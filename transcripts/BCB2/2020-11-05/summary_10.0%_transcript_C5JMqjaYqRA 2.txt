Development Employment Committee, okay, I'm, going to read a remote meeting announcement.
At, the meeting of the economic develop economic Development employment committee of Brooklyn, Committee, board, 2, is called to order and is being recorded for public access and archiving accordance with the New York State opening meeting law in the practice of CB2 to conduct remote meetings with all committee members cameras on So. We need all cameras on for committee, members.
I'm, Kate, Yearwood, Young, Committee, member and Board member standing in as acting secretary, today, I, guess: Sorry, it's a new rule bill It's not working, no worries, bill.
Okay, with that, okay, we'll now go to the agenda for the Economic Development Employment Committee , I, want approval of the agenda, may have a motion to approve the agenda motion to approve okay and lindsay okay, so I moved okay, today , The presentation with the first individual up for presentation is job path.
We work in four boroughs of the city, Manhattan Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn, I'm, a Clinton hill resident, so I'm very excited to be connected with you, guys, tonight, and my hope is that after I tell you a little about what we do, we can be thought of as a resource for you in the future, for employers to reach out to us in the future and for also residents who might be coming into our program.
The gentleman, who is just finished the scanning project and is really enhancing their bottom line by having someone take care of these needed files and letting the other paralegal and legal team do their duties and I'll give one more example, because I know it might I do not want to take too much time, but I want to make sure I can share just a different example of our jobs, job seekers and different roles.
The company wanted to create a feeling of being at home and create a up their morale of their team members he's really beloved, because if you work there you're getting a personalized card and we're able to add tasks, he does an inventory of diff items that the office purchases as well.
Our. Job seekers have perhaps their autism or other developmental disabilities, and we want to acclimate them to the workplace as best as possible to give them that extra bit of training.
The idea also is to let the employee the employer focus on their other tasks and not feel the need to extra time training we're there as long- term consultants, especially when someone grows for a while and wants to learn a new task.
We have many talented job seekers and we love to tell you more at job path, we're actually part of a consortium for customized employment, so we're partnered with other not- for- profit agencies in New, York, City.
We have a lot of different a big talent pool and our funding is a combination from access vr, as well as opwdd, which is the office for people with developmental disabilities, funded by New York state.
What's your capacity looking like these days in terms of new job seekers.
That's really opened up than we would have been this time last year, so there is actually quite a need, so the more employers who would love to just even just have a conversation without feeling they have to commit to anything, but just to learn a little bit more about us.
, now, it's a little longer because of what's going on, so some people are waiting a year and a half to get into our program and the reason there is such a weight is that again, because we're doing one- on- one work if we open the door and have everyone come at the same time, Our retention rate is about 82 at the first year, so the first year after the first day of them starting the job they're.
We are so if I'm working with say That example earlier doing the inventory of the liquor and the wine bottles at the restaurant, I'm there with her one- On, I was travel training with her the first first couple, days, just to make sure she knew her out in the subway as she got more and more comfortable, I'm fading back, maybe I'm coming in halfway through the shift, I'm in discussion with her supervisor and her and make sure everyone's comfortable with that letting her learn And then Some people might need a little more support based on needs, and so some people who are providing more support for them.
Okay, good evening, everyone, and thank you for giving me this opportunity to present to the board and thank you, ryan, a big fan of the job path and the services that they provide.
I can drop my contact info on the chat when we're done and we would try to get them connected with the New York State Commission for the blind and visually impaired so that they can receive other services, not just job placement, and then we would.
They may have- Maybe you know if somebody's looking for a job in customer service, but they only type 12 words, a minute, then we're going to have to work on getting some additional computer training or maybe redirecting to a different career.
There's, six of us that work on my team You know it may take a few days, but again, we'd want to open up their case with the New York State Commission for the blind so that they can get all comprehensive services.
Okay, that's the board office and the chair will do okay and after that As far as we're looking at what we do, we do, and if you give me a couple, minutes, I could actually share that if you're interested, not a problem, okay, I'll, just continue with the report.
Or at least I wanted to know, is how the bids are actually doing, with the current circumstances of being what they are, and this is what we actually saw as far as the Covid-19 response is concerned, there's been an outreach to all the businesses, small businesses for the small business support programs and also they're also reached out for PPE resources for a lot of these small businesses need this information.
You discover exactly what we're looking at as far as which items have been finalized for the district needs, I like to focus on the items that were not okay and start reaching out directly and doing our outreach now to the different agencies.
We think that there are some ways that process could be opened up so that there's a little more transparency there, because that seems to be to my first year perspective the best opportunity to ask specific agency heads really specific questions that would help shape the requests in committee.
