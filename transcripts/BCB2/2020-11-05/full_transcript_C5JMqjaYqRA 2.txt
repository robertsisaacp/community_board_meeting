That's right! Okay! Here we go great. It's loading. Can you see the customized employment slide? Let's go ahead, okay! Well, thank you for having me my name is Ryan Finger. I am the director of intensive services, job path at job path. We are a not-, for- profit agency and we help individuals with developmental disabilities find employment. We work in four boroughs of the city, Manhattan Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn, I'm a Clinton hill resident, so I'm very excited to be connected with you guys tonight, and my hope is that after I tell you a little about what we do, we can be thought of as a resource for you in the future, for employers to reach out to us in the future and for also residents who might be coming into our program. If a family member has a developmental disability for employment, our services can help them. But I'd really like to reach out to the businesses tonight and just let us know about our free, our freebies ourselves, being a free resource for you. We operate on a model called Customize employment and customized employment, as defined by the Department of Labor, is the process of creating a unique job description that meets the employer's needs and aligns with job seekers skills through our process. We're trying to create unique and individuals that are beneficial for an employer and can match the unique talents and strengths of our job seekers, who are too often and looking for a traditional employment. Our process is when up when an individual comes to us to seek job an in- depth, discovery process with them learning their interests, skills and strengths. During this time, we are getting to know them very well where we are touring their neighborhoods, including all of the neighborhoods supporting community board too. This discovery time. We are finding out connections in the community. We are getting ideas and brainstorming ideas for what how what they can offer for their first job. Many of our job seekers have never been able to join the workforce because of either made their disability or never having the opportunity. During this process, we are targeting specific employers that, based on their interests and skills, we believe would be beneficial. The counselors at our agency then reach out to these employers, tell them program and see through a free consulting if their business could buy. Some of the talents of our job seekers and our ultimate objective is to create a new job that benefits both the employer and the job seeker. We target all different types of business needs. They could be unmet. Workplace needs perhaps task better specific employee competencies. We just some of the ways customize employment addresses. We look at daily tasks that are reducing staff productivity, work that is backing up, perhaps back burner. Perhaps a staff with a certain degree is doing tasks that might be more entry level and their skills could be used elsewhere, while a job path, job seeker could be focusing on some more perhaps entry- level tasks, but it does not mean you looked at in just that fashion. I'll, give you some examples of just to show how we work. This is a young woman. I work with a few years ago. She came to Mr Finger you're. Breaking up. I do not quite have your audio. I think we just lost him leave. This connectivity is a little off. That's correct, Mr, Fingers Claire. Through the discovery process with her and reaching out to employers, we found an employer need at Clyde, Fraser Restaurant, where, when I spoke with the manager she's asking about what could be enhanced at her at a restaurant, what would be a great asset? She said: well, I'm coming in at 8 A.M every day and spending three hours, just counting the wine and liquor inventory from what was used the night before I do not like getting here at 8, A.M I'd rather get here at 10 or 11. like or I use that time elsewhere, because there's so many different things that entail running a restaurant then doing this monotonous task. Well, I said, I know a very young woman, who's very talented. She has computer skills and loves playing video games and would love to learn something like this and we were able to create a job just for Jessica where she uses the scanner this accubar device. She goes behind. The manager gets to sleep in a little longer. Oran days come in focus on her test and what Jessica does is, creates a report of all with the wine and liquor inventory and see what needs to be ordered and from that they are never low on any of their expensive bottles of wine, so they maximize their profits. They are always able to sell something, that's on hand, she's, so talented and so good that when the manager got transferred to a different restaurant, El Rio, she demanded that Jessica be able to come with her. So now she works two jobs. Her skills were just such an asset and just was such a morale booster for her co- workers as well. This gentleman, his name, is Randy Randy's been with us for many years, came to us very aspiring. Young guy wanted a chance to have a job in the community. He actually works now Myerson Associates at a law firm. He now was it started like when he first started. Well, it was a back burner project of all these documents that needed to be scanned, because at Myerson Associates at the law firm, they could not simply Mr Finger. We lost you again. It's right within his energy level and when he's giving his they're very happy, because these back burner projects that was taking up a whole room, he actually scanned everything. You know he's on to doing some different tasks now, because he's been there a few years. This is my favorite place. I mean they dropped you, but we lost them there for a second, could you go back again and repeat what you just said? Yes to randy, you can start right here. That's perfect, okay, so yeah the gentleman who is just finished the scanning project and is really enhancing their bottom line by having someone take care of these needed files and letting the other paralegal and legal team do their duties and I'll give one more example, because I know it might. I do not want to take too much time, but I want to make sure I can share just a different example of our jobs, job seekers and different roles. They've created caden, I've known for many years, and he has an incredible art skill at an artistic ability. He is an advertising agency enforcement in Bowdoin, first in Soho, and he actually makes cards for new staff within their HR department as well as anniversary cards, and he decorates them and personalizing them based on their own specific interests. The company wanted to create a feeling of being at home and create a up their morale of their team members he's really beloved, because if you work there you're getting a personalized card and we're able to add tasks, he does an inventory of diff items that the office purchases as well. So it's been really great. He works about 10 hours 10 hours a week. Many of our jobs are part time and perhaps lower between 10 to 20 hours a week, but that's not necessarily a case across the board and the thing that makes our services very unique. Is that to be sure to enhance the experience we are there as trainers as job coaches to acclimate them towards the job. Our job seekers have perhaps their autism or other developmental disabilities, and we want to acclimate them to the workplace as best as possible to give them that extra bit of training. The idea also is to let the employee the employer focus on their other tasks and not feel the need to extra time training we're there as long- term consultants, especially when someone grows for a while and wants to learn a new task. We can go in there, so I'm the individuals I just mentioned. I still visit them about twice a month just to check in and I'm always available and there's lots of ways. Businesses can. The business themselves can provide an assessment to get some ideas. The staff ourselves can perform an assessment. We've done this by giving tours or being able to observe some of some of the day- to- day activities, but perhaps the most common is just together through collaboration. We assess together through conversation, collaboration and traditional negotiation, to see what would be a great match, and if there is one and if there's not a great match, that's okay too. We never want to that's not there. We wanted to make it very successful, both the employer and our participants in our program. These are just some different examples of different types of businesses, of some of the tasks that job path individuals are working on. We are partnered with about 170 different employers right now in New, York City, and so there are many different types of jobs and we're not limited to one industry. It's based on the needs of a business and the skills and strengths of our individuals. So these are just some, but by no means limited to just these tasks listed and ultimately our goal is we want. We want our individuals to be fully accepted as team members and help them join the workforce and be treated and treat it as equals. These are just- and these are just some of the companies who we are partnered with that we have great long- term partnerships with and again. I hope that we can be thought of in the future, as you think about needs that are within your own business or if you could connect us with a business that would be interested in partnering with an agency like ours. We have many talented job seekers and we love to tell you more at job path, we're actually part of a consortium for customized employment, so we're partnered with other not- for- profit agencies in New, York City. So we have a lot of different a big talent pool and our funding is a combination from access vr, as well as opwdd, which is the office for people with developmental disabilities, funded by New York state. So our goal is to have people join the workforce. We want it to be meaningful employment. We want it to be tasks that are a great asset to you not to be charity by any means. We want this to be a real job. That's really going to help you. So we are here's, a free consulting for you, and so we hope we can be considered for you in the future. Okay, is there anything else? Have you completed your presentation? That's the end of the presentation. I can take off the sharing mode. If you have any questions I'll be very happy to answer. Yes, I'm sure we're going to have a couple questions here. Thank you very much. That was very informative. I really appreciate that. Thank you. What one of the questions I'm curious about right off the fact Mr Finger medically Ryan is, for instance, you mentioned a number of companies and also the different types of potential jobs that they can do the individuals that you're working with. Let me ask you a question: if a company is interested in this or if you are looking to reach through outreach, how do we go about doing that? I think the simplest way is contact me directly and we can have a conversation on the phone or through or through these means too, and to start a conversation saying what are these exact skills you are needing for and through discussion see if we can find someone that matches it, I think that'll be just the first stop. It takes a couple conversations before we realize this is what the job's going to look like. This is the good match, but it's just through one- on-, one conversations really. Okay, and do you have individuals who are currently looking for work? Yes right now, especially during this 2012. Many of our job seekers are once you've had and are hoping to return. I have many job seekers too, so we have those who are hoping to get back but we're looking at other options as we're going as the realities of the economy are and November of 2020.. They do want to return to work, but we have yes, many other jobs. Many job seekers who've been looking even before the before the economic turnaround that we've experienced this year. Okay and as far as pay is concerned, is who is responsible for paying these individuals, so it would be on the employer and it would be based on the skill level. We wanted to be competitive that strengths, their brain and the tab, so it would have to be on the books and at least of minimum age, according to you know, wage loss, but we wanted to be competitive and fair to the other, their other co- workers. That would be fair. I mean many of many of our individuals. This is our first ch first job, so entry level pay is, would be fine for some, but we have it might be wanting to expand their career and maybe take on go on to that next step as well, because we follow people for the long haul and we want career advantage. So we have a wide array, so some people might be worth that higher pay and we can look at that individualized basis, yeah one individual. You mentioned the young lady who was asked to continue working with the managers, an example. Okay. Finally, is there any limitations as far as travel is concerned? No, it depends we're looking at well our well something we do want to keep it in New York City. Well, you know we'll have an offer in long island or New Jersey and we'll have just it's unfortunate. We can't take you up on the coffer, so if we're looking at Brooklyn, if someone's there and the individual can get there on a reasonable, fair commute like just like you or I, everyone here would seem reasonable and is of their comfort. Then that's where we're kind of looking at okay. Thank you. Is there any other questions from other committee members? Okay. Okay, I see that in the chat section we have your link to your organization as far as your organization website. Oh great, terrific. Anything everyone here can feel free to email me with any questions, because I've heard so many I've heard them all. So please feel free and comfortable doing so, and if maybe we can talk on the phone sometime soon, Phil, I'm sorry. I had trouble meeting for a second. Do you mind if I ask a quick question by all means: lazy? Yes, thanks Ryan, I'm curious. If you guys have additional capacity. I know you know the job market being what it is if the Community Board and members of the community were to link to you on social media and suggest that people come and check you out. What's your capacity looking like these days in terms of new job seekers coming to the program or in terms of finding employers? So I think that I think a lot of people on the board have the capacity to do both, and maybe, if you speak to where you're looking for more capacity and where you might be a little stretched. Well, because our program is very unique, we do have a waiting list of people wanting to come into our program because we're doing July's unique process, but those people are all more than welcome to be learn more about, and I'm always happy to share about what we do if, but if I could be connected to more employers, we have so many different job seekers and we have a really strong employment, counselor teams that we can welcome quite a bit right now, and especially with the number of our participants. Who've been furloughed, that's really opened up than we would have been this time last year, so there is actually quite a need, so the more employers who would love to just even just have a conversation without feeling they have to commit to anything, but just to learn a little bit more about us, I'm very happy to entertain as many as possible, so maybe the platform that might be most helpful as if those of us on Linkedin were to post on Linkedin to our networks, that'd be wonderful. We are bet, we've been using linkedin a lot more of these past few years. That would be a wonderful resource could be shared. That would be great. Thank you lindsay hi. This is, let's rock and axe a question bill by all means. This sounds like a really great program. How long is the waiting list for individuals it does do hard? It can be right now, it's a little longer because of what's going on, so some people are waiting a year and a half to get into our program and the reason there is such a weight is that again, because we're doing one- on- one work if we open the door and have everyone come at the same time, we can't we can't get continue to give that same quality as much as we'd like to and by keeping it a smaller, a smaller program. We can make sure we can get those people, those right, fitting jobs, so here to a year and a half, it might be swelling on the longer side of this year and people coming onto the waiting list and also you said that individuals can move up. What's the ratio of individuals who moved up in the company that they started in it's actually pretty high? Our retention rate is about 82 at the first year, so the first year after the first day of them starting the job they're still there and we're always there, because we're continually following up with the employer to make sure everyone's happy and everything's being addressed. We are always pushing for career advancement within a company new tasks, perhaps more hours different responsibilities, just like anybody would want to be challenged more and go up the ladder. So I do not have an exact number of what that is, but I can say that our retention rate is very strong and yeah. So yeah I stay with the individual. The whole time like. Is there a cut of time, or do you stay with the individual from the time they get the job to? I do not know if you responded to this earlier, I'm sorry I may have missed it, but do you follow them like say if they're there for a year, do you still stay with them for that year? Do you continually to use a support system for them if they have any concerns? That's a fantastic question. Yes, we stay. So that's the great thing too, and why again, why awaiting this might be so long is because we want to have someone feel independent as possible on the job. So we are so if I'm working with say the young woman Jessica who's. That example earlier doing the inventory of the liquor and the wine bottles at the restaurant, I'm there with her one- on-, one as she gets acclimated get into rhythm. I was travel training with her the first first couple days, just to make sure she knew her out in the subway as she got more and more comfortable, I'm fading back, maybe I'm coming in halfway through the shift, I'm in discussion with her supervisor and her and make sure everyone's comfortable with that letting her learn and then and now we eventually fade back about twice a month. So every other week, I'm just I'm just checking in real quick, just to make sure all is good. We're always, but some people might need a little. Some people might need a little more support based on needs, and so some people who are providing more support for them whatever is needed, and but we are there for the long term. So some people were supporting. You know ten years along the job, but we're just checking in, and sometimes it's just a very friendly chit chat with the supervisor not much going on, but especially for that career advancement. Part we're there to help them guide and maybe help them and guide them to self- advocate for themselves to ask for a raise, perhaps or to ask for those extra days or tasks they want to work on. So we are there as counselors to help them help them gain independence in their roles and in their lives. Thank you very welcome. Okay, if there's number questions, okay, Mr Finger. Thank you very much. If you want to in the chat, if you want to put your email, so people can contact you, okay, we have other information there, but in the event you want to put your email in there by all means. Do so thanks very much for having me, I really appreciate it. Thank you and, as you know, as we were talking earlier, this will be posted on YouTube. Okay. Next, to do a presentation. We have visions, Sbvi, that's vision, services for the blind and visually impaired and the presenter will be Michael Cush senior director of Workforce Development Michael. Do you hear me Michael? You have to mute, can't hear you there you go. Can you hear me now we can hear you. I apologize not a problem. Okay, good evening, everyone and thank you for giving me this opportunity to present to the board and thank you, ryan, a big fan of the job path and the services that they provide and we've done some work with them in the past, but my name is Mike Cush. I am the senior director of workforce development at vision, services, vision, services for blind visually impaired has been around since 1926, we service clients throughout all five boroughs. Last year we serviced nearly over seven thousand people in the New York Metropolitan Area, and more than a thousand people in Brooklyn. I myself was born in park slope and raised and still reside in Brooklyn. We have connections with the Brooklyn chamber of commerce, as well as the Brooklyn workforce. One stop centers visions is a social service, rehabilitation, not- for-, profit organization, where we service people of all ages who are blind and visually impaired, children, adults and seniors. We have a senior center in located in Chelsea, but it's open to people of all five boroughs and it's the only senior center. That specifically is designed for people with vision impairments, but we do allow all seniors to attend. 60 and above my role as the senior director of Workforce development, I oversee our job development, job training and job placement services as part of our job development. We work on training, clients in work, readiness, soft skills, technology training. We also do work, experience, training and, of course, job placement. In the last four years, visions was the number one placement agency of all blindness agencies throughout New, York state. We place more people in jobs than any other agency in the state of New York visions, funding primarily comes through foundation and government grants, and my department is funded mostly by the New York State Commission, for the blind, which is the sort of partner agency to access Vr. It's the New York State Voc Rehab agency, that receives money through the federal government through the Rehabilitation services Administration, and we are contracting with them to provide these placement services. Visions has three locations. We have one in Manhattan, sorry, two Manhattan one in Chelsea, one in Soho, and then we also have a rehabilitation center located in Spring Valley, New York in Rockland County. We provide services in the home and the community. Those services include orientation, mobility, vision, Rehab therapy and social work, and while those services have been limited somewhat through the Covid-19, we have begun providing in- person, services throughout Brooklyn and the outer boroughs, the other boroughs as well, and where we're trying to get back on track there. Some of the types of jobs that we place. People in we've placed people in social work positions, retail finance. We just placed somebody at a agency near the Brooklyn Navy yard. As a software engineer, making over six figures, we developed partnerships with Pelton, Hospital, 1199, Northwest, Health and Amazon, where we've placed a number of people as warehouse associates at their facilities in Brooklyn, staten, island, Queens and long island, oh in the Bronx. Just to give you kind of example, of some of the people that we serve. We had a woman in her late 50s who was coming to this country from another country and was new to vision, loss and was trying to kind of find her way and decide what career path to go. She was a teacher back in her home country, but did not feel or did not have the credentials here and felt like she was having a hard time trying to start all over. We connected her with a warehouse associate position at Amazon in Staten island. She traveled from Jamaica Queens to staten island every day, five days a week and nearly two years later, she's still working on the floor and she's about 60 and she's. One of the quickest producing associates that they have and, as you know, Amazon wants you to move quick because they wanted where to get their boxes in one two three days whenever possible, that was one success story that that's kind of recent that came to mind recently due to Covid-19. The job market has shifted and it's become a bit more volatile, but we're still placing people in jobs. We've placed several people as contact tracers we've placed a couple: people in the healthcare industry Amazon and a couple of case management positions. So our clientele more or less varies. It's representative of New York. We have clients who have little to no education, clients who have bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, advanced degrees, Phd's and again they are ranging in adult ages from 20 to, I think our oldest job seeker right now is currently 74. and that's pretty much my presentation, if you guys have any questions, I'd love to hear them well. Thank you Mike. I appreciate that Mr Chris, just kind of curiosity, who else are you affiliated with as far as associations within the area, uv partners, the agencies that we partner with? Yes, Sir so yeah, so all chamber of commerce, several of the business improvement districts, the workforce, one centers. We have other employer partners, Google, Facebook, Lij and a number of other partners. Okay, and once again, I'm going to ask you the same question. I asked Mr finger. If I had an individual who's interested in getting involved in your program, how would they go about doing it so they can reach out to me directly. I can drop my contact info on the chat when we're done and we would try to get them connected with the New York State Commission for the blind and visually impaired so that they can receive other services, not just job placement, and then we would. We would open up their case okay and once the case is open. Okay, what is the procedure from there I mean? Is there training involved? Is there other things assessments? How exactly would you go about getting involved? So we would. We would do an assessment. We do a very thorough assessment to get a sense of what type of work they want. What's their background. What's their experience and you know what hard skills they may have- or maybe you know if somebody's looking for a job in customer service, but they only type 12 words a minute, then we're going to have to work on getting some additional computer training or maybe redirecting to a different career path. If that's not the best thing but yeah, we start the process right away and then make whatever recommendations a person might need. A lot of our clients are new to vision, loss either from accidents, unfortunately or age- related conditions, so they themselves are not too sure what kind of work they're able to do as somebody with legal blindness, okay, fair enough, is there any other questions from any of the committee members? I know we spoke about this with the other presenter, but maybe you can speak to what your waitlist is like at this point for individuals looking for services, so we do not have a wait list per se. I have a department of six there's six of us that work on my team and there would be no wait list to be seen or to be met with or virtually met with. At this point you know it may take a few days, but again, we'd want to open up their case with the New York State Commission for the blind so that they can get all comprehensive services, but in terms of moving the process along it would it would start pretty quickly lazy, any other questions. Okay, latrell yeah, I see yeah. I just noticed you on a muted yourself. I have a question for people who do not know. Can you explain the commission for the blind and what exactly they do and the process? So is it a long process to get involved with them? Was it a short process sure it's relatively quick, they've kind of streamlined their process now and they even are opening cases virtually so the process is they you you'd contact them? They would send you an application or I think it's even online now, but they would send you an electronic application. Yes, thank you and you would meet with a counselor they'd want to see an eye report to make sure you're eligible that you fall into the category of legal blindness, which is 20 over 200 with breast correction, with an acuity field of view less than 20 and yeah. It's probably I've opened or referred clients to be opened during the pandemic, and it's generally within 30 days and from my understanding with the commission for the blind. Is they assign you Bob? Is it still by borrow whatever borrower you live in so yeah? There's two district offices in Manhattan the downtown office covers Brooklyn, so yeah they have attachments. Can you hear me? Okay, so the downtown yeah? There are two men, two offices within the five boroughs, I'm sorry the downtown Manhattan office covers Brooklyn, lower Manhattan, staten island and then the uptown office covers Manhattan Queens and the Bronx so yeah, it's broken down by location. Geographically, okay, I believe we lost latrell, okay. So, but thank you very much. We have your information and, if there's any other questions we'll have people, please approach through the board office and we'll forward those questions on or they can reach you. I appreciate it. Okay, thank you so much appreciate it. Okay, thank you very much, my pleasure for coming to our meeting. Let's see now we're now going to continue with the agenda. Okay, next on the agenda, okay is a chairperson's report. Okay, so let me get started here on the chairperson's report. Currently right now, as of last month, the President Presenter Cinch market is getting a lot of attention and enrollments for deliveries and also news, storage, signups. So sorry and new store sign ups, so that's actually a quite quite a response that we're seeing from that. A lot of people were interested and I of course, also signed up for it because I've been doing a lot of ordering online have not delivered okay. Now, in addition to that, the district needs. Okay, I'm sure we're all interested in that. Currently right now, the executive committee actually sat down and we voted on the top 40 budget requests that were listed after we did. The selections from the entire board members and we also decided to go with the top 25 capital expenditures. The chair will make the final position with the help of the board office. If there's anything that we can actually see combined. Okay, that's the board office and the chair will do okay and after that, they'll give us their final list that we're going to be approaching with do we have anything I said yet Tia as far as we're looking at what we do, we do, and if you give me a couple minutes, I could actually share that if you're interested, not a problem, okay, I'll just continue with the report when you get a chance by all means. Okay, so that's the Good news. We have quite a few items on there by the way, in addition to that on October 22nd, I'm on the Cls Board and we had a board of directors meeting. We also had a finance report and a report in regards to the downtown Brooklyn partnership. One of the things we wanted to find out- or at least I wanted to know, is how the bids are actually doing, with the current circumstances of being what they are, and this is what we actually saw as far as the Covid-19 response is concerned, there's been an outreach to all the businesses, small businesses for the small business support programs and also they're also reached out for PPE resources for a lot of these small businesses need this information. I also downtown Brooke. Partnership also have webinars. Some of those webinars are about New York, City's, open restaurants plan to explain to them exactly how that works and the procedures involved in that they also mentioned the all in New, York City and that's the neighborhood gateway. That's for marketing programs to promote and support these businesses that are currently looking at the circumstances with Covid-19. They also did the virtual cube and legal consulting consultant center. What that was basically was a. It was a webinar that was actually was actually something that was held with webinar held with Brooklyn law school and the center for urban business and enterprises they're, basically letting them know what they're legal the legal options they had as far as going forward now. The other thing that we're looking at is the real estate in downtown Brooklyn. Currently right now there are 27 projects under construction and 20. Some of those projects, 27 more projects, are in the pipeline. Since 2004 we've had 115 projects completed after the rezoning now right now, commercial invasion, vacancy rates have increased by 10 to 10.8 percent from 10, sorry from 10.8 to 13.1 percent. So there has been an increase in vacancies in downtown Brooklyn. Interestingly enough rents have gone up: okay from forty nine dollars and five cents to forty nine dollars and fifty cents. A square foot, okay, so they've actually gone up, not tremendously, but they have gone up and by the way, throughout the all, the boroughs we've seen a decrease in the vacancy rates and also actually in other boroughs and we've seen a decrease in the rents. So question: what period are you talking about that these changes occurred currently right now, we're looking at since Covid-19 actually occurred, so this is just over the last since, like March, yes, okay, thanks okay, so this is basically on Covid-19. This is what we're looking at right. Now: okay, the rent rental market is down by 19. Okay, so that's we're looking at as far as the rental market is concerned. As far as retail they canvassed 375 businesses in the area of those 79 are still in operation. Nine percent are temporarily closed and 12 are permanently closed. That's the circumstances right now that we're looking at in the area as far as business is concerned, in addition to that on October 14th wegman's food market celebrated one year as of October 27th they've, actually donated a hundred and 170,000 pounds of food to neighboring communities. So that's where we are right now, so one of the other things I'm going to suggest is this: once you discover exactly what we're looking at as far as which items have been finalized for the district needs, I like to focus on the items that were not okay and start reaching out directly and doing our outreach now to the different agencies. Do you have a list for us there? It is. I do. Can you hear me? Yes, you can okay. So let me just give you I'll offer a quick overview of this chart because it might, the format might be a little bit unfamiliar it's different from the way you were working in committee, so we had to divide all. I think. In the end there were, I think there were 87 total requests submitted by the six committees of CB2. We divided them into capital, requests and expense requests, so board members. I will drop a link to this spreadsheet in the chat which you'll be able to see. You will not be able to open the link if you are not a board member. This is the full list of capital expenses. Ranking in column b, the full and you'll note that we were allowed to submit up to 40 capital requests, but we only had 28 actually, so there was no deliberation required there for the expenses. We had to cut it down to a list and we did it a little and we came out in the end with 26.. So the indexes of the index of the city office of planning is slightly different from the six committee titles, so just to have to get this webex window out of the way just to quickly review the index, you might have fallen under healthcare and human services. There is public safety and emergency services, transportation, youth, education and child welfare, housing, economic development in land use, which is where most of this committee's requests ended up and perks, cultural and other community facilities, and finally, core infrastructure, city services and resiliency. So obviously we do not have a corresponding committee for that. So if we look at Hedley I'll scroll through this list, a bit slower, there are a bunch of fields to the right that you do not have to worry about. I'm sure you will recognize some of these, so just keeping in mind that the Total board score fell in column, C and I'm sure you'll recognize quite a few of these housing incubator. Oh those were the capacity requests and now these are the expense requests. So most of these came out of your committee, and I believe this was also the largest chapter index for us yep. There were seven of 14 submitted here so again, I will stop sharing unless you want to look at something in particular bill, and I will have links to this in the chat for right now. Just put it in the chat and the committee will review it and I'm sure we'll be discussing it next committee meeting sure and just to give some context I'll also offer the link where you can see the published version of Fy21, which was last year's. Thank you. No problem. Okay, hi bill. Can I ask a couple questions sure by all means so based on our previous success, or rather lack of success in getting some of the things that we've requested. I'm just curious about the strategy like why focus on the things that were not prioritized, rather than trying to advocate for the things that were prioritized. We can do both okay, but as far as a committee is concerned, I like to go after the things that we're not okay. As a community board, we will actually advocate for things that are a little bit. Is there any sense of what the strategy will be to advocate for the things that were prioritized? Where is that strategy to be developed and who is it to be developed by I'm? Assuming that's going to be developed by the board office and also by the chair? Is there any way we can follow up on that rather than assuming, because I think in previous years there has not been any advocacy on the items that have been prioritized. What I'll do is I'll reach out at the executive committee meeting and determine what that procedure is going to be sounds good lindsay. That's a really a really good question that I appreciate and sorry I was just typing: I'm going to actually share screen really quickly to show you from the office of planning what the annual timeline is for this, and just to say that we've already started some discussions in the district office. We realized that the you know the good and the bad of remote work is that actually it enabled a lot more participation this year than in previous years, so we're going to be taking some of the things that worked well this year and revamping the process next year. We completely agree that there are many opportunities to increase discussion in different phases. Okay, any other discussion for committee members, okay, Bill Chef. I just want to add in a little bit that you were discussing in your report and there was a metro tech bid meeting and a couple of things. A few things were discussed there. You know I'll skip over some of the stuff that you already covered, but I just wanted to add that 80 of businesses in the metro tech bids are now open. The Atlantic, Terminal and Atlantic Center. All stores have reopened and there's about it's, not what it was. But there's a hundred and fifty thousand foot traffic per week now at at those centers and the busway on J Street is, is getting built. The pedestrian traffic in the in the bid area, Metro Tech Bid area, is about 50, which is up from percent which it was in April. So it's coming up. There's a couple new restaurants that opened in the city point you know the. What do you call it? The marketplace there and they're doing constant, deep cleanings and make sure that everything is up to us thesis standards, the there's going to be new holiday lights in the Metro tech bid and they're, extending it a little further along Flatbush avenue this you see a Flatbush adam extended this year. The indigo and aloft hotels are apparently temporarily used for the homeless in arts and culture. It's definitely not open yet, but they're doing a lot of live streaming and for dancers dancers can get. What do you call it? They can reserve dance. You know dance rehearsal time to sign up for it about a hundred. No, I'm sorry about 1,000, oh god. I can't say this. One- third is what it is one- third of the Nyu students are back in person and let's see, there's about a hundred thousand jobs that are back in in the district with more, if you count in the the outdoor dining and the bid supplied meals for our heroes at the Brooklyn hospital, so that was really a wonderful thing that they did leasing and I think you talked about a little and brookfield said. Basically, it's slow, it's very slow leasing, properties and that I'm going to say is about it that I have okay. Thank you ron. I appreciate that if you can continue giving these reports as they come about, I appreciate that now you did mention that city point. The food court has opened. Yes, it's open and there's a couple new restaurants, one of the restaurants- and I mean it's good- that there's a new restaurant there, but it's bad that it replaced a restaurant. So it's there's not a net gain the restaurant that the italian restaurant and it was pretty good. I ate there a couple times for Tina. I think yeah I've eaten there, myself, yes, yeah and they were pretty good, well they're, now called mizion, or something like that, and it's sort of middle eastern Food, now, okay, so, but as far as the different stores have opened up how many stores have reopened in general. Do you know? Well, I do not have a total of how many, but most in city point have reopened. Okay, excellent! Thank you very much, okay. Okay, as far as I'm concerned, my report is not too clear. Taya, you mentioned you actually posted something in the chat or you actually shared something earlier. Yes, regarding the statement of needs, yes, you were given the schedule, oh sure. Well, I just closed it. Let me find it again: okay, I was actually sharing it while Ron was speaking, my apologies and find it again if you could post that in the chat or send it to the committee members. I'd appreciate that, yes, it's in chat, and here, if you can see this, it is again so this is the this. Is the schedule provided to us by the Office of City planning and I have an email that might have even more info okay, so the preliminary budget will be in January, so we have between now and January to have a discussion with them. I'm assuming so, could you set a gun bill? I said the preliminary budget was it's going to be published in January we're going to be having an opportunity to have discussions with them between now and January. No, so the submission on Friday was the final submission, and now we just wait patiently. They will issue responses to us and then we respond. We issue responses to the capital plan and the strategy in February, but there is not really an open commentary period for the Community Board sdn Vr. Okay, thank you. Okay. So, can I ask a question about the timeline and process yeah by all means? So what's the role right now of the borough president's office so like every community board in their district, has submitted their requests? Do they ever advocate on behalf of their board's priorities and what about the city council members from our districts as well like? How does what are the relationship between officials so lindsay? You actually may be more informed than I am because this is my first year going through this process. From this end, I do not know if you know that I just started in March dude, I'm sorry, I do not mean to press you. I know I'm being a little bit, I'm just being a little like. Let's follow up with them kind of without yeah. No, I love your gentle advocacy. The I think, a part that is germane to what you just asked was that the borough president's office arranges for us to have borough- wide agency consultations, which happens between August and October. Those are typically not open to the entire board, they're typically open to district office, but I believe, and in discussion with staff. We think that there are some ways that process could be opened up so that there's a little more transparency there, because that seems to be to my first year perspective the best opportunity to ask specific agency heads really specific questions that would help shape the requests in committee. I guess I'm also wondering if there's an opportunity for us to work more closely with the borough office on this and do some strategy sessions ahead of those meetings, because I think I think it would, I think, based on the constraints of this year's budget. In particular, I know that past years lack of success has been pretty discouraging and this year is going to be more difficult than others based on budget cuts that are happening, and so I'm just curious if we should maybe take the opportunity to strategize a little bit more than we have in the past. Actually, since we seemed more act, we seem more organized this year. You know I am going to make sure that is brought up at the next staff meeting next Tuesday. So I'm writing it down right now: okay and Lizzie. I've! Actually, I appreciate you, I'm sorry about you, oh yeah, that's no problem. There's no problem! Lizzie I've actually been at some of these meetings as a as a individual who's. Just watching what goes on and usually what happens is there's an individual from the board off sorry for the board office is actually there and listening in on the actual process. So it's something that I would definitely like to see us be more involved in, but we'll find out what we can do going forward, and I think there's also an opportunity, though, with the elected officials to do some advocacy on behalf of some of these issues, especially with our city, Council members. I you know, I think, yeah, that's the path I want to go down to lindsay exactly okay, I got both of those down thanks, so much cincy. Okay. Is there any other business currently right now the committee wants to bring up okay. This is a time for a community forum, okay at the community forum. If anyone who is not a member of the committee would like to or a committee member would like to bring up something right now, this is the time to do it. Hey bill, and I know denise is not here, but maybe on next week's agenda. We should talk about bringing the unemployment fair, virtual and discuss yeah. I had asked her to do it this month, but unfortunately she could not attend awesome. Okay, you're always 10 steps ahead. Bill I have to with you lindsay. Okay with that. Did everyone get a chance to read the minutes from October? Are there any corrections that anyone's noticed or would suggest? Okay, seeing none, I'm assuming that we're going to accept the minutes as written we'll do that by ascension? Okay, with that, if there's no other business to discuss, I will entertain a motion to adjourn okay, Mr Kearney. Just out of curiosity before we adjourn I'm sorry I apologize did you want to say anything? Okay, I take that. I said no okay, excellent. Okay with that we'll close the meeting the meeting is adjourned. Time now is 7:14.. Thank you very much. Everyone who's been here and we'll go into more detail one on one later on.
