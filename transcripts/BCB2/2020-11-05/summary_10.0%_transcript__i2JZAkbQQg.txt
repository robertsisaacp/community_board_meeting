, I'm, the chair of the health Environment Social Services, Committee, Community, Board, 2.
It is the practice of Brooklyn community board 2 to conduct remote meetings with all committee members.
My remarks are going to be pretty limited, because I wanted to just leave a lot of time for open discussion and questions, So, we'll just give you sort of a quick rundown of current situation and both globally and here in New York, and go down to Brooklyn level.
Over the last few weeks, we have, you know, started out having more cases in particular pockets, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens, and that is what has prompted this new cluster response that has led to some localized restrictions, and that is an initiative that is really being led by the governor's office at the state level.
Think the only other, interesting update I did want to highlight in terms of the city and state is that the governor's office and over the last couple of days over the weekend has changed.
That's really insightful to hear and good to know about some of these details about what's going on, presently, particularly, I want to have the committee asked some questions.
First, I wanted to ask you to touch on some of the things that occurred back in March in terms of the closures and the announcements and when we all found out about this at the very beginning, I think you know part of our committee's approach, we're located here in downtown Brooklyn and also fort Greene and Clinton hill and Vinegar Hill and Boerum, Hill and Dumbo, and some of these neighborhoods here and in our meetings.
Think we were really struck when one of our community health centers came to us early in the year for one of our first video meetings and said that they were just completely out of supplies and they he did not feel like.
If, there's not anything specific to the areas that I described, downtown Brooklyn, heights, Fort, Greene, Clinton, hill, We're also really concerned as a committee with the NYCHA communities within our district, and it's a point that we've been wanting to make with the Department of Health for quite some time, because the community health profile that was issued in 2018 referred to our district, as quote Unquote Brooklyn high Fort Greene, and yet we have.
I'll do my best to do justice to your questions, And. You know give myself a little PTSD while I'm doing it, but you know, I think, really for us in New, York.
You know we're putting in a lot of effort to making sure that the right communities are being tested, meaning.
You know during the first wave, so I It's, certainly not from lack of trying, h, health and hospitals and the test and trace core Have put in a tremendous amount of resources and effort to get testing sites set, up.
There was obviously the very strong messaging about if you're sick stay home, which people actually really did adhere to, and there was a lot of fear of just you know, seeking health care in general.
There was a lot of fear and concern that you would end up getting Covid-19 if you went to a healthcare facility, and so we saw just people's interests or ability to access, outpatient, healthcare, just bottom out and drop precipitously.
That was a huge challenge and they were putting in a lot of time and effort and expense to this and getting very little reimbursement back for you, know, Tele telephone visits and things like that, so that took a while to really move the needle and get them better reimbursement, so they could actually financially survive and maintain their practice.
I know that's sort of near impossible, because so much of this public health stuff is politicized and the term is determined by the economy really right.
There's, certainly been financial concerns, you know, so not only do we have people that you know at baseline before the pandemic had issues with health care coverage and being able to afford care.
And I've heard this feedback from you- know- community partners that there's hesitancy for people to go to a government, run, testing site and especially with the testing and trace program.
You know what the efforts have been, but you know obviously there's been a huge on the ground like real feet on the ground effort to do local engagement, Community engagement, especially in these kind of cluster areas.
You know, we've been making sure that providers there have access to information, PPE and the equipment that they need , they're being supported to do more testing.
I think we certainly can always do better with engaging community based organizations and our partners, and so I think you know, there's been a lot of effort to do that really engage better with community- based organizations and let them those work and live in the community really drive the messaging and outreach with our support, hopefully from behind.
We are certainly in a lot of conversations to how to capture these lessons learned and implement them for preparing further for future events like this, and we are working very closely with our national colleagues as well.
You know we have been all hands on deck for over nine months and we're informing new yorkers about coping 19 in February and staff have literally been working around hours and we were operating with the information that we had that much without much leadership as we should have been a pandemic from the federal government.
You, know working with the t2 campaign team on specific, like events and outreach, but you know for a micro site and that's a location that is air, high, foot, traffic and public transportation for access to direct population.
You know, housing, developments, shopping, centers stuff, like that on the access space inside or outside from approximately like 10, am to 4 P.M and a staff point of contact who will remain on site for the duration of our time in the space.
That's something that's available, and if interested, I can put you directly in contact with the t2 campaign team through this and then in terms of you know like what lessons Department of Health learned and Overall, we are learning a lot about the virus itself and how it's pressed.
I really appreciate that I just want to say real, quick, it's less of a question and more just a clarification that I that I was even just thinking about the ways in which, regardless of the type of disaster or health pandemic.
A few months ago, like there's a facility in Manhattan, Out, patient, clinic We dealing with I know about that facility, but how we dealing with the concern in the long term for people after the virus, because there's a lot of you know different underlying health concerns being shown.
Stop shops, where you can access multiple services and specialties, and you know in terms of being able to access it for people that you know have uninsured or underinsured New, York, City, Health and hospitals is going to be opening three sites in Queens Brooklyn and the Bronx that are Covid-19 centers for excellence that will be specifically dedicated to this type of care that will be able to offer free or low- cost services.
If you have any information on how these community health care providers are surviving with the fact that there's no utilization, I know the federal government had issued some provider relief, funds.
I do not know if New York City has really accessed that or not.
Probably what has made the biggest impact and has helped a lot has been the just changing of the reimbursement for these remote care, telehealth visits and other you know, just better payment structures for this kind of services that they're providing right, now.
I. Ask a question: I'd, just like to offer my opinion and observation, which is that you're a department within New, York, City and you're dependent on a lot of political issues and other issues that help you and also hinder you.
You know a tremendous effort that you've made as a department to help us in New, York City and just please carry the message forward about how this kind of planning and systemic preparation is critical for any city like New, York, City and going forward, and if we do not spend time on it, we're going to find ourselves.
That was not completely Covid-19 focused because our committee has been very concerned about the the community health profile that was issued by the Department of Health.
Could you potentially take the message that we would like a more granular examination of the areas most impacted in our district whenever the next community health profile is produced?
We have a great disparity of people who have wonderful health experiences and other people who have less access to care or and other health disparities in our community, and when you merge it all together into one profile and say this is what's going on across the board.
Has, New York thought because I'm always struck by how many people I encounter that have never been tested for Covid-19 and obviously like a test on one day.
If potentially crazy measures like just paying people to get tested have been considered just so, we actually have a full picture and given obviously, what asymptomatic spread, does So. This would be a best question to answer by the health and hospitals attest and trace team as they're the ones that are doing all of this.
So I'm happy to get you guys in contact with the test and trace team to help address this question in terms of the you know, the folk that have not been tested at all during open, end.
I feel what our my colleague Barry has said, but in a slightly different way, you know, I think he used the word jaded or something like that, and I do not see Barry at all as jaded, but coming from you, know, full disclosure right of coming as an officer of the New York City Department of Social services.
Second, one and sort of sort of to keep in mind with Covid-19, My feeling about it is the city has done a pretty good job, because there's a massive numbers of people b , there's little precedent in recent history to this kind of a crisis and third.
Second thing: I want to say one of our colleagues has brought up the thing of tracing and testing and that's a good thing Can people I've been tested, And, you know, there's not testing in certain pockets, Community, board, 2 or certain pockets in Brooklyn or the city, but it's much more important that everybody be wearing masks and from the southerly and east elite that I hail from non- compliance, whether it be in this neighborhood or be.
You know we have a lot of graphics that you can share on social media and there are the posters and flyers that we can mail that you can help us spread out in the community for people to post it.
So, okay, all right questions from members of the committee.
You think that you could amend the application a little bit here with the hours to make it clear what is am and what is pm specifically for each one, because it just it seems like the word pm and Am is written in these different locations, and you want to make sure that that's clear.
Is there going to be a menu available in Braille, or is there some other someone who wants to know the menu and they can't read it Any other questions from members of the committee.
Okay, questions from members of the committee: yes, Mrs, Mr, Harrison.
Specifically around and people jump in to correct me around where outside terraces and entertainment areas are relatively, I'm sure it's not as simple as this, but you're talking about transportation, right, because transportation does the sidewalk, cafes or Because I do not think land use and also, I.
I think that this is the only committee that they hit So Maybe I do not know like a sort of a good neighborly policy.
Maybe there's a way that we could talk to Lenny or just discuss this at our next executive committee meeting and just say: How can we put the word out that if there's a hotel, we, you know really strongly encourage them to come at least before the executive committee and ideally to us and to land use or wherever we think is appropriate, so that we're at least part of that conversation, even if not in a formal way, Mr Chair, Mr Harrison did not vote, but he got cut.
I kind of feel, there's an expectation that work is done at the committee level and that we're fundamentally more responsible for that, But I I'd be open to having any further conversation about that, and I I'm, definitely going to think about it.
So I, if I may, I, think it has to be more of a conversation about what the committee would like, because this building this hotel might have been as of right.
