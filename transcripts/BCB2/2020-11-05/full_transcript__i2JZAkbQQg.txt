The evening we are particularly honored to be joined by a couple of speakers tonight we have Dr Mary Foote, a senior health security specialist from the New York City Department of Health and mental hygiene. We also have Anna Schatz from the office of External Affairs. I believe I saw Dr Foote on the in the participant list. Do we have, and I see him as shots also, dr Foote, do you want to introduce yourself hi everyone? Thank you for the invitation to speak with you tonight. My name is Dr Mary Foote, I'm a fix, an infectious disease specialist. I work in the office of emergency preparedness and response in my sort of day job non- response role and in the Covid-19 response. I am one of the directors for healthcare system, preparedness and response, and also do a lot of healthcare system planning and strategies. So, thanks for having me, okay, that's great and miss shops. Do we have you on the line? Also? Yes, hello, hi everyone. Thank you. So much for your invitation for having me here, Dr Mary Foote is going to be presenting, but I'm here I'm representing the community affairs and office of external affairs at the Department of Health, so anything that we won't be able to answer tonight. I am happy to follow up with and get back to you after this meeting and anything that does come up. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions, and I will do our best to get everything back to you as much information as we have. Thank you. So much, that's great! Thank you very much. Okay, well, Dr Foote feel free to begin with your presentation. It's we're really honored to have you thank you for coming and for everyone else's benefit, we're going to be talking about Covid-19 and the response and the future of our approach to this. So I think this is really timely and we have some very experienced and credentialed guests with us. So thank you and please commence with your presentation. Okay, great, so full disclosure. I my remarks are going to be pretty limited, because I wanted to just leave a lot of time for open discussion and questions, so we'll just give you sort of a quick rundown of current situation and both globally and here in New York and go down to Brooklyn level. So globally we are at more than 47 million reported cases throughout the world, and these are confirmed cases. New, York state has had almost 250,000 reported cases outside of New York City and in New York City. We have had actually more than that at 265 reported cases. At this point we are at our total death count. Right now is at about night a little over 19,000 confirmed deaths and another 4,600 probable deaths, and those are deaths that are reported by by our ocme after death. If covant is listed as a cause of death, so in Brooklyn, specifically drilling down you've had a total of 74,000 confirmed cases and about 23 percent of which have been hospitalized throughout the response and in Brooklyn there have been about 5700, confirmed death and 1600 probable deaths, and you know just generally from the global perspective. We are seeing a really you know. I'm sure this is not a big surprise to most of you, but Europe is really kind of the big hot spot at the moment, and there have been just over the last couple days, some much more severe measures, social distancing measures and lockdown measures being taken in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Uk and other countries, so just in terms of trajectory of their outbreak they are. You know this is sort of a similar scenario to what we're seeing in March, where they seem to be a few weeks ahead of us in terms of their trajectory, and we are kind of having acceleration that is really mirroring what they're seeing what they were saying a couple weeks ago. So we're obviously very you know watching things very closely and New York City Wise. You know we have actually we you know in New, York in general, we've been doing quite well all things considered, especially compared to the rest of the country. Just over the last few weeks we have, you know, started out having more cases in particular pockets, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens, and that is what has prompted this new cluster response that has led to some localized restrictions, and that is an initiative that is really being led by the governor's office at the state level. But it is impacting largely communities within New, York, City and all go over kind of some further information for that in just a bit just a bit. So we were initially a few weeks ago, seeing really kind of pretty discrete areas and communities, specific communities that were really having a higher level transmission. But now we are seeing a much more broad dispersion of upticks in cases, so we now have pockets of increasing infections pretty much in all five boroughs. So this is something that we are certainly concerned about and are watching very closely and may have to take. You know more further measures to try and control if things continue to increase, but we are. We are hoping that the measures that we're taking right now will be you know, effective and we'll see some impact for that. But you know, of course, that that's something that we're watching very closely. We are seeing some increases in hospitalizations and that's you know: we've seen it in Manhattan as well as Queens and Brooklyn, but we're also starting to see now staten, Island and Bronx as well having increasing number of Covid-19 patients in the hospitals, nothing that has overwhelmed or stretched the system. So far. You know we're in very close communication with hospitals pretty much every day and as of now you know there have been some. You know very early response in the hospitals in terms of creating special code, but so far no one has had to implement aggressive surge plannings, where they've had to really aggressively increase bed capacity, so they've been able to absorb the amount of patients that they're seeing pretty well so as of now we're kind of comfortable with the hospital system's preparedness and ability to handle what we're, seeing and they're, certainly much better off in terms of preparedness and planning and supplies wise than they were back in March. So I think the only other, interesting update I did want to highlight in terms of the city and state is that the governor's office and over the last couple of days over the weekend has changed their. Let's say I guess it's an executive order, but their travel advisory and restrictions. So, instead of having you know a list of specific states that were under travel advisory, it's now been changed to basically and if you're traveling anywhere in the country and in any state that is not contiguous with New York. So the exempt states include, I believe, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont, and if you're traveling to any other state, then you can either just do as we. What we have been doing and have you quarantined for 14 days when you arrive home or there's now the option to, I guess they called the opt- out option, which would be you would have to be tested within the three days before returning tested for Covid-19 within three days before returning back to New, York City, and then you would be asked to assuming that was a negative test before you left, then you would be asked to quarantine at home for three days and then on the fourth day you would get tested, and if that test was negative, then you could end your quarantine and if, of course, obviously, if you do test positive, then you would then going to be enrolled in our test and trace program and be asked to isolate until you were no longer infectious. So I think those are the big highlights that I wanted to touch on just to give you a snapshot of where we are, and I would be very happy to open this up for discussion and questions. Thank you very much. That's really insightful to hear and good to know about some of these details about what's going on presently, particularly, I want to have the committee asked some questions I think just like. First, I wanted to ask you to touch on some of the things that occurred back in March in terms of the closures and the announcements and when we all found out about this at the very beginning, I think you know part of our committee's approach, we're located here in downtown Brooklyn and also fort Greene and Clinton hill and Vinegar Hill and Boerum, Hill and Dumbo, and some of these neighborhoods here and in our meetings. We have different health providers who come before us at times, and I think we were really struck when one of our community health centers came to us early in the year for one of our first video meetings and said that they were just completely out of supplies and they he did not feel like. They had the guidance to really talk to patients about the risks that were that were coming up in terms of what to do when you presented systems that might have been similar to Covid-19.. So I just wanted to ask you to touch upon what happened at the beginning, whether you feel like the out and the closures of everything was effective and efficient from you know, looking back and in retrospect and if there's any light that could be said on why it was that health, because I doubt that the health care provider we spoke to was really unique in this regard. Why was it that health care providers did not have these supplies and then just? Finally, when, from a looking back perspective, any lessons learned and anything that anything at all? It's fine. If there's not anything specific to the areas that I described, downtown Brooklyn heights, Fort, Greene, Clinton, hill, the we we're really we're also really concerned as a committee with the NYCHA communities within our district, and it's a point that we've been wanting to make with the Department of Health for quite some time, because the community health profile that was issued in 2018 referred to our district, as quote Unquote Brooklyn high Fort Greene, and yet we have. We have other communities that are much that within this district, some of which are experiencing much. You know the pandemic, much stronger and forceful than others, and you know we kind of felt like our health profile had landed us in a position where you know it sort of trended to be more positive than it really was for some of those more impacted areas. So you know I thinking about all of that. I know there's a lot in there, but could you touch upon the stuff from earlier in the year yeah? I would say we could probably have an hour conversation on any one of those topics. I'll do my best to do justice to your questions, but I mean, I think, they're all very fair concerns. You know I can. I can go back to the beginning and you know give myself a little PTSD while I'm doing it, but you know, I think, really for us in New York. Obviously you know we were all living it, but our really our biggest challenge and I think what handicapped us more than anything else was the lack of testing and just the fact that we had probably could have gotten testing on board a lot earlier. If things had been done differently on the federal level, you know because you know New, York, City, New, York, State, Lab and other like north well, and some of the other commercial laboratories actually got testing capacity could have been doing testing much sooner than they were, and so that really did just leave us flying blind. I know that's kind of a cliche, but it really hobbled us. So you know we at the health department. You know we were watching the numbers and watching our surveillance information from the emergency rooms and, seeing you know, people coming in with flu- like illness that you know we knew were not being diagnosed with flu. That was indicating that we were having Covid-19 circulating quite early. You know quite early in March and late February for sure. So I mean I think that in itself is a huge. We are in a very different place now, where we probably have some of the most robust testing capabilities in the country. I would say so that's good and that's an advantage, but I do think that we're still could you know we're putting in a lot of effort to making sure that the right communities are being tested, meaning you know we still see a heavy concentration of testing being done in the wealthier parts of Manhattan, where of course, we'd like to see testing being utilized a lot more. You know in the outer boroughs, particularly in the most heavily impacted areas. You know during the first wave, so I it's certainly not from lack of trying h, health and hospitals and the test and trace core have put in a tremendous amount of resources and effort to get testing sites set up. You know really throughout the outer boroughs, but it's you know it's a matter of trying to. You know, really increase uptake and I think community awareness of that. So that's been an ongoing challenge, but you know we're getting there. We hope and certainly more every day, we're improving our capacity to do testing. So I know testing, question and testing supply and access was high on your list of questions. So you know- and I think another challenge and certainly lesson learned and very complicated in terms of the factors that went into those decisions about closing and shutting things down earlier I mean, I think we would all say that we, you know should have, should have probably shut things down sooner, particularly schools. You know, but that was such a complex decision. In terms of you know, how does it impact the health care system and essential services when you shut down? Schools and people have to stay home with their children, and you know you have caregiving duties, and you know the health and well- being of the children, making sure that they're able to you know access food, and you know health care and other essential services. So and of course it was also not just a decision on the city level, it was very much. A lot of decisions were heavily impacted by decisions coming down from the state, so you know I would. I would love to say that we've learned a lot of lessons from that. So I'll be optimistic on that and you know so I so I think those were some of the big things that I can. I can really speak to and in terms of impact on health care. You know, and I also am a health care provider. I work at Cowl and Lord who just opened a site in downtown Brooklyn, which is very exciting. You know the healthcare. The healthcare impact was really interesting that we, you know, we all expected the surge in the hospitals. That obviously was not a surprise, but we, you know we were expecting a surge on all health care services, including in the outpatient sector, and that really did not happen. So you know there was. There was obviously the very strong messaging about if you're sick stay home, which people actually really did adhere to, and there was a lot of fear of just you know seeking health care in general. You know if you were not coming in for Covid-19 you. Obviously there was a lot of fear and concern that you would end up getting Covid-19 if you went to a healthcare facility, and so we saw just people's interests or ability to access, outpatient, healthcare, just bottom out and drop precipitously. The other challenge with the outpatient was certainly the access to PPE personal protective equipment, and that is absolutely like a full day. We could spend talking about pbe, and that was a big part of my work during the search. But you know we did have a stockpile from the city. Obviously, global supply chains for personal protective equipment masks, especially in respirators I mean back in January. We were already seeing runs on supplies, starting to see strain on the supply chain, and that was you know before we ever saw a case in the U.S. Part of the challenge was a lot of personal protective equipment, especially respirators and mass are manufactured in China, particularly in the hubei province. You know, so it was just sort of you know those compounding factors and everybody in the globe was, you know, really going to the same suppliers and same equipment, manufacturers and factories, a lot of which were shut down. So I mean part of the issue was just there. Just was not any to get and then the stockpiles that we did have you know on the city level. You know it was, I would say, probably some of the hardest discussions and decisions that I've ever had professionally was deciding who had to be prioritized to get personal protective equipment, and we really- you know, at a certain point- had to really prioritize the health and safety of the hospital workers, because that's where the patients were going and you know if they needed to seek care, you know they could either access telemedicine. You know for non- urgent issues or they would go to the hospital for urgent issues, and that's you know so these real we had to prioritize the health and safety, the real emergent services in that case so and of course, nursing homes were a high priority and you know other, you know specific groups that were prioritized so definitely, hospitals, definitely Ems and first responders, and the nursing home sectors were really in the alternate care sites. So, unfortunately, that left a lot of the outpatient practices in a bind and even if they could find supplies it was, you know, wildly expensive for them to access so yeah. So that was a big challenge, so they very understandably a lot of people just were not comfortable, you know being able to see patients, so there was a big shift fortunate. You know in one way it's been a big win from this. Is that we've seen you know, efforts to move to telemedicine and remote care. You know that have been moving at the glacial pace for a decade have all of a sudden been accelerated. So you know now: most practices are set up to provide telehealth and Cms has created better reimbursement structures to actually sustain the provision of health, remote health care remotely, but in the beginning that was not there. So a lot of people, you know literally overnight, had to try and build systems to provide care remotely to patients that were often very complex with a lot of you know social complexities as well. So that was a huge challenge and they were putting in a lot of time and effort and expense to this and getting very little reimbursement back for you know, Tele telephone visits and things like that, so that took a while to really move the needle and get them better reimbursement, so they could actually financially survive and maintain their practice. So I think I touched on a lot of what you asked about sort of the beginning and the impact on the health care were there other specifically, you did an amazing job of catching up on all these different things. I just left. I could really talk. Is there anything specific to downtown Brooklyn or to our surrounding communities down here, Fort Greene, Clinton hill? What have you and it's? Okay? If there's not, I understand that the data does not go that granular yeah. So I'm in the chat page, I'm just going to share our data page. So on the DOH we do it DOH site. We do have some maps where you can kind of see what the trends have been by zip code. So I would say that this area of Brooklyn has been, and I am also in this area of Brooklyn. So this is my home base. I would say if you just look at the wrong numbers, it was kind of in a moderate impact zone. But of course, when you really get granular and you look at the NYCHA residents and the communities of color and especially when you look at the you know, stratified by income, multi-, family housing, you know people that are living in more crowded. You know apartments the front line workers, you know, that's, you know that did not discriminate by neighborhood. Those were people that were impacted throughout Brooklyn and Queens and the Bronx. So you know it certainly had a big impact, and I and I know Brooklyn hospital the Brooklyn hospital center- I'm not sure what other hospitals are within your zone, but certainly we're heavily impacted, and you know we worked very closely with them throughout the response. So oh thank you for that and I will say no. I know if you take a look at this data site. It's pretty helpful yeah, so this data site we're actually going to be updating it with a lot better, more granular data on the neighborhood level. So look for that, hopefully, early next week, okay, yeah questions from members of the committee. I've rendered you speechless or put you to sleep, Mr, Varela hi. Thank you. Dr cook, your presentation, apologies in advance for the background noise. My kids are about 10 feet away and I can't get them to stay quiet. I I'm curious as to two questions. One is how to what do you attribute the low testing rates in the poor communities that you mentioned earlier, as opposed to the wealthier communities and or areas in New, York City? And what plans do you have to overcome those barriers? So that's my number one number two is and really the reason why I was very interested in this presentation is to talk about the next. The next pandemic, the next epidemic, what sort of communication strategies or what have we learned, and how will we disseminate that? I feel like a lot of what was happening and again as we were all learning sort of, as we went that I was curious about. As everything has been unfolding, I wanted to see more information at bus stops. I wanted to know what the long- term plan was and how we were going to roll things out and to what extent we should do this out or the other, and I wonder you know the concerns is as it concerns natural disasters. I just wish we had a better sense of what the government's plan is and how we're going to be involved in what we're going to do, and I wonder if those conversations are happening, what you already know and and then just one minor comment I wanted to touch. I still feel- and I think you hinted at this because there's so many layers of government here involved in the process that it felt to me as if the social determinants of health were the sort of the least considered in how to keep people at home. I kept waiting for some sort of omniscient voice to say everyone. It's going to. We right now with the limited information we have. We think this thing lasts for two weeks, which is a prevailing wisdom at the beginning for two weeks it was on services for two weeks. It was in the air for two weeks two weeks, and I thought why can't we do everything in our power to shut things down for just two weeks, as opposed to the nine months we're going into now, and I know that's sort of near impossible, because so much of this public health stuff is politicized and the term is determined by the economy really right. If the economy was not an issue, we'd all be at home, and so anyway. So I wonder if you can talk about those things a little, I know that's a lot or whatever you can touch on. Thank you by the way, sure and Anna you can. My colleague Anna hopefully, can feel free to chime in about the testing the low uptake of testing. You know, I mean I think it's multi- fold obvious, like everything else, you know it's complex and there's no black or white answer in terms of testing uptake. You know one is just in general: access to care in the outer boroughs is not as good. You know. We have healthcare deserts, certainly, especially in you know, communities that probably need it most. So that is definitely an issue. There's certainly been financial concerns, you know, so not only do we have people that you know at baseline before the pandemic had issues with health care coverage and being able to afford care. You know that was compounded, obviously by a huge amount of people losing their jobs, losing healthcare coverage etc, so that we are still certainly feeling residual effects from that, and people are just worried about. You know not being able to afford care, and so just are not necessarily going in. You know. I think the other issue is, you know I mean you know, I will say it, there's a huge mistrust of an understandable mistrust of government and the system, and you know a lot of the testing sites that are being set up. You know- and I've heard this feedback from you- know- community partners that there's hesitancy for people to go to a government- run, testing site and especially with the testing and trace program. I think that does kind of spark some concern and mistrust in some people. You know I'm being registered in the system you're asking like every detail about my life who I've been with, and I think that's been a huge challenge for the whole contact racing operation in general. But testing is very much attached to that and in fact we've actually heard you know. We've certainly heard reports of underground testing operations where people are getting tested, but it's not part of the system that is reporting into our city data. So you know I mean there's obviously a lot of things at play and maybe Anna can talk a little bit about. You know what the efforts have been, but you know obviously there's been a huge on the ground like real feet on the ground effort to do local engagement, Community engagement, especially in these kind of cluster areas. These cluster zip codes and the you know we've sort of we have a list of high priority zip codes based on you know the social determinants. You know the highest risk areas based on social determinants, and you know how profoundly they were impacted by Kovitz. So these are areas where we have been doing a lot of ground game, putting in a lot of resources. You know, we've been making sure that providers there have access to information, PPE and the equipment that they need they're being supported to do more testing. You know at the community provider level, so these are all things that we're you know realizing you know needed to be stepped up and better supported we're engaging a lot more with you know. I think we certainly can always do better with engaging community based organizations and our partners, and so I think you know, there's been a lot of effort to do that really engage better with community- based organizations and let them those work and live in the community really drive the messaging and outreach with our support, hopefully from behind. So those are those are kind of things that I can think of. You know to answer your first question. What are we doing to prepare for the future? That is, that is that's what I've been doing for the last five years after Ebola, so this is actually this is. This is really my bread and butter, you know, and unfortunately, on a national level. You know a lot of this was predictable in some ways. You know there were a lot of unknowns and new things that we did see with Covid-19, but there were also a lot. You know the supply chain issues a lot of things that were predictable, the healthcare surge- and you know we can do our best in terms of taking lessons learned, I mean you know things like the stockpiled supply chain. We are. We now have a massive city based stockpile a personal protective equipment that will be able to withstand another surge like we saw and maintain essential services, both on the outpatient and the inpatient level. I mean we have, we are doing meeting every day to talk about forward planning and how we can maintain better preparedness. Beefing up our surveillance systems, I think in New York City. We have very good surveillance systems nationally. You know it's very spotty, so you know I mean there's kind of what we can do locally and what has to be done nationally, and you know so. We are certainly in a lot of conversations to how to capture these lessons learned and implement them for preparing further for future events like this, and we are working very closely with our national colleagues as well. You know, and on the federal level, not just the city and state hi, and this is Anna. I just wanted to add to you- know the a lot of things that then Dr Fred said just to you know backtrack. You know we have been all hands on deck for over nine months and we're informing new yorkers about coping 19 in February and staff have literally been working around hours and we were operating with the information that we had that much without much leadership as we should have been a pandemic from the federal government. We updated our information as we got it and you know, including the latest, about asymptomatic spread. You know, masks, guidelines and such so. We are in a totally different place now with testing tracing and understanding of the virus, even though that's also constantly evolving and we're collaborating across agencies with healthcare partners to ensure preparedness and are working with community partners to get buy- in issues in the data. We're taking a hyper- local approach to search busting distributing of face coverings as Dr mentioned cities, prioritizing resources and support service provides over data, show low test rates and a high percentage of positive tests. We try to engage the whole community and increase testing rates, so these neighborhoods would have testing sites that deliver results within an hour, and this is put together by the test and trace team trying to bring wrap- around services into the community and lower transmission and to speak to that a little bit, there's also micro sites that tesla increase put together. So this is, you know directly. You know working with the t2 campaign team on specific, like events and outreach, but you know for a micro site and that's a location that is air, high foot, traffic and public transportation for access to direct population, for example like senior housing. You know housing developments, shopping, centers stuff, like that on the access space inside or outside from approximately like 10, am to 4 P.M and a staff point of contact who will remain on site for the duration of our time in the space. You know a table two three chairs that just for the setup aspect of it and access to a restroom for the staff members and then the host organization can take responsibility for promoting getting tested at this microsite. But that's something that's available and if interested, I can put you directly in contact with the t2 campaign team through this and then in terms of you know like what lessons Department of Health learned and so far you know, Dr Foot was able to describe a lot of it. But overall we are learning a lot about the virus itself and how it's pressed. We are still learning about immunity. We are learning about working across partners, including with small businesses, to make sure everyone has the right information at the right time on our website. There's also the posters and flyers page so for any businesses that want to have those flyers and posters printed, they can call 3- 1- 1 or if you want, you can connect with me directly and let me know any of the you know information any of the flyers that you wanted any of the languages that are available. We can. I have them printed and mailed directly to your office as well, so you can help disseminate this information as well and we're working closely with trusted community partners and are always happy to do webinars town halls. Anything that you need to get the info out. You know try to try to get someone to join and speak to questions that you have and we've got nearly 500 speaking events since March, and that does not include all like the one- off stuff you've had as well based on like lectures and community words as well. So hopefully that helps to answer your question. Thank you to you both. I really appreciate that I just want to say real, quick, it's less of a question and more just a clarification that I that I was even just thinking about the ways in which, regardless of the type of disaster or health pandemic, it may be just some sort of standard operating procedure for all new yorkers so that we know you know these are the depots where we're lined up- and these are the last names a through m that go on Monday Wednesday Friday to get food you know, and so that we do not create this sort of log Jam and all this the kind of chaos that was happening near the beginning, because you know we are such a quote: unquote, liberty! You know: liberty, oriented society that it's hard to have these mandatory things. So it's like how do we get people to voluntarily choose to lock down and how do we sort of move that along? But thank you both for your explanation and quickly brandon. If I can, I wanted to pass it over to latrell who's, another CB2 member, on the line and has a question latrell. We're really happy to have you here feel free to introduce yourself and ask your question hi good afternoon everybody. My name is Latrell and I'm a community board member. My first question is Cuomo stated that how people can we're monitoring people traveling in and out of the state on buses and airplanes, but what about for people who travel in United, States and vehicles, how we monitoring them yeah? I sorry I was waiting to see if Anna had anything to say we can't speak as much to the governor level travel order, because we actually have not gotten very detailed information about the enforcement of it. So unfortunately we may have to refer you to the you know to the governor's office until we get more information, but we have similar questions ourselves. Let's say that and my other question was a lot of people before the virus had a lot of serious underlining conditions and from understanding after the virus a lot of people. There's more. You know people with health concerns- and I remember seeing something on the news a few months ago, like there's a facility in Manhattan and it's a 300 and it's like they house like 300 and some people is an in- n- out patient clinic and there's a waiting list. How we dealing with I know about that facility, but how we dealing with the concern in the long term for people after the virus, because there's a lot of you know different underlying health concerns being shown. You mean specifically after somebody recovers from Covid-19 yeah. No, that's a that's actually a fantastic question and I've been working on that a lot this week, so very, very apt, timing, yeah! So right now, actually what we're doing is compiling a list of the clinics that are dedicated to you know the post care of a patient after they've suffered from Covid-19, especially severe copit, where they're having residual health problems and it, and it is a big issue and it's a really big concern, because you know we're seeing now: it's not just the lungs. Obviously, it's multi, really every system in the body can be impacted and have long- term effects, so so that actually lists should be up on the website. We hope next week, but there are several within all five boroughs, including Staten island, run by the different healthcare networks. And those are you know, we're really focusing on the clinics, and I think you might be probably talking about Mount Sinai Clinic. They were really the first ones to set something like this up, and these are specialty clinics that are really one-. Stop shops, where you can access multiple services and specialties, and you know in terms of being able to access it for people that you know have uninsured or underinsured New, York, City, Health and hospitals is going to be opening three sites in Queens Brooklyn and the Bronx that are Covid-19 centers for excellence that will be specifically dedicated to this type of care that will be able to offer free or low- cost services yeah, because the disability number will increase even more for disability. Yes, also, absolutely is going to be in CB2. Mine is Mount Sinai. Well, I assume you're talking about the mouse Sinai and CB2 the MOU, I'm sorry. What was the question? Mount Sinai is going to be one of the places that's going to be open up the clinic, but we do have a mouse on I and CB2. How many other facilities and cv2 do you know that's going to be opening up yeah that I do not know. Bounce now actually has just the one location that's going to be in downtown union square for now, and I am not sure where the health and hospitals location is going to be. The Brooklyn hospital center does not have one at this point, but yeah, so I'm not sure, what's going to be available in Brooklyn and from the h side, but can we go about to see if we can get one in our district and community boy 2 district? So we could be that's a very good question. You know it may be something to advocate with the Brooklyn hospital because they certainly you know, could be a good site for that, and that's something that we're you know like. I said we're just starting to kind of compile the list and put out feelers, but we can certainly advocate for that as well. Thank you sure. Thanks for your question, miss mcknight. You had a question. I do. I have a question related to community health care providers. I know there's been articles related to the fact that there's been lower utilization of services and I just want to know if you have any information on how these community health care providers are surviving with the fact that there's no utilization, I know the federal government had issued some provider relief funds. I do not know if New York City has really accessed that or not. There has not been that much information. I've been privy to yeah. No, that's a that's a really good question. So, looking at the data that we do have looking at independent practices and federally qualified help, centers utilization actually looks like it's near at or near baseline for this time of year. So it's so it's fortunately bounced back pretty well, you know in terms of utilization, but you know. Obviously people are really still suffering major economic impact from before. So yeah, so definitely there were a lot of clinics that did apply and received money, especially for the paycheck protection program, and that, I think, probably what has made the biggest impact and has helped a lot has been the just changing of the reimbursement for these remote care, telehealth visits and other you know, just better payment structures for this kind of services that they're providing right now. So you know there are definitely some especially the independent providers have been hit pretty hard and some have shuttered for good. But you know, as of now there are you know, structures in place to help support them, those that have been able to stay open yeah, and I hopefully there will be another round of funding soon to help support, outpatient services and federally qualified help. Centers, especially, thank you any other questions from members of the committee. Any questions from any of the members of the public who are here at the meeting. Excuse me Brandon Barry, had earlier indicated. He wanted to speak, I'm sorry who would indicate they wanted to speak Barry. Oh Barry wanted to speak Barry. The floor is yours. I believe you're a mute, though, are you able to unmute Barry? Oh there we go sorry, I think I just did actually, as is often the case alejandro a lot of what I was interested in and Dr Foote and Ms Schatz. You were kind enough to provide a lot of answers and responses to those questions which I know we all appreciate on the committee, and we appreciate your being here. You know, I think why do not. I ask a question: I'd just like to offer my opinion and observation, which is that you're a department within New, York, City and you're dependent on a lot of political issues and other issues that help you and also hinder you as a department. In carrying out your mission, which I appreciate- and I understand that I think probably everybody here does and New York City is also at the mercy of New York state. Unfortunately, for a lot of things, home rule does not really exist in New York City for important things, and we witnessed that most recently and New York state's dependent on the rest of the country states government, because we're all one big, crazy, family and usually in times of crisis, we come together to help each other and we see the best in most of us and unfortunately, except for what we've seen from people. We know and trust that has not been the case, so you guys were really up against it. All I really wanna again say is that I've done a lot of work in dealing with crises in communities and the aftermath of those crises and in planning how to reach out and engage with communities. And what always happens? Is things go down? And even though, what's the old saying, announcer prevention is worth a pound of cure? We do not do it as a society. We just do not stick with it and Alejandro was getting to another point which I was thinking of during the conversation, which is that there are lessons to be learned from this experience. As with every crisis that has confronted New, York, City and New York state- and it just would be a shame that this again becomes one of those times where we do not spend the effort boring as it sometimes is, in planning and setting up the kinds of systems that Alejandro was alluding to, so that we can move into those relatively seamlessly. Aside from the chaos that any crisis brings. But this is something that we have to stick with. We have a department of emergency management just across the street, from where I live, and I do not know what the heck they were doing during all of this. To tell you the truth, I saw lights on in the building, but you know I have to say I'm cynical about the level of support that you guys received trying to manage this crisis. You guys really had your hands full and more, and you know having 500,600 meetings in such a short time as you've as the shots you described before is a great thing, but we had some communities like borough park like Williamsburg, where the politics and the people who really exercise influence are very well known to the politicians in New, York City, and with all of that we had chaos so and that you had no control over, and I appreciate that so I guess including Mary, I'm sorry to cut you off. It's just Miss foot has got to get going in two minutes, so I want to make sure that I was just going to end and that's fine. Thank you again for coming out and nothing, I said, was a criticism, dr food of you or mishats or the department, and I hope you did not think I was doing anything of that. I was really joining you in what I think has been. You know a tremendous effort that you've made as a department to help us in New, York City and just please carry the message forward about how this kind of planning and systemic preparation is critical for any city like New, York, City and going forward, and if we do not spend time on it, we're going to find ourselves. You know thank you, Brandon for being so generous. Thank you Mary for your thoughts, yeah and thank you Barry for your remarks, and I all I can say is a big ditto and we hear you and believe me, the work is being done as best we can. Thank you very much. Dr Foote. I think I had a question for Miss Schatz. If maybe so, it's okay, if you, if you're, if you drop off but yeah thanks, everybody thank you for the invitation, but I have to jump off. So. Thank you. Thank you happy to answer we're really appreciative. Okay, but I'm happy to answer any follow- up. Questions through miss jets, so have a good night. Thank you great. Thank you. Thank you all Michelle say I just wanted to ask one other follow- up question that was not completely Covid-19 focused because our committee has been very concerned about the the community health profile that was issued by the Department of Health. Who might we follow up with at the Department of Health? Or could you potentially take the message that we would like a more granular examination of the areas most impacted in our district whenever the next community health profile is produced? Yeah? Absolutely I took this down when you mentioned that earlier as well, and I will be flagging it up chain in terms of you know, you mentioned, like the NYCHA community district as well yeah that that's absolutely the case. Yeah I mean I think it really can just be best termed by the fact that the profile reads describing our community district as Quote Fort, Greene and Brooklyn heights, and you know. Obviously, we have a great disparity of people who have wonderful health experiences and other people who have less access to care or and other health disparities in our community, and when you merge it all together into one profile and say this is what's going on across the board. It looks like we may be one of the better profiles in the city, but it really needs to be. The story needs to be told about the places that are most impacted within our district because they're experiencing the real challenges and it makes we do not want to make it seem like they're part of a story, that's better than it really is for those folks yeah. Absolutely thank you for your comment. I'm noting it and I'm going to bring it back to our teams, any other questions from the committee or any members of the public for Ms Schatz. I have a question hi, it's emily, oh emily, hi the floor is yours, hi, sorry and I'm going to miss chats, I'm going to try to think of how to ask this question has New York thought because I'm always struck by how many people I encounter that have never been tested for Covid-19 and obviously like a test on one day. Does not you know mean that your results? You know the next week still hold the same, especially if you're out and about in the world, but again I'm so struck by the fact that we're you know eight months into this and the number of people that have never been tested, and so I wonder, has the state or the city or I do not know at what level considered paying people to get tested, and I know that sounds kind of crazy, but I guess the thinking is, if you can identify someone who has it and you're fundamentally then saving the health costs and the costs on the system to take care of them or to take care of the people who may they may go on to infect? I just I do not know, I guess I'm just struck by the number, and it sounds like you're identifying that through places where there's low rates of testing of Covid-19- and I'm just thinking about things where you hear in the news like, for example, the South Dakota Bike rally, it would have been cheaper to basically pay all those people. Ten thousand dollars, just not go to the rally for the cost that were then inflicted on the system, and so I'm just wondering for New York, like what percentage of people have been tested and again, if potentially crazy measures like just paying people to get tested have been considered just so we actually have a full picture and given obviously, what asymptomatic spread does and yes I'll stop there. No thank you for that. It's a great point and a great question. So this would be a best question to answer by the health and hospitals attest and trace team as they're the ones that are doing all of this. So I'm happy to get you guys in contact with the test and trace team to help address this question in terms of the you know, the folk that have not been tested at all during open end. What the approach there would be yeah- and I guess I'm just thinking about even like specifically as we talk about like Fort Greene, where you have such great disparity and if it just honestly what it would do and if it would be helpful to just like go into pockets, particularly if there are, if we're understanding there to be low incidence of testing and incentivize people to get tests again with the idea being the greater savings to the health care system. If you can identify people early on, but yes, I will find brandon on that and crazy thinking. Right yeah. I will get you in contact and also, as I mentioned, about the micro sites. Maybe that's something that you might be interested in doing as well as the Community Board yeah love that especially I'll connect that Brandon with the Fort Green Park conservancy, to see. If that's something we could potentially do on myrtle. That would be amazing, yes, I'll, follow up Brandon to get the dots connected there. Okay, thank you thanks emily and thank you miss Shadz. Were there any other questions from Miss Schatz? I we have been joined by another community board member Mr Harrison. Do you want to introduce yourself and feel free to to make your point? Yes, thank you. Thank you. Mr chair. You have it's not a question, so I'm not sure that I should raise this now granted. It's really an observation, but it does involve miss chats and it did involve our colleague the doctor, the doctor who had elsewhere to go. I do not know if you want to make this at this time or you want me to hold off hey John. If you want to raise your thought, you can raise your thought. I just you know like any thought. Let's I wanted I want to. Ultimately this is. This is a secret about tonight's meeting, I'd like to avoid having a four- hour meeting tonight like we did last month, so I would like to try to keep things somewhat sustained. If I could I'd I virtually. Let me do a virtual handbook, Mr chair, so my point is this and I think I what I'm about to express, I will do succinctly and it's me brandon, so you know I'm going to try to keep myself to my standard of succinctness, but it's I felt the need to express this because I expressed it as best I could in a document that was circulated by one of the Community Board office staff as it applies to district needs, or maybe I have that wrong. Maybe it was much do believe it was district needs, because a lot of the questions or a lot of the points that came up in that document were covered related. And it's simply this. I feel what our my colleague Barry has said, but in a slightly different way you know, I think he used the word jaded or something like that, and I do not see Barry at all as jaded, but coming from you know, full disclosure right of coming as an officer of the New York City Department of Social services. I have a slightly different perspective than many people and it is definitely tempered by 30 years of service with the city, and so it comes down to three things and I tried to say this distinctly in the document. One is expectations about just what the city and it's and it's you know with this reality with the city's kind of expanded to include you know some non- profits that work with the city or for the city if they get contracts but I'll just use the word, the city to sort of cover. All that one has to do with the expectation just in general, on how the city, at what level the city can respond to a crisis. The second one and sort of sort of to keep in mind with Covid-19, and it's not to let anybody off the hook. But my feeling about it is the city has done a pretty good job, because there's a massive numbers of people b, there's little precedent in recent history to this kind of a crisis and third, it's something that I reference in the documents. I we one of the important points for the committee and for the board and just in looking at this crisis, but in the larger context of of a crisis that the crisis has come and they do not almost come in the same form right so in our lifetime as adults in this city, we have dealt with other health problems, but we have dealt with nine of dealt with Hurricane Sandy and the reason I bring them up is because time and again often the public- I'm not saying this board, but often the public will criticize the city for its preparedness response. But it comes down to numbers folks, when you talk about the millions of people that live in the city and the amount of personnel and other than personnel allocation of monies you'd have to have for every kind of a possibility of a crisis. That's why I stressed in that document and I think in emails discussing the budget priorities it's kind of good. If some of the city agencies can project made possible crisis, so they can sort of put their money in that bucket, because there's just no way if New York, whether it's or anything else, can anticipate all permutations of all possible crisis and then prepare them by stockpiling masks and having a huge, just vast blood supply and having all the roads repaired. So it comes in different forms. So I so that's one thing it has to do with expectations so to say: well, you know what the city should have done this yes, the city should have, and the city could have done this and yes, they could have, but it all costs money and it takes planning, and you really, the real planning is not well next time having. I do not know whatever billions of mass sitting around or billions of hand sanitizers to sort of move towards anticipating what the next crisis might be and then preparing that way. The second thing I want to say, Mr Harrison. We are very tight on time. Do you have something that you can want me to capture succinctly in the notes, a question or anything? The second thing I want to say one of our colleagues has brought up the thing of tracing and testing and that's a good thing, but more fundamentally, right off the bat, because it's great to know if someone's got it, but more importantly it you know you can people I've been tested, and you know, there's not testing in certain pockets, Community board, 2 or certain pockets in Brooklyn or the city, but it's much more important that everybody be wearing masks and from the southerly and east elite that I hail from non- compliance, whether it be in this neighborhood or be. When I go out to my job in the city. Non- compliance with wearing masks is just pervasive so and so that's just a basic thing, and that has to do with behavior. I do not know how you do that and I'm not saying that testing is not important, but I think fundamentally, I'm getting more people to wear masks would help a lot. Thirdly, before we do. Thirdly, John, I'm just going to come back to you in a second on that miss shads. I want to be cognizant of your time and if you need to drop off, feel free to drop off and John. I do not know how many total points you have to raise, but if you could, if you can, if you can cover the rest in the next like minute or so, then that would be good that, whether it's the health department or it's emergency management or any of the city departments, it all comes down to money. So if we talk about well, you know if we can reach out and pay people to go, get a test in this crisis. I will just tell you: that's not going to be possible because the budget is already bust with the city, so we have to think about this thing in an anticipate. Then a Monday morning. Quarterback, that's my point. Thank you. Did you want to respond? Yes, I just you know in terms of thank you for your comments. You know I'm always happy when joining these hearing, you know feedback just so we can have a two- way. Conversation between you know the opinions and the thoughts and concerns that are happening within the community and bringing it back to our team that you know, does the guidelines, policy and all the all of that work. So for that and in terms of compliance, as I mentioned before, you know we're trying to get people to follow the core for as much as possible. You know staying home if you're, sick wearing a face covering social distancing and you know getting tested washing hands with soap and water using hand sanitizer. So you know we have a lot of graphics that you can share on social media and there are the posters and flyers that we can mail that you can help us spread out in the community for people to post it. As a reminder, you know this has have been a long time in the pandemic. There is a bit of a fatigue of being hearing the same message and maybe just dropping off on compliance, but you know happy to push that core for messaging over and over and over again, so you know visit our website for all the guidance for the you know anything that you need us to mail and any questions that come up please feel free to follow up directly through via email with me or tashamadi who's. Your representative, thank you very much. Mrs greatly appreciate that. Thank you for having me guys. Thank you all right, I'm going to move along to the next item on the agenda at the at the before we do that. I just wanted to give Miss church the opportunity to introduce herself, because I'm sorry, I did not acknowledge her once again earlier in the meeting. I'm sorry hi everyone, I'm Carol, Ann Church, I'm the assistant, district manager and staffing this meeting tonight, also not on screen, is Taya Mueller who's running the webex. Thank you, Carol Anne. Thank you. Thank you. Teo. Also, all right! Next up on the agenda, we've got our liquor licenses. The first new on premise tonight is 57 Front street E, M Dumbo M Dumbo. Do we have somebody here from that location hi? My name is Frank Colo hi Frank. How are you guys just going to I'm just going to ask him for everybody here for a liquor license if you're, if you're presenting your application, then please do not present the signature portion of your application. We try to avoid that. As a committee. Do you want to know what you want? How are you on? I saw my clients, that's signed in Patrick, I'm here. How are you good? Do you have a pdf to share with us? Are you able to share your screen? I can't share my screen. I emailed it to the community, but I thought you guys all got it. Okay, sorry, I'm actually on vacation. We do. We do have it, but we generally prefer for the applicant to run the presentation. That's either Mr, Ing or who else either of you have the presentation? No okay. I can do it. Thank you guys, I'm working with a an ipad, so I can't do that. Thanks, caroline, I have the materials, but thank you caroline excuse me taya. Can you give me sharing privileges? Thank you just give me one second mister, my screen, not quite yet Mr Pillow. If you want to start talking about your application, I think that that's probably fine we'll be able to present it shortly. That's great patrick! You want to give a brief overview of what we have in mind there. So we're opening a vietnamese restaurant. It's a mystery. One howard is one of the partners there we're doing vietnamese food. My wife is the chef you can continue. Miss church. We can see your screen now yeah. It looks funny so we're requesting a full liquor license. We have a lot of inventive cocktails that we had in mind our previous restaurant. Let's get on the New York Times top cheap vice 2018 for our smoothies. So we were thinking we were going to do some really interesting smoothies. Well, our restaurant hours will be 11 A.M to 9:00 pm Monday through Thursday Friday and Saturday 11 A.M to 10 P.M and Sunday 11 A.M to 10 P.M background music. Only excellent. It looks like there's an outdoor area from the application. What is the outdoor area? Is it within the property right name the sidewalk cafe? What is that? Actually one? Second outdoor area we figured when we were filling out the form we were doing outdoor dining because of the city's program, but under pre- covet there was no outdoor space right and the plants do not show in outdoor space. So, okay, all right questions from members of the committee. When do you anticipate opening and how many folks do you plan to hire? We hope to open next month we're waiting for a national grid to come in to increase our gas line? Hopefully you will be able to hire about 10 to 15 people, depending on how many how much the city is allowing for under dining Mr Varela. Do you want to now to put you on the spot but give the Spiel on the hiring just the one that I would give to every applicant here and I'll remind as it pops up is that our highest concentrations of unemployment are in black and brown areas of CB2, and so it would be great if you hired brown and black people, and not just in the kitchen but in front of house too sure that has no. That has no bearing any other questions from members of the committee. Any questions from members of the public for this application. Okay, not here, I'm not seeing any. Thank you very much. Mr Smith Miss Emily on Ado has her hand raised. Oh sorry, emily do you want to ask your question? Sorry? That was an accident. I just had not put my hand down yet my arm is so tired, I'm going to put it down now. Sorry, that's fine too. All right with no further questions. Does anyone on the committee want to make a motion in regards to this application? I make a motion. Is your motion to approve Victor Second by Barry Discussion on the motion was it was? Did someone ask about residents like private residence? I missed that. That's the first question that Jessica asked. I think so. Oh no, I did not ask about that whether they were nearby residential yeah is there a residential building? Is there do they have any neighbors across the street either side Patrick Howard the building is residential upstairs across the street. Is a construction site? Have you all spoken with the neighbors upstairs? Yes, okay, there been any concerns expressed. No this project started actually pre- covered and took hope. We took basically the spring and the summer off and we're back into it. So the neighbors are well aware of our presence, any other. Further discussions. Hearing none I'll take the members of the committee's vote at this point: Mr Newmark. How do you vote favor, Miss Thunderstone in favor, okay, Mr, Harrison, yes, okay, Miss, mcknight, okay and Mr Andrews approve great, I think, that's everybody this evening. I also vote to approve so unanimous. Thank you very much. Next item on the agenda. 673 Atlantic avenue the Simpson restaurant. Do we have someone here from that location me, sorry? Who would that be frank? Yes, Patrick, yes, introduce yourself Sir, I'm sorry! I did not get the question. No! You you're done Patrick! Oh okay! Thank you! Mr Lynn, before you get started, is this the same situation as before Mr Paulo, where we need to get the presentation up? Yes, okay, yes, but Mr was the last case. He had nothing to do with this case. Okay, that's fine! You can sign off. Okay got it ms church. Could I could I humor you again for helping us with presenting this application? Sure? Thank you. Sorry, Caroline! Okay! Frank enjoy! Yes, are you seeing this? No, we do not in the meantime, who else will be presenting this with Frank myself, wenford Simpson, hi winford, thanks hi people when you're, seeing to tell the folks a little bit about yourself, yeah, okay, guys! Thank you so much. It's definitely a pleasure being here. I hope everyone is safe and everyone is good just want to quickly introduce myself originally. I was born in Jamaica, but I live here in New York with my family, my mom, my dad lives in Florida. I fell in love with cooking from. I was probably around 10 and fell in love with cooking, basically out of poverty. So over time I was the executive chef for Bb kings, which is the 42nd also the executive chef for highline, ballroom and also simone hall. One of my passion is to always open my own restaurant, which I just did and trying to I'm all about great vibes, great energy, also great food. So my restaurant is mostly going to be soul. Food Caribbean, American they're not going to be any live music, probably only on occasion, if there's a private event or something that's going on, but most of the music will be from the house system. If I can interrupt you for a second patrick, the hours of operation are Monday through Thursday 11 A.M, until midnight, Friday and Saturday 11 A.M to 1 A.M and Sunday from 10 A.M to 10, P.M background music and occasional live music. The chef has for years now been catering, private events at different locations. For clients, so he does not tend to do a large amount of catering at this establishment, so there will be private parties and corporate events, and things like that did I say that correctly: yes, okay: what proximity would you have to any residential housing and the outdoor area again is referenced on here? Is there any outdoor area in the in the within the property line or a sidewalk cafe, or is this I just if that could be clarified yeah? I do not think there's any outdoor area. No, there is not at some point. We were looking into the possibility of a sidewalk cafe, but I do not think we've gotten a definitive answer on that. So about this application. There's no outdoors. Do you think that you could amend the application a little bit here with the hours to make it clear what is am and what is pm specifically for each one, because it just it seems like the word pm and Am is written in these different locations, and you want to make sure that that's clear. I thought it had open and close yeah, but it says you're implying 12 p.m. For example, for the close after each actual number, no that's right, yeah, that's my fault! That's dumb! All right! We can a minute I can set that to the off tomorrow. We will not be closing at noon. Okay, we'll fix that and I'll send it to you tomorrow. Are there any residents that live above or adjacent across the street? Yes, there are residents that live above and there's a condominium. There's a condominium, that's going up across the street, so yes, there will also be resident across okay, I'm not so concerned with across the street. This is Atlantic Avenue, so there's probably going to be a lot of traffic, but the folks who are up above have you spoken with them and have they expressed any concerns to you. Yes, I've spoken to a few of them. Few of them was not there because of social justice and so forth, but no, they did not have any concern and I also had a board. I met with them over zoom with quite a few of them and met a few of them in person as well. Okay- and I guess from the understanding Mr Palillo gave you're going to be having kind of gatherings or private events in this space. Well, I do away from it away from it being a restaurant with also a sport bar theme every now and then I'll have somebody who they have a little birthday party or a baby shower, or something like that. So if someone want the dining room for a private event to celebrate a birthday party, nothing with live music or anything like that. Okay, so that's it! It's not like you're opening this just for special events. This is you would you would do that if you, if there was a request for it, I understand yeah. Okay, any other questions to members of the committee. Yes, I have yeah Mr Terry. May I go ahead, Mr Newmark! Thank you! Mr Smith. I have a question. I'm not sure this is the correct application. I apologize if I'm wrong. When I was reading the applications. The other day. Are you guys planning to have security at your location? Well, yes, for a reason of just to make sure that everyone remains safe, so security will be there on particular nights, just in short safety for all the g, all the customers that comes in. So if there's ever a situation, there'll be someone there to handle it and make sure everything is okay. Thank you. I just I'm just curious. I know your occupancy, if I recall correctly, is a few hundred people potentially at a time maximum occupancy. Yes, so how did you arrive at one or two security people for several hundred people? I'm just curious. How did you come to that? Well, because of because of the way in which the room is set up, the room is set up in different sections, so you have the dining room section where it's more succeeding, and then you also have the bar where the base center, you have the left and the right. So it's it's based on how it is set up from the dining room side to the bar side, and just you basically need to either one or two security there on any given night. Just to make sure everything is okay and then it's a dining room environment. It's not like a nightclub or anything where people are dancing and getting crazy and start a fight or anything it's more. It's mostly coming in to dine another drink or they come to eat some dinner or celebrate a little get together. That's the kind of environment. It is. Okay. Have you and my last question? I appreciate your answer so far. Have you had experience in any of the other establishments? You've worked in where having some security present was helpful. Yes, as I said, I was the executive chef of Bb kings and, as you know, Bb kings of 46th street. We hold 1100 standing and we always have multiple security and also for seating and dining. We see it's 500 and we also have security, so I'm very familiar with the security environment and how to conduct how to approach a customer if they're intoxicated if they have too much to drink. If there's a situation, I know how to I'm also a manager. I've been a manager for many years, so I definitely know how to defuse a situation. Thank you very much. Mr Simpson. I appreciate you if I can add something to what the chef just said. Security and soundproofing go hand in hand. This is a residential building overhead. The last thing he wants to do is be a listen to his neighbors. The premises are soundproofed, we're going to add to this existing soundproofing and the security was basically we do not expect and you usually do not put security in a restaurant because of the size and the residential nature of the building. He thought it was the idea to have security. There yeah one of the reasons just also had I've cooked for over 400 celebrities here in New York. So a lot of celebrity is going to be at the restaurant so for their safety and also for the customers. If the celebrities inside say Jcr beyond Cr and one of them come to dine, we just want to ensure that everyone is safe, while they're there in the restaurant Mr Chair. Thank you very much. Are there any other questions from the committee? Is that the chair, Mr Andrews question Mr Simpson? Do you guys have accessible bathrooms on the first floor? How is that going to work? I'm sorry, I did not hear. Can you repeat, are there any accessible bathrooms on the first floor? Yes, they are there's a male and female and also undercat bathroom available, and all this is on the first floor. Correct, yes, all is on the first floor with a ramp with a ramp that goes right up to the dining room here and what about coming in? What about coming in coming in yes, there's it's it's one floor, so there's a ram to come in where you get there and from there there's a ramp to take you right to your table or if you want to go to the bathroom, there's a ramp to take you wherever you want to go within the vicinity. Oh okay, thanks Mr, Simpson appreciate it you're most welcome any other questions from members of the community varela. Just did you say how many people you expect to employ anywhere from 25 to 30., and it's just to clarify this is directly across from barclays. This is the place that was not too long ago. This may be more for my fellow committee members in the last year and a half or so that came in not this applicant, for it was Vegan a Vegan restaurant. Does that ring a bell? Is it the same space? No, it's not directly across it's just up the block like a little bit of the block. Of course, yeah across from the barclays is the best buy and and the chaperone the shop right stop and shop. I am just that's where Atlantic Social used to be right, yeah. Thank you, okay! Thank you very much, you're most welcome. Thank you, members of the public or any there any questions for the applicant, not seeing any trying to double check my raised hand feature no okay. Thank you very much. Does anybody want to make a motion? I do Mr Chair Movement Mr Harrison. We have a second by Mr Andrews discussion on the motion. Hearing, none I'll take everybody's vote, Mr Andrews. How do you vote? Yes, Mr Newmark? Yes, Mr Harrison, yes, Mr Varela, yes, Thurston! Yes, miss mcknight, yes, and I also vote yes, okay. Thank you very much. So most definitely one last one last thing: I would love to have something that I do. I do a lot with the community where I go around to schools and colleges and speak to kids about staying in school and focus on their education. I'm presently in the process of opening a culinary school is my way of giving back to Jamaica and just try to help out some of the youths on the streets. So one thing that every now and then you'll see if I'm at the restaurant I'll have cooking classes where I take kids, who want to learn how to cook and I'll, have them in a restaurant to teach them how to cook and so forth. That's my way of trying to keep them on track, so they can stay focused you go on. My social media you'll see me with a lot of kids at the school stuff. That's my way of giving back. Oh, I applaud you Mr Simpson. Thank you very much. We really might enjoyed your presentation and look forward to having you in our community. Thank you. So much greatly appreciate it all right. Next, up on the agenda tonight, we have 121 bridge park, drive Brooklyn, bridge Park, Cafe Inc Hi. How are you hi good evening good evening? I hope everyone's having a good night. My name is Beatrice Martinez and I am the owner of Bbb Cafe. Yes, I'm Anthony Carabell of a representative. This is for an on- premises. Liquor license in Brooklyn bridge park, Pier six, the corporate name is Bbp cafe the dba is Iris cafe. The hours of operation will be 7 A.M to 10 P.M seven days. There is seating for 50 inside with 13 tables, there's outside seasonal seating for a patio. It's right off the water on Brooklyn bridge park, there's seating for 32 with eight tables background music. Only there will be nine employees and we'd be thrilled to address any questions the committee might have. Thank you. Thank you. Mr Carabao questions from the committee and thank you Caroline for putting that up. That's taya! Thank you, ted. What about accessible bathroom? I have to ask that question again. I'm sorry but yeah there's an accessible bathroom. It's a one- level premises! If you can see from the diagram and the bathroom is accessible to patrons that they do have a bathroom accessible, meaningful wheelchairs, am I correct yeah beatrice this is being built to code, so it has to be handicap accessible, correct. What is the outdoor area at this location? So there's some seating in front which you'd have a view of the water and it's not in the jurisdiction of sidewalk Cafe. I think this is Brooklyn bridge park property, so they have the consent of the landlord to put some tables out there on a seasonal basis. It's part of the ambiance over there to be right off the water yeah. I have a question Mr Caraballo and Miss Martinez. Can you explain where you're actually located in Brooklyn bridge park? I had a horse, I'm trying to figure that out? Yes, so it's essentially, if you go down Atlantic you go down all the way down Atlantic. As far as you can go, you make the Columbia. You make a right and then you make the first left and then you walk all the way down. As far as you can go and there's retail space there, it's quite beautiful the view is phenomenal as soon as you make the right at the end, they're right on that corner this retail space, it's new- it's been recently developed and then you make the right and it takes you all the way into Brooklyn bridge park. The pier there's, a dog walk. There's a lot of fields. There there's an ice cream shop down the road as the marina. If that will familiarize you, okay, I got it. I think thanks a lot. Mr Caraballo you're very welcome, sir any other Mr. Yes, Mr Chair. I have a question for Anthony hi John, okay, so I was actually going to ask this to the last applicant. It might be more applicable here. I do not know that it's ethical at all, but rightfully often Mr Andrews is asking the questions about handy handicap, accessibility, I'm wondering anthony. What would your client know if someone came in? Who was blind and wanted to order? Is there? Is there going to be a menu available in Braille, or is there some other someone who wants to know the menu and they can't read it yeah I'll, pass this off to you beatrice you can address that question. Yes, we're going to have a host on staff that could help out our customers if they need any assistance with the menu for waitrose. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions from members of the committee. Just one, do you anticipate opening trust? You got a couple of months of renovations right in construction, we're looking end of January, so we're hopeful and I get delayed in the department of buildings, but that's the projected opening so you're looking at about two to three months right. Thank you! Mr Varela! I was just curious. I heard earlier someone's referred to this as seasonal is it'll be and they will make every effort to hire locally. Yes, I'm sure. Thank you very much all right. I can't. If it comes back to me, I will thank you. You're welcome. Thank you all right. Thank you. It came back to me. He came back to me. It's a residential building. So do the signatures include people from the building? Have you heard anything so here's the thing you know I appear before you guys for many years. I generally bring sufficient amount of petitions, but with Covid-19 we did not. We did not embark to get signatures due to the pandemic and they really have not they're just getting possession of the premises now, but they're more than willing to meet with residents in conjunction with the landlord. If there is any kind of tenants, Association directly on top of them, Alejandro there's only two stories which is like lost residential, which is not fully occupied. But if you go down the block there are residential units, but they would make every effort to meet with them when they're on site and they're actually beginning the project. I think, maybe just because in the last few meetings or this year, we've had a few meetings where people have come back and complained about residents. Who've just complained about noise about business owners, restaurant owners, hotel owners who are just not they're, not trying to respect their neighbors. I do not. I do not mean to assume it's Martinez that you would be one of those people. I it's just it's much harder to have these conversations after the fact. After there's a license, and my I just my encouragement would be that if you do encounter neighbors who have concerns that you'll meet them where they're at with those concerns. I agree. We usually we're a little encumbered now we're usually coming with petitions and we do the outreach they did. Do the appropriate and required posting. But you know what all the community about presentations I make. A lot of boards have suspended petition signatures and the outreach protocol due to the pandemic. Unfortunately yeah we do. We do not do that. We we've done the same thing, so we nothing will be held against you for that regard. Thank you and also alejandra. I just might add quickly if the closing time is 10 P.M and there's background music only. So I certainly understand your concerns, but I and there's nobody in the area of the water, so it's just it's the building behind them and on top and then it's open space and the New York harbor. So in terms of you know, quality of life for residents, I think that'll be minimal. Thank you. I appreciate that answer. Thank you. Any members of the public have any questions for this applicant. I'm not seeing any hands raised. Can I with that? Could I ask if any member of the committee has a motion chair? Second, okay, I've got a motion by Mr Andrews and a second was that Mr Harrison with the second. It was the opposite way, but that's fine. Okay, I I'll credit you Mr Harrison, with the motion and I'll credit you Mr Andrews with the second, if you're, both okay with that either way. That's what I'm going to do any discussion on the motion. Nope, okay, hearing, none I'll try to take everybody's vote. Maybe we'll go backwards! I vote yes, miss Mr Harrison, yes, Mr Andrews, yes, Mr Newmark, yes, Miss mcknight! Yes, Miss Thurston, yes, Mr Varela! Yes, I do not think I forgot anybody. My view keeps changing on me, which is why it's sometimes hard for me to figure this out great. It's unanimous. Thank you very much. Thank you, Anthony! Thank you. So much have a great night. Everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good night okey dokey next up next up on the agenda tonight is 229 Livingston street Jennifer Bistro. We have somebody here from that place. 229 Livingston jennifer Bistro, going once going twice. I do not see that application in the Google Drive, okay, maybe that got moved. I think I'm going off of an agenda, but nobody dated hello. Do you have access to your application? Are you able to present it? Yes, please, okay, my name is Shahzad Jennifer Bistro 229 Livingston street and we are applying for a full liquor license. The place is located in the commercial area. The building is commercial. There is no residential upstairs and our hour of operations are from 12 pm to 10 pm except sundays, which will be from 2 P.M to till 10 pm. Okay, questions from members of the committee: yes, Mrs, Mr Harrison. What are the cross streets? The Cro, the corner is the corner of ellen place and Livingston street. So it's so anwar. It's on the it's on the north side of Livingston. Yes, it's the north side of Livingston. Yes, you know exactly where this is. Thank you, Mr Chair, any other kind of establishment will this be this is a restaurant or can you tell us anything about it? It's going to be finger foods and the liquor and the background music, okay, Mr Chair. Can I ask a question: Mr Chair go ahead, Mr Andrews? What about accessible bathrooms? What about that? Sir? Yes, we have the male and female bathrooms and we have their handicap accessible and we do have an elevator for them too, as well. Okay, got it! What I'm worried it's an elevator did not you say first floor, it's a! It is the first floor, but it's like there are two couple of steps down, so we made it to accommodate the handicap. Yep. Okay, any other questions from the committee. When do you anticipate opening three to four months, because we are waiting for all this coverage and everything you know we're just taking our time? Okay, any questions from members of the public on this application. I have a question Brandon. Oh sorry, I have trouble scrolling. I did not see you go ahead. Okay, did I miss something, we're just not seeing this application or am I remiss and I did not. I have not seen this application right or I'm missing it. I did not see it in the Google Drive and I do not. I did not come up on the screen, it's definitely on the agenda and I think it was just and I think it was just presented. I also did not see it in what was just emailed over. Do we do we get email copies of this Miss church unless I missed it, no, I did not okay, so I mean it was a good description, it's just hard, because I I'm so used to seeing the actual questions and answers one more time. Oh, we will need to have the packet. I need the packet right is it? Does the board office have one? No okay? Oh so, okay number one number two, although I believe number one might lead to a little bit more discussion. Number two Mr Shazad. How many people do you expect to employ? That's for the customers, yeah employees, total employees- I mean about 10 about 10., okay, I have a question: what is the size, the capacity, how many seats tables about 55 to 60 people we are thinking of accommodating because of this coverage situation we want to have the proper distance, so, okay, Mr Shahzad, are you able to email a copy of the application to our board office? Definitely I'll do that. I did send the email, but you know which was I received, and we had the confirmation for that. But I'll do that again. I did a bit like, maybe about seven, eight days back. Okay, I apologize, but I not see it. I do not have it Mr Zod. Do you have access to the application on your computer? Now, if you like, we could share your screen. Okay, maybe I can ask my son at the moment: can you do that? Maybe yeah? Maybe my son will help me: would you agree a minute or so please yeah, okay, I'm going to ask you to yeah I'm going to we're, I'm going to suggest we move on and just cover the next item on the agenda and we'll come back to you in a second while you figure that out. It looks like the next item on our agenda. Is 690 Fulton, Street Broccoli bar? Do you have anybody here from that location, 690, Fulton, Street, Broccoli Bar, going once going twice: okay, Nighty Furman, Street Meadow! Oh, no! That's a renewal, that's a renewal! So I think we just need to complete this. This presentation here with this application and we can take a vote so just to clarify 224, green and 275 park- were laid over correct. Okay. Yes, if we do not have this application, Mr, Smith or Mrs Church, what do you recommend that we do? He can just send it on just what he says about the opening hours needs to match. What's in the thing, Mr Chair, let's see Mr Harrison yeah, while we're waiting for our son to enable the site of the application. Can we ask a question of anwar sure? Okay, thanks so Anwar, you said that it was about 50 persons who you would be accommodating there right. Yes right and I heard you say, finger food and drinks, yes right. So while we're waiting to see the application and I'm sorry if it was sent- and I did not review it- but it sounds like maybe people that others did not see it is this. Is this then, so I'm trying to get an idea in my mind how this works? Is it kind of a kind of a stand- up situation where people are sort of schmoozing and there's kind of an area not a buffet but maybe sort of approaching that where they would go at the finger, food and they'd get them from a bar and there'd be seats but they're sort of or is it more formal, sit- down kind of a thing or no? I was just trying to say that it's not going to be a full cooking restaurant. You know we won't be serving food like hot food, preparing the food and then serving it. You know so. Finger foods comes in lots of varieties. You know it's right, it's not something that you know we are going to like. We have a buffet system or stuff like that right. So it's a sit down situation. Yes, sir. Yes, thank you. Okay, Mr Shazad. I want to kind of expedite this, and maybe we do not need to have the presentation. If we can just figure out a few critical details. Can you just remind us again what are going to be the hours and confirm if there are going to be any outdoor and indoor or confirm if there's going to be any outdoor? No outdoor the hour of operation are from 12 P.M till 10 P.M Monday through Saturday and Sunday it will be short hours from 2 P.M till 10. P.M yeah right could be any music played background. Music, only background music, only okay and as if the screen is if they could see the screen. If you can see the screen, maybe we can. I do not know. If you are, you guys be able to like skip right now. Yes, yeah we can. We can see that yeah. If you want to keep flipping through, that would be fine. All right, hey keep going, keep going! Okay! Stop there for a second! Everybody can see the hours yes they're inconsistent, though the these hours here say: 12 P.M to 11, P.M, Friday and Saturday, and then Sunday 2 P.M to 11 P.M. Could you please clarify which is correct and either amend the application to match what you said or restate what you said: okay Sunday, we open from P.M till 10 P.M sure, but it looks like it that your application says 11 P.M unless I'm just misreading your handwriting Jessica you're right. It's not consistent, but 2 P.M to it says: 2 P.M to 10 P.M on Sunday, okay, that looked like it's just two: it's just to 11 P.M on Friday Saturday, as you indicated, so you had previously said: 10 P.M on Friday and Saturday. So can you just be clear about what are your hours for Friday and Saturday? Please Fridays from 12 P.M till 11, Pm and Saturday is going to be 12, P.M till 11 pm, okay and keep going. If, if you can, thank you, okay, stop for a second, so it says that you managed a similar business. What was the, what was the other business that you managed and were there were there any complaints or concerns expressed about noise at the prior business that you operated? I have the multiple experience I used to manage sit in restaurants, the fast food places. You know miscellaneous experience, you can say like Burgers, Breakfast, American, Breakfast hot dog place, okay, so at any, so how many other businesses have you? Have you owned or managed previously about maybe four or five? You know, okay in the course of like 20 to 30 years, we're talking about it. Have you have you had any issues with community members expressing concern about noise or any other issues related to your businesses? Never okay, Brandon yeah, omar! Yes, Sir on your application. It says I I'm seeing delight 7 incorporated 472 fulton is that the hot dog place that was on fulton between yes Sir? Yes, Sir, it was okay. Thank you! Yes, sir. Okay, can you keep scrolling? Okay, all right description? Okay, keep going great! Thank you very much any other questions from members of the committee. No Mr Tim any questions from members of the public hearing. None any does anyone wish to make a motion. I do Mr Chair wholeheartedly endorse approval, sir, a second. Anyone want a second. This motion. Second, miss mcknight, no motion, Mr, Harrison, Second, Miss, Knight Discussion on the motion, all right hearing, none we'll do the vote. Mr Varela, yes, Mr, Newmark, yes, Miss, Thurston, Alex, Stain, Mr, Harrison, come back to Mr, Harrison Miss Mcknight, yes, Mr, Andrews Victor. I vote in favor. I think, if you put Mr Harrison and Miss Mr Andrews down for an abstention, then motion still carries. We have four zero. Three yep, okay, wait! One two: three! That's the clarification! Mr Harrison made the motion, so there would not be an assumption that he would approve. He has to actually vote. Okay, all right. Moving on along next on our agenda is the renewals for, for this go round. We got knighty Fuhrman Street, Meadow, Roo, 37, Washington, Avenue, Ill, Porto, 60 water street, odd, fellows and 925 fulton Hanson dry as church. Any concerns expressed by members of the community with these with these locations there have been no concerns. Anybody on the committee have any concerns about these locations. Nope any members of the public have any concerns about these renewals. Okay, hearing none I'll entertain a motion with regard to the renewals. All right, I got a motion, I'm going to call that a motion from Mr Andrews, oh seconded, by Mr, Newmark, okay, great any discussion on this hearing: none Mr Varela, yes, Mr Newmark, yes, Ms, Thurston, Miss, Mcknight, yes, Mr, Andrews, yes, and I also vote yes, I think Mr Harrison has departed, so we can put him down for having left the meeting at this point. Okay, next up on the agenda after Renewals Chairperson's report. In light of our extremely long meeting last month, I'm going to waive my chairperson's report tonight I'll make it up next month. I want to get everybody out the door somewhat early, but respect everybody's right to their portion of this other business any other business to raise. I wanted to bring up quickly that last meeting the all that business with the dazzler. Is it the dazzler? The hotel, with the issues of the sound it was formally called the message. Now. It's called the tillery yeah, the hillary right, we sort of alluded, or I might have alluded to the fact that this should I mean I would like to see it formalize. What we learned from that process, not just for our own meaning's sake, but also be for as a formal suggestion to the what's the committee that land use, who sees designs earlier in earlier stages and can pass along this sort of information. Specifically around and people jump in to correct me around where outside terraces and entertainment areas are relatively, I'm sure it's not as simple as this, but you're talking about transportation right, because transportation does the sidewalk cafes or because I do not think land use and also, I think it's important to recognize. With this location, it was a it was within the property line, so it would not. I think that this is the only committee that they hit so yeah and I would not want to do it brandon as a requirement merely just as like. Maybe I do not know like a sort of a good neighborly policy, the sort of the larger buildings- and I do not know if that hotel qualified as one I do not remember when it was being built if any of the plans came through land use, but if it does, if that sort of suggestion could be made in the early stages, the designers, one of the architects who was from the community- and maybe someone else had said you know, this could have just as easily been on the other side not facing a residential area, and it would have been just expected easier said than done. So that's what I mean by maybe we can pass along this information and see if land use would be receptive to it. No, that's a it's. Not that definitely is an idea. I can touch base with Mr Gordon and see that I'll touch base with Mr Gordon between this meeting and the next meeting and see the degree to which he thinks there might be some overlap in these kind of circumstances, and you know like any comment, you make alejandra really any comment. Anyone on the committee makes I'll make sure that we follow up with this to try to get to the to the to a point of learning. I mean I think about that, and I want to belong the issue too much, but I think that there are a lot of things we can think about from this experience, which is be cognizant with hotels. You know, hotels, change management, you know, there's a risk with hotels, be cognizant with the with be aware when any applicant comes in, because, just as they told us when they came in the original application that they did not have any exposure to neighbors or anyone near us, it's on us to make sure that we keep track of where properties are located and call folks out when they, when they raise things, although we do not expect people to misrepresent things to us so that that's part of it too, but it's there's definitely a number of things to learn from that process along those along those lines. Brandon I've often wondered I'm remiss. We used to have a committee member who did this, who would go and visit the locations. Although he knew the district like the back of his hand, Mr Lazavecki, but it I've often wondered if we should not just check in and break up the agenda and be like okay who lives near this one who has seen it because even areas that I'm not even if I can picture the corner- and I can see it on a map- I can't always. I can't always speak to what the surrounding neighborhood is like and how you know. So maybe we should do a bit more to inform ourselves when we're not super familiar with the space. Maybe that's something that we I mean. I do not want to create a rule for what our committee can do, but I think maybe that's something we can talk about and we can think about when we get hotels that come before us, particularly perhaps there's also just a way that we elevate hotels specifically and ask them to come before either us or the executive committee. I only say that, because Caroline can speak to this much better, but I do not actually know that this would have gone to land use in any sort of detailed way. So maybe there's a way that we could talk to Lenny or just discuss this at our next executive committee meeting and just say: how can we put the word out that if there's a hotel, we, you know really strongly encourage them to come at least before the executive committee and ideally to us and to land use or wherever we think is appropriate, so that we're at least part of that conversation, even if not in a formal way, Mr Chair, Mr Harrison did not vote, but he got cut off. I do not know if you saw that. No, I see the comment we can put Mr Harrison down for a yes for the for the item where he moved to approve it. I believe his comment is sufficient to indicate his intent. Did anybody else? Have any other comments from the committee on Mr Varela's thoughts as well as the lessons learned from the I mean I guess Mr chair, we have to stay on top when they say management we get. I guess- and I thought Tanya was the one who was going around to visit mother. That's what she told me when I saw her. I think it was sometime last week she said she goes around to most of the restaurants and visits them and stuff, like that. That's great! It's great! It's great! That people do that, there's also Google maps, so you can you can look it up over there too. The I think, unless, as anybody has any other comments on this I'll, take that question up regarding the land use I'll, think about that more on the on the executive committee. I kind of feel there's an expectation that work is done at the committee level and that we're fundamentally more responsible for that, but I I'd be open to having any further conversation about that, and I I'm definitely going to think about it more too. So I, if I may, I think it has to be more of a conversation about what the committee would like, because this building this hotel might have been as of right, so the community board would have had absolutely no contact with them until they came with their liquor license. So it requires a lot of thought about what we'd like to have and how can we get it right? You know, because if it's, if it's not a ulab application or BSA they're, not asking anything for us all right, so that's true, that's true! We'd have to create a process right if I may just drop. One quick comment on this is that the complaints have continued from the neighborhood so meeting since our last meeting yeah. The events have continued so, but to be fair guys, she did say that she had a bunch of events already booked and my main concern is if she already paid these people and they cancelled the whoever entertainment is you're not going to get your money back. So that's not going to catch 22 on that. That's true they're stuck in that, but they booked those events. Let's go back the truck up a little bit more. They booked those events after having already agreed not to hold the noisy events outside so yeah. They kind of dug that for themselves and just to not like relitigate that conversation Carol Anne, have you heard complaints after the 26th, which is when I think they said, was the last day that they would hold events. That's a good point, so that would have been in the last week. No, there have been no. There were no complaints. Last week. Okay, not to you know I mean the other. Is complaints are completely valid, but we did probably expect that through the 26th all right, any other comments on the on this issue with the tillery. This is not the end of this conversation. I think you know, obviously we're going to need to stay on top of it. Okay, moving right along next up on our agenda, is community forum and does anyone from the public who's attended? The meeting and still remains here in our virtual room, would want to speak Mr Beasley Mr Beasley. Did you want to speak? I did hello. Okay, just before you before you before you speak, I just want to let you know we try. We try to ask folks to keep their comments within about two minutes. So please try to do that. Thank you. Absolutely well, hello. Public service warriors of Community Board 2., I'm Stephan, Anthony Beasley, I'm the community for New, York, presbyterian, Brooklyn, methodist hospital, but really across the city which we're made up of 10 hospital campuses about 3.4 million visitors a year. I do not know why my camera just turned off we here in Brooklyn, specifically, though we have 6,500 residents or more who are employed. I have our inpatient discharges from nyp in Brooklyn, it's about 36,000 and in my per 300 community events that are that happen in person and virtually even before cover 19 that reach about 10,000 folks. We are just here tonight to just do a quick update just to remind you all that we're here not only at the corner of 7Th, Avenue and 6Th street at our main hospital location, but also in about three dozen medical group offices, with dozens and dozens of specialties and clinicians who are just excited and waiting to help you, the nearest one to CB2 would probably be our location right behind barclays at 38 6th Avenue. I believe it's 38, forgive me if it's not and in February of 2021 we're going to be offering a number of services in cardiology, orthopedics, gastroenterology cancer services, radiology services and women's health in a 400 square feet center for community health that will be opening on the corner of it will take up most of the block of street between 7th and 8th avenues. Just a little bit more about. We do about. 30 percent of all our patients have Medicaid. 35 have Medicare. If you should find yourself in a situation to the hospital, have hospital services that and either you're uninsured or even your insurance with the copay can't afford you can apply for a financial aid and that's for individuals and families that earn up to 600 percent of the federal poverty line. I am so sorry about this video situation, so in case you maybe have an existing bill or anything like that. There's the number is zero. One and 866- 252- 0101 leave that as well as a link in our chat and for two of our upcoming virtual events. I'll leave links there's one on neck pain, which I'm actually preparing for for tomorrow morning. I'll leave the registration link and there is that's in partnership with good neighbors at park, slope and heights and hills. But you do not have to be a senior to come to that and then our very next lecture after that is going to be on diabetes, education and awareness as part of a few months of virtual programming that we've done with the Brooklyn public library. So again, nyp.org Brooklyn for all of your needs, and you know we're here to serve you and to do our best to you know to make amazing things happen for new yorkers when they need care, and so that's really. It hope I've made my two minutes and I'll leave those registration links in the chat. Okay, thank you very much steph and that we're really grateful for you to come and speak to us and I'd love to hear more about your organization and the work at the hospital in the future. I think you know it'd be great to have you at another meeting at some point and maybe get you a little bit earlier on in the agenda. Yeah, no problem, I understand what I understand what happened with tonight and I would not be interested in coming back next month, because we have a just some discussions that we're going to do around racial equity in association with some local electeds, and so when we get those dates finalized.
