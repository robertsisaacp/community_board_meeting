What are the makeup of our respective community boards, and so the executive committee should have received a survey that gustavo put together to help us get to know each other and better understand the makeup of the skill.
So first I'd like to thank the executive committee for taking the time to fill the survey, and you know thank you, everyone for having a full response.
Some are education, some are affordable, housing and some topics reflect the current situation we are facing and in terms of next steps, I would like the the executive committee to you, know, move into allowing the full board to answer this survey and kind of reflect the different diversities of the committee of the board.
We need to talk about how we can get this information to the executive committee only because I personally believe that some of the results are very insightful.
Let me just pause and ask if there are any members, any board members executive, committee, members who have questions, could we look at the second page again?
Is: It gives a chance to really look at the composition of the exec committee and the board and maybe, in some cases, help to facilitate the type of interest that people have maybe a way to engage in the type of questioning that would lend to other projects that we want the office to take part of, but I think right now for me just to kind of get the ball rolling so to speak.
Looking forward to what this could, what kind of insight we get when we open this up to the general body, so in line with what we have on the agenda, because the scott gustavo's report was going to be part of the chairperson's report, so that took one less item off of my topic.
We also discussed our statement of district needs, which we had previously discussed the month prior as a follow-up to that there were a couple questions about certain new york, city, transit, authority, capital requests that were on the prior year, but not the most recent year of budget priorities and caroline suggested that, because the mta is not a city agency that those had been removed.
We also had a couple of other ADA improvements on certain stations, identified, so I guess that would be a question for maybe for rob or for lenny about just protocol A decision was made prior to the previous year's submission, based on the responses we had received in the past, as well as the follow-up with new york city transit.
So I'm, not quite sure, if there's been a lull in the communication about the project, I'm, not sure if there are meetings taking place, And we're just not being updated, but we're experiencing the same thing as the committee, and so with that.
We also heard from generation vote, which not only helps to register young people in places that they are such as in parks and outside, but they work on, such as in certain type of elections to to lower the voting age, and they describe some of the recent problems that, during the cohort time that students who were registered in let's say some of the state universities who had to go home.
: Let's move on to item number six new business, fiscal, year, 2022, statement of community district needs and register of budget priorities.
A couple of things I want to just mention in consistence with the presentation that was given by taya during the last general body meeting and then the presentation that was given today by gustavo and some of the things that I know rob and the rest of the office is working.
Is that we're trying to take a different perspective for the information and the way we communicate and the transparency coming out of the district, office.
What I like to do is ask each of you that at your next committee, meetings, advise all of your members, both board members and public members, and maybe anyone who's in the sound of your voice.
That I've instructed the board office to not just accept and work on, requests that are coming out of many different avenues.
We actually worked on the district needs and we sent that into the office to be actually presented to the exec committee and that came through my secretary.
I want to cover is we have representation on the board for people who represent the general body in the entire office for different committees such as atlantic yards 80, Flatbush?
What I need to ask is that each of you who do represent a committee or represent the community board on a committee that you submit a report.
If you went to the participant list, the only names that you would see were the people from DOT, so community members were unable to know what other community members had joined the briefing they also D.O.T seemed to be ignorant of the fact that ps8 plans to hold outdoor classes relatively close to where this work is going to be going on, including some jackhammering and community members, use that to push for this request to have a bqe task, force, something that juliette mentioned.
So I recognize what several people have said this evening, that it's been a long time since the community, the community board and the committee have received an update on the triple cantilever and that fact is true.
I just wanted to know how it would be used by the executive committee or the board in general, and also the quest itself.
Another thing I want to mention is we're coming close to the point in the year where we need to have a nominating committee where we need to go through our voting process, and so what I've asked the office to do was reach out to mr quint, who has served as our chairperson of the nominating committee and to mr smith, who served as the co-chair for the nominating committee in the past, as well as some a mixture of some existing and new board members, and so we're convening that committee.
That would allow us to have an interactive and engaging way of you know looking at consensus, as mr peres has laid out from the committee, and so you know we want to give a few more days to explore different options, but that potentially could be one way that we would be able to engage and look at a way to vote and make sure this consensus on the items and then still give us the platform to discuss and give feedback on the budget.
So is the whole board going to vote on this or just the executive committee.
Will request some support from the district office to be able to see how those items fit or not fit within what we've done in the past, I think we can offer that to help up, but once we get the feedback from your committee, then it becomes a question of how do we mesh it in to get it done to represent the entire community?
You know either the staff has been giving me too much of a overly positive report, but I'm I think that work has been done and what we need now is a path for putting the information that we have together and before either the full board or the executive committee as the board leadership sees fit and then taking one last look at it on at the October executive committee meeting.
What the day you have your committee meeting I need that into the board office.
The next day, but at least any conversation or topics that were discussed that are germaine to the ranking and the rankings have to be into the board office the next day to give us enough time to compile a list that we can share to the exec committee and be able to capture it that way.
I was going to ask the same thing because we aren't actually meeting before the October 26th executive, so I just wanted to make sure if it would be okay.
It was communicated to me from one of the board members that we should have some type of mechanism to encourage students to attend meetings, since it's virtual on webex that there should be a process so that teachers and other youth leaders could let young people know about our meetings so that they could attend.
Our committee does not want to be in the position of grading a report or analyzing it, because people come to meetings, maybe with different, essential questions or different things that they're looking at.
I, don't see a problem with maybe asking young people to advising them of our meetings asking them to participate if they would choose to do so, but I, don't see us as a committee, as a community board going any further than that, because we're not teaching the children.
That's going to come from the committee, because that's where the work needs to be done, and then we can discuss it through the district.
Your thoughts, are, I, would jot them down email them to the board office and copy me, and it will work through giving you know getting the right language to get out on your meeting notices, Anybody else, an executive committee with a other business Okay, great community So I, am not clear on who is from the community and to be consistent with what we've done in the past.
So just wanted to make a mention of those two things really grateful for this community board's commitment to continuing to do the important work in the midst of all this.
Raised, I did want to point out that back when you had to come to executive committee meetings in person.
