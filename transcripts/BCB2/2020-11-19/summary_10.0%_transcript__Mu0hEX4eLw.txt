Do you have any funds that the Parks Committee could have any influence in advocating for how they might be spent so welcome good evening, everyone, and thank you, community, Ward 2, for inviting me to this committee.
All five borough presidents actually receive five percent of the city's capital budget that can range anywhere in a given year from 30 million dollars upwards to 50 million dollars.
Given the state of things who knows what next year's budget is going to look like, but generally just before we get into Q&A, and is there any money left over.
I want to give you just a bird's eye view into what I do at Barrow Hall, and what that capital funding process looks like so I've been at Borough Hall for about eight years, now.
Seven or eight years, now, I'm working before I took over the capital budget portfolio last year in the programs department working with our development director on writing grants and then executing those programs in schools, senior, centers, any and everywhere in the borough which we're focused on cultural diversity, financial, education, things of that nature, so capital funding.
Our presidents receive five percent of the city's capital funding budget capital budget applications generally open in December and close in February non-profit organizations complete two applications.
You know accessing capital through the borough president or a non-profit.
Coming after education, 15 of the administration's application went to housing and third was parks, receiving 11 of the administration's capital allocation receiving roughly 42 million dollars in capital, projects.
He has, and also a lot of times what the community board hands over a list of projects and their funding.
If the community board wanted to also work with the borough, president I would say reach out to that managing agency.
This is the committee we're talking to have conversations with Marty Maher, because he would be the one to speak to the Bp to say we can move this project in this district, faster, than.
I'm, going to come back to you over four years at five hundred thousand dollars like this.
My question is: Marty may likely get more than 42 million dollars worth of requests that he puts before the borough.
I know the borough president likes to give 50 to schools.
So we're going to look at project cost, how much money do they have raised and the timeline, because again with one year left in office, you know it would make more sense to close up projects that are close to being.
Like I think you should fund this, and the president will either agree with Marty or agree.
He would say the community wants this, we're going to put it in there and try to raise the money and work with our partners in government with City Council to fund the project.
It depends like I know, like let's say, Prospect park, the perimeter restoration, that's a project that we've been funding since President Adam's first year in office, because again big project, we knew we weren't going to be able to allocate a big number in one year, so we allocate over the years.
Another part you know, requested 500,000 for turf and like we were able to solely fund that.
And, that's something that either the school or parks can apply for capital to turn that courtyard, which is usually just you, know, an open field into an actual playground that the community can access jointly operated parks.
Don't know that I even knew that there was funding in the borough president's office of this ilk.
We are cabin plaza users, mainly we live in Dumbo, so we oscillate between Brooklyn bridge park, which I know is a separate purview and cabin Plaza.
You may have seen him in the park, he's very good about I, think, cleaning and also weeding and all of that kind of thing.
You know a marker for us to be communicating with the borough president in some way and just after the new year to to line up support for some of our top initiatives, as makes sense for his conversation with Borough President Adams.
People could start to think about what are their top priorities, and you know I guess the other thing that Candice said: is.
No one knows what the budget's going to look like correct.
That would really need that, because Brooklyn bridge park, I, think, has an organizational structure in place for that.
Is this a larger initiative to find other park locations in our communities district that could benefit from having turf, relayed or if there are places that are completely concrete.
My colleagues would know better, but there is a there's a perspective on turf I feel like by the the borough.
The third was trust for public land and the fourth was Brooklyn bridge park, which we think would probably be better later in the spring and for February and March.
We were thinking that in March we could ask representatives from those parks, friends, groups to come and maybe do a bit of a Cd2, park, friends, public forum in March, in anticipation of that being a good time of year to start a parks, cleanup, outreach.
An opportunity to attempt some revitalization and, as you mentioned, about these community gardens I, wonder if there's ever a way to turn park space into a community garden or how that process works because it seems, like everyone, is just passing off this area, to either the DOT or to the department of buildings, doing construction or passing it off to Brooklyn bridge park.
Maybe three years ago, now, which had some support from the borough president's office, then there turned out to be not a lot of money to do anything.
Just that you know individual four corner meeting where you get off the Brooklyn bridge is one project to tackle in a smaller scale, whether it's community garden or just revitalization of the green space.
Then there was supposed to be like little coffee, area, and you know real really, because two folks needed to have something that once they got off the bridge from the stuff.
I think the best idea would be to try to you know kind of clean it up a little bit and which realistically could be funded.
You know, like you've, heard who's going to get the money to fund it.
Is there a world in which a community garden would be able to take over public park space and just make that space feel better right.
There, I, think like in our place in this committee, advocating for smaller things within this community is where we can, where we can have success.
That would also work with the stream if we shave the strand just to be a smaller alleyway from let's say the borough hall to the entrances, or you know, wherever we might construe to be the entrance as far as Brooklyn bridge park, just.
There's got to be I, think I, don't know they have to find out how many of those little slivers are in our district.
I mean it might not be the right timing, but it's like there's a part that doesn't have a friends group you know advocating on its behalf.
You know if we could get more of the politics involved to get Amanda Barry Park fixed up for the three largest housing projects in Brooklyn.
I mean I, just want to remind ourselves that there was that you know 16 sycamores park or something it was a dump.
The first thing: he went to De Blasio was to fix all the it's, the streetscape, all around Borough hall, some like 10 or 11 million dollars.
You go into the plaza that becomes parks, department, so I think you know.
