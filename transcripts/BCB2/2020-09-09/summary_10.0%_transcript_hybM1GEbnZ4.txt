It is custom that at the discretion of the chair, when there's no one that assigned it to speak, that I have the ability to close the public hearing or I have the ability to open it up for some limited commentary from those who signed on to speak and so I'm going to take the liberty now to ask If there's anyone who has comments now before I do that before I allow people to unmute themselves and to give comments I'm going to do this two ways : This is for commentary from board members and then at that point, I will open it up to commentary from the public recognizing that each person is given a two-minute maximum to speak.
