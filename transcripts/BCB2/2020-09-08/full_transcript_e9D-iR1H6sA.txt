Recording looks like we are yeah wonderful, thank you. Everybody for coming. My name is Brandon Smith, I'm the chair of the health Environment Social Services Committee. I've got a little script, I'm going to run through so give me a quick moment and I'll be I'll. Give you the rules of the road for the meeting tonight. Okay, so the meeting has been called to order. The recording has begun. A meeting is being recorded for the purpose of transparency and for permanent public access on the CB2 youtube archive. All attendees should keep your microphone muted. When you are not speaking, district staff will actively assist in maintaining this protocol. It is the practice of community Brooklyn community board 2 to conduct remote meetings with all committee members cameras on for full transparency. We encourage all attendees to also leave their cameras on, particularly if you are given the floor to speak, to maintain appropriate discussion and voting process. I will make it known when and which topics are open for comment by Committee members, Board members at large and the general public. If you wish to speak, please use the webex feature in the participants panel to digitally, raise and lower a hand, and I will call on you in order, if you have questions that fall outside of public comment time, just type your questions in the chat panel and we will address them if relevant to the matter and as time permits if any attendee experiences technical difficulties in the Webex software features. During the meeting, please consult Help.Webex.Com after the meeting please reach out to the district staff at bk02. It is our desire to provide access for all of our neighbors, regardless of physical ability or limitation. If you require any accommodation or assistance for full participation, please contact the district staff office 72 hours before any public meeting. We will now begin the roll call. So I'm asking each of the members of the committee to introduce themselves and we'll start with Jessica hi, I'm Jessica and I'm the Secretary hey Barry hi, I'm Barry Newmark Public member John. I think we heard John Harrison member. Your microphone was a little garbled there John. Oh sorry, John Harrison, member Excellent, Alejandro, Varela, public member Tanya, Richardson, CB2 member, great victor Mr, Andrews, member, excellent and caroline. You want to introduce yourself, Caroline, Church assistant, district manager, excellent, very happy to have all of you and I believe, we've more than achieved Quorum for the committee. So at this time I'm going to ask for an approval of to a motion for approval of tonight's agenda. Mr Harrison. I have a second Mr newmark as by a show of hands the does the committee agree with tonight's agenda. Victor. Do you also agree to tonight's agenda? Yes, okay, unanimous excellent! So on tonight's committee agenda, we're going to have the review of the district needs statement and budget priorities. This is a discussion that we picked up at the last committee meeting and I hope it'll prove to be a fruitful discussion for us to continue forward in this comedian meeting. Did everybody have a chance to review the document that Carol Ann sent over a little earlier this week? That was entitled s priorities, I'm going to guess that silence means yes, but if not, then we can we could. We can probably go through it a little bit and I hope to kind of talk through some of the issues that we brought up the last time as well as some other issues that might be coming up too. I think it would also be worth noting that remember the commit of the community who's come to our meetings. A couple of times now miss Emily Annadu. Thank you for joining us had done some additional research into the to some of the data underlying our district needs and should be able to share some information with us too about that research as well, but I think, let's see Carol Ann, do you think we should start off with going through the the hess priorities list, maybe section by section we could go whichever way you like? Okay, I think that's probably the best way to go about it, I'm going to cry going to try something new here. Okay, I was going to try to share this, but it does not look like. I have the ability to share on no, I if you do not mind or if you like, I can put up the original statement that you prefer. The one that's been worked on. Let's put up the original statement: okay, okay, I tried I'm sorry I tried, but nothing came up, try again! Ah here it is just need to move you out of the way, and can you see it Brandon? I got a big gray box. Oh and I guess it's not working. You try again miss church I'll, try to revoke the Presenter Privilege and give it back to you and see if that resets it. Okay. Thank you. Okay! Now we can see it. Thank you, okay, taking a look at this, so this page, if everybody can see, reflects what we had in our district needs statement last year and I think the the top of the page is a discussion about noise and it's supposed to be sort of the most pressing, urgent issue for our community from a health perspective, at least according to how this was written. Last time it seemed like the issues presented were noise and respiratory illness. As being most important from a health perspective, but my thought- and I think maybe some other thoughts on the committee is that this is probably not the most pressing health related concern in the community. And my initial thoughts would be about the some of the same topics. We discussed last time in terms of health, equity and access to care, particularly for the NYCHA community, and that probably would be backed in both needs for mental health and substance, abuse, treatment and availability for a number of different kinds of of care, which would be important in not the least of which would also include maternal mortality. But I so I think that there should be some kind of reworking here. The first most important issue related to our district portion of this document, and I think, as we go down, there is a discussion about the needs for healthcare facilities, and I, if I'm to read the next paragraph, I in a sort of a cliff notes manner it discusses there are a number of mental health facilities and chemical dependency centers in our in our area and perhaps we're too highly saturated. So I I'm thinking we need to have sort of a different perspective, and maybe we can start off just sort of talking about what that perspective should be. Does anybody have any thoughts? I see Mr Varela's already got his hand up. You want you want to chime in here at Alejandro. I do I appreciate you posing this question. Can you hear me? Well, yes, absolutely you know. I really think that we should be operating from a places, as you suggest, but urgency, I'm very concerned about where we are sort of economically and health in the city in the country for sure, but specifically in the city and our purview is the district, and I think we should be looking very closely at what are the hardest hit areas with unemployment and all of the factors related to the crisis. That's looming from this recession, and we should try as best we can to get in front of it. So what are the resources that people will need? Where, specifically, are those resources going to be needed, and I think that's the lens that we should be approaching the needs statement that there's a crisis coming and that crisis is going to affect us any number of ways: Health Environment, Social, Services, Education, Health and safety all that stuff, and what can we do to get ahead of it as best we can yeah? I think that seems to be pretty on point with my thinking of the issue, too. Does anybody else on the committee want to offer their view of this issue or what should be the most important thing? Barry you're unmute? I always get annoyed with people who do that. My apologies. Thank you, Brandon. Thank you Alejandro. I I have two things that I really wanted to say. One is: could you alejandro be clear and specific about what the crisis is that you're? Referring to? I have no doubt you're right, but I do not want to guess what it is that you're referring to. So that would be helpful. The second thing that, just to maybe underline what Alejandro said, we have a portion of our district that suffers tremendously from ongoing health problems, specifically disease, heart disease, asthma and high blood pressure, and those factors are major contributors to severe problems that people experience in life and with a crisis it'll be worse without a crisis, it's still horrible and it's not being addressed in the way in which it should be addressed in this community, and it falls back to the reasons that we all can surmise as to why that's the case, but I think we need to be very specific about those problems because they affect the most vulnerable. I think that makes sense. Does anybody else want to chime in on this issue as to what they feel is most important? I do Mr Harrison. Thank you. First off, I have to apologize because, right after you went through your disclaimer, the system kicked me out and kept me out for about six minutes. So then, I, finally, when it opened up after about 10, tries you were at the document, so I do not disagree with what Alejandro and what Barry, but I think a prior step is to because I time I took the day right, look at all of the material that was sent by the office this time around and also last time- and I remember the issue and I'm glad you figured it out because it was the one that was highlighted first, the thing about the air quality, so I so in this exercise I would definitely go along with whatever the it's on the committee thinks the most important. I think what we should decide before discuss any specifics is whether we should pursue this. The way I hear Alejandro saying which I do not disagree with, which is where's the most acute need versus, where is the greatest number of people who could be impacted? Which is why I think the document was resting where it was with air quality. The other option- I think, we've already heard from too, and I would suggest that it probably will go that way which I'm but the reason I say that is because I think it then drives what we ask for and what we say and the reason I say that is because in reviewing the material today I noted, at least in the one thing where it was quoting I'm going to get the names wrong. So it was just pages four through eight and it was naming basically a city department and it was naming things of needs or things that have been said prior a lot of those things is my department, the larger one, the Department of social services and then the sub departments, hra and DHS, department of homeless and human resources. Those are very important things and by community needs and a lot of what seemed to be implied. I was not sure what some of the things were asking for that regard, but a lot of those things the city does not even control such as eligibility for snap or eligibility for cash. I think some of the questions seem, or some of the issues seem to point towards access prior to this horrible Covid-19 environment. We have worked hard in to make access through on the kinds of things that people have called in on right on this meeting, either on a tablet phone and during Covid-19, we've, we've gotten waivers from this disability assistance to basically have something which we never had no requirement for person interviews. So when so, if I know we have not talked about those yet, but we're sort of going down that trail, and so as it applies to accessibility for public benefits and as it applies to eligibility for public benefits, the accessibility, electronic means and the loosening of the requirements of in- person interviews have definitely gone towards a way to apply and to reapply and as to accessibility. Of course, it can always be easier, but for a number of years now we have pursued a lot of data electronically by people wanting to apply feed and wanting to recertify. So I think that the health thing is actually and the issues that Alejandra raised. The health are very important. I think they're a good thing and I think they can be- and I think that's a good thing, so I just want to think the framework. If we get if we kind of come to a kind of a meeting of the minds on the framework, then I think the rest of it sort of falls into place. Thanks. Thank you, John. Before I move on to everybody else, I just want to acknowledge that we have Miss Nan Blackshear here from the President's office, and I just wanted to thank you for coming to our committee meeting and we're very honored to have you and, if there's anything that you wanted to add I'd be more than happy to entertain it. Thank you, Committee Chair, Brandon Smith for acknowledging me. I appreciate that you're giving me this time and in one minute I just want to say that I'm about to email, a community health profile to Carol Ann Church that I saw online. That is specifically for the Fort Greene Clinton hill area, and I will try to send it for the other areas within community district 2., and I think it's a tool, though it's from 2018, I believe it's a tool that could be helpful to the committee if you have not seen it as yet. Has the committee seen this? Is this the city Department of Health profile from 2018? Yes, I believe we have. We have looked through that profile quite a bit: oh okay, in a prior year, yeah, and but it's definitely something that we've taken a fresh look at in the last year too, and it is a really good start and thank you for raising it. I think the thing that I just that I just want to say is that well I really I found a lot of the information in that profile, really helpful. It sort of talks about like Brooklyn heights and Fort Greene on this, like really high level, and it would be nice if, like the City, Department of Health was referencing NYCHA and you know Ingersoll whitman Farragut and the impact on like this real, like pocket of poverty, that we feel is exists in our in our community district. I think that at least was that was my big like take away from that. May I also recommend that our office has recently gotten in contact with the health Disparities coalition representative, and I would be very happy to introduce you Mr Smith, to to that person so that they may want to possibly weigh in. Maybe they have done some work on their end, so just a future reference, oh that'd, be wonderful! Thank you. Okay. I just wanted to say that in general, it's difficult to get health related data broken down into those more micro sectors because of confidentiality. So that makes sense that makes sense also because of methodology right. The Department of Health and mental hygiene is fairly scientific, but again it goes back to framework. So if you do not set up your framework to capture data and report on data and analyze data that way, you're not going to have it at the back end and my experience on both on the committee and deal with them to some degree in hra and DSS- is that they do not go down. They do not. I hate the expression, but they used to used to be popular drill down. They do not drill down to something that Alejandra often refers to right at census. Tracts they do not generally do that about, as far as they go generally is like a community district, that's about as micro, which is problematic in this regard, right. What I can do, I'm also I work with the age friendly commission and the New York, the New York Academy of Medicine. I can reach out to them and to see what type of data sets that they have as far as for the senior population, they have done a coalition with CUNY in regards to a mapping system that they do based on various types of health conditions and criteria that is accessible to the public. In terms of getting data but like I said, it's limited only to seniors, unfortunately well fortunate for me, but maybe not for everybody and every age group, but they may be able to assist you in regards to other data that you might be looking for. So I'd be happy to make that connection for you also thank you. No, that would be great and thank you very much Nan. I greatly appreciate that. I think I want to get I we have a number of people whose voices I want to hear on this, and- and I just want to check before I go back to Alejandro and before I hear about the data that emily has prepared- or I would not say prepare, but it has worked on a little bit. I just wanted to see if any other members of the committee had any other thoughts about what our most important priorities should be. Just anybody I have not. I have not heard from Jeff just really quickly. I agree that this should be our most important priority. I still will say that I think in some way focusing on disproportionate effects of the development in our district on NYCHA residents and long- term residents. I'd like to see it studied or acknowledged in some ways, specifically thinking about the environmental side of this air quality, air pollution, noise pollution, light pollution. I do not think that's the. I agree with alejandra that our lens should be about urgency right now, but I would call I would say something about that level of pollution that I do suppose. My hypothesis is that NYCHA housing residents are disproportionately affected by those types of pollution. I'd like to see us address that, but I do not think it's number one right now. I just wanted to make sure to acknowledge it. Okay did any other members of the committee want to chime in here on the on the most important issue: it's okay! If not to, can I say something me. Thank you. I just want to say that I looked at some numbers surrounding Covid-19, its impacts incident, acrosss, the city, and it's really interesting to see what the numbers are between. What's high income areas and low income areas, if you just give me a Sec, I can actually talk about some of what I saw in low income areas, lower income areas, the difference in hospitalization was 480. Sorry, persons for 100,000 people between the highest income areas and the lowest income and debts was 145 per 100 thousand. So I think it's really critical when the numbers look like that, we you know we make this. We highlight this because we have the numbers, while they're not specific to our community district. You know, we know that our community district is represented there right. I think that makes sense. I think that makes sense yeah and I have my own thoughts on Covid-19 2. I want to add, but I just wanted to make sure unless there's any other members of the committee who had any other thoughts, I want to go back to Alejandro to respond on his point alejandro. Do you want to respond? Yeah? Thank you for giving me opportunity Barry. I hear you and sorry not being more specific. I think what I meant is exactly what everyone then said after I spoke, which is just that in the best of times we have a massive disparity within our district and that disparity is only going to grow. Everyone has been affected by Covid-19, but that chasm between and between the haves and the have not grows in these sort of situations, and I think, there's a little bit of a leap of faith that we all have to take, or just not too much of a leap of faith. Just that, let's not you know, reinvent the wheel. We know that the people who hardest hit are then hardest with all the issues, as Nan put in the comments you know, or around mold or on diabetes or on cancer, and a lot of that is if a lot of that is related to poverty. A lot of blood is related to chronic stress and the wear and tear in the body, all of which comes from issues like unemployment and systemic racism. So I think what I was trying to get at is that this urgent lens? We should not shy away from saying: listen. We have to back sorry to repeat myself, two of the poorest census tracts in New York City within our district. That's massive, but we do not just have two of the poor census tracts. We have two of the biggest disparities, because those census tracts are sandwiched with two with very rich areas. So we can't when we apply. When we look at the priorities, I think in the past. We might just talk about a program I know. Sometimes we do talk specifically about NYCHA and I do not want to only focus on NYCHA because there's poverty outside of NYCHA and within our district still, but just that it's saying there are people who are going to come out just fine and we know where a lot of it is concentrated and we're a lot of it anywhere. We do not know we need to make an effort to find out, so the programs specifically target the resources specifically target the most in need and I'll just say very quickly, back to the unemployment piece, because so much comes from. The unemployment rate is that we were at somewhere near 3.4 percent of 0.5 3.5 unemployment. In the city, which mirrored what was happening acrosss the country which began with Obama, even though the current president wants to take all the credit for it anyway, so the that, but within our within out within NYCHA acrosss, the city Mr Varela, your feed has frozen. Unfortunately, all hundred can you hear us, it looks like Alejandra is having a connectivity issue. You could try turning your video feed off and your audio might come through. Oh, maybe not, okay. Well, we can come back to Alejandro when he when he gets back on Ms Richardson. I see you got your hand raised. I wanted to acknowledge you and let you share your thoughts, okay, hi, so I wanna touch base on the. Can you guys hear me yeah, okay, great, I'm speaking as coming from as me, being a nature resident that why is NYCHA always like targeted? When is other areas that has the same issues and one of the things that I noticed since Covid-19 and because I'm always out in the community and observing a lot as well as I did a lot of work, distributing food and so forth, but the homeless rate then went up so when the people were supposed to be quarantined and the city was locked down, it was a lot of spaces all over the place where you know people were outside on the street and the majority of them, I believe, have mental health issues as well, because shelters and so forth was available. You know that we did not want people on the street, so I had a real high concern about that because, like what, if these people were even ill, how are they getting treated or anything like that? It's just like they're just lost right. So how do we, how we address for the people that's just out in speed and even if they're undocumented or whatever like? How do we address that and I had issues before Kovic that was not addressed as far as the mold and the diabetes and the high blood pressure, so the only thing it did is just increase. You know numbers just probably went higher right. You know, so you know that that's one of my main concerns is that it's just it's a it was. I think that you know it was just too many people that was in the street and even last week Friday I took train to Manhattan to I got off at 34th Street. There was so many homeless people in the train station. It was so homeless, people on 34th street, where the little sitting areas were, and that's a lot of stores boarded. I was like it just. It did not sit right with me not only for our district. I'm just saying you know, okay, and I could see this this paragraph about our most important issue in encapsulating multiple things. It does not have to be all about night. It could include homelessness and many of the same needs that exist in terms of mental health and substance. Abuse services would be part of that conversation Alejandro. I think we lost you mid- stream, and I wanted to give you a chance to finish your thought since you dropped. Do you have something else you'd like to add? No, I think I've said enough. I think it was the universe telling me to stop being so preachy, but I think I think I think I've said plenty and I think, we're all sort of on the similar track. So I just I want to see what we can do with the priorities. Okay, can I make one more comment sure? So I think that in addressing the concerns of the district, that you know, there's one thing that there's one issue where everything stems from and that everything is interrelated. So when we talk about health, it's not just our physical health, it's everything! It's the all- encompassing it's education. It's food right, access to food. We do nutrition programs and for cultures who are used to cooking a certain way. We want to come in and bring you know, Quinoa and a salad. So we also need, when we're doing programs to create programs that are culturally nutrition programs that are culturally relevant to the people that we're trying to switch their eating habits. Just things like that, I think all gets tied in to what is our greatest need, and our good well greatest need really is, I think, as a district would be, I mean you look at it overall, it might be reduction in chronic diseases, and how do we address that? My two sets? No, it's most appreciated Carol Anne. I think that's a good thought. I want to give emily an opportunity to talk about some of the research that she's done. Maybe this would be a good juncture. Do you feel comfortable doing that? Emily? Yes, hi? Am I able to share a few spy, I feel like you might have to email it to maybe Carol Anne? Oh no caroline is shaking her head, so maybe not brandon. I can make her presenter one. Second, apparently thank you Presenter. So I think this will work. Yes, okay. I promise not to show baby pictures once again. We would not mind pictures like I want to eat my own face. Okay, you should have presentation ability now, okay, you guys. Are you seeing my screen now? No, oh in the upper left corner you'll want to select and then share contact. I have yeah I'm doing that again: okay, okay, so some of this information. So this was from the first meeting I attended on August 5th, where we first were looking at some data and the I think all of us had the same reaction. Okay, are you still able to see that emily? What type of file are you trying to share? It's a google, it's from Google Chrome, it just says five will Google slides. Is it not showing good? I do not wanna add to the pile of complaint. Oh there, it goes. It's just very slow to load. Thank you. Sorry, oh no problem! Thank you! Thank you. This is phenomenal and probably better than many of us could do so. I definitely do not believe that so we'll start there. I believe in all of us. Okay, so let me know- and so at the August 5th meeting, we reviewed a snapshot of key community indicators which showed positive numbers versus other parts of Brooklyn, and I think for me looking at this and we, you know somewhat had that discussion and I believe it was barry. Also speaking of this just this idea that this data paints a very rosy picture of the CB2 and because we're looking at averages and obviously averages are just not great so that data was presented as averages and unfortunately averages do not serve the Underserved. Are my slides? Advancing? Are you already okay cool thanks for checking? First, thanks for yeah, thanks, okay, so Brandon was kind enough to share a host of information with me, including census, Tract data. I actually did look at the report that was mentioned in terms of the health outlook which looked at Fort Greene in Brooklyn heights that, unfortunately, I think had the same issue with some of the other data we were looking at, and so what I was trying to do was just for us and obviously there's tons of good work getting done. But this is just really this idea that how can we make sure that we really are focusing on the needs where health is needed and then also just looking at some of the academic information around the health impacts, the disparities we see and the health impacts of gentrification, which Alejandra was speaking to and it's very eloquent. So for the purposes of this and I apologize, I will often speak of Fort Greene, just because I live in poor, green and so for me, it's helpful to look at the numbers when I think about what I see every day and so excuse any language in this that might be offensive to people, particularly like Tanya. This, for me, was not about looking at specifically or trying to attack NYCHA anyway, but again it's just about really highlighting the disparities that are erased when we look at averages. So in looking at the data, looked at census tracts, and so you see four green park there in the middle or not in the middle, so looked at census, tracts 183,195, 33, 181,197 together. That was not all that scientific other than for me. It's just like where all the brownstones are so obviously, with some of that I caught it's not again, it's not perfect science, but this again, I think you're you'll see some of the huge differences that exist. So does everyone see the two little maps just making sure my size are advancing, yep, okay, great, so one of the first things I just wanted to take big picture and then kind of zoom in on a few things so terms of racial differences. But this for me again, it's kind of obvious that you just walk around in four green, but really here just highlighting that literally, if you look in the data that you'll see on each side on the left side is the what I'll call the dekalb side of the park versus the myrtle side of the park, and so on the left side. You see things like the huge difference from a racial perspective that exists, and so I think, when you start thinking about some of the examples that were brought up just even around like culturally and how education has to happen because of diets and what people eat. You are literally talking about completely different cultures on the two sides of the park, and so here specifically looking at, for example, the dekalb side of the park, 51 white versus only nine percent on the myrtle side, so again not surprising, but always just good, to look at the Data Household composition. I think this is where we really start to think about not just like access and kind of for me what I think about just like the time and energy involved in like cooking, healthy meals, taking people to doctors going to doctors. So, looking at this, one of the things that stood out to me was that when you look at household composition, basically the myrtle side of the park tends to be larger: female households, no husband presence and children under 18.. So again, this no sorts of attack anything here, but I think it's again just being realistic about when you think about education. You think about information. Think about things that you're asking people to do in terms of well. You know we built this great center, so everyone just go there and do this that you're literally, you have to think about that people have different times available to them, based on what they're dealing with in their own households and what they have to manage and take care of just to exist. So here just the things. If you look sorry, I can't really say yes, oh I do have a question. I do not know if you can see it, but again, just huge disparities in exist in terms of just how households are composed. So when we look at income and benefits- and we started talking about, we did discuss a little bit about snap benefits and availability. And so what you'll see here is that on this side on the left side, again the decal side versus right side, the myrtle side that obviously there's tons- and this data is census. Data going back to 2010. I can imagine if these numbers have only increased in the spread- has only increased. But when we look at snap benefits, almost half of the residents on the myrtle side of the park. Enjoy Snap benefits, and I think that there are things that are often done and I do not want to say to make people feel good. But when I think about the idea that, for example, the farmers market, you can use ebt and snap benefits at the farmers market. But you do not often see what the farmers market looks like in terms of people going, it's very homogeneous. And so for me, that is a gap in potentially a gap in education, making sure people are aware that there are options that could be taken advantage of. But again do not want to dismiss the point about their cultural differences and how people cook- and maybe everyone does not want a radish. I do not know but again just huge differences that we're seeing here in terms of income the benefits. The other thing that starts getting directly into when we think about health care is just even health insurance and so for me, because I emailed to Brandon and caroline before it makes me sad, but just the idea that on the dekalb side of the park, and so even when we think about times of Covid-19 and any other sort of pandemic that might pop up when we think about mental health issues, that private health insurance enables you to do a lot of things very easily, because you typically do not have to get referrals. You typically just got. You know, go to whatever doctor you want versus. Unfortunately, the public coverage typically comes with. You know there is a primary care physician that is assigned to you that might have like a trillion patients waiting for that person to then refer you to specialists and so getting basic health care. It is hard to think about all the other things that need to be done. That could help with like mental health, because again it comes with having to have referrals, and it just gets more challenging so again, just seeing huge disparities in terms of when we look at you know whether you're employed or unemployed. The basically you know, public coverage is what is largely used on on the other side, on the myrtle side of the park, and so all of this for me, just looking at this, came from a health policy brief that Brandon Sharon. I thought this chart was really helpful because we think about gentrification just as ideas, and so what it's basically showing is that when you think about people that either and again, I'm very much in my mind thinking, because that is what I live and experience every day that when we think about this, basically showing on the blue, it's basically thinking about you know if you're in Fort Greene and have been here for a long time and have decided to either stay or you've had to move based on rent increases or you've stayed because you're in you know, rent stabilized housing, and so this also ends up coming with one, if you're having to move just the health implications of like disrupting your social networks. So what that does in terms of mental health, and we know that mental health leads to what are called diseases of despair which are leading to american life expectancy going down for the first time in decades, because you end up with things like stress induced, you know heart conditions, you end up with drug use. So, similarly, even if that's not happening in terms of disruption, social networks, even if you're staying in the network there are staying in the neighborhoods as they're being just gentrified they're, just things that happen in terms of the stores you used to be able to shop, you know at are no longer there. The there's just elevated, stress and anxiety. This feeling, like I do not belong here, becomes a real becomes a very real issue. So I think that is all the slides that I have for today, I'm actually going to unshare. How do I stop sharing sorry, I'm trying to figure out how to stop sharing. Can someone? Let me stop sharing. I do not know so anyway. So for me, I think all of this, I think for me- does actually, of course, sorry my notifications. It does reinforce that there is a lot of work to be done on mental health, but then there are also things that again, just as this data is being packed together that, for example, the health profile for fourth grade of Brooklyn heights in talks, you know it shows that you know Yay for green they're. Less you know roaches being reported than in other parts of Brooklyn and in other parts of New York City, but we know that is just not true in much of in many of these tracks, where housing is different and that, unfortunately, ends up being like roaches end up impacting and or trigger for asthma, and so all of these things truly are related, and so I do not think I'm necessarily saying anything different than what others on the or what members of the committee have said. But for me I think that this just really for us calls into the need to make sure that we are trying to get as granular as data as possible and getting down to individual census tracts as much as we can just to make sure that we are, you know, taking one just thinking about what are the cultural implications of health that is being suggested, but then also just really thinking about the needs from not only a physical health standpoint, but also to the mental health standpoint. Thank you very much for that emily. That was very I'm going to echo Nan's kind comments. This is a phenomenal presentation, very insightful to get an additional look at, and perhaps some stronger data around the specifics inside our community district. That sort of lay out the the breakdown between different communities and highlight some of the needs. I mean for everybody to think about some of these topics. I know you know on the sheet that Carol Ann shared earlier one of the items that we can identify from the budget requests or expanding access to public health insurance and it sort of fits into that realm. And I know there are many other things that could also come up in that regard too, and one can say, though, just in terms of that the public expanding access to public health, but I think, there's also a need to push for the ability to have direct access to mental health counselors without people having to go through referrals from their primary care physicians. But I think that also paired with the idea of making sure that people aware like it is okay to not be okay and that, like it is okay to. But so I think yes, what you're saying, but just making sure again, just following through all the way that it's not just the access to the insurance, but the making sure it's not difficult to use that insurance for the any thoughts from members of the committee on the data that emily has shared and potentially further comments or suggestions. I'm not seeing anybody raising your hand on the committee. I did want to also give any of the member public or attending our meeting an opportunity to voice any strong concerns or priorities that they have in terms of health concerns. What they feel should be most important for the community. So before we go into sort of, I hope a little bit more specific discussion about cataloging some of our district needs. I wanted to give that opportunity to any of the members of the public who are attending. If you could just raise your hand, that would be great using the webex feature. I hope I'm reading this correctly. I do not. I do not see any raised hands, so I think from here. It might be good to to talk briefly about some of the district needs that we catalogued from the last meeting and since and I appreciate for all those who either had them in mind or were able to to put them down into the sharepoint. I think last time it started with the three that Alejandro had identified, which were the mobile health clinics, local hiring program and the NYCHA survey of needs. I do not want to go through those all. You know as much as we did last time, but did you want to add anything about that now, Alejandro or sort of vocalize the priority of those items? Just to say that I what I wrote in the comment earlier that I think all of this conversation, what we've gathered and what emily presented. Thank you emily all this data that we've been sort of accumulating over the last few meetings. How did he operationalize that, like? What does that look like on the ground, and- and I do think I mean it- was just an idea- the mobile health clinics are just one way and then specifically, they were mobile mental health clinics to sort of to be stationed in areas, but I do not know how that works. I mean, I know that mobile health clinics have had a lot of public health success for a long time all over the country, but specifically for mental health care. I do not know how that would look, but really it's just this general idea of like how do we make health care more active? You know Mr Harrison. Thank you, I think is spot on. That's what I was trying to get to with my long- winded John Webb frame it because it's specific, but not specific, and it speaks to what I heard our other colleagues say when she said that all the all the disparity just not just rest in the right. That was point I have to be right for the city they're. I think it would be hoovers to mention your idea, alejandra of the mobile health clinics, because I think it's spot on number one, because if nothing else they are mobile and that's a great thing. I think at times have talked as a committee, and I think at times we have talked as a city about we need to establish x, number of new health clinics or we need to set up a new job center for Hra, a new welfare center and the problem with that is just that. It is that right building where it's a location and then there are all sorts of problems, connect tests, hours, staffing it. You know who has the ability, because of disabilities to get there. I think a mobile health clinic is really really spot on and I think creative we can come up with a number of things that I think would definitely be worth mentioning if no other reason alejandro, because a mobile health, by definition at some point, there's a ceiling in the cost right. So I do not care how big a vehicle a very doable thing and I think it could get to a lot of people in a lot of places. I'm all for that. I, if we can come up with things like that, I think we've got something, because I think you get your biggest we there was a mention also. I want to say that I think kind of sedation was not only spot on, but exceptional the professionalism was just wow. There was a, I think you mentioned Mr chair about because it was mentioned by someone else about access to public health. That's one of the things I raised before, and I suggest we stay away from that, because the app is there most people today, their acumen of systems and Gizmos is much greater than mine and they also possess them. So if there's an awful lot of access to public health benefits, if it was meant by benefits, asking that that's why I asked the question before: what's meant by access, if it's meant, on the other hand, something along the lines of excess being like access to some medical professionals right in this. In this regard, mental health professionals, then that's another thing, but if it's, if it's access to the benefits, meaning the ability to apply for medicaid that sort of exists, I would stay away from that. Okay. Well, I think you know in this in this perspective and I'm going to go to Miss Richardson in just a second I just want to. I just want to respond to that a little bit. I think it's one thing and I think we've had a good discussion about what should be most important, but I think from now we can sort of transition a little bit more into cataloging out specific things that we want to raise as district needs from that discussion, and they do not all have to be the most important item, but they that they probably can be related to in some capacity tanya. I did not want to cut you off, could feel free to take the floor. Thank you. So, in addition to a mobile clinic right, so what would the? How would the services be? What would be the criteria of the service? Would it be like pre- screening and then what happens after that? It still will have to probably be some type of referral, because it all depends on what type of insurance the people have again. So then we're back to square one again, so what it will be pre- screening- and we already know that our district has a high rate of african- american men with high blood pressure, because we discussed that issue before and diabetes. So how is that going to be addressed if we had a mobile clinic? How often will this clip? Where is it going and what, if the people get they get serviced, but then what's going to happen after that? What is the treatment plan you know so like? Where do we start and if it, if it's getting started, it has to be continued? It can't just fall through the cracks, because so many things get started and then it falls through the cracks. You know you know it sounds good. It can't work, but you know that's just my concern right. There. Definitely people need mental health assets, you know immediately and then especially more even so now so many people have lost family members. Who is the sole providers of their family? They do not know they do not have no direction of anything. What to do and then we're in September next month is flu season, so we're back to square one all over again. That's all I got to say right now: okay, I think what we should do and to just to try to maximize the time, because we I do want to get to the rest of our agenda at a later point in the meeting tonight is if we have a few things down, we've got the mobile health clinics. We've got the the local hiring program and the and the the NYCHA the NYCHA survey is try to see if there's anything else that we wanted to add. As a as a new item, I added a couple of other new items that I thought might be worthy, but I would not say that they're necessarily as high priority as some of the items we discussed tonight, but I also want to capture sort of the feelings coming out of this discussion and and put them into something a little bit more specific. So I think, in terms of the in terms of the in terms of this disparity that emily highlighted from the presentation about the one side of the park versus the other side of the park, what do we think fundamentally would change things to improve the folks who are experiencing disparities on the side of the park that is disaffected emily? Do you have any strong thoughts on this? I have strong thoughts about everything, but on this in particular, one thing I was going to say is on so I think it's challenging because I think unfortunately, you're also dealing you're dealing with, I think, just fundamentally mental. While there is a great mental health need. I think that there's also the challenge that fundamentally black people are- and I hate to speak in gross generalizations, but we are only just getting comfortable with the idea of mental health care to begin with, because we've been taught to like[ _ _] it up and just you know, shut up and take. You know, handle things, and so I think for me it's the access to the insurance. Sorry, it's making sure people have insurance, but it's making sure there's a direct line to care providers without having to have referrals, but then also just on the mobile health trucks. I do not know about other neighborhoods in CB2, but there's actually an initiative. That's hopefully going to start very soon in Fort Greene Park, which I think it would be a great idea if someone from Mahesh was on the advisory council, but basically fountain house and I can put the link in the chat. But fountain house is basically going to be doing training peer training so that it's not just coming from. You know: doctors who people may or may not see, but actually just being stationed in the park and just being available to people either reaching out if they see that someone either looks distressed or also just being there as a resource. And so that's something there's already grant money being raised. I think there's already grants that are it's already happening, but again the advisory council is being formed. So that will be it's not mobile in the sense that there's like a vehicle. But it's mobile in the sense that there will just be mental health care advocates in the park and available to people, and I think particularly leading towards the myrtle side, because unfortunately, that is it is where there tends to be- and I hate speaking like this, but intravenous drug use, or just even outside of that- the stress of unemployment of yeah. Just all these things so yeah. So I'm a huge fan of the mobile health, whether that's physical vehicles or just people being there and Brandon. I can send you the information if you'd like, because I do think it would be great for someone from this committee to be on that advisory council tanya. That might even be awesome for you to do, but then I think it's also education to destigmatize getting mental health because, unfortunately, does impact right. I got you so maybe there's something we could say to the effect of deploying specific mental health professionals and folks who can provide treatment for substance abuse, particularly to the to the area around that specific side of the park. Is that would that would that be something that we could concretely write down as an action yeah, and I would also say that on that there also needs to be better, follow up and follow through between the ADA precinct and mental health professionals, because at least from what I have heard from them, I went to a meeting with the police in the park a couple of weeks ago. Their basic stance is catch and release they're like and if you ask well what happened with this person, who I saw was in distress, they will always say we turned him over. We sent him to a hospital, we do not know what happens after that and for me that just does not feel good enough like there needs to be a like a better loop of education and information between the ADA precinct, particularly when they are saying we often see the same people who are in distress that information is not caring, and so that to me feels like something that does not take money. It just takes better communication, so yes, people mobile in the park, but then also, I think, better- communication between 88 precinct, at least specifically just dealing with the poor green area and those mental health care professionals. Okay, did you want to comment Mr Harrison? He did so the referral by a police officer to wherever they're referring right for mental health. I understand what you're saying about no follow- up, but they it's not really in their follow- up. It's a it's a tricky one, because it again that's sort of about the framework it speaks to. It speaks to the structure of the city. It's the same thing could be, I guess, new staff members and numerous agencies within the Department of Social Services right. It gets someone is before them and there's an issue. Our area does not deal with they'll. Make a referral or they'll make a contact. They'll transport, someone to the thing, but then that's sort of where you end yeah. That's it. We do not have a good solution, a lot of the things that we've been talking about so okay. So I'm going to go a little bit, but very right to the point. A lot of we've been talking about the elephant in the room that we no one seemed to have said this time. At least maybe I did mention it at the beginning, but I have not heard anybody stress. It is yes. Mental health is an issue. Yes, roaches in one's domicile or someone's home is an issue. Substance abuse is an issue, but folks, it's jobs. I do not know how we, but we have these two very acute and negatively impacted on pockets of poverty, not that there are not others. If you can bring people, if you can, you know paying jobs, then a lot of this starts to be dealt with in a different way and I'm not saying that one said is wrong and I'm not saying that any of the been put out there are wrong, but they sort of work around the edges right, so there's they're to a degree they're working right, they're, not at the heart of the problem. I do not know that we can get to the heart of the problem, but the heart of poverty and the best way out of poverty is the job. Okay, I see there's been some thoughts going around in the chat about potentially convening a meeting, which I think would be a very interesting idea to bring some of these players together and Alejandro also had a thought about mental health training and whether police officers are even appropriate for being the responders. In those circumstances, is there something alejandro? Did you want to add something to that yeah? I just want to clarify I yes to what you were saying John by the way I agree with. I agree with your points about employment, but I'm not suggesting that I was speaking more about the follow- up and what happens next. I understand that in this moment, if someone feels quote- unquote threatened or they see something, then they say. Oh that person is, you know having mental health issues, and I do not know what to do they're going to call 9- 1- 1 period, so I'm not this is. I was not suggesting, even if I do believe that should not be within the purview of the NYPD. That's not what I was saying in this moment. I was just trying to clarify that and then you know followed up saying that's why partnerships are very key, and I and I agree with her just that you know there are that there are different places like the idea that after a police take someone in or take them to a hospital, then they become the warehouse for follow- up or for information. I do not. I do not know if that's what people were trying to say, I just questioned whether that is even appropriate or necessary for them to be the stakeholder there. I'm actually uncomfortable with that idea. So what you said right so, for example, if a police officer comes in and picks someone up whether to provide whether to refer them to a mental health, professional or just to arrest them, because in that moment they do not know how to deal with that acute issue whatever it is. That to me should be like the end of that relationship in terms of what the involvement with the police, I do not see why they then have to be involved in the follow- up of that person, unless I'm unaware of mental health training that police officers have, and maybe there's a whole branch of that I'm unaware of, but still I'm that's what I was saying I did not. I do not think they should be role right. I think I think I understand what you're saying I would totally agree. That's the point I was making it's come up at work with because, because of the issue of homelessness that we've been discussing, the fact that, because of what's happened with the George Floyd protests and the on the disparities, but also just at the the actual conditions of policing within the city, shelter system, the administration has done kind of an about- face, and I think I can talk about this only because- and I do not want to waste much time but there's a point because they made a determination. When the mayor started back in 14, he made a determination and turned to Bill Bratton about how the the staff, the police, the shelter system, could be more, and so it went in a way of you know: God, you think John Harrison. You know it went in a way of traditional police attack and there has been like an epiphany and they've decided and the resultant of that was at a certain level. The police department supervised the peace officers from the department of homeless services that were the quote, unquote police in the system and they in a way by extension, supervised the security guards and decided that is not a good model, and so they've come up with a new model and they're working on that, and one of the things that's come up with. Alejandro is how, because we know that Hill Health is a is a condition that is manifests in a measurable percentage of the people, especially singles who go into the shelter system and how that was being dealt with being dealt with improperly and so they've kind of gone towards a model of this thing of and bring it to. The attention social staff, who would be better in a better position, from training and from experience and from education to make a judgment, call and then make the follow- up, and so that seems to be what you're talking about. I think that seems to work. You know if you can educate the an officer more so with a lot of different things, but ultimately they are for, as as I think it was emily who said it catcher and lace, they are yeah. There can be a lot of opinions about this. I think we have a little more discussion on this, but I do want to try to wrap this up into something that we can. You can add to our statement: Mr Newmark. Thank you. I've debated about saying this. I think, first of all, I'm really proud of us as a committee and I'm proud of our guests like emily, like man and others in the last meeting or two that have brought us to this point. I have not been on the committee as long as some of you, but I've been on it for a while for a number of years, and this is the first time I recall us focusing in on the fact that there are parts of the district that are in tremendous need as compared to the district community, and I think that's a significant centralizing theme that I would hope the Community board is comfortable with, and I think it pulls together a lot of what some of maybe some of the other committees are going to look at, but also John. When you said before, there's a 500 pound elephant in the room that no one's talking about. I, those are exactly the words I wanted to use, but I would say that it's different, I would say it's racism and the legacy of racism, and I think that if we can be clear about that and direct about it, that's more important than trying to come up with a lot of individual ideas, because, frankly, those ideas have been around for a long time and those efforts quotes have been around for a long time. And nothing has happened to help those who are in the worst shape in our society in our community district and I'm kind of fed up with worried little details because they ai not going to do nothing until we face the facts of why we're here? What we're here? What white people have done to the black community? What institutional organizations and governments have done to the black community and also to the latin community or to anybody else? Who does not look white and does not speak in the same way? And you know again it's easy for me to say it, because I have not been a victim of it. If some sectors knew I was jewish, maybe I would suffer some of it, but I can pass is not jewish. I guess until you hear me speak, but I think if we centralize that framework we'll have done more in this need statement than any of the other needs statements. I've ever done before. That's just my thinking, my idea, I'm probably not being as eloquent about it as I could be. If I thought about it somewhere as if somewhat worse than you could be right now, but I want you to put that out Barry, I think not just from your words, but from the committee's reaction there there's a universal agreement that you're being very eloquent. We appreciate that I really wanna. First of all, thank you emily for coming in and feel free to take off. It will value your contributions in the future have a nice evening. I think one thing that we might want to do is from the perspective of our initial need statement. When we're talking about the most important issue, we should sort of frame it around some of the concepts that Barry has summarized from our discussions throughout this meeting. To then focus on the needs for mental health and substance, abuse and access to care and many other issues that are particular to the pockets of poverty in our in our community. That's the number one issue, the issues of racism and historical origins and its impact, or are something I think it's probably fair to draw upon, because that's the that's how we got here and I think that's how we talk about our most important need, but I think is, as Nan pointed out in the in the comments, we need to come up with some actions that are related to these things and I think the mobile health, the ability to have mental health professionals in the specific locations where the issues exist is part of the story Carolyn. I know you had your hand up earlier and I'm sorry I did not recognize you did you want to add something further at this point. No, you got it. Thank you. Alejandro, staying on this sort of action- oriented thing well to completely agree with you Barry. Thank you for what you said. You know a big part of what we do at every meeting is liquor licenses right and so in terms of the purview of Hess. I do believe employment is not only linked to health, but it's also very much a part of our committee. Every year we in through the bars and restaurants that comes it's just one example of the businesses that come into CB2. We see hundreds of new jobs. Remember we keep count and for a while we kept a spreadsheet, and so hundreds and hundreds of new jobs come into the community every single year by way of bars and restaurants, and then we tell them hire locally, and then they started hiring locally, but mostly young white people with Phds. You know who were like moonlighting and then we said, hire locally brown and black people who have lived in the community for a long time. Oh now I see what you mean and nothing and then hire locally, and we hook them up with four green snap and with all these other agencies. But you go to most of these restaurants. That say yes and their representatives will say: oh Alejandro, we're doing local hiring. Do not worry we're going to do that. I go to these restaurants and bars and I do not see a single white, a single person of color in there never mind a black person not working there, not drinking there not eating there, and so I think, there's actually even something more direct that our community, our committee, can do to improve access to employment, and I think we should name employment or unemployment as a as a health issue, and so I do not know how we can operationalize that to say that we agree that that we say specifically that we are. We can't have a disparity of unemployment right. The good has to be distributed evenly, but so does the bad right. We can't have a block where there's zero percent unemployment and another blocker there's 25 unemployment, and so, if we identify that block back to numbers, if we identify that block has a high unemployment, then every job that comes into CB2 has to go through that block. First, now that's easier said than done, but that's where we as a community board have a lot of power, because we know where the resources are. We can be a funnel for that or we can partner with people who can funnel. For that you know this is a thing we've been talking about for years, and I think the moment would really allow us to say it more clearly, because we did we dip tiptoe around it. We would not say race, we would not say black and brown, we would say long term, you know chronically unemployed and now we're not afraid to say it, and we just need to be really loud about it and say every business that comes in here needs to we need to do. You know we need to do more to decrease unemployment and, specifically in black and ground black and ground population in our community. I'll echo your comments on that alejandro. We have been saying that for many years and it's it's been a subject of a lot of discussion in terms of what do we do? What can we do? Private businesses- and you know we want to be respectful of that, but at the same time it's a very real issue that exists and unemployment is a is a root cause of many other problems. So I mean, would I do not know how to pass a law to force businesses to to and yes rest in peace, Mr, Winston Claire, but the I do not know how to pass a lot of forced businesses to to hire specific people as much as we want them to do that we can offer. We can ask for promoting job training. We can ask for promoting a number of different for promoting more career, centers and or maybe providing incentives to certain businesses that actually hire locally. Is there something that I'm missing, though? I do not claim to know everything about this in the past, and I remember this came through Robert Paris, it's sticky when you start requiring of people who they can and can not hire right. There are laws that protect. There are for larger contractors and larger employers wmbe contracts, but I do not when it when I got to the small level, because again we have brought this to the board. We tried to change the language of our application so that we could ask who you know what jobs were out there, but even that maybe got a little back from conflict of interest. I'm not entirely sure about that history. I could be wrong, but that is one roadblock, but maybe this moment you know everyone feels more comfortable, just saying that you know the silent part out loud, and so maybe in this moment we can push for this more and it won't face so much resistance. I do not know well. Miss Blackshear has an interesting idea of potentially some kind of a tracking system. Perhaps the city came up with some way of tracking this in some capacity. That would be. That would be effective, at least in identifying where these, where the actual local hiring is going on. So maybe that's an idea. It's an idea. I would suggest and Mr Newmark. I agree that we can talk with applicants about the importance of hiring. I you know what we're completely on board with that. But, to be frank, that's what we've been doing for several years on this committee and yeah. That's those are. Those are good points all right. I know we're hitting about 7:40 here in the evening and we have some other items to get on to on our agenda. I think, unless anyone has a has another comment, I'm going to ask that we move on to the to the liquor licenses. Excuse me Brandon this church, another con. I think there should be a vote on what was discussed for entrance for formal entry into the statement and the priorities. That's right! That's a good point. Thank you! Miss Church. So let's talk about that a little bit based upon what we have so you know, we we've discussed the health equity issue and the framing that that Barry has supplied us with the rootings and racism and the pockets of poverty and the specific health issues. Mental health substance abuse, as well as chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease. As being the what I would view as our most important issue, then we have several subsequent issues that explain point by point, some other great important things in more detail which go to which go from the mobile health clinics, local hiring, the survey of NYCHA. There are some other points in here which specifically call out a few things. There's one on finer geographical data, which I think is really pointed at that community Health survey. I would view that as really arguing for a more granular community health survey, which I would view as a as a district need as part of this discussion, there is I've added a I added, an item on better preparedness in the city's part for future pandemics. I think, if you recall back in the in the first meeting that we had once we commenced the pandemic, the Brooklyn plaza medical center came here and spoke about being underprepared with resources, with training and with guidance from all different levels, and I think that if we asked the city to provide more training, materials and guidance and also to sort of be a little bit further ahead with the global community as to the state of global pandemics, then I think that would be something that would be particularly appropriate in this year's statement of district needs. There was a discussion I mentioned at the last meeting. There was a specific piece of there was a specific scaffolding issue going on, and I got some further details from Miss Johnson that this is going on at 64, Saint Edward Street, where the scaffolding at this location has not been removed for approximately 10 years out in this in this particular NYCHA complex, which has caused a number of different quality of life and health issues to the people in that building, including the ability to have emergency personnel and residents and guests access it and causing a safety issue in the evening. So I added an item to remove that scaffolding and do that within six months, which I think would be a reasonable time to remove scaffolding. And let's see there, I also had suggested an item with regards to homelessness. I think we could probably have some additional items with homelessness if we really thought of something specific. But it's come to light in the years with the pandemic, that there are these folks who are staying in the temporary shelters in the in the hotels, and I think that the city should probably do something more substantial with them to assess the their needs for social services, job training, substance abuse or mental health services as necessary and and try to find a pathway to permanent housing for those people. So I would recommend that option that item as well too, and then it seems, there's another item. That's been added about out- of- scale, development, creating a disproportionate impact on long- term residents and others in our community with air light and noise pollution, and I think that that's that that's probably another item that is fair to address the an issue that's going on in our community. So I think, with these items, plus what we've discussed tonight and plus or minus. I want to I'll open the floor again to see if there are any further comments on them and additions or subtractions, and I would just ask if we can try to focus on specific actions. So we can make this productive. Then we can, I hope, take a vote and and agree to a plan for some of these things. So does anyone on the committee have any further comments on this or suggestions, additions or subtractions from the list? I think it was. The Google sheet was pasted in this church. There is no discussion on the other parts. I know that the health is our most important or right now feels like the most important thing we can speak about, but I just want to steer the conversation in the direction of the environment, a part of our portfolio, usually that focuses on Shiva's pickups trash pickups. If anyone has anything to add there. Actually I do, I think I have, I think, I'm guilty of this component of dealing with the problem with the wastewater and the sewer at bond and living. I'm doing a lot of work on that, and yet I again with this- you sent Carol Ann, not this time around, but I think last time around this issue that I think the chair has encapsulated well right with the with the development that's gone on. That has contributed to health issues. I think that is that in the that, in the general era of pollution, as it's acutely felt right, both in Fort, Greene and and in the other, but also just throughout the district. It's again it's one of these elephants in the room that, but we do not talk about that much anymore, only because it's it's a really difficult one to like to address. You know we have this one of the busiest highways in the United States running through the district, and it contributes in such a big way to asthma, to levels of lead to general particulate matter and to other pollution that it's and it's something that's being dealt with right, because the triple can't believe right. You know the ground I think would be to bear you never say never. I do not think they're going to do that, so I do not know how you deal with that, but I think that at Brandon's point of you know the contributing factor of this development to the pollution. That is something I think we can zero in on for certainly for air pollution, and I think there's at this point to the game. I think, like from what alejandra has already articulated what emily shared with the data and what very so eloquently spoke on lead levels and air pollution and particulate matter they're, so much more far- reaching they're felt so more acutely at two of the locations that I've mentioned, but and yet it permeates throughout the district. I think it's such a more important issue than the drainage dislocation and the distance of the sidewall because of a breaking water main or a breaking drain at this location. Those are unfortunate, those things by the general levels of pollution in the air, it's so much more important. Thank you. Just a thought, with the BQE cantilever being up for renovation redesign reconceptualizing. Is that something that the committee would consider as part of their priorities? I know it's transportation, but an overhead highway leads to pollution, just a thought. Well, that's why I mentioned it because I think it's a huge contributing factor and I think that the ultimately the best solution is something they're, just not going to consider not only not deal with in the way that they've dealing with the cantilever, but just make a tunnel. If you make a tunnel, it's terrible in some ways right for the motorist in some ways, but it helps deal with the pollution a whole lot, because the impact is not felt as chronically or acutely history. I do not think they're going to do that. So what else could we do? I've been thinking about this one because it did appear on the document that you sent last right. It was in that thing with the eight pages right. It was right up off and it exists and it's something that I've always felt very passionate about because and it does hit the projects much more so than the rest of the district, but it hits the rest of the district. Folks, no mistake about it. I mean I in this respect and maybe only in this respect, I my locale benefits so much by not being near that highway, and I do not mean that in a braggart way- and I do not mean that you know like oh okay, any other views on the environment, impact of pollution and or BQE. I am not hearing any it's too. I mean okay, I'll just say real, quick on the BQE thing anytime, you have a major artery passing through a community. Obviously there's going to be pollution, and so you have two options: either you reduce the cause of the pollution or you remove the people from the source of the pollution right, and so the cantilevering of the BQE in a way removes people, and so that's a possibility. The tunneling removes people from the source, but there's also the reduction of our traffic. You know, which is the source of the pollution right, that BQE can be there if it's not being used as much there's going to be less exhaust and there's going to be less pollution and people will be less affected. I do not feel equipped to propose anything. I just wanted to state sort of the obvious thing, which is: that is the other way to deal with the source of pollution right and, of course, the other. The other extension is to go to electric vehicles, but I do not see that happening. Mr Newmark yeah, I'm for those of you who may not be aware of it. There are local community groups in some of the wealthier parts of the community district and adjacent community districts that have formed the coalition. That's been working on the issue of the BQE they've, probably been focused more on, what's going through the wealthier areas like Brooklyn heights, in particular, but they're, conscious of the effect of the highway on the entire range of Brooklyn through which it runs. So they would be. I mean if the Community board ever wanted to do something in terms of public education or broaden the discussions about options. That coalition would be a very good coalition to connect with just wanted to add that, and I have that information since I'm a member of that coalition, because of a local co-, op group that I belong to representing Concord village. Okay, so would you suggest supporting that commission further or taking some other steps to make sure that they're that to mitigate the pollution? Somehow I do not know that I feel comfortable, even though I'm a member of the coalition. I do not think I feel member comfortable as a member of this committee to suggest that it considers supporting that coalition, because you guys do not know enough about it. So that would not. I do not think it would be appropriate at this time, but if we could figure out a statement, a strong statement along the lines of what I said before Jessica spoke very well about the effects of it as to John, and I do think it's a it's more important than some of the other environmental areas that we focused on. I think, if we focus on the big things and actually try to make something happen, instead of trying to have a big laundry list be more effective. I have a suggestion along the lines of what was saying. Okay, what if we, what if we propose that only high occupancy vehicles outside of trucks, because you know that's a big thing- that's the big polluter right, but passenger vehicles. What if we say that only high occupancy vehicles would be allowed on the BQE as a way to mitigate the, and I guess we just get a lot of high occupancy vehicles, so I guess that's no solution at all yeah. I would rather let I do not. I do not have a lot of confidence in the process as it currently stands, but I do not think this is the place that we should be thinking through what the solutions to the BQE could be, because I think Alejandro's point my brothers have said too: is that, like the BQE being where it is and having the traffic that it does, is just really one component of rethinking what it even what purpose it serves? So I agree we should address it. I just I do not know that we should come up with solutions for it. If that makes sense in our statement and again I would just say the coalition has come up with a number of solutions. They've spent a lot of money on having different designs and having different consultants. Look at it there's a lot of information there. If you I mean, I could send you some links, if you guys would like to look at it further, that would work probably would be helpful, yeah. Okay, so I mean I'm getting sort of a feeling that we are. We are not a hundred percent in favor of creating a specific district need about the Cantilever issue. I mean, I think it clearly is an issue that has an environmental impact. I would probably I maybe we do something at a higher level which which suggests that the city take steps to address the environmental impact pollution from vehicles and reduce and reduce the pollution without going into detailed specifics. Does that sound like something that we could do? I just want to say, while we think of what the committee is going to say that the transportation committee should be addressing the cantilever itself, and so you know if a statement is going to come from the committee on that issue, it could simply be about how, as I think you just said how to reduce the impact of pollution from it. You know right, but the transportation committee would be much more specific. I think in means of reducing okay, so I do not know if everybody has access to the Google Doc where all of these things are categorized, but I could type this one out for it for you, I, as just as a suggestion that so maybe what we want to say is that the can, I suggest something I I'm thinking that maybe we say something higher level like the triple Cantilever project. Produ provides a risk of a severe environmental impact from the pollution of numerous vehicles that would be transiting through our community district near residential housing and commercial businesses. The city should this: the city should examine the environmental impact statement, that's produced from the from the Department of Transportation's decision with how to proceed on the project and take all necessary or take all steps possible to mitigate the environmental pollution impact of the project to- and I think that's probably about. As far as I can say, based on the information that I have, does anybody have any other thoughts on that? On that point, I think that's great yeah, John I'll give you I'll give you a brief point. Thank you. I think, along the lines of what I heard Barry saying and what I heard Carol Anne, saying I'm not sure with this issue, but I concentrate just on the cantilever, and it just occurred to me that one of the things that I, when I spoke too long about this issue, might not be a bad idea to put out there, even if it's not so doable, maybe because it is a wacky idea, but it's not so wacky, because my big boss, the mayor, is moving this way with the city's fleet of vehicles. Another thing that is that by a certain date, all city. So what if we made a suggestion based upon the impact of the BQE through the district and because it's not just a Brooklyn issue, it's an issue in this city that the city consider requiring that all purposes either be hybrid or be electric by a certain date to reduce the amount of particulate matter. The amount of lead amount of carbon dioxide, because they can't do that as a city. They can require that its residents who are registered and have a vehicle in that city. It meets certain standards of a vehicle, just a suggestion. Okay, I mean I can appreciate that point and just want to make sure I get my statement correct on that. I'm pasting in a additional action that I created on this on this issue, so certainly we'll impact we'll take any further steps from that in terms of your hybrid and electronic and electric vehicle proposal John from is there anyone else on the committee who is supportive or against that idea? I just want to. I want to add this amount of traffic on the BQE comes from other states that are making deliveries into this city also particularly new Jersey. So I number one I affect not to. I do not think it is the time to take a stand on requiring something like that: there's no infrastructure to support electric vehicles in New, York City and to expect people to buy expensive electric vehicles and then have to deal with fueling them. I do not think it's reasonable at this time and I do not think it's our place to make that kind of recommend. I would not agree with that recommendation in my Spirit John as an individual, but I get it. That's why I said up front. It was a wacky idea. It's not wacky. It's not worth whacking the facts. It's not implementable! It's not! I do not think I do not think we take that stand at this time. That's all yeah! Okay, so I think we've resolved that point. Were there any other thoughts about the statement that I've put in the chat here about the environmental Impact Statement Barry is in favor. I've got that. Thank you very much. Okay, brandon. I want to see it that it reads as if what we're saying is that it should take into account that, if the impacts of pollution from this project alone, right as opposed to from the BQE, is that what you mean? Yes, I think that the BQE is, I think the BQE is I mean the BQE is the is the project and I, and certainly the larger aspect of that can be referenced too, because the B2B itself does have environmental impact. I think the project produced has sort of a critical importance this year. For us to think about so maybe we can add that maybe we can add something to this statement to say a little bit more broadly, that the city should examine the environmental impact statement that is produced for the triple cantilever project, as well as the environmental impact of the BQE highway more generally, and take all possible steps to mitigate the impacts of pollution for this project and from this highway very well put Mr, Chair, okay and I think Alejandro's added a point to this, to sort of get at some of the thoughts that you had John, which I think is very diplomatic to add that were that there should also be consideration for ways to reduce pollution, including reduction of vehicular traffic, all right, but it gives them a little leeway so we're not requiring right safety standards and emission standards right. Okay. So I think then, at this point, unless anyone has another thought we should, we can proceed to take a vote. Oh wait, solar power, the 2030 project. I know that's something that is important for us to think about. We can add that to that, to that to that point as well too, I'm not sure I know what transgeneration is Dan. Do you want to take that one sorry, it is a type of power energy that the Clinton hill slash cooperative apartments installed into their development that saved a lot of on their energy and energy bills. I'm I can't go into detail about it. Mr do you know all about it because he did not care at the time. So that's something that you might want to explore as far as you know, advocating more for that in larger developments. Consideration. Thank you. Sorry, you're right, the proper terminology is co- generation, it's co- generation. What it does is it allows you to produce heat and I guess cooling too. Probably if you have that in your system and also create some electricity as part of it, it's a it's a huge project for buildings to take on, and you know, with the local law, that's been passed, 97 and some of those other local laws that have to do with energy savings. The city is really moving towards wanting everybody to use electricity right. Large residential buildings, so even the co- generation in which you're using natural gas they're moving away even from natural gas, which is a great option that buildings like mine, have moved to 100, but the city's not satisfied with that. The city wants everybody to use electric power based on our reject whatever that term is called now. Nuclear energy, Wind, Power, solar power stuff like that. That's renewable instead of using fossil fuel, so cogeneration is really falling by the way. Sorry because it's not going to solve a building's problem in terms of how much it's going to owe the city if it does not meet the guidelines by 2024 and 2030., so sorry to talk that much about it. No, it sounds very interesting. It sounds really interesting are we are we are we are, but are we still on the topic of the BQE, because I feel like we're on a different thing here now we're talking about power generation and the proliferation of these other types of power sources, which are which are very interesting, and do we want to take that somewhere with the co- generation and with the solar power? In terms of promoting the greater use of that in our community yeah, I would not talk about cogeneration personally, but I would talk about promoting renewable energy sources as being something that would be very helpful for our community history, because this is another topic I want to just give the opportunity, the members of the committee to comment in favor or object to anything about that talking about increased use of renewable energy sources and as a potential district need. I think we could just say something very general about supporting initiatives to. I do not know, engage homeowners really well. No, ultimately, we should be requiring all new development to be driven by renewable energy. I think we are not at a point where we could say that, so maybe we just say something broader and also, but it's like we incur, you know supporting programs that incentivize homeowners and commercial and residential real estate developers to prioritize that sounds perfect. Is there some way we can tie that in as well to a budget request? It's just it. It's just always a good idea. If the needs also can translate into budget requests. That's all right who what would you be requesting from who on this one carolyn? I do not know it could be that you asked the city to subsidize the installation of renewable energy supply. It could be about educational programming and in that way, is an expense item. You know, I agree with the education part. It seems that there's still a lot of sort of consciousness or sort of awareness that needs to happen around this particular issue and how to transition. I agree that once there's kind of a you know a push for it, that the city should subsidize it or the state, and I do not know where that would go, but but it still seems that the city should maybe make more of an effort to educate people, so that folks are more willing to switch over this sort of thing all right. So I think maybe we would be in line with something along the lines. The city should devote funding to provide educational programming about the use of to promote the use of renewable energy, renewable energy sources. Right. Does that sound like something that we would all support? Yep? I want to do justice to this other suggestion that Nana's put in here about flooding resiliency, and I think we were done a few years since we had super storm safety and the environmental impacts of that, and I just remember looking at the map that I got from the city of the most affected flood areas and seeing how certain communities were so much more disproportionately impacted than other communities as a result of the storm, and here there's room for another item Alejandro. I just want to cover this issue off about flooding and storm resiliency. Is there something that we should that that we can say around greater preparedness, greater education, greater resources? Should we build a flood wall for local low- lying areas in our community and or are there any other thoughts on how we could potentially address some of the impact of having another major storm? I mean. The thing I always think of is that these big buildings, like I'll, take 80 Flatbush as an example like that are being built right near major transit quarters are not required to do any sort of green infrastructure support. I do not know for lack of a better term. I mean we eventually. Ideally, there would be a requirement that, if you're building something that has been, you know based on something based on land being rezoned, that you would have to do something like add bioswales to the to Flatbush or some way that could be measured. That's proportionate to the development, because the issue of a lack of flooding infrastructure is coming from higher levels like physically higher levels of the land in the district, and then we like Dumbo will be fine. I know that's not really to say but like it has been kind of shored up since Sandy. It's areas that are frankly, less privileged where there is not sufficient infrastructure to protect people from flooding. So I do not know if that's in our purview but like, ideally, we would be able to. I do not know advocate, for you know, as part of frankly, the land use process that developers are required to do something to prevent flooding elsewhere in the district. No, I think that you're on the right track, with what you're, with what you're saying the only thing is that, like as much as I'd love to require the developers to do these things we're talking about what we can ask the city to do. Yeah I mean we can ask the maybe DEP to test the impact of flooding upon a says, the impact of flooding on the district broadly and identify opportunities for green infrastructure district- wide, and then at least we could say if we see some massive development going on Flatbush, we could say: hey like we need bioswales. We need permeable pavement like the basics at that time. Okay, all right, one. Second, just going to check to make sure I can smell Spell Bios walls, correctly e I, o S W, a l e. You know I should not have been so reticent. I did spell it correctly. I forgot one of my question marks. Okay, I think we got an additional one there, alejandro you had mentioned that you had another idea. Yeah I mean I was I was just going to. I think we've talked about this before and I know a lot of the infrastructure, especially subways, but for mass transit. You know they've been able to avoid the ADA act because they were created beforehand. I'm just curious about what plans of any exist and what we could push for, or is it a lost cause in terms of making subway stations in our district, more ADA compliant, you know and accessible in general. That was that I'm completely on board with this. But caroline is this: is this the purview of the transportation committee, these improvements to subway stations, because I feel, like that's, really come out of that committee- a lot in recent history? It is probably more transportation, but I think from looking at it as the human resource part of our social services, part of our portfolio. We could probably figure out a way to phrase it as such Mr chair, because it's addressing people's with disabilities, it's related to mobility. That's a health issue, Mr Chair! Okay, that's a fair point: Barry John! I heard you I heard you also. I was saying I think Mr Andrews has a point: okay, oh Mr. Andrews, hey go ahead. They are working on that as we speak, because I'm on the team, where, with Alex Allen Guten and everybody else, we have a committee that oversees MTA and they are working on. They have 50 stations that are done. They may not necessarily be in our district, but they are working on that. But Pat Foye came out and said well if we do not get this bail out from the from the federal government that they're going to they're going to they're going to have to cut those projects, but they are still working on those projects, not necessarily in our district. But if we put a list together of stations in our district, you should be able to carolyn should be able to forward those over to Rachel at MTA. But I do not know if they're going to get those. I do not know where they are, but I can get some details and get back to you guys on that. Okay, so I'm just going to throw down my home station, because I absolutely feel it's disgraceful that the high Street subway station entrance near our wonderful are our wonderful. Our wonderful home, very Concord, village, the escalator, is constantly broken and it baffles my mind. In fact, it does not baffle my mind. It's just tragically awful that no one who experiences a physical disability in some capacity can get down there when the when the escalator is broken and they're just perpet they've been perpetually fixing it for some time now. I say that with a grain of salt, because I have not accessed that subway station since March because of the pandemic, but it never seemed to get any better and there were always people who were there replacing it, and I mean it would be wonderful if they put an elevator in the station. But you know at least having a functioning escalator was a an issue of access. I felt and actually now Mr chair with the new app that just launched my MTA. You can actually report these things and then the dashboards that let you know when the elevators are done as well as I believe the experts I'm not too sure, but you can look at the my Nba App and speak, but they just did some updates to that. For the elevator dashboard, I do not know about the expert, I'm not too sure victor's right and I think the escalators are listed also, but it's our station and it's also J street, which is at York and J, both highly populated highly used, at least before the Corona virus, and hopefully after the Corona virus, and they both need a tremendous amount of work. That's transportation, but it's also health yeah. No, it's almost like. Where do we start because Evans Street Borough Hall, Clark Street? They all they all need significant repairs associated with them in different ways and they all have their own impacts upon access and how you're putting in a new elevator by Borah Hall we've been working on that for a while. I know that the club's food is scheduled. Mr chair, I think perhaps we should make a statement that says: Handicap accessibility is a right and therefore elevators should be installed throughout the district yeah. I would support that. Mr Chair Mr Jet. What about mentioning about Mrs Goodman? Who actually fell down the stairs and with the baby? So can we say something about that? Maybe that'll make them put an element. I do not know so. This was this happened earlier in the year right. There was that incident. Where someone fell down the stairs yeah. You know the term. The term we might want to use is universal access, which, in the mobility world means that it should be accessible for everyone, regardless of ability. So you know the same. The same thing that you need for a parent with a stroller is the same that you need for the person who has a cane or a walker or a wheel, yep. Okay, so I think we can say generally. Universal access must be established in every subway station throughout community district 2. really beyond, but we're speaking on behalf of we're. We can only speak on behalf of our areas. Do we want to be specific on the universal access, including elevators and escalators access right? I just feel like it opens the opportunity for a response to be provided that does not fully satisfy what we would think is universal access, granted the idea that the chances we're going to get universal access as a result of this. Well, maybe you could say, including elevators on escalators. That's what that's what I was thinking. Yes, I would want to be fair to anyone who disagrees with you, though yeah well, I do not mind being unfair. Well, you know even an example of universal access. Just earlier this year at the J Street Station Subway Station a J street Metro Tech the they put down the oh gosh. Why can't I remember the name of it now, but they put down a floor treatment that allows visually impaired people to tell where they are, and also for people who may have low vision that their stripes that lead in one direction. So all that is by universal access right yeah. That was called the J Street project, that's what they called it yeah, but I can't remember the name of the treatment for some reason, but yeah the same thing they put on the side room. Sorry, victor yeah, it was, it was tactile, warning strips, that's what they use tactile strips brandon. Maybe you could tell all methodologies that contribute to universal access, something like that: okay Mr child one. I was wondering Mr Chair. How many actual stations are in CB2? There's got to be at least six or seven. I would think, oh many more than that, much more than that. That's just downtown! That's right! You got so many lines that come through right, but okay, so I've got that statement. Also, I was going to say what we probably need more than anything as I'm looking at the time is probably just a defined area, a defined sense of what we're talking about and the language itself to be worked on later. If you guys do not mind, no, I Mr chair. I think we have the defined sense right. We've talked about a lot of issues and there seems to be a lot of fun. There seems to be much more agreement than disagreement right yeah I would say so. I think we've agreed on what were the most important issues for the most part, and I was prepared that we could take a vote on these issues plus what we've already raised in the Google Doc. Does anybody have an objection to that approach? Mr Harrison! You have an objection or you would agree, move that, based upon the discussion, we've had the notes, you've taken and the Google Doc that we adopt our. I think we've already had quite a bit: okay, I'll roll call everybody to make sure that just cobb Mr Newmark in paper, Mr, Harrison, Hey, Mr, Varela, Miss Thurston in Favor and Miss Richardson in Favor and Mr Andrews favor great. I think I got everybody great, so we've completed that item of our agenda and we can move on to the next item, which is the lawyer one for us all. The liquor license. Reviews now in terms of the licenses listed here, the first one on the agenda is entitled: oops ella at 86, South Portland Avenue, it's a full- on premise. Do we have a representative here for this application? I'm here sorry who I'm here, Kelly Brody, hello, Kelly? How are you I'm great thanks for your time, thanks for thanks for joining us? Do you? Is there a copy of the application that was sent to the district office or to someone caroline? Has it or I can share my screen? Whichever is easier, we love Kelly, Cher, okay, so we're going to have Kelly share the application. Okay, she has access great, give me just a Sec here, I'm seeing an in a connectivity issue on Kelly's line, so it might be a little slow. It's showing us connecting here, yeah it took it took a little bit the last time we did this with emily. Here comes Kelly. It's loading right now. Let me know when you can see not quite yet it says still loading. What type of document is this pdf? Oh, that should be faster. Thank you webex! Oh there it is, we can see you there you go. Shall I begin or do we begin with questions remind me? No, if you can give a brief overview of your presentation or of your of your establishment and then I just need to be able to figure out how to view this myself there it is there. It is excellent cool yeah yeah. If you can give a brief overview as to what your application, what your, what your establishment does, what are the hours? What have your interactions been with, neighbors and and what kind of facility you've got in terms of indoor outdoor seating and any noise issues? That would be probably the best presentation that we can take a few questions from here sure. So some, if not all of you, may remember that I presented before the board. In February of this year, we were originally considering a space on Myrtle Avenue, 347 myrtle, that was in February once Covid-19 hit in March. All of those plant plans fell apart. We are now leasing the former Pequena space at 86, south Portland. Our bar restaurant is a wholly owned subsidiary of a 501c3, not not-, for- profit that was developed to benefit women in New, York City, all of our profits. After we have paid fair wages and taxes and expenses will be donated to said not-, for- profit and distributed to other 501c3s, predominantly in Brooklyn, but all throughout New York City. What else can I answer for you? The space was operating as a restaurant. Up until a few months ago, we are actually, since it is still permitted. We have purchased the business entity that was operating there and aimed to be up and running sooner than later, with our new application, with the existing license. As far as sounds, there will be very minimal construction because it was basically turnkey. We have hired a sound engineer who will help to just make sure that we are not any more disruptive than the previously licensed place has been to the residential neighbors. There is no outdoor space at the location we will, depending on how soon we can get the liquor license. Active we and whether or not the governor extends the open streets, roadway dining. We will aim to take advantage of that, but the space does not have any dedicated outdoor facilities. We are calling ourselves an all- day lounge, so we are going to open as early as seven A.M we're on that corner, where the green Grape Annex just closed. So there's kind of a lag in the coffee service in the neighborhood. It's located between two subway stations, so we plan to open as early as seven A.M for coffee and cafe service and then continue through the evening the hours you should be able to see them there. These are obviously like a post, Covid-19, fantasy time open and closing times that we've posted here. Obviously, venues are only allowed to be open until 11 P.M. At this point, this is kind of a guesstimation to see for what we would aim for once indoor dining returns in any capacity. There are a total of 30 seats and again there are no outdoor seats. So I do not know if I'm the only one who is experiencing this, but I can not see Saturday and Sunday on that presentation. It's there. Okay, so other others can see this. I see it Brandon yep! Oh! This is interesting. Sorry, if it's helpful saturday, it would be 7 am to 2 A.M yeah. I see that I see that yeah. I just do not see Sunday what are the hours on Sunday and I'm sorry Saturday, okay, with obviously the alcohol service beginning at noon. Okay, yeah great cool, so questions from members of the committee observation I'm going to go with question. First, Mr Alejandro had a question. So do you want to take the floor? Yeah thanks. I'm just curious. No outdoor, no outdoor space is that correct. I can't believe I asked I'm very familiar with the space and just around employment. We. This has no bearing on your application, just curious how many people you expect to employ. So I actually would like to talk a little bit about the employment. As you guys discussed earlier, when we were pursuing the space on Myrtle Avenue. I worked very closely with chad, perky at the Myrtle Avenue Bid, and one of the great disparities. I would say that changed once we were no longer in the myrtle Avenue Bid and we're now covered by the Fab Fulton bid is that Myrtle Avenue offered us a lengthy list of resources to assist in hiring locally and a diverse workforce. They we set up an apprenticeship. We were planning on taking advantage of the apprenticeship program that they offered. They were offered to do like a open house hiring session for us, and so when we identified this new location on South Portland, I contacted Christina Chavez at the Fab fulton bid and they offered nothing of the sort. So, as the committee was previously discussing the lack of hiring and the lack of diversity, that is evident in the very saturated dekalb avenue side of the park where all of these food and beverage entities are exist, but they are not hiring from the local community. It seems like a disservice that the job seekers on the myrtle avenue side of the park are not solicited for open positions by the Fulton Business district, since it's all since it has such a higher concentration of food and beverage as well as retail outlets. So, as I mean from the beginning, we created this brand to be able to give back and to be able to put women and minorities in positions to succeed, and so that was always something that we pursued and it was kind of shocking. When once we moved from the Myrtle Avenue bid to the fab fulton, there was no support in that department and, as we talk about restaurants and bars struggling through the current pandemic and the bandwidth and the resources that these business owners have to contribute to finding a diverse workforce is limited, and it seems to me that there could be additional support to make sure that these positions are advertised and offered to local members of the community. Thank you very much for that explanation. I really appreciate knowing that and I wonder if down the road, there are ways that maybe we can connect with fab, to encourage them to provide those resources and or just to have this open conversation now I'll share with you. What we've always shared again we're not. We do have in CB2 an employment committee and we're not that committee, but I have always suggested that posting it used to be fortune Snap, which is no longer no longer accessible because of Dr Glow's passing. But the Ingersoll community center has a job board, I believe, or in the past they did and we would send folks there and our contact, who is the board member? That is it is who works as oh, my gosh. I forgot her name anyway. She would always. Oh it's closed. Tanya says: okay. Well, I'm sorry to hear that we would always just encourage folks to post at Ingersoll, Whitman and Farragut, but I do not. I do not have an answer now, for that does anyone else want to chime in Carol Anne? I do not know. I just want to say Fab's defense. It's two different types of entities. Fab is a bid in its creation, while the Martial Avenue bid was not just a bid, it was also it also had the myrtle Avenue Revitalization program, which was charged with doing different types of work that you know sort of seemed seamless to the public. But there were two organizations working together to make that happen. Understood perfect, it's a little different, miss brody. I think I'm remembering your presentation. Now from back in February. I wanted to confirm whether we have did you have the same hours for the other place back then, as you have for this one. This one has earlier opening hours and the Friday Saturday Sunday hours or two hours later and again. This is, I do not actually intend to be open that late, but since we do not know what a post Covid-19 world looks like or how desperate we will be for cash. At that point, I just wanted to have the option to be able to serve. Should we decide to stay open that late, any other questions from members of the community? I'm sorry from the committee just an observation: Mr Chair go ahead: Mr Harrison, eight o'clock in the morning it's pretty early to be serving alcohol, a lot of times alone. What's that 8 A.M is the time that the State Liquor Authority allows Alcohol service to begin. We just set it up to be completely aligned with those hours so that we have the option once we have a better understanding of what a post- covered world looks like and we do not know if the to- go options are going to continue. So if somebody wanted to pick up a gift on their way to work and grab a bottle of wine from us outside of the train station, we'd like to have that option until we have a better understanding of what food and beverage service looks like going forward, I think what we're approving here is not is not necessarily the to- go aspect, but the full- on premise, alcohol service. So, and just to be clear on that point, but I did want to ensure that everyone had their questions asked. Was there any other member of the committee who had a question on the application? Mr Newmark Miss Brodie? Let's assume that there are any problems with neighbors, but if any came up, what would be your approach? My personal phone number is currently on the website and will remain on the business cards that are available in the venue. So I would encourage all residents or customers with any sort of concerns to have direct access to ownership, so that there's no confusion about messages getting lost between ownership and management and the neighborhood and the customers. So I intend to be the direct contact for any concerns by the neighborhood. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions from the committee hearing. None seeing none are there any questions from the members of the public who are attending the meeting. If you can raise your hand that way, Mr Chair, Mr, Andrews, Mr Andrews. Yes, sorry question! I wonder if that establishment is weirdly accessible, okay, listen, Miss Brodie! Would you be able to address whether the establishment that you have is ADA or accessible or wheelchair accessible? Surprisingly, none of the three food and beverage restaurants on that one block are wheelchair accessible entirely. We are changing the grade at the slope so that the so that you have wheelchair access into the venue. However, I'm still waiting for kind of plans from the architect about changing the bathroom to the 88. That's good yeah. He dig do that. Quick, that's going to be a problem! You have a whole body, would you be fighting outside? You do not Wanna. Do that? That's bad! I understand the entire space is only 565 square feet and its width is only 11 feet. So getting that an eight foot, ADA bathroom has been a challenge. Again. There was a restaurant operating there for years without accessibility, it is a priority for us all changes that are logistically feasible. But at this point I can't guarantee that there will be an ADA assessment. It's 11 feet wide. Okay, I'm sorry! What was the question? I'm sorry, it's 11 feet wide. It is because part of the I'm not sure I'm going going to explain this correctly. I can share a floor plan. The there is what looks like a sidewall cafe: that's actually contained within the property line, so part of the space indoor outdoor with a permanent enclosure. So the indoor space is only what's available to be used to add a restroom, obviously, and that depth is only 11 feet. Essentially, half of the space is an enclosed glass front, so we can't put a restroom there. So what is fully enclosed as an interior is what's left for us to arrest her, but, as I mentioned literally, nobody else on the block has any sort of wheelchair accessibility which stood out as a glaring thing when we originally went and saw the speed, so the plans are already in to make all of the changes that are straightforward. I do not have final plans for my architect about fitting in an ADA bathroom, a kitchen and storage in 565 square feet. Okay, I think that, to summarize what you're saying then Miss brody is that you've made an attempt to get ADA accessible features to the to the restaurant. There are some challenges presenting yourself presenting themselves with the bathroom. Are you saying that the bathroom is not going to happen or that it's looking like it may not happen? The plan is for it to happen. I just would not want to guarantee it to you, because I know that there are two different architect firms still consulting about the best way to do it. So I do not have concrete plans that I could say are: okay, all right, all right great. That helps I appreciate you clarifying, because I think everybody we have some. We have interest to know where it stands, and I think that that's a good explanation of that other questions from members of the committee for this application. Okay, I do not see any members of the community, I'm sorry. I just want to ask for the members of the community at this point to if there are any other members who have questions about this application who are not from the committee, I do not see any hands raised on this from the members of the community. Now before I ask, if we have a motion, did you want to add something? Mr Harrison? If you could do something? No, I did not have a that was not me Mr, chair, oh okay, was that you Mr Andrews yeah. Oh sure, sorry, I'm just I'm just wondering. Can we ask that if it is done that they can? Let us know if and when that solidifies, that possible we'd be happy to okay? I think I think we have the end, so you you'll provide an update to the to the board office about the outcome of the the issue with the ADA accessible bathroom. Thank you and again it is of the most important to us. That's why we're changing the slope at the entrance to the grade. These are things that were taken into account from the outset. It's just. I would not want to misrepresent and guarantee you that it is done and happening before I have those signed off plans. Okay, we appreciate the transparency and I think from here I'll ask if anyone on the committee has a motion for this application. I'll move to approve the application. Okay have a second, I have a second. I heard it and saw and saw it at the same time. So I can't ignore what I heard: Mr Harrison I'll, give you the second I'm Sorry Miss Richardson, oh no, that was Mr anders that was Mr Andrews, I'm sorry I'll give Mr Andrews the second then okay, discussion on the motion hearing none take a vote. I'll come back for Miss Cobb when she returns Mr Harrison Mr Cobb. Is there Mr chair? I know I'm starting with you. How do you vote? I think I'm going to abstain. Okay, Mr this person abstains Mr Varela. I support it and I just want to add, as I said in my note, that I'm sorry that we miss Brodie, that we can offer more resources on local hiring practices that would be active for our community, but I just hope that you know you know you heard us that it is a problem and in any way that you can contribute to the solution would be. You know, we'd greatly appreciate it again bearing on replication. We absolutely will make everything that is a large part of our goal. Okay, best of luck, Mr Varela in Favor, Mr, Newmark, Hey, Ms Cobb. I got that as this cobb is in favor Miss Thurston in favor, okay, Mr, Andrews, favor, great and Miss Richardson, Favor, okay, great I'm in favor as well too, so we are unanimous with one abstention. Thank you very much and best of luck to you and we'll look forward to hearing more about and with your business great. Thank you all right. Moving to the next item on the agenda we've got. Let's see, I remember one of these was laid over and one of these is here. Is it 224, green or 68 burgundy who's here, 68, okay, so 224 green is laid over for this month and we'll go to 68. I'm sorry, let me get it correct. 68 Bergen, Street bar baloo, it's actually barbaloo there's they threw an extra a in there. Okay, barbaloo Spar baloo. My name is Bob. Callahan from my Kelly's office with me is the owner of Stefano Barbagallo hi everybody. So basically, this is an on- premise. Liquor license application, we're located at 68 bergen between Smith and Court Street we're a full- service. Italian restaurant we'll have 19 tables with 46 seats and a seat bar we'll be applying for a sidewalk cafe with 10 tables and 24 seats, which is what the previous place before us had and in the same footprint we'll be open from 11 to 11 seven days a week. So there are no late nights and we'll only provide background music to the indoor dining. The previous occupant was Numero 28. At that space they had a full liquor license, I believe from 2015 and then broken English was before them. They also had an on- premise: liquor license. So Stefano has been in the business for 20 years. He's a very experienced operator has operated other restaurants in the city. One was Paprika on St Mark's place. Another was barbalou at 225 front street in downtown Manhattan, so he has a lot of experience. He's a professional restaurant tour that knows how to operate an establishment with a full liquor license. So if you have any questions, we'd be glad to answer them great, the upstairs neighbors at that location. Have you have you spoken to them? Have there been any issues or concerns raised? I think there's like a second floor at this location above this there's a two apartment on the second two or three apartment. On the second floor, and I introduced myself to the tenants they are rental apartment and that's where we're at now. Okay, I need to get that part. Okay, Carol Ann, I believe, Mike had emailed you signatures earlier today. Yeah I'm just trying to. We do not really show the signatures. I do have a copy with me, so I just wanted to make sure that you had them. Yes, I do. Thank you. Okay, all right! Well, we're looking this up. Are there any questions from the members of the committee for this application? I'm sorry! When do you plan to open the place? I think it will be ready by end of October is obviously everything depends on indoor dining at this time I still operate my other place, which is called also Barbalou in the financial district. So here I have some outdoor table, but if we do not get outdoor table, I may keep this close until we can operate indoors because it's going to get too cold, obviously to work outside, but hopefully by the end of October. We should be ready. Thank you. Thank other you, members of the committee, okay, Mr Andrews. Yes, I'm just wondering: if does he have accessible? There is a menu or one bathroom in his restaurant that he's working on. There is two bathrooms and there are wheelchair, accessible and there's a large front. So there's one door that is with a ramp and it can be open and become a wheel which are accessible. The main door is a little stacked, so wheelchair can actually can access the space opening a secondary window or door, which is already there is existing, but it's normally characterized. Okay, if I remember correctly, this location had issue their previous, which again is not I'm not that on you. This location has had issues in the past where many complaints about the outdoor cafe, I realize in Covid-19 times the outdoor cafe, issues are probably taken on a different dimension, so I do not. I just want to know if, if anyone in the committee can maybe speak to that and whether the signatures include upstairs neighbors, if the complaints were in fact coming from them just so that you're aware that there have been there have, there was contention between previous owners and the media neighbors around the use of the outside space. Well, we my office is aware of it, because we had represented that gentleman as well the complaints. I believe were going past, the battlefields that he was supposed to be, and they had this enormous white picket fence around it which took up some room as well. I know that was a problem at one point: miss church if we received a substantial number of complaints about Numero, 28 or broken English in the past- and you do you recall anything about that. Actually, I would say we have not received anything in a couple of years: okay, Mr Chair, I'm not personally aware of any but Mr Harrison yeah. It was a while ago. It's this is actually to Caroline was one of those the entity in which we had a meeting with a. I think it's not being too much for drama queen to say it was a vast number of people it came from the community. Is this the same entity? No, it's not! Okay, right, okay, good! What are you talking about? Smith Street? I would like to mention that I've been living for 23 years on the same block, so I'm pretty much part of the community. My three kids goes to school in the public school in the community and I'm I live on the same exact block like I'm living on bergen between Smith and Court. I mean just to mention so Mr Barbaga, yes, one second Mr Harrison, I heard you, but I saw Mr Newmark get his hand up too, and I wanted to give him a chance to speak yeah. I assume what I'm going to hear is positive. Based on that, but I'm going to ask you the same question. I asked the Pri prior applicant if there were complaints from the community about either the outdoor space or anything related to your new establishment. How would you go about responding to those complaints? I want to work with the community. The community will be my my customer base, so I have all the interest in working with the community. I want to make a place where this community oriented and where everybody in the neighborhood will feel welcome, and that's only the only thing I can say I mean I obviously want to work and try to address any complaint. Okay, thank you and my second question is: I always forget: if 11 A.M 11 P.M is permitted for outdoor spaces, but let's assume it is, would you would you consider closing earlier Monday through Thursday, no problem, no problem, my place in a seaport in South Street, civil financial district, close at 10 o'clock every night I open it until 11, only Friday and Saturday, so Stephanie Stefano you're talking about the outdoor space yeah I mean during the week. I have no problem with closing okay at 10 o'clock. I do not want to work late, I'm fine with the closing at 10 o'clock. Yes, thank you. So if you'll recommend your application to that effect, yeah we'll do Sunday to Thursday 10 o'clock and Friday Saturday 11 right. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Are there any other questions from the members of the committee? Mr Varela just curious. How many people you expect to employ? I predict I mean if things improve and I'll be able to do a good job. I think we'll be around 20 people I mean to cover to shift. I will need at least 20 people growing in a similar in a similar space right now, full employment. I was around 25 right now. I have a little bit less because of only outdoor timing, but you know I hope, to be able to employ at least 20 people and again you heard the conversation earlier. All the while. I just want to see the same encouragement and say that I believe that the Gowanus housing has a community center at Hoyt and Baltic. So if you feel like you, think that might be helpful to post for employment there, I encourage it. Okay, no bearing thank you any other questions for this applicant from the committee. Just an observation or just a comment. Mr chair. I think I speak out of turn and we would be very pleased to see that you hire from communities and that your staff in fact reflects that okay Mr chair as it applies to the good questions that my colleagues asked. The obvious one to me is that Stefano can run, but he can't hide. He lives on the same block exactly okay. Thank you, Mr, Harrison, to the extent that we still have a few left in the in the meeting. Are there any questions for this application right? I do not see any hands raised at this point I'll ask. If anyone on the committee has a motion regarding this application, this Mr Harrison. Is there it's mostly your motion. Okay, he's moving to approve. Is there a second checking from Mr Newmark? I see Mr Newmark a second discussion on the motion hearing, none. How do you vote Ms Cobb approve Dr Harrison in Favor, Mr Newmark, Proof, Mr Varela in Favor, Miss Thurston, Miss, Richardson, Favor, Gotcha, Mr Andrews. I did not quite hear you Mr Andrews, sorry, favorite! Okay, did I get you also Mr Newmark Mr Newmark approves hey, so we're unanimous on this one. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much and just on a quick personal note, it's great to see the committee again and I'm glad to see everybody looks healthy and happy you. Thank you, hello to Mr Kelly. I will see you soon right, stay safe! Thank you all right! Well, it's been a while, since we've done this but we're up to the renewals, we have five renewals on the calendar tonight. 81 wait. We have a restaurant wine, we have a restaurant is laid over well. The restaurant weight is waved and not laid over ah very good: okay Renewals 81 Washington Avenue Westfield Dumbo, 89,892, 892.99 street sisters, 243 decal romans, 445, gold, the Alamo Draft House and 97 Hoyt, aka 348 Atlantic Miss church. Do we have any complaints or concerns that have been expressed on these app on these renewals? None? Okay, any other comments from the committee on any of the renewals. Not hearing any. Can I get a motion on the renewals moved by Mr Harrison. We have a second. Anyone want a second Mr Varela seconds, great discussion hearing none. I think we can do this by a general consensus, but I'll ask Mr Ant Mr Andrews. How do you vote on the renewals? It's a goal. Mr chair, we go oh Mr! Varela! You see you reminded me. I should check with the community. I got on this one. Does anyone from the community have any concerns about this one? These are the five renewals I listed not seeing anything still, not seeing anything. Okay, I'm going to go back to the to the voting. Can I just get a show of hands from everybody as to their support for this one Miss Richardson, I can't see you so perhaps you could you could announce how you feel about the renewals. I can barely hear you guys, I'm sorry. We can hear you. I can barely hear you. We got you. How do you are you? Do you need any refresher on the renewals or are you? Are you in favor of supporting them, I'm in favor, great okay? So that's unanimous on the renewals right next, we have the approval of the minutes from the August 5th meeting. Does anybody want to make a motion or does anybody feel they have not had enough time I'll give this church? I did you have something you wanted yeah. I just want to make a correction on the spelling of Mr Carabano's name. That's right! It's italian! All! Right now I forgot who had the motion? No one had. That was just a new work. He's got the motion. Broedcast emotion, all seconds to approve the minutes as amended yep second frame Mr Harrison Mr Andrews. Are you in favor of approving the minutes from the August meeting? He should have screamed. He was not there. Okay, Mr Andrews Abstains. Could I ask for a show of hands from everybody else? I abstain. I left Midway okay, so we got two abstentions. We got myself Barry John Acosta Jessica in Favor, Miss Richardson. How do you vote? I would imagine you might abstain as well, because I do not believe you were there at the August meeting. She has a little triangle, which means she has connectivity issues. Okay, we can mark that and I do not know if we mark that as abstaining, but we can I'll just say she did not participate in the vote. Okay, I think that's fair. All right. I believe that passes. Does it not yes? Okay, great the minutes are approved from August all right. Next on the agenda. Is the chairs report I'm going to waive the chairs report tonight, given the late hour, the other business? Do we have anyone who has any other business that they wish to raise here tonight? I just want to make a comment in the interest of transparency. We've been getting complaints from it about 85, Flatbush extension double tower, which hotel is this caroline? It depends on what day it's been. Oh, it's the same. The same hotel, the same hotel, my god. We can't get away from the complaints about this hotel. Is this the one with the outdoor spaces? Yes, and we got them to agree not to do any music? What do what caroline? What are the nature of the complaints? Well, it's that they're doing music on the inside and that the management is not has not been responsive, so I have reached out I'm and I'm still awaiting the attorney is reaching out to the client and we're awaiting a response from them. Okay, I mean this is this is beyond ridiculous at this point, because we've had multiple meetings about this they've come in they've spoken about this yeah, so my biggest concern is the lack of responsiveness right from the management company, even if they do not think that the complaint is warranted, there needs to be a response to the to the residents. So when you're contacting them, Carol Ann, are you what it? What is that is that contact like we're, seeking to try to bring the people together- or I would just think, is there anything that we can do to foster that, like maybe invite them to a meeting, so that we can help yourself again with the community, particularly because we've been conf we've confronted that question before with them? Well, usually, my first step is to get their side of the story and see if we can address it. That way I mean they've used a couple of their free passes, but still we need to hear what it is that they have to say and then take it from there, because there is a signed agreement to what their what they were going to do in terms of managing that space, so they can be held to that. But first we need to hear from them. Okay, so I guess when they respond to the attorney, then they'll follow up with me. Well, what if we do not hear from them, I mean. Is there a point at which we can take a stronger course of action? We wait for the renewal, I mean unless they're doing something that could be really be called illegal. You know it's not going to be easy for us to get any action on that from the authority, so we would have to wait for the renewal and try to impose some stipulations against them right. So we can write. Yes, la excuse me John, I'm sorry. We could not write to the SLA to know that we're concerned about the lack of responsiveness that this organization has provided, given that we have a written document outlining agreed to expectations with regard to performance, that's probably an option. Yes, I would think so, but I think, let's, when was it, you contacted them Carol, Anne, probably about a week ago, at this point: oh okay, so carolyn, so you were trying to get them to come in and meet with us. No I'm trying to hear what they have to say right. You know I like to start from that point right. So I think Barry's point is a good one, but maybe I was reading into what you said, but I was thinking that maybe we could consider the possibility in the future of part of our protocol for entities acting in this manner. Maybe not exactly this not in a great way that we do call them in you know when it looks like, though, is a certain length into the future is sort of far into the future. I do not know if that's constructive or even wanted, but yeah. Well, the this applicant probably was different management. Multiple iterations of different management back at the time had agreed to come back and speak to us about in connection with community and the community came back, but the for the for the meeting that we had agreed to go to, but nobody from management came back. I think we've got to wait. You know Carolina's contacted them a week ago. We should hear what their side of the story is. We should absolutely give them a fair shake in that regard, and, but I think I would this is an ongoing situation. That's been going on in the in that area and, if they're willing to come back to our meeting next month, I'd be open to hearing their side of the story in person and having Mr Vinokum and his organization come in and speak about their side of the story as well too. We've been part of this conversation as well from the point where they originally got a liquor license, and I do not want to lose. I want to. I want to help try to broker the a better solution there in the future and if it has to be that they do not show up- and we end up writing a letter to the state Liquor Authority saying that they're non- responsive when we gave them an opportunity to come to our meeting and they did not show up after not being responsive previously after agreeing to adhere to certain stipulations about ways which then did not get followed. I mean, I think it. I think you know that would be a foreseeable approach in the future, considering all the times that we've dealt with them, but certainly, if there's a reasonable explanation of this and I'll say this- you know if the if the concern is about the music coming from the inside as opposed to the outside, and the concern last time was about the acoustic music. When that was the case, it appears that they are adhering in some respect to the stipulations that we had given them in the past, and that report said acoustic music only and then that we said no music and now they're. Now the music is coming from the inside as opposed to the outside, so I mean definitely give them the benefit of the doubt, but Caroline do you think it's fair to invite back to our next meeting? Yes, I'm actually writing that into the next agenda. As you speak great terrific great. That sounds like a plan thanks for bringing that to our attention and because I mean I know I've wanted. I I've thought about that place several times. Miss Cobb did you have something you wanted to add? What position does the police I'm sure they've called the police? What did what does the police do in a situation like this? Do they take it down? Well, if you have a noise complaint, you call the police. The police should show up and do that whether they actually do that in practice probably depends on their volume of crimes that they need to respond to in some respect. But at the same time I would think if you call 9- 1- 1, then somebody's going to somebody's going to show up not so nice right. If you call 9- 1- 1. Well, no, it's not going to turn up at the top of the priority listing. So that's usually an issue. You know it's a noise complaint right, so they might show up two hours later. The party's over was our former committee members issue right. This was Andrew's issue with a number of entities right. He'd say that you know the police were called. The ADA did not show up until three hours later yeah no noise at all the establishment closed. Well, yes, but I think in this instance you know we we've been down this road with this particular establishment a few times and it you know, hopefully there's a way to work it. Oh yes, I'm concerned that they may not show up at all to our next meeting or be responsive to us, but we'll see Miss Cobb. I did you have something else yeah. I just want to make it quick. So what you're saying when this happens? The only place a person can do only thing they can do is come to the community board. They have no other regret. You know there are a couple of things right if, let's just suppose that the police officers show up- and some can be a little objective and they do not really. As far as I understand, I do not know how much that has changed unless it's really loud they're not going to really do anything beyonce. Can you turn it down from? What I heard in the past is that their decibel readers were not being calibrated on a regular basis, and so that evidence was not permissible in court. I see Mr Harrison shaking his head. He remembers that conversation. So that's another issue as well. No, they did not keep their tool, they did not keep their knives sharpened properly or they did not keep their tires inflated. It was a. It was a technical issue with the tools you're, absolutely correct. For remembering that it came out in our meetings. It came out at Precinct Council. I do not think this is a something that we're going to solve tonight. I think we've got to wait and see what happens with next month and let's pick it up in that discussion. Mr Varela a different item, but I wanted to we're in that other business right, absolutely I'll make it quick, because my back hurts and I really want to go to sleep but the the statement of needs. We took a vote and I wonder if we could amend to add one other thing that I emailed you all already so you I but I it's just. I can read it. It's two sentences go ahead, it's about as it concerns Covid-19 or and future epidemics and or natural disasters like Sandy. I feel, like the city needs to present us their plan of action, so I would like to request. It would like to know what the resiliency and response plans are for future crisis like these. So the request is that the government has had enough time to draft a plan and the community should now have time to view the plans and comment on set plans. This transparency will give the community peaceful alignment more deeply resiliency post disaster or health crises. That makes sense absolutely, and I and I, and I really I it's as simple as that. I just think we should not wait for the next thing. They've had enough time with Sandy had enough time to covered. I think there should be a move to educate us now on what they have learned and what the next time something arises. What it's going to look like on the ground right? I think that Alejandro is spot on. I had thought you had mentioned this when we talked a little bit about the body, I would move that we add this to the statement. District needs yeah. I would agree with that I'll. Second, your motion, and does anybody have any further discussion on this hearing? None. The proposal is to add an additional district need focused on requiring the city to deliver their plan for future pandemics. To us and Alejandro, did I miss anything on that and or something like Sandy like a natural disaster, just what their response and resiliency plans are absolutely responsible about emergency and disaster preparedness? There you go, you always have a way. I got that imperial that we had to pick what we thought were the most important issues under certain categories as an exercise, and that was the one I picked under that particular exercise. So that's why I remembered okay, it's establishing so we're going to do both we're going to do both pandemic and resiliency storm resiliency and the city will be required to deliver us their plan for future events like this, so that we can be assured about our their approach and have greater confidence in them all right for this.
