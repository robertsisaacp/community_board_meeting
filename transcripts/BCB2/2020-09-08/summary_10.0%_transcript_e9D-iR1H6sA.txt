Yes, okay, unanimous excellent, so on tonight's committee, agenda, we're going to have the review of the district needs statement and budget priorities.
Thank you, okay, taking a look at this, so this page, if everybody can see, reflects what we had in our district needs statement last year, And I think the the top of the page is a discussion about noise and it's supposed to be sort of the most pressing, urgent issue for our community from a health perspective, at least according to how this was written.
Last time it seemed like the issues presented were noise and respiratory illness as being most important from a health perspective.
And I think maybe some other thoughts on the committee- is that this is probably not the most pressing health related concern in the community.
We discussed last time in terms of health, equity and access to care, particularly for the NYCHA community, and that probably would be backed in both needs for mental health and substance, abuse, treatment and availability.
I, really think that we should be operating from a places, as you suggest, but urgency, I'm, very concerned about where we are sort of economically and health in the city in the country for sure, but specifically in the city and our purview, is the district, and I think we should be looking very closely at what are the hardest hit areas with unemployment and all of the factors related to the crisis.
The needs statement that there's a crisis coming and that crisis is going to affect us any number of ways, health, environment, social services, education, health and safety.
Anybody else on the committee want to offer their view of this issue or what should be the most important thing, I, always get annoyed with people who do that.
The second thing that, just to maybe underline what alejandro said, we have a portion of our district that suffers tremendously from ongoing health problems, specifically disease, heart, disease, asthma and high blood pressure, and those factors are major contributors to severe problems that people experience in life and with a crisis it'll be worse without a crisis.
And, it's not being addressed in the way in which it should be addressed in this community, and it falls back to the reasons that we all can surmise as to why that's the case, but I think we need to be very specific about those problems because they affect the most vulnerable.
Right, look at all of the material that was sent by the office this time around and also last time, And I, remember the issue: First, the thing about the air quality, so I So in this exercise, I would definitely go along with whatever the it's on.
We have worked hard in to make access through on the kinds of things that people have called in on right on this meeting, either on a tablet phone and during Covid-19, we've, we've gotten waivers from this disability assistance to basically have something which we never had no requirement for person, interviews.
So I think that the health thing is actually and the issues that alejandra raised.
It, sort of talks about like Brooklyn heights and fort greene on this, like really high level, and it would be nice if, like the city department of health, was referencing NYCHA And you know ingersoll whitman farragut, and the impact on like this real.
They don't generally do that about as far as they go generally is like a community district, I'm, also I work with the age friendly commission and the new york, the new york academy of medicine I can reach out to them and to see what type of data sets that they have.
Okay did any other members of the committee want to chime in here on the on the most important issue: It's okay!
Don't want to only focus on NYCHA, because there's poverty outside of NYCHA and within our district still, You know, there are people who are going to come out.
When is other areas that has the same issues and one of the things that I noticed since Covid-19, 19 and because I'm always out in the community and observing a lot as well as I, did a lot of work, distributing food and so forth, but the homeless rate then went up.
So when the people were supposed to be quarantined and the city was locked down, it was a lot of spaces all over the place where you know people were outside on the street, and the majority of them, I believe, have mental health issues as well, because shelters and so forth was available.
You know that we didn't want people on the street, so I had a real high concern about that because, like what.
So I think that in addressing the concerns of the district that you know, there's one thing that there's one issue where everything stems from and that everything is interrelated.
It's helpful to look at the numbers when I think about what I see every day and so excuse any language in this that might be offensive to people, particularly like tanya.
When you start thinking about some of the examples that were brought up just even around like culturally and how education has to happen because of diets and what people eat.
The other thing that starts getting directly into when we think about health care is just even health insurance and so for me, because I emailed to brandon and caroline before it makes me sad, but just the idea that on the dekalb side of the park, and so even when we think about times of Covid-19 and any other sort of pandemic that might pop up when we think about mental health.
That could help with like mental health, because again it comes with having to have referrals, and it just gets more challenging so again, just seeing huge disparities in terms of when we look at The. Basically, you know, public coverage is what is largely used on on the other side, on the myrtle side of the park, and so all of this for me.
You, know If you're in fort greene and have been here for a long time and have decided to either stay or you've had to move based on rent increases or you've stayed because you're in you, know, rent, stabilized housing, If you're having to move just the health implications of like disrupting your social networks.
What that does in terms of mental health, and we know that mental health leads to what are called diseases of despair which are leading to american life expectancy going down for the first time in decades, because you end up with things like stress induced, you know heart conditions, you end up with drug use.
There is a lot of work to be done on mental health, but then there are also things that again, just as this data is being packed together, that, for example, the health profile for fourth grade of Brooklyn heights in talks, you know it shows that you know yay for green You, know roaches being reported than in other parts of Brooklyn and in other parts of new york city.
But we know that is just not true in much of in many of these tracks, where housing is different and that, unfortunately, ends up being like roaches end up, impacting and or trigger for asthma, and so all of these things truly are related, and so I, don't think I'm necessarily saying anything different than what others on the or what members of the committee have said.
You know on the sheet that carol ann shared earlier one of the items that we can identify from the budget requests or expanding access to public health insurance, and it sort of fits into that realm.
The public expanding access to public health, But, I think, there's also a need to push for the ability to have direct access to mental health counselors without people having to go through referrals from their primary care.
But I think that also paired with the idea of making sure that people aware like it is okay to not be okay, But, so I think yes, what you're saying, but just making sure again, just following through all the way that it's not just the access to the insurance, but the making sure it's not difficult to use that insurance for the any thoughts from members of the committee on the data that emily has shared and potentially further comments or suggestions.
I did want to also give any of the member public or attending our meeting an opportunity to voice any strong concerns or priorities that they have in terms of health.
Last time it started with the three that alejandro had identified, which were the mobile health, clinics, local hiring program and the NYCHA survey of needs.
I mean, I know that mobile health clinics have had a lot of public health success for a long time all over the country, but specifically for mental health care.
We can come up with a number of things that I think would definitely be worth mentioning if no other reason alejandro, because a mobile health, by definition at some point, there's a ceiling in the cost, right.
If there's an awful lot of access to public health benefits, if it was meant by benefits, asking that that's why I asked the question before, what's meant by access, if it's meant, on the other hand, something along the lines of excess being like access to some medical professionals right in this.
In, this regard, mental health professionals, then that's another thing, but if it's, if it's access to the benefits, meaning the ability to apply for medicaid that sort of exists, I would stay away from that.
Think From now we can sort of transition a little bit more into cataloging out specific things that we want to raise as district needs from that discussion, and they don't all have to be the most important item, but they that they probably can be related to in some capacity tanya I didn't want to cut you.
Okay, I think what we should do and to just to try to maximize the time, because we I do want to get to the rest of our agenda at a later point in the meeting tonight is if we have a few things.
But we are only just getting comfortable with the idea of mental health care to begin with, because we've been taught to like [ __ ] it up and just you know, It's, the access to the insurance.
That's, hopefully going to start very soon in fort greene park, which I think it would be a great idea if someone from mahesh was on the advisory council, but basically fountain house You, know: doctors who people may or may not see, but actually just being stationed in the park and just being available to people either reaching out.
But, it's mobile in the sense that there will just be mental health care advocates in the park and available to people, and I think particularly leading towards the myrtle side, because unfortunately, that is, it is where there tends to be- And I hate speaking like this, but intravenous drug use, or just even outside of that- The stress of unemployment of So I'm, a huge fan of the mobile health, whether that's physical vehicles or Just people being there and brandon.
We don't know what happens after that and for me that just doesn't feel good enough like there needs to be a like a better loop of education and information between the ada precinct, particularly when they are saying we often see the same people who are in distress that information is not caring, and so that to me feels like something that doesn't take.
It just takes better communication, so yes, people mobile in the park, but then also, I think, better- communication between 88 precinct, at least specifically just dealing with the poor green area and those mental health care.
I understand that in this moment, if someone feels quote-unquote threatened or they see something, then they say: Oh, that person is, you know having mental health, issues, and I, Just that you know there- are that there are different places like the idea that, after a police take someone in or take them to a hospital, then they become the warehouse for follow-up or for information.
If a police officer comes in and picks someone up whether to provide whether to refer them to a mental health, professional or just to arrest them, because in that moment they don't know how to deal with that acute issue, whatever it is.
That to me should be like the end of that relationship in terms of what the involvement with the police, I don't see why they then have to be involved in the follow-up of that person, unless I'm unaware of mental health, training, that police officers have, and maybe there's a whole branch of that The point I was making it's come up at work with because, because of the issue of homelessness, that we've been discussing.
The community board is comfortable, with,, I would say it's racism and the legacy of racism, and I think that if we can be clear about that and direct about it, that's more important than trying to come up with a lot of individual ideas, because, frankly.
To then focus on the needs for mental health and substance, abuse and access to care and many other issues that are particular to the pockets of poverty in our in our community.
And I think the mobile health, the ability to have mental health professionals in the specific locations where the issues exist is part of the story.
Then we said, hire locally brown and black people who have lived in the community for a long time.
In there never mind a black person, not working there, not drinking there, not eating there, And, so I think, there's actually even something more direct that our community, our committee, can do to improve access to employment, and I think we should name employment or unemployment as a as a health, issue, and so I.
You know we want to be respectful of that, but at the same time it's a very real issue that exists and unemployment So, I mean, would I, don't know how to pass a law to force businesses to to, and yes, rest in peace, mr winston claire, but the I don't know how to pass a lot of forced businesses to to hire specific people as much as we want them to do that we can offer.
There's, one on finer geographical data, which I think is really pointed at that community health survey.
But, it's come to light in the years with the pandemic, that there are these folks who are staying in the temporary shelters in the in the hotels, and I think that the city should probably do something more substantial with them to assess the their needs for social services, job training, substance, abuse or mental health services as necessary, and and try to find a pathway to permanent housing for those people.
That's been working on the issue of the bqe they've, probably been focused more on, what's going through the wealthier areas like Brooklyn heights, in particular, but they're, conscious of the effect of the highway on the entire range of Brooklyn, through which it runs.
If the community board ever wanted to do something in terms of public education or broaden the discussions about options.
While we think of what the committee is going to say that the transportation committee should be addressing the cantilever itself, and so you know, if a statement is going to come from the committee on that issue, it could simply be about how, as I think you just said how to reduce the impact of pollution from it.
So I, don't know if everybody has access to the google doc where all of these things are categorized, but I could type this one out for it for you , I'm thinking that, maybe we say something higher level like the triple cantilever project.
I want to just give the opportunity, the members of the committee to comment in favor or object to anything about that talking about increased use of renewable energy sources and as a potential district, need.
Don't know where that would go, But, but it still seems that the city should maybe make more of an effort to educate people, so that folks are more willing to switch over this sort of thing.
You can actually report these things and then the dashboards that let you know when the elevators are done, as well as I believe the experts It's also j street, which is at york and j, Both, highly populated, highly used, at least before the corona virus, and hopefully after the corona virus, and they both need a tremendous amount of work.
I want to make a place where this community oriented and where everybody in the neighborhood will feel welcome, and that's only the only thing I can say I mean I, obviously want to work and try to address any complaint.
