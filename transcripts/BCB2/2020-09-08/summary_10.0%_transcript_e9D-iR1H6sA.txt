Last time it seemed like the issues presented were noise and respiratory illness as being most important from a health perspective and I think maybe some other thoughts on the committee- is that this is probably not the most pressing health related concern in the community.
We discussed last time in terms of health, equity and access to care, particularly for the NYCHA community, and that probably would be backed in both needs for mental health and substance, abuse, treatment and availability for a number of different kinds of of care, which would be important in not the least of which would also include maternal mortality.
Manner it discusses There are a number of mental health facilities and chemical dependency centers in our in our area, and perhaps we're too highly saturated I, really think that we should be operating from a places, as you suggest, but urgency I'm very concerned about where we are sort of economically and health in the city in the country for sure, but specifically in the city and our purview is the district and I think we should be looking very closely at what are the hardest hit areas with unemployment and all of the factors related to the crisis.
and I think that's the lens that we should be approaching the needs statement that there's a crisis coming and that crisis is going to affect us any number of ways: health, environment, social services, education, health and safety, all that stuff?
The second thing that just to maybe underline what alejandro said, we have a portion of our district that suffers tremendously from ongoing health problems, specifically disease, heart disease, asthma and high blood pressure, and those factors are major contributors to severe problems that people experience in life and with a crisis it'll be worse without a crisis, it's still horrible and it's not being addressed in the way in which it should be addressed in this community, and it falls back to the reasons that we all can surmise as to.
We have worked hard in to make access through on the kinds of things that people have called in on right on this meeting, either on a tablet phone and during Covid-19, we've, we've gotten waivers from this disability assistance to basically have something which we never had no requirement for person, So when so, if I know we haven't talked about those yet, but we're sort of going down that trail, and so as it applies to accessibility for public benefits and as it applies to eligibility for public benefits, the accessibility, electronic means and the loosening of the requirements of in-person interviews have definitely gone towards a way to apply and to reapply and as to accessibility, Of course it can always be easier.
But for a number of years now we have pursued a lot of data electronically by people wanting to apply feed and wanting to recertify So I think that the health thing is actually and the issues that alejandra raised.
You committee, chair brandon smith, for acknowledging me I, appreciate that you're giving me this time and in one minute, I just want to say that I'm about to email, a community health profile to carol ann church that I saw online That is specifically for the fort greene clinton hill area and I will try to send it for the other areas within community district, 2 I believe it's a tool that could be helpful to the committee.
It sort of talks about like Brooklyn heights and fort greene on this, like really high level, and it would be nice if, like the city, department of health, was referencing NYCHA and you know ingersoll whitman farragut and the impact on like this real Like pocket of poverty.
They, don't I hate the expression, but they used to used to be popular drill down They, don't drill down to something that alejandra often refers to right at census, tracts they don't generally do that about as far as they go generally is like a community district I work with the age friendly commission and the new york, the new york academy of medicine I can reach out to them and to see what type of data sets that they have as far as for the senior population, they have done a coalition with cuny in regards to a mapping system that they do based on various types of health conditions and criteria that is accessible to the public in terms of getting data, but, like I said, it's limited only to seniors, unfortunately well fortunate for me, but maybe not for everybody and every age group, but they may be able to assist you in regards to other data that you might be looking for.
Don't want to only focus on NYCHA because there's poverty outside of NYCHA and within our district still, but just that it's saying like you know there are people who are going to come out just fine, okay, great I'm, speaking as coming from as me being a nature resident that why is NYCHA always like targeted?
So when the people were supposed to be quarantined and the city was locked down, it was a lot of spaces all over the place where you know people were outside on the street and the majority of them I believe have mental health issues as well, because shelters and so forth was available.
I actually did look at the report that was mentioned in terms of the health outlook which looked at fort greene in Brooklyn heights that unfortunately, I think had the same issue with some of the other data.
When we look at snap benefits, almost half of the residents on the myrtle side of the park enjoy snap benefits and I don't want to say to make people feel good You don't often see what the farmers market looks like in terms of people going, it's very homogeneous So for me, that is a gap in potentially a gap in education, making sure people are aware that there are options that could be taken advantage of, but again do not want to dismiss the point about their cultural differences and how people cook, I, don't know, but again, just huge differences that we're seeing here in terms of income, the benefits Other thing that starts getting directly into when we think about health care is just even health insurance and so for me, because I emailed to brandon and caroline before it makes me sad, but just the idea that on the dekalb side of the park, and so even when we think about times of Covid-19 and any other sort of pandemic that might pop up when we think about mental health issues that private health insurance enables you to do a lot of things very easily, because you typically don't have to get referrals Unfortunately.
That could help with like mental health, because again it comes with having to have referrals, and it just gets more challenging so again, just seeing huge disparities in terms of when we look at The. Basically, you know public coverage is what is largely used on on the other side on the myrtle side of the park, and so all of this for me, just looking at this, came from a health policy brief that brandon sharon I thought this chart was really helpful because we think about gentrification just as ideas, and so what it's basically showing is that when you think about people that either and again, I'm very much in my mind thinking, because that is what I live and experience every day that when we think about this, basically showing on the blue.
But we know that is just not true in much of in many of these tracks, where housing is different and that, unfortunately, ends up being like roaches end up impacting and or trigger for asthma, and so all of these things truly are related and so I, don't think I'm necessarily saying anything different than what others on the or what members of the committee have said.
But for me, I think that this just really for us calls into the need to make sure that we are trying to get as granular as data as possible and getting down to individual census tracts as much as we can just to make sure that we are, you know taking one just thinking about what are the cultural implications of health that is being suggested, but then also just really thinking about the needs from not only a physical health standpoint, but also to the mental health standpoint Very insightful to get an additional look at, and perhaps some stronger data around the specifics inside our community district.
I know you know on the sheet that carol ann shared earlier one of the items that we can identify from the budget requests or expanding access to public health insurance And I know there are many other things that could also come up in that regard too, and one can say, though, just in terms of that the public, expanding access to public health but I think there's also a need to push for the ability to have direct access to mental health counselors without people having to go through referrals from their primary care.
Physicians, But I think that also paired with the idea of making sure that people aware like it is okay to not be okay, But, so I think yes, what you're saying, but just making sure again, just following through all the way that it's not just the access to the insurance, but the making sure it's not difficult to use that insurance for the any thoughts from members of the committee on the data that emily has shared and potentially further comments or suggestions.
I wanted to give that opportunity to any of the members of the public who are attending some of the district needs that we catalogued from the last meeting and since Last time it started with the three that alejandro had identified, which were the mobile health clinics, local hiring program and the NYCHA survey of needs Just to say that I.
I think at times have talked as a committee , number of new health clinics, or we need to set up a new job center for hra a new welfare center, and the problem with that is just that.
We can come up with a number of things that I think would definitely be worth mentioning if no other reason alejandro, because a mobile health, by definition at some point, there's a ceiling in the cost right and I think it could get to a lot of people in a lot of places.
Why I asked the question before: what's meant by access, if it's meant, on the other hand, something along the lines of excess being like access to some medical professionals right in this This regard mental health professionals, then that's another thing, but if it's, if it's access to the benefits, meaning the ability to apply for medicaid that sort of exists, I would stay away from that and I'm going to go to miss richardson in just a second and I.
Think from now we can sort of transition a little bit more into cataloging out specific things that we want to raise as district needs from that discussion, and they don't all have to be the most important item, but they that they probably can be related to in some capacity tanya What would be the criteria of the service?.
Okay, I think what we should do and to just to try to maximize the time because we I do want to get to the rest of our agenda at a later point in the meeting tonight is if we have a few things down, we've got the mobile health clinics, We've got the the local hiring program and the and the the NYCHA So I.
But we are only just getting comfortable with the idea of mental health care to begin with, because we've been taught to like fuck it up and it's the access to the insurance It's making sure people have insurance, but it's making sure there's a direct line to care providers without having to have referrals, but then also just on the mobile health trucks That's, hopefully going to start very soon in fort greene park, which I think it would be a great idea if someone from mahesh was on the advisory council, but basically fountain house You, know: doctors who people may or may not see, but actually just being stationed in the park and just being available to people either reaching out if they see that someone either looks distressed or also just being there as a resource There's already grant money being raised.
So maybe there's something we could say to the effect of deploying specific mental health professionals and folks who can provide treatment for substance abuse, particularly to the to the area around that specific side of the park and I would also say that on that there also needs to be better, follow up and follow through between the ada precinct and mental health professionals, because at least from what I have heard from them, I went to a meeting with the police in the park a couple of weeks ago We don't know what happens after that and for me that just doesn't feel good enough like there needs to be a like a better loop of education and information between the ada precinct, particularly when they are saying we often see the same people who are in distress that information is not caring, and so that to me feels like something that doesn't take money.
I, don't know that we can get to the heart of the problem, but the heart of poverty and the best way out of poverty is the job There's been some thoughts going around in the chat about potentially convening a meeting, which I think would be a very interesting idea to bring some of these players together and alejandro also had a thought about mental health training and whether police officers are even appropriate for being the responders.
I understand that in this moment, if someone feels quote-unquote threatened or they see something, then they say: Oh, that person is, you know having mental health issues Just that you know, there- are that there are different places like the idea that, after a police take someone in or take them to a hospital, then they become the warehouse for follow-up or for information.
That to me should be like the end of that relationship in terms of what the involvement with the police I don't see why they then have to be involved in the follow-up of that person unless I'm unaware of mental health training, that police officers have The point I was making it's come up at work with, because, because of the issue of homelessness that we've been discussing, the fact that, because of what's happened with the george floyd protests and the on the disparities, but also just at the the actual conditions of policing within the city shelter system, the administration has done kind of an about-face and I.
To then, focus on the needs for mental health and substance abuse and access to care and many other issues that are particular to the pockets of poverty in our in our community The number one issue, the issues of racism and historical origins and its impact, or are something I think it's probably fair to draw upon, because that's the and I think that's how we talk about our most important need, but I think is, as nan pointed out in the in the comments.
In there never mind a black person not working there, not drinking there, not eating there and so I think there's actually even something more direct that our community, our committee, can do to improve access to employment and I think we should name employment or unemployment as a as a health issue, and so I don't know how we can operationalize that to say that we agree that that we say specifically that we are We can't have a block where there's zero percent unemployment and another blocker there's 25 unemployment.
The Brooklyn plaza medical center came here and spoke about being underprepared with resources, with training and with guidance from all different levels and I think that if we asked the city to provide more training, materials and guidance, and also to sort of be a little bit further ahead with the global community as to the state of global pandemics, then I think that would be something that would be particularly appropriate in this year's statement of district needs.
It's come to light in the years with the pandemic that there are these folks who are staying in the temporary shelters in the in the hotels and I think that the city should probably do something more substantial with them to assess the their needs for social services, job training, substance abuse or mental health services as necessary, and and try to find a pathway to permanent housing for those people.
I know that the health is our most important or right now feels like the most important thing we can speak about, but I just want to steer the conversation in the direction of the environment.
That's proportionate to the development, because the issue of a lack of flooding infrastructure is coming from higher levels like physically higher levels of the land in the district, and then we like dumbo, will be fine It's areas that are frankly less privileged where there is not sufficient infrastructure to protect people from flooding , I mean we can ask the maybe dep to test the impact of flooding upon a says: the impact of flooding on the district broadly and identify opportunities for green infrastructure district-wide, and then at least we could say if we see some massive development going on flatbush, we could say: hey like we need bioswales and I know a lot of the infrastructure, especially subways, but for mass transit I'm, just curious about what plans of any exist and what we could push for, or is it a lost cause in terms of making subway stations in our district, more ada compliant, you know and accessible in general.
There was no support in that department and, as we talk about restaurants and bars struggling through the current pandemic and the bandwidth and the resources that these business owners have to contribute to finding a diverse workforce is limited, and it seems to me that there could be additional support to make sure that these positions are advertised and offered to local members of the community There are ways that maybe we can connect with fab, to encourage them to provide those resources and or just to have this open conversation now I'll share with you.
I just wouldn't want to guarantee it to you, because I know that there are two different architect firms still consulting about the best way to do it and I think that that's a good explanation of that other questions from members of the committee for this application.
He'd say that you know the police were called Yes, I'm concerned that they may not show up at all to our next meeting or be responsive to us, but we'll see miss cobb Only thing they can do is come to the community board right.
