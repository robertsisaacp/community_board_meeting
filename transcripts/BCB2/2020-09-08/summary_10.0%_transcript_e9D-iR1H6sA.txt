You try again miss church Thank, you, okay, taking a look at this, so this page, if everybody can see, reflects what we had in our district And I think the the top of the page is a discussion about noise and it's supposed to be sort of the most pressing, urgent issue for our community from a health perspective, at least according to how this was written.
As being most important from a health perspective, but my thought- And I think maybe some other thoughts on the committee is that this is probably not the most pressing health related concern in the community.
We discussed last time in terms of health, equity and access to care, particularly for the NYCHA community, and that probably would be backed in both needs for mental health and substance, abuse, treatment and availability for a number of different kinds of of care, which would be important in not the least of which would also include maternal mortality.
Very concerned about where we are sort of economically and health in the city in the country for sure, but specifically in the city and our purview, is the district, and I think we should be looking very closely at what are the hardest hit areas with unemployment and all of the factors related to the crisis.
The needs statement that there's a crisis coming and that crisis is going to affect us any number of ways: Health Environment, Social, Services, Education, Health and safety, all that stuff, and what can we do to get ahead of it as best I think that seems to be pretty on point with my thinking of the issue, too.
Anybody else on the committee want to offer their view of this issue or what should be the most important thing?
The second thing that, just to maybe underline what Alejandro said , we have a portion of our district that suffers tremendously from ongoing health problems, specifically disease, heart, disease, asthma and high blood pressure, and those factors are major contributors to severe problems that people experience in life and with a crisis it'll be worse without a crisis.
And, it's not being addressed in the way in which it should be addressed in this community, and it falls back to the reasons that we all can surmise as to why that's the case, but I think we need to be very specific about those problems because they affect the most vulnerable.
I. Think some of the questions seem, or some of the issues seem to point towards access prior to this horrible Covid-19, environment.
We have worked hard in to make access through on the kinds of things that people have called in on right on this meeting, either on a tablet phone and during Covid-19, we've, we've gotten waivers from this disability assistance to basically have something which we never had no requirement for person, interviews.
If I know we have not talked about those yet, but we're sort of going down that trail, and so as it applies to accessibility for public benefits and as it applies to eligibility for public benefits, the accessibility, electronic means and the loosening of the requirements of in- person interviews have definitely gone towards a way to apply and to reapply and as to accessibility.
So I think that the health thing is actually and the issues that Alejandra raised.
Just wanted to thank you for coming to our committee meeting And I appreciate that you're giving me this time and in one minute, I just want to say that I'm about to email, a community health profile to Carol Ann Church that I saw online.
It, sort of talks about like Brooklyn heights and Fort Greene on this, like really high level, and it would be nice if, like the City, Department of Health was referencing NYCHA and you know Ingersoll whitman Farragut, and the impact on like this real, like pocket of poverty, that we feel is exists in our in our community district.
They have done some work on their end, so just a future reference I just wanted to say that in general, it's difficult to get health related data broken down into those more micro sectors because of confidentiality.
Okay did any other members of the committee want to chime in here on the on the most important issue: It's okay!
We do talk specifically about NYCHA And I do not want to only focus on NYCHA, because there's poverty outside of NYCHA and within our district still, Just that it's saying there are people who are going to come out.
So when the people were supposed to be quarantined and the city was locked down, it was a lot of spaces all over the place where you know people were outside on the street and the majority of them, I believe, have mental health issues as well, because shelters and so forth was available.
You know that we did not want people on the street, so I had a real high concern about that because, like what.
So I think that in addressing the concerns of the district, that you know, there's one thing that there's one issue where everything stems from and that everything is interrelated.
It's helpful to look at the numbers when I think about what I see every day and so excuse any language in this that might be offensive to people, particularly like Tanya.
, it's not perfect science, but this again, I think you're So. Does everyone see the two little maps just making sure my size are advancing, yep, okay, great, so one of the first things I just wanted to take big picture and then kind of zoom in on a few things so terms of racial differences.
When you start thinking about some of the examples that were brought up just even around like culturally and how education has to happen because of diets and what people eat.
Think about things that you're asking people to do in terms of well.
, you have to think about that people have different times available to them, based on what they're dealing with in their own households and what they have to manage and take care of just to exist.
The other thing that starts getting directly into when we think about health care is just even health insurance and so for me, because I emailed to Brandon and caroline before it makes me sad, but just the idea that on the dekalb side of the park, and so even when we think about times of Covid-19 and any other sort of pandemic that might pop up when we think about mental health issues, that private health insurance enables you to do a lot of things very easily, because you typically do not have to get referrals.
That could help with like mental health, because again it comes with having to have referrals, and it just gets more challenging so again, just seeing huge disparities in terms of when we look at The. Basically, you know, public coverage is what is largely used on on the other side, on the myrtle side of the park, and so all of this for me, just looking at this, came from a health policy brief that Brandon Sharon.
It's basically thinking about you, know If you're in Fort Greene, and have been here for a long time and have decided to either stay or you've had to move based on rent increases or you've stayed because you're in you, know, rent, stabilized housing, and so this also ends up coming with one, if you're having to move just the health implications of like disrupting your social networks.
What that does in terms of mental health, and we know that mental health leads to what are called diseases of despair which are leading to american life expectancy going down for the first time in decades, because you end up with things like stress induced, you know heart conditions, you end up with drug use.
It does reinforce that there is a lot of work to be done on mental health, but then there are also things that again, just as this data is being packed together, that, for example, the health profile for fourth grade of Brooklyn heights in talks, you know it shows that you know Yay for green they're.
But we know that is just not true in much of in many of these tracks, where housing is different and that, unfortunately, ends up being like roaches end up, impacting and or trigger for asthma, and so all of these things truly are related, and so I do not think I'm necessarily saying anything different than what others on the or what members of the committee have said.
I think that this just really for us calls into the need to make sure that we are trying to get as granular as data as possible and getting down to individual census tracts as much as we can just to make sure that we are, you know.
I know you know on the sheet that Carol Ann shared earlier one of the items that we can identify from the budget requests or expanding access to public health insurance, The public expanding access to public health, But, I think, there's also a need to push for the ability to have direct access to mental health counselors without people having to go through referrals from their primary care.
But I think that also paired with the idea of making sure that people aware like it is okay to not be okay, But, so I think yes, what you're saying, but just making sure again, just following through all the way that it's not just the access to the insurance, but the making sure it's not difficult to use that insurance for the any thoughts from members of the committee on the data that emily has shared and potentially further comments or suggestions.
I did want to also give any of the member public or attending our meeting an opportunity to voice any strong concerns or priorities that they have in terms of health.
Last time it started with the three that Alejandro had identified, which were the mobile health, clinics, local hiring program and the NYCHA survey of needs.
They were mobile mental health clinics to sort of to be stationed in areas, but I do not know how that works.
I mean, I know that mobile health clinics have had a lot of public health success for a long time all over the country, but specifically for mental health care.
At times we have talked as a city about we need to establish x, number of new health clinics, or we need to set up a new job center for Hra, a new welfare center, and the problem with that is just that.
If there's an awful lot of access to public health benefits, if it was meant by benefits, asking that that's why I asked the question before, what's meant by access, if it's meant, on the other hand, something along the lines of excess being like access to some medical professionals right in this.
In, this regard, mental health professionals, then that's another thing, but if it's, if it's access to the benefits, meaning the ability to apply for medicaid that sort of exists, I would stay away from that.
Think From now we can sort of transition a little bit more into cataloging out specific things that we want to raise as district needs from that discussion, and they do not all have to be the most important item, but they that they probably can be related to in some capacity tanya.
Okay, I think what we should do and to just to try to maximize the time, because we I do want to get to the rest of our agenda at a later point in the meeting tonight is if we have a few things : down, we've got the mobile health, clinics.
But we are only just getting comfortable with the idea of mental health care to begin with, because we've been taught to like[ _ _] it up and just you know, It's, the access to the insurance.
But, it's mobile in the sense that there will just be mental health care advocates in the park and available to people, and I think particularly leading towards the myrtle side, because unfortunately, that is, it is where there tends to be- And I hate speaking like this, but intravenous drug use, or just even outside of that- The stress of unemployment of So I'm, a huge fan of the mobile health, whether that's physical vehicles or Just people being there and Brandon.
And I would also say that on that there also needs to be better, follow up and follow through between the ADA precinct and mental health professionals, because at least from what I have heard from them, I went to a meeting with the police in the park.
We do not know what happens after that and for me that just does not feel good enough like there needs to be a like a better loop of education and information between the ADA precinct, particularly when they are saying we often see the same people who are in distress that information is not caring, and so that to me feels like something that does not take.
It just takes better communication, so yes, people mobile in the park, but then also, I think, better- communication between 88 precinct, at least specifically just dealing with the poor green area and those mental health care.
If a police officer comes in and picks someone up whether to provide whether to refer them to a mental, health, professional or just to arrest them, because in that moment they do not know how to deal with that acute issue, whatever it is.
That to me should be like the end of that relationship in terms of what the involvement with the police, I do not see why they then have to be involved in the follow- up of that person, unless I'm unaware of mental health, training, that police officers have, and maybe there's a whole branch of that The point I was making it's come up at work with because, because of the issue of homelessness that we've been discussing.
You know if you can educate the an officer more so with a lot of different things, but ultimately they are for, as as I think it was emily who said it catcher and lace.
I have not been on the committee as long as some of you, but I've been on it for a while for a number of years, and this is the first time I recall us, focusing in on the fact that there are parts of the district that are in tremendous need as compared to the district, community, and I.
To then focus on the needs for mental health and substance, abuse and access to care and many other issues that are particular to the pockets of poverty in our in our community.
And I think the mobile health, the ability to have mental health professionals in the specific locations where the issues exist is part of the story.
Then we said, hire locally brown and black people who have lived in the community for a long time.
In there never mind a black person, not working there, not drinking there, not eating there, And, so I think, there's actually even something more direct that our community, our committee, can do to improve access to employment, and I think we should name employment or unemployment as a as a health, issue, and so I do not know how we can operationalize that to say that we agree that that we say specifically that we are.
You know we want to be respectful of that, but at the same time it's a very real issue that exists and unemployment So, I mean, would I do not know how to pass a law to force businesses to to And yes, rest in peace, Mr, Winston Claire, but the I do not know how to pass a lot of forced businesses to to hire specific people as much as we want them to do that we can offer.
Think that if we asked the city to provide more training, materials and guidance, and also to sort of be a little bit further ahead with the global community as to the state of global pandemics, then I think that would be something that would be particularly appropriate.
There was a specific scaffolding issue going on, and I got some further details from Miss Johnson that this is going on at 64, Saint Edward Street, where the scaffolding at this location has not been removed for approximately 10 years out in this in this particular NYCHA complex, which has caused a number of different quality of life and health issues to the people in that building, including the ability to have emergency personnel and residents and guests access it and causing a safety issue in the evening.
It's come to light in the years with the pandemic, that there are these folks who are staying in the temporary shelters in the in the hotels, and I think that the city should probably do something more substantial with them to assess the their needs for social services, job training, substance, abuse or mental health services as necessary, and and try to find a pathway to permanent housing for those people.
That's been working on the issue of the BQE they've, probably been focused more on, What's, going through the wealthier areas like Brooklyn heights, in particular, but they're, conscious of the effect of the highway on the entire range of Brooklyn, through which it runs.
I, do not think I feel member comfortable as a member of this committee, to suggest that it considers supporting that coalition, because you guys do not know enough about it.
While we think of what the committee is going to say that the transportation committee should be addressing the cantilever itself, and so you know, if a statement is going to come from the committee on that issue, it could simply be about how, as I think you just said how to reduce the impact of pollution from it.
So I do not know if everybody has access to the Google Doc, where all of these things are categorized, but I could type this one out for it for you , I'm thinking that, maybe we say something higher level like the triple Cantilever project.
I want to just give the opportunity, the members of the committee to comment in favor or object to anything about that talking about increased use of renewable energy sources and as a potential district need.
I mean we can ask the maybe DEP to test the impact of flooding upon a says, the impact of flooding on the district broadly and identify opportunities for green infrastructure, Then, at least we could say if we see some massive development going on Flatbush, we could say: hey like we need bioswales.
I'm, just curious about what plans of any exist and what we could push for, or is it a lost cause in terms of making subway stations in our district, more ADA compliant, you know and accessible in general.
But it's also health All they all need significant repairs associated with them in different ways, and they all have their own impacts upon access and how you're putting in a new elevator by Borah Hall we've been working on that for a while.
We have interest to know where it stands, and I think that that's a good explanation of that other questions from members of the committee for this application.
I just want to ask for the members of the community at this point to if there are any other members who have questions about this application who are not from the committee , I do not see any hands raised on this from the members of the community.
I want to make a place where this community oriented and where everybody in the neighborhood will feel welcome, and that's only the only thing I can say I mean I, obviously want to work and try to address any complaint.
