Good evening, everybody welcome to the first meeting of the new committee year for community board 2 health environment, social services, committee.
Ms macy is here on behalf of the fort greene senior council and we're going to be talking about Covid-19 19 impacts on the programs and services offered there, which we're really excited to hear.
I had to look in the thing: call each senior, where there's a thousand or whatever make sure they want to clarify that they're eligible for meal asked if they have nobody to cook et cetera, once they were qualified to get meals, we had to register them with the city get meal.
I think it's four times we opened since they started the cooling centers, so people are able to come, in, seniors are able to come in and we have.
Or they'll ask who's this person's name or whatever, because we see the seniors and you're welcome to take a sample in If you know anybody 60 and over in the community board, you want to, if they're isolated, they can join our virtual centers and if they live in community board 2, it's going to be great cigar.
: I don't know if it would be the committee if we need any help from you, I will reach out to miss church to see what the community board can help us with helping the seniors during this pandemic.
The people that you work with are appropriately equipped with personal protective equipment masks or if there were any issues or concerns that came up on the course of the pandemic?
So right now, we're good with the PPE, because office of the management are the OEM people they're sending PPE for the seniors that are open for cooling, center.
If anybody know any private person that would willing we'd willing to give our proposal give them the names- And I know some provider may probably give them free internet, because that's this is that I feel this is the new senior centers, because I don't think this is gonna, be a comeback.
A lot of seniors in Brooklyn in the Brooklyn area and I can testify , it would be truly missed and a lot of people may not have survived and may not survive, because this is a place where people come to socialize They come because they know that they are loved and welcome, and that is so important, particularly at this time.
I'm, going to ask the rest of the committee members to if you have any questions to definitely feel free to share them.
I just wanted to give one sort of public service state statement here to the members of the committee.
They don't seem to be in the room, so I think we should probably move ahead to the next point in the agenda, which is a discussion of our district needs statement and budget priorities.
I. Think it's great that we've gotten to this point here, because the district needs is really coming up in the in what is it October We're doing district needs And it's going to be pretty important, particularly in line of presentations that we've heard in the last meetings, It be the maternal mortality, whether it be the presentation that we heard about the Brooklyn plaza in the last meeting and then today from the senior council.
That's, another conversation, so I, there's a lot there's a strong effect from you, know, sort of a lifetime of racism and discrimination and people are walking around with that trauma, and So I think, there's stuff that can be done from a health perspective.
You know in this committee alone, with liquor licenses, we see hundreds of jobs, every year, But and we're always encouraging people to hire locally specifically to hire black and brown people.
Yes, we're going to hire locally and we give them contact information to fort greene snap to the comm, the ingersoll community center to post to the Brooklyn navy, yard.
There, has to be sort of comprehensive distribution and and facilitation of the personal protective equipment getting out to both hospitals, medical providers, as well as places where there are large concentrations of people like NYCHA developments, so that people have the opportunity to use them, and I'm continuously troubled by the number of people who just flagrantly don't wear, masks, left and right throughout our community in multiple different settings and the it It's always a struggle to balance the people's individual rights to do what they want with the public health effects that come out of not wearing masks.
And while we have other committees that are thinking about how we address things like AMI calculations and the lack of affordable housing in the district, I worry a lot about air quality and street safety.
I. Don't know infrastructure of the district, so I'm going to keep thinking on what that actually starts.
That's, really a question, but I do think that some of these the effects of this out of control development are felt disproportionately by the same parts of our district, where there's also a lot of long-term unemployment, and it's just sort of a compounding issue.
It's really horrendous, that kids are suffering and families are suffering the way they are, and that leads me to something I wanted to say, which is not really a specific need statement at this point, because I think we really covered a lot of good ground last year.
What I wanted to point out is that we are a very diverse community district, which probably everybody here, knows, and I'm, saying what everybody already understands.
But I, don't know how needs are thought about on the city hall level if they look at community district, wide.
So, my point, I guess, is that what the people who are going to make the decisions about spending money and focusing on issues need to understand is that we're a district that have pockets of tremendous need and tremendously long histories of having been ignored?
You know well not park slow, but you know what before my neighbor's need, is very different and at a different level than what many components of the district, need, And I think that has to be repeated frequently, so that the powers that be who are going to really make the decisions about spending money understand what it is that we're asking for, because if you ask for something- And I would like to say that part of the problem is how the data that we're getting that community survey, which you know it really murkies up the waters.
It would be right so that I think that's really essential that we push on that level to get that data They just need to be teased out and presented to us in a way because the community surveys, really just it, pulls everything too much.
I think I got it, but I think what I'm hearing at least barry and alejandro, is that we need to have a little bit more geared towards the those specific aspects of the community district, because you know in several in some parts of the district, things are going.
Even here locally, there have been a few bars and restaurants who've had their liquor licenses taken away because they're serving people without wearing without wearing masks on the inside, and I just feel like that could be that there's more education, , that's needed, you know, and it's not like mandating people to wear the masks or but really making sure people understand the importance of it and the risks.
Any other members of the committee have any more points regarding district needs, not hearing anything else from the from the committee, like with anything else, I'm gonna ask the community.
I, just think it's worth time in conversation, but specifically just around the issues of mental health and then to barry's point about the data on the total data nerd, and so one of the things that strikes me because I was looking at the same thing.
If there's some effort around getting the actual range of data, I, think that's a great point and just for the sake of time I'm, a trauma, I'm, a community board.
I want health concerns with people and going forward.
More things are going to come out with people with disabilities, commit community, So I.
But I think, aside from the concern about the noise that would be generated by any outdoor cafe in a residential neighborhood, which is something that I feel is fairly a common concern that we express there were some concerns expressed in the letters about the liquor store that the applicant currently operates and specifically sort of indicating that the applicant was serving or providing an opportunity to have, as it was alleged kind of an illegal sidewalk.
And I think there were even some photos that were shared with us with expressing concerns about the amount of noise, as well as the fact that some of the staff members at this liquor store were not wearing masks or complying with the Covid-19 19 health.
So, firstly, I had a meeting with miss rodriguez and her son oscar actually, today, in preparation of tonight's meeting, and I had discussed these issues prior with the community board and outside of the liquor.
You know what I would reiterate to the committee is that this premises was already licensed for a decade and a half , so we're not adding another license to the community and again they're the It's a fairly small establishment and the applicant owns the building.
This would be if the only thing that you I would just ask for anybody making a statement or a question just try to keep it somewhat brief answer in the hour and and direct your comments to the chair and to the committee, just because the based upon how we do this when we're in person, we normally ask folks in the community to do that.
And it's very pro-business, But I would ask the committee to push on these issues and to push on the idea that the people who own the liquor store are not aware.
I just want to also see if there are any other members of the community who have a question for regarding this application as well too I had a lot of problems laundering littering noise.
Don't think anybody is going to say that as a property owner as a as a as the owner of a store or a business, that you know that the that you're responsible for everything that goes on outside your business- How much is how often is there going to be on-premise supervision of the outdoor area to make sure things don't get out of hand with customers being loud, or this is a very residential neighborhood and the only way that this works in residential neighborhoods from our experience, I guess what will be done in the event that there's too much noise And Or there's excessive concerns being raised by the community oftentimes.
The outdoor seating will certainly close at 10 o'clock, seven days a week and the midnight again not to be repetitive, and I apologize, but the midnight is extremely fair, midnight's, usually to cut off a lot of community, boards, and So midnight's like the threshold that you're really not going to be a raucous bar And, you legitimately a restaurant or a cafe.
We've already worked with the committee in response to the concerns That, the community has okay Okay, no issue at all.
Okay, great, I asked the members of the committee.
Do you agree that if the community has concerns and questions and brings them to your attention, you will be open to discussing the concerns of the community and knowing that will be also put before this committee , I'm sure by your community members?
With a close on alcohol service at midnight, seven days a week, we do not have any outdoor sitting, but because of Covid-19, the coffee shop actually has approval for open restaurant, and we finish Early So right now there is an outdoor space with barricade and build out and depending on when we're getting our liquor license.
Yes, I've got your you on the line here, but I just want to give the committee a chance to ask any questions off the off the bat in light of the hour.
Would just ask you guys one question which is that here at the health committee, we are very interested in local hiring and we wanted to have you speak briefly about the number of people you want to hire and give our some available options to consider between grasshall community center, fort greene, snap and the Brooklyn navy art, which are great resources in our community?
I should have asked this as a question, but we assume that should any concerns come up from the community while you're in operation, you will be accepted to discuss those concerns and if they seem to have merit resolving them in a way that works as best as it possibly can for you, as well as the people's concerns.
Any questions from members of the community for this application.
