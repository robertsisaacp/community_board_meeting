Right now seniors are refusing them because after that came and everybody tried to get in private agencies and so they're getting meals from here meals from there So through this pandemic, what we're doing every day, The city, free air condition program for the seniors, so the people who live in NYCHA were supposed to automatically get it, but the other people that we have registered So in this case, if you were a member of a senior center membership, has privilege, because only those names were in the city and the city would send us a list of the names that we would call them to re, pre-qualify them, and so we were able to qualify.
I have one senior, they remember her name every day, I see her in her bed, but from the time she comes on a tent, she doesn't leave till everything is over and she takes part It's giving them and then some of them, one senior, the daughter, came to him and realized this and that's all we can do in a local level, because we can't I can't get closer to the mirror and the governor and my opinion We have to take care of our seniors on a local level in Brooklyn and in this district and everywhere else and I hope on one thing: I want to say with this committee I don't know if it would be the committee if we need any help from you, I will reach out to miss church to see what the community board can help us with helping the seniors during this pandemic.
My best I was on a call when they had a committee with the mayor's office If anybody know any private person that would willing we'd willing to give our proposal give them the names- and I know some provider may probably give them free internet, because that's this is that I feel this is the new senior centers, because I don't think this is gonna, be a comeback.
We can refer people to or recall for them if they cannot So there is support and the wellness call is an addition to the virtual centers People that don't get wellness call is because they're coming out in the street now they're six feet apart and I'm, going to ask the rest of the committee members to if you have any questions to definitely feel free to share them.
I just wanted to give one sort of public service state statement here to the members of the committee You are speaking if you could please turn on your video just so that we can comply with the open meeting laws we're trying our best we can to work in the virtual environment, but it's a requirement and important for everyone to be able to show their lovely faces here.
Don't have any other contact information beyond them, an email, so I do not know if they're on I doubt it well, they don't seem to be in the room, so I think we should probably move ahead to the next point in the agenda, which is a discussion of our district needs statement and budget priorities, because the district needs is really coming up in the in what is it october, we're doing district needs and it's going to be pretty important, particularly in line of presentations that we've heard in the last meetings, whether it be the maternal mortality, whether it be the presentation that we heard about the Brooklyn plaza in the last meeting, and then today from the senior council.
That's going on in our community that we can I , don't know it's kind of hard to take a poll on the on the webex call, but I thought there were some interesting points in there about like mental health and NYCHA andro came up in in a cb2 email about a meeting that was had last week around what cb2 can do to to do something about the social and racial inequities that have been brought to light or that have gotten attention recently and is there something more that cb2 can do?
I suggested mobile health clinics because they have a long history, and so we could have more mobile health clinics that provide counseling and care for trauma and stress and I put it both ways, not just for people who are survivors and dealing with discrimination, but also for people who are perpetrators of racism and discrimination to prevent the sort of dangerous situations that are happening all the time so to combat sort of ignorance and insecurities That was one thing: mobile health clinic Other thing that I put out there was local hiring You know in this committee alone with liquor licenses, we see hundreds of jobs every year, but and we're always encouraging people to hire locally specifically to hire black and brown people , don't see any black or brown people working there or even eating there to be to be honest, and so what can we do?
Don't know what happens in the interim between the time that all of these business owners say yes, alejandro Yes, we're going to hire locally and we give them contact information to fort greene snap to the comm, the ingersoll community center to post to the Brooklyn navy yard, and we have interaction both with the people who need jobs and the people who are providing jobs, and I put an example there, so that was the other and then the article that came up through vice that carol, the calallen sent around evictions and how we're finding that it's disproportionately landlords are evicting black women as just as compared to white women.
They clearly did not have sufficient resources when they first got hit with the pandemic, to treat people for or for common symptoms, to be apprised of the right medical next steps to be given the right equipment There has to be sort of comprehensive distribution and and facilitation of the personal protective equipment getting out to both hospitals, medical providers, as well as places where there are large concentrations of people like NYCHA developments, so that people have the opportunity to use them and I'm continuously troubled by the number of people who just flagrantly don't wear, masks, left and right throughout our community in multiple different settings and the it I mean it's always a struggle to balance the people's individual rights to do what they want with the public health effects that come out of not wearing masks It's particularly noticeable to me that you know we have all of these businesses that are serving alcohol on the sidewalk or serving food on the sidewalk Even and every time I go by these places in our community.
There are very few people at the tables wearing a mask and I I'm concerned about the health aspects that come out of that I know I, always talk about green infrastructure and can seem a little bit intangible or maybe not always timely, but particularly with the development that we still struggle to have a voice in controlling, and while we have other committees that are thinking about how we address things like ami calculations and the lack of affordable housing in the district.
That is not just about new people moving into this district, but long-time residents in this district and well again, I, don't really know what form that takes, but I do think that air quality and other sort of lack of green infrastructure issues that have persisted kind of contribute to this inequitable.
But you know what, before my neighbor's need, is very different and at a different level than what many components of the district need and I think that has to be repeated frequently so that the powers that be who are going to really make the decisions about spending money understand what it is that we're asking for, because if you ask for something- and I would like to say that part of the problem is how the data that we're getting that community survey, which you know it really murkies up the waters here.
I. Don't know that we can actually impact the american community survey, but the community health profile also actually gives a little more detail, I think than the broad census data for our district, the one that new york city does every year, and so that's something we can use as well as most of most of the city's data is accessible online If we have you know a lot of data people, that's something we can actually get into and tease out the data that we're looking for you know : Should we be asking the city to focus their city-wide survey on something that's more focused on the more needed areas of our community, rather than like the you know, the community district as a whole No, it isn't, but again the community on the health, the community health profile, sort of pulls a little bit of that out.
I think I got it, but I think what I'm hearing at least barry and alejandro is that we need to have a little bit more geared towards the those specific aspects of the community district, because you know in several in some parts of the district things are going.
I think there needs to be more education on kova 19, put out to by the city department of health, But I'm, really not aware of any major initiatives, and it just makes me feel like in the world that I see with the kova 19, where you know, 50 people are not wearing masks.
When I go on the street, sometimes that you know there needs to be more education, provided particularly to like small business owners in the in the city, and you know, we've had a very kind of interesting couple of months with all kinds of things going on Even here locally, there have been a few bars and restaurants who've had their liquor licenses taken away because they're serving people without wearing without wearing masks on the inside and I.
I hope you have access to this, that we shared via email, I'll, try and make sure everybody has a renewed link to that afterwards and we can have some input Any other members of the committee have any more points regarding district needs, not hearing anything else from the from the committee, like with anything else, I'm gonna ask the community so two things so just on alejandro's point about the mental health services.
If you're in the neighborhoods you experience and feel, and one of the things is that obviously they're reporting the data as means and means always erase kind of doubt like the edges of the data One thing that would be an interesting point to start is just to even get the actual range of the data so that you are seeing the lows and the highs, because I think, particularly when I think about full green The highs, have gotten so high that it has thrown the average off considerably so that I think there is this obviously getting more granular data as alejandro is speaking to If there's some effort around getting the actual range of data, I think that's a great point and just for the sake of time I'm a community board member I have two points.
Think, aside from the concern about the noise that would be generated by any outdoor cafe in a residential neighborhood, which is something that I feel is fairly a common concern that we express there were some concerns expressed in the letters about the liquor store that the applicant currently operates and specifically sort of indicating that the applicant was serving or providing an opportunity to have, as it was alleged kind of an illegal sidewalk.
Oscar We have no control of what the community does outside the public room well from our establishment or across the street, because we have overflow from this otters that actually comes over and sits down on the benches I mean, as you guys know, generally, you know bars and nightclubs and establishments of that nature stay open significantly later The compromise would be we'd, certainly be willing to close the outside seating area.
Don't want to be open until late night , We've agreed, as I indicated, to barry that we would close the outside seating Even earlier, we've agreed to an earlier closing time, so we're willing to work with the community That's small, closing at midnight, the outside seating, closing at 10 I , don't know how it can be portrayed as a bar that will disrupt the area.
Don't think anybody is going to say that as a property owner as a as a as the owner of a store or a business, that you know that the that you're responsible for everything that goes on outside your business- How much is how often is there going to be on-premise supervision of the outdoor area to make sure things don't get out of hand with customers being loud, or this is a very residential neighborhood and the only way that this works in residential neighborhoods from our experience or there's excessive concerns being raised by the community Have these discussions after the applicant has already met with the block association but-.
But the midnight is extremely fair, midnight's, usually to cut off a lot of community boards and So midnight's, like the threshold that you're really not going to be a raucous bar and you legitimately a restaurant or a cafe, I mean if the committee thinks.
Okay I would just ask you guys one question which is that here at the health committee, we are very interested in local hiring and we wanted to have you speak briefly about the number of people you want to hire and give our some available options to consider between grasshall community center, fort greene, snap and the Brooklyn navy art, which are great resources in our community?
