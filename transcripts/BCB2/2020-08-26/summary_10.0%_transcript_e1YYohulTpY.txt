Good evening, everybody welcome to the first meeting of the New committee year for Community Board 2 health, environment, Social, Services Committee.
Ms Macy is here on behalf of the Fort Greene Senior Council, and we're going to be talking about Covid-19 impacts on the programs and services offered there, which we're really excited to hear.
I had to look in the thing: call each senior, where there's a thousand or whatever make sure they want to clarify that they're eligible for meal asked if they have nobody to cook Et cetera once they were qualified to get meals, we had to register them with the city, get meal program.
I think it's four times we opened since they started the cooling centers, so people are able to come, in, seniors are able to come in and we have.
Or they'll ask who's this person's name or whatever, because we see the seniors and you're welcome to take a sample in If you know anybody 60 and over in the community board, you want to, if they're isolated, they can join our virtual centers and if they live in community board 2, it's going to be great cigar.
: I do not know if it would be the committee if we need any help from you, I will reach out to miss church to see what the community board can help us with helping the seniors during this pandemic.
I, really appreciate your coming and speaking to us and if we were in a real room in person and not virtually we'd, be giving you a big round of applause, I'm sure, but I wanted to ask you a couple of questions and the committee , I'm sure, may have some other questions for you, too.
The people that you work with are appropriately equipped with personal protective equipment masks or if there were any issues or concerns that came up on the course of the pandemic.
So right now, we're good with the PPE, because office of the management are the OEM people they're sending PPE for the seniors that are open for cooling, center.
If anybody know any private person that would willing we'd willing to give our proposal give them the names- And I know some provider may probably give them free internet, because that's this is that I feel this is the new senior centers, because I do not think this is going to be a comeback.
Things might get back for the seniors wanting to come up, but for now they all want to get on the virtual centers Can I just interject for one second for Have the question answered with every presentation we're going to have we're going to have we're going to have first, the committee members are going to ask questions.
That says that looks like a little hand and raise your hand but feel free to type it in as well or or hello for members of the committee.
I'm, going to ask the rest of the committee members to if you have any questions to definitely feel free to share them.
I just wanted to give one sort of public service state statement here to the members of the committee.
They do not seem to be in the room, so I think we should probably move ahead to the next point in the agenda, which is a discussion of our district needs statement and budget priorities.
I. Think it's great that we've gotten to this point here, because the district needs is really coming up in the in what is it October We're doing district needs And it's going to be pretty important, particularly in line of presentations that we've heard in the last meetings, It be the maternal mortality, whether it be the presentation that we heard about the Brooklyn plaza in the last meeting and then today from the senior council.
That's, another conversation, so Know, sort of a lifetime of racism and discrimination and people are walking around with that trauma, and so I think, there's stuff that can be done from a health perspective around mental health and providing access to more care in our community.
You know in this committee alone, with liquor licenses, we see hundreds of jobs, every year, But and we're always encouraging people to hire locally specifically to hire black and brown people.
Yes, we're going to hire locally and we give them contact information to Fort Greene snap to the comm, the Ingersoll Community center to post to the Brooklyn Navy yard.
There, has to be sort of comprehensive distribution and and facilitation of the personal protective equipment getting out to both hospitals, medical providers, as well as places where there are large concentrations of people like NYCHA developments, so that people have the opportunity to use them, and I'm continuously troubled by the number of people who just flagrantly do not wear, masks, left and right throughout our community in multiple different settings and the it It's always a struggle to balance the people's individual rights to do what they want with the public health effects that come out of not wearing masks.
And while we have other committees that are thinking about how we address things like AMI calculations and the lack of affordable housing in the district, I worry a lot about air quality and Street.
I do not know infrastructure of the district, so I'm going to keep thinking on what that actually starts.
That's, really a question, but I do think that some of these the effects of this out of control development are felt disproportionately by the same parts of our district, where there's also a lot of long- term unemployment, and it's just sort of a compounding issue.
It's really horrendous, that kids are suffering and families are suffering the way they are, and that leads me to something I wanted to say, which is not really a specific need statement at this point, because I think we really covered a lot of good ground last year, also in the major needs that are there.
And, that's true, but what I wanted to point out is that we are a very diverse community district, which probably everybody here, knows, and I'm, saying what everybody already understands.
But I do not know how needs are thought about on the city hall level if they look at community district, wide.
So, my point, I guess, is that what the people who are going to make the decisions about spending money and focusing on issues need to understand is that we're a district that have pockets of tremendous need and tremendously long histories of having been ignored.
You know Well not park slow, but you know what, before my neighbor's need, is very different and at a different level than what many components of the district, need, And I think that has to be repeated frequently, so that the powers that be who are going to really make the decisions about spending money understand what it is that we're asking for, because if you ask for something- And I would like to say that part of the problem is how the data that we're getting that community survey, which you know it really murkies up the waters.
It would be right so that I think that's really essential that we push on that level to get that data They just need to be teased out and presented to us in a way because the community surveys, really just it, pulls everything too much.
You know: Should we be asking the city to focus their city- wide survey on something that's more focused on the more needed areas of our community, rather than like the you know, the community district as a whole- No, it is not, but again the community on the health, the community health profile, sort of pulls a little bit of that out.
I think I got it, but I think what I'm hearing at least Barry and Alejandro is that we need to have a little bit more geared towards the those specific aspects of the community district, because you know in several in some parts of the district, things are going.
Even here locally, there have been a few bars and restaurants who've had their liquor licenses taken away because they're serving people without wearing without wearing masks on the inside, and I just feel like that could be that there's more education, , that's needed, you know, and it's not like mandating people to wear the masks or but really making sure people understand the importance of it and the risks.
Any other members of the committee have any more points regarding district needs, not hearing anything else from the from the committee, like with anything else, I'm, going to ask the community.
I. Just think it's worth time in conversation, but specifically just around the issues of mental health and then to Barry's point about the data on the total, Data nerd, and so one of the things that strikes me because I was looking at the same thing.
If there's some effort around getting the actual range of data, I, think that's a great point and just for the sake of time I'm, a trauma, I'm, a community board.
I want health concerns with people and going forward.
More things are going to come out with people with disabilities, commit community, So I.
But I think, aside from the concern about the noise that would be generated by any outdoor cafe in a residential neighborhood, which is something that I feel is fairly a common concern that we express there were some concerns expressed in the letters about the liquor store that the applicant currently operates and specifically sort of indicating that the applicant was serving or providing an opportunity to have, as it was alleged kind of an illegal sidewalk.
And I think there were even some photos that were shared with us with expressing concerns about the amount of noise, as well as the fact that some of the staff members at this liquor store were not wearing masks or complying with the Covid-19 health directives.
Okay, I'm, going to let other members of the committee ask questions as well.
You know what I would reiterate to the committee is that this premises was already licensed for a decade and a half , so we're not adding another license to the community and again they're the It's a fairly small establishment and the applicant owns the building.
This would be if the only thing that you I would just ask for anybody making a statement or a question just try to keep it somewhat brief answer in the hour and and direct your comments to the chair and to the committee, just because the based upon how we do this when we're in person, we normally ask folks in the community to do that.
And, it's very pro, business, But I would ask the committee to push on these issues and to push on the idea that the people who own the liquor store are not aware.
I just want to also see if there are any other members of the community who have a question for regarding this application as well too I had a lot of problems laundering littering noise.
But I just want to give you an opportunity to respond to the comments and questions that were raised by the members of the community.
Do not think anybody is going to say that as a property owner as a as a as the owner of a store or a business, that you know that the that you're responsible for everything that goes on outside your business- How often is there going to be on, premise, supervision of the outdoor area, to make sure things do not get out of hand with customers being loud, or this is a very residential neighborhood, and the only way that this works in residential neighborhoods from our experience is if there is really strong, supervision- I guess what will be done in the event that there's too much noise And Or there's excessive concerns being raised by the community.
You want to do a poll of committee members, but again, midnight is a fair closing hour and reducing the outdoor seating by two hours.
The community has okay Okay, no issue at all right , we're going to need to wrap this up because we're nearing the what, when maybe the close of our meeting, because some folks on our committee need to go.
Do, you agree that if the community has concerns and questions and brings them to your attention, you will be open to discussing the concerns of the community and knowing that will be also put before this committee, I'm sure by your community members?
All, right, approve, okay , I, do not know if I'm no Jessica's point about the community concern is a great concern for me, as well, obviously, by my questions, But John's point about giving people who are offering to be reasonable, a reasonable chance and opportunity to prove their medal resonates to me as well.
The coffee shop actually has approval for open restaurant, and we finish Early So right now there is an outdoor space with barricade and build out and depending on when we're getting our liquor license.
Any questions for this application from the members of the committee.
Yes, I've got your you on the line here, but I just want to give the committee a chance to ask any questions off the off the bat in light of the hour.
Would just ask you guys one question which is that here at the health committee, we are very interested in local hiring and we wanted to have you speak briefly about the number of people you want to hire and give our some available options to consider between Grasshall Community, Center, Fort, Greene Snap and the Brooklyn Navy art, which are great resources in our community?
I should have asked this as a question, but we assume that should any concerns come up from the community while you're in operation, you will be accepted to discuss those concerns and if they seem to have merit resolving them in a way that works as best as it possibly can for you, as well as the people's concerns.
Any questions from members of the community for this application.
