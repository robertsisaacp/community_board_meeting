I are both the leadership team for the organization Today we wanted to share with you our mission, the timeline of our organization, the impact thus far to the community, how we've been operating during Covid-19 19 and then how we would love for people to get involved with our organization and then, if time permits we'll have q a We've been asked to keep our presentation to 15 minutes because you guys have a full agenda today, but we have our contact information at the end.
So first I'll share with you the mission of the book of the bodega, and the mission is to increase the number of 100 plus book homes in new york city There's, research that shows that households with 100 plus book homes, boost life outcomes for children, adolescents, and we have educators on the call today, So I'm sure you can speak to that also and know how important it is Despite the resources, though, and the wealth and the growth in Brooklyn, we recognize that our community actually is a book desert, which just means that areas have few books available for sale or for lending, and we strongly believe that children should be able to grab a book and be at home and immerse themselves in it.
You know I think it's important for kids to be able to choose the books that they want to read and have access to a variety of books, and then the third is around community because we're bridging communities and we're open to to the public to any community we're really welcoming diverse backgrounds from people from different social, economic classes, race and culture, and so it's not uncommon to see at our events, people from public housing and then people who own a multi-million dollar apartment sitting and reading together with their kids and we found downtown Brooklyn, is a great location to bridge communities together, So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into the organization we're a young organization that was started in december of 2018 and what we did is we piloted programs?
The Brooklyn navy yard was able to give a space to run our events and I think someone from the call is here from the Brooklyn navy yard, so I'll just give them a shout out, because that has also been great for us during Covid-19 This year before Covid-19, we had three successful events and we had on average So I'll share a little bit more about Covid-19 in a second, but before I get into that I'm going to share a little bit about the impact that we've had so far with some of the numbers So. Since we started in december of 2018 up until now, which is about 19 months, we have been partnering with many local organizations from businesses to schools and we're utilizing them for either book collection or volunteers.
Online I can read anything level, I'm a very strong reader, but I really miss the library When we got that letter in at the end of march early april, we were like, we really need to work, to get books out into communities and into homes, because kids do want to be able to read in their own home and may not have the books Is. We set up a model where we were distributing books with essential organizations that were handing out things, handing out food and supplies to the community, and so we've distributed about 6, 500 books so far to different community-based organizations and right in the community board.
Two area we've distributed to 307 to 261 and the farragut cornerstone community center Also, and then I also wanted to share with you a letter that we got from a principal once they received a delivery from us, so they said, as you can imagine, access to text can be challenging in the best of circumstances, but during these unprecedented times ensuring our students have access to books is virtually impossible.
We've, also added our reader's corner to get recommendations for readers, and then we've moved our personal guest, our guests that come in on-site to our events, to be pre-recorded and virtual, so that parents have access to them anytime, also, and then, just last week we added a summer reading page for families also, and you can see all this is on our website and then lastly, I'd like to show and share with you on how people can get involved with the bodega.
Think that could be an area for your organization to reach additional families, because when the gardens are in operation, lots of families go there and children and it could be great We- have to come up with creative ways now, because there are not large family events that you know that we're going to be hosting- You know and in people's homes.
There is an organization called barbershop, it's called barbershop books called barbershop books, yes barbershop books and that's what they focus on They focus on books and putting books in barber shops and also working with the people who work in the barber shops also and to educate them about literacy Are there any more questions or comments from committee members, so I'll open this up to anyone who's on this call I'm sure several of my of my schools will arrange with their parents to can arrange with their parents some kind of drive or something especially over the summer- didn't serve the children of first responders, and so one of the things we could possibly potentially do is to connect you with someone who supervises one of those sites in the district.
Where I'd say most of our schools in the cb2 area are in district 13 and we have had a relationship with the cec 13 that have been sharing information with us, as well as parents that come to our meetings The last few months with the remote learning the plans for the summer.
The plans for reopening I know a lot of this is still in flux, and then there will be questions from our committee and audience We just want to hear your perspective and also help inform us when we start to write our statement of community needs.
We are now in the middle of all of our all, of our principles are meeting and assessing how we did and areas that we need to improve going into the future and developing real expectations across the district for what high quality, remote learning would look like, and so, as we continued into remote learning after the disruption We. Also in this district launched three sites for what we call regional enrichment centers where we were serving and we continued to serve the students and families of first responders.
A lot of the feedback that we got from parents was that there wasn't in at first there wasn't enough live instruction, meaning a teacher going on and teaching life focus So. As we as we had to do with the with the pandemic, and so we are Our, principals now are looking at what are administering assessments and looking at what kids have learned in during this time and making sure that they plan different intervention strategies, making sure that students are recommended, if not mandated for summer school Most.
But you know, I think the a jarring image for me was seeing the police van burn close to the barclays center and realizing wow how to really look at the trauma, not only from that event, but also from Covid-19 to really look at our social, emotional learning and development of asia appropriately for students, and we used that to then launch, as requested by the cec launch a conversation with the cac with the broader community around You know, policing policies, housing policies, how and how they interact and how they intersect and play themselves out in our schools right, and so that's that that's a conversation that we are heavily involved in our district.
What's not good remote learning is to expect people to do just to post assignments and so on and also- So the teacher is on like for the entire day, so I would I I believe that and what we talked about as a district is that what happened was a period of adjustment right, a period where, first of all, how much work is enough?
It was march 10th or something we had a meeting, and then we decided not to do it because of the outbreak, and this was very important to me I mean the cec had a zoom thing that had a capacity of a hundred So the people, especially given, what's happening today , It's a conversation, it's a mission that most people want to start back and it's a mission that I So in terms of the specific that the work of the diversity group and the specific people that have been that are together on that we're, constantly pushing and advocating to start, hopefully in september, but even prior to that.
Having this conversation, all the voices at the table and really managing a process that involves becoming a better new york, I'm becoming a better Brooklyn, a better downtown Brooklyn, a better district, 13, I'm going to be working on that, regardless of what the school diversity, whether we get go ahead from them or not?
We then have to ask well what policies drive enrollment patterns Over the last 10 years, you've had like thousands of black students, leave our elementary schools, a thousand or so white students who move in That's, causing that, because what we believe and the way we discuss it as a cec and as and as a community superintendent, which is kind of you know, the community comes before the superintendency If I, don't work with my cec and know my community board to kind of interrogate the intersectionality of all those things.
But right now we're so focused on making sure that we have the right structure in place to ensure that appropriate social distance, because you bring up like reopening and you're bringing up a reopening conversation right Thinking about protocols and mechanisms to ensure safety and social, distancing- If there are schools that have gardens, they should be considering that into their program to kind of alleviate some of the space concerns or some of the internal kids being inside concerns, and so I totally appreciate that you're saying what you're putting You know people he got a letter into a little trouble, but I'll say too In this case.
In fact we had people going on facebook trying to connect with your cousin, If I know you have a cousin in the school and trying like we had a whole I felt like investigative work that we were doing to get to those students, and so we worked out that list down over the course of the last seven weeks and Thank you so much for engaging with our committee, and we please continue on the meeting here unless you want to put your daughter to bed.
What so I want to hear from the committee members how you feel about having a summer meeting Some of the things we would probably be talking about is the statement of district needs, we'd be talking about youth and the police, the policing and the schools, the school safety Everybody knows the summer.
When we had the executive committee meeting, there was an interest in the transportation bus transportation, public safety committee It's the public safety part of the committee might be interested in meeting with us regarding youth and supporting youth in terms of perhaps a statement about the school safety agents who are transferring the funding from the police to the school So. Our people interested in perhaps having a summer meeting, and it would be a format like webex from where you are- We have to choose I'd, say one month out of the summer, either july or august, but I don't think we need to have more than one item of substance on the agenda so that we can get it done in a good time.
To check with the chair, I mean I can't just say we're gonna, but I think we should do it because they're concerned with public safety, we're concerned with the youth and the the policing and My ceo is on the school opening committee for the mayor with the mayor, and she, you know, is, doesn't hold back and school safety actually was, has come up in that conversation and I believe there was some students represented and comment was made that school safety is not the NYPD by the DOE and the student had to say so.
