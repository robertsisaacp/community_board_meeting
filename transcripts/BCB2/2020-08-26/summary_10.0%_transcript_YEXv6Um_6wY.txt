Is, the youth education, cultural affairs committee of the Brooklyn community board, two It's being recorded for the purpose of transparency and for public access on the cb2 youtube.
We encourage attendees to leave the cameras on, especially if you're, given the flaw to speak, I'm going to make it known which topics are open for comment by community members board members or the public, and if you wish to speak, you can use the webex feature to digitally.
Since our committee last met in february, a community as well as people have experienced tremendous loss, and we acknowledge that and our country is going through a very challenging time.
She started teaching middle school in baltimore city 20 years ago and has been working on issues of literary access and equity for her entire career.
Despite the resources, though, and the wealth and the growth in Brooklyn, we recognize that our community actually is a book desert, which just means that areas have few books available for sale or for lending, and we strongly believe that children should be able to grab a book and be at home and immerse themselves.
So, just in the interest of time, today, I'm just going to share a little bit more about ownership, book access and building a community I appreciate that thanks, rob so sort of the areas of focus is one is ownership, so you can see.
So kids can write their names in their in the books, and we know that books at home makes it more like likely that children will have exposure to vocabulary, which then leads to them to thrive at school and then in general, in life.
You know, I think it's important for kids to be able to choose the books that they want to read and have access to a variety of books, and then the third is around community.
We spent most of last year working building our relationship at the ingersoll cornerstone community center at NYCHA, and we hosted five public events at that community center, which was open to anyone, and then we also had private school events in the neighborhood in in downtown Brooklyn, The Brooklyn navy yard was able to give a space to run our events, and I.
We really need to get books into homes, because schools were going to be closed and libraries for the foreseeable future, and during this time one teen wrote to us about the start.
When we got that letter in at the end of March early April, we were like, we really need to work to get books out into communities and into homes, because kids do want to be able to read in their own home and may not have the books.
You know we're getting more and more letters from cbo's that having access to books to be able to share with their community has had a positive impact in the last two months.
Think the first ways people can go to our website and you can learn more about us and the work that we're doing Second, you can host a neighborhood table to distribute books.
Had a few book drives happening during Covid-19 And they've been very successful, because people do want to share their resources and again we have step-by-step instructions on best practices and people can get their community engaged.
So first I'd like to call on any members of our committee who have any questions about the Brooklyn book odega.
When we hold events in our community garden, we can certainly collaborate, but I, think that could be an area for your organization to reach additional families, because when the gardens are in operation, lots of families go there and children and it could be great We- have to come up with creative ways now, because there are not large family events that you know that we're going to be hosting- And, we know, there's still a need to have books out there, you know, and in people's homes.
Another idea that came out in another committee was that people are looking at barber shops as poor places in the community, where people regularly go and the thought of having maybe some books, there.
I'm sure several of my of my schools will arrange with their parents to can arrange with their parents some kind of drive or something especially over the summer- Didn't serve the children of first responders, and so one of the things we could possibly potentially do is to connect you with someone who supervises one of those sites in the district.
So we're kind of hiring, Because I know some of you kind of cut off some of the funding, so we're actually hiring six to seven teams through the summer for each clubhouse And I'm in charge with coming up with different service projects or project-based learning, activities, And I.
Where I'd say most of our schools in the cb2 area are in district 13 and we have had a relationship with the cec 13 that have been sharing information with us, as well as parents that come to our meetings.
The last few months with the remote learning the plans for the summer, the plans for reopening I know a lot of this is still in flux, and then there will be questions from our committee and audience We just want to hear your perspective and also help inform us when we start to write our statement of community Needs.
How to use teams just like a lot of work, went into that We are now in the middle of all of our all, of our principles are meeting and assessing how we did and areas that we need to improve going into the future and developing real expectations across the district.
Our principals, now are looking at what are administering assessments and looking at what kids have learned in during this time and making sure that they plan different intervention, strategies, making sure that students are recommended, if not mandated for summer school.
How to really look at the trauma, not only from that event, but also from Covid-19 to really look at our social, emotional learning and development of asia appropriately for students, and we used that to then launch, as requested by the cec launch a conversation with the cac with the broader community around you, know.
We looked at the reciting of arts and letters from the ps20 building, which has been an ongoing issue in our district, where both schools felt like they were growing and needed.
And we are working within those schools to really really build out the educational platform and once And also, we will be thinking about and engaging in a public engagement process.
And finally, I want to talk about ps 67, which and by the way most of my schools, like elementary schools, especially have are involved in some kind of diversity and enrollment conversation.
What's not good remote learning is to expect people to do just to post assignments, and so on, and also- So the teacher is on like for the entire day, so I would I I believe that and what we talked about as a district, is that what happened was a period of adjustment right, a period where, first of all,?
Engagement process, but even if we don't some of that, some of that work is about it's more about will and the political will that you have and how strong how you position yourself in order to like house those conversations which I think would like I said we're building on that in our cec meetings.
You know, I am there, I'm going to be working on that, regardless of what the school diversity, whether we get go ahead from them or not.
You know that says whether the parents know it or not like are we confronting people with those conversations, since everybody wants to be anti-racist , today, all right, so I will say the last two meetings which I kicked off at the cc was directly addressing what you just talked about and the first one was like.
If I, don't work with my cec and know my community board to kind of interrogate the intersectionality of all those things.
Yes to answer the question, we're going to continue the conversation What we came up with yesterday Were some areas of policy that folks are going to look at, whether that be funding mechanisms, whether that be school safety being under the NYPD versus the department of education and what that can?, And I'll be sure to make sure all those community boards get information on that.
Or how can we engage with your thinking to use school gardens as outdoor classrooms, because we know that we would prefer the students to be outside then inside, but we know that gardens are very powerful in the children's social, emotional learning in cultural revol, cultural, relevant work, storytelling, acknowledgement of kids, culture building skills, as well as the healthy food, nutrition, and so on.
If there are schools that have gardens, they should be considering that into their program, to kind of alleviate some of the space concerns or some of the internal kids being inside concerns, and so I totally appreciate that you're saying what you're putting You know people he got a letter into a little trouble, but I'll say too.
Thank, you so much for engaging with our committee, and we please continue on the meeting here unless you want to put your daughter to bed We, look forward to engaging in these deep conversations to hear all voices and all parts of the community.
And I know one of the things we're going to be talking about further this summer and so on.
We're going to be talking about policing and in relation to the school safety and the police and the schools, and that might be something that you or your staff want to be part of that conversation, And I know we're going to be asked to start working on our district statement of needs.
What so, I want to hear from the committee members how you feel about having a summer meeting.
Perhaps, but now it sounds like you're talking about two meetings, one with public safety and one just on the district of needs.
To check with the chair, I mean, I can't just say we're gonna, but I think we should do it because they're concerned with public safety, we're concerned with the youth and the the policing and My ceo is on the school opening committee for the mayor with the mayor and she, you know, is, doesn't hold back and school safety actually was, has come up in that conversation, and I believe there was some students represented and comment was made that school safety is not the NYPD by the DOE and the student had to say.
