Ms macy is here on behalf of the fort greene senior council and we're going to be talking about Covid-19 19 impacts on the programs and services offered there, which we're really excited to hear about. So thank you very much for coming and for being part of our meeting. You're welcome. Okay, everyone! It's going to be a brief, so you can carry on with your meeting and I have another meeting. I just want to give a background for everyone that wouldn't know about fort greene. Council ford ring council has been wrong. This is their 48th year at 966, fulton street in community board. Two, it's our district and we are social services agency, human services. We serve seniors. Well, we usually say we serve from the cradle to the grave. We serve from two years old to infinity, so we have children's program day care and after school program and the upk program, and we have 13 senior centers, which they call now neighborhood centers, so how the Covid-19 19 affected our all our programs. First, I'm going to start with the children's program. Briefly, they're now getting to the seniors. All our members are not 65.. The department for the aging age is 60., so those of you who think you're not a senior if you're 60, you can join our center you're considered a senior to be eligible to join any senior center run by the city. New york city depart for the aging once you're 60 and over okay, so the coffin 19 came and our children's program, which is also located at 966 next door, which is 972 same building. It suddenly came to a halt. We were told first of all, the parents took the kids out suddenly and then, after that it happened. So quick next thing I know the teachers call in and since then the entire children program has been affected. It was coming on this summer we were supposed to have some camp for the children that are six to twelve and that's funded by dycd. That came to all, because there was no money to fund it and, of course it wasn't impossible. So right now for our children program, we're listening to the powers that be the mayor and the governor wait and the board of ed, of course, they'll get information from them as to when and if we're gonna open back in september. So that's where we stand so with the Covid-19 19. We were doing for the last two weeks of the after school program. We were supposed to close in april and we did do distant learning until we closed that. Just for the school age, the little kids, they warned the two-year-old. The teachers were calling the parents and see what they can do with them, but it wasn't too much helpful for a two-year-old. So that's where we are moving to our bigger population, they're 60 and over and this Covid-19 19 has affected. Though you don't hear a lot about it with seniors, there's a reason it did affect the seniors. Really bad social isolation was the main thing: social, isolation and meals. So I'll give you an inside view of what you do here the last day the seniors were here was on friday, the 13th of march, and that was the friday. The last day they were in here having congregate me in which they come together and eat and socialize and we were and everybody that's sponsors. We were getting instruction second by second last minute, so that was a friday. We got a call to say, cancel coming back, tell them they can do grab and go. So we immediately from monday, which we started. They stopped coming on the 13th for congregate and from monday march 16th we had to cook the meal, they come by the door, grab it and go so that went on and then suddenly it was stopped on march 30th. That was stopped by the city if you're following the news and they started with something with get meals from new york city. So what we were told to do, because my staff is still working the essential workers we had to register everybody, because our names and our system goes directly to lifta to the mirror, whatever whoever, if all of your seniors registered, would be in the system. So each of my programs had to call. I had to look in the thing: call each senior, where there's a thousand or whatever make sure they want to clarify that they're eligible for meal asked if they have nobody to cook et cetera, once they were qualified to get meals, we had to register them with the city get meal program. It started out by us calling 3-1-1 for any problems and, as you know, every second, it was being changed. So eventually the mayor, that's all I'm going to say the mayor turn it over, take it away from diphther and turn it over to the department of sanitation to do the meals. So at that point yes, so at that point we had to now we're like going everywhere for the place we had to. We had registered some people, the meal started to come. It was a big disaster. Then it was changed. The first thing is they change vendors anyway, right now to fast forward the seniors. Some were getting some word in the meantime, those that weren't getting for here, the cb2 from me personally for green council. I reach out to the department for the aging and ask for permission for us to cook. I know what the mayor's doing, but we had seniors. One was a hundred years couldn't cook for herself, and I said I want to do it and deliver myself. Have my staff do it so during that time I did it twice. We serve like a thousand meals one day. You know all around giving everybody who wasn't getting it. Eventually that worked out where everybody start getting the food and then eventually it turns out. They don't want the food, because it's no good and a whole lot of complaints. So my staff has been very busy and myself that's why we're back in the office? People couldn't work from home because it's a lot going on and we need to cut all the computers. So my staff has been in the office at 966 since about two and a half months. Now we had to come back into the office. So the seniors, though you may not hear a lot about seniors and there's probably a reason on the tv they're pushing for the children. The seniors were going through a lot and I'm thankful that ford green council was able to help the folks at least not all the time, with some meals when we deliver those meal. I give everybody five meals, one hot meal and the rest that we cook and put in the fridge. They call it quick chill we quick chili so that they would have had meat for a week, because I did not know whether the get meal program would have gotten to them for a week, and I didn't want them to be hungry but, like I said since then, meals all over the city is being wasted. Right now, seniors are refusing them because after that came and everybody tried to get in private agencies and so they're getting meals from here, meals from there and they're picking and choosing so hopefully that we'll get back to normal. So through this pandemic, what we're doing every day we're making calls and we were able to register over 2 000 seniors, not register. We have to qualify them to get a free air condition, which was the city you heard about that right. The city free air condition program for the seniors, so the people who live in NYCHA were supposed to automatically get it, but the other people that we have registered. So in this case, if you were a member of a senior center membership has privilege, because only those names were in the city and the city would send us a list of the names that we would call them to re, pre-qualify them, and so we were able to qualify. 2 000 people got air conditioned seniors through our effort and we're also doing everyday wellness calls, which is very important. There's a lot of socializing the seniors who live by themselves. It's very you know, social isolation. So what happened? I thought about how we can help them because they want to come back out it's getting too boring. Now we have a bench for those who know the area. There's a bench in front of the building here, we're opposite the putnam triangle and right now, even though it's pandemic they're getting bored we're in here working, they cannot come in, but we finding more and more of them are coming and sit on the bench. But it's hot or not! Our center is being open now as a cooling center and I'm very proud and happy that the mayor made it 60 and over for the social isolation. So we have been opening. I think it's four times we opened since they started the cooling centers, so people are able to come in, seniors are able to come in and we have. We have to follow the guidelines. We have training on the CDC regulations and so the commission of visitors last week. I think one day checking results and we were on the channel 5 news, so we're doing well with that so being isolated and can't come back. I started for green. We call it the fgc virtual senior centers and we're open the virtual centers from 10 o'clock to 3 o'clock monday through friday, and I will send miss church a link after the meeting or tomorrow morning, so she can share with everyone who would like to check it out, although you're not 60, so you can see what's going on and if you know anybody 60 and over, you can come on. You register them online. So the virtual program, I'm just going to describe a bit we're trying to do every single thing that we did in the center and I'm very pleased to say, you'll, be surprised today in our cooking demonstration, we had 68 people and you'll be surprised how the seniors be doing technology work class and all of that to show them how to use their cell phone and their computers. Those who have so it's becoming a big hit. This is our third week and we have activities from exercise in the morning which you can take part in. Is it's busy one after the other? Three is our last. Our last program started two today. The last program was black girls who quilt or who do craft and we've upgraded ourselves. I bought equipment, so we have a studio now that we're still working on, but we're recording summer live from the studio like the cooking and the exercise classes, and some are those who can manage it are doing it from their place. So it's amazing. I know it's working because if you sign on anytime you'll see the seniors are so happy and we're very culturally sensitive to all our members. So we have music lunch. Time is from 12 to 1 and once that's over, then you have the cooking class, the cooking demonstration. Every day you have one which is live and we have whatever music. They want it here. They give them, and we do it and I'm proud of my staff, because everybody I'm not paying to do this they're learning overnight how to operate a camera etc, and the people are cooking, are all the cooks every day at different center. Prepare something for the seniors can learn how to do it. Today we had a smoothie with garlic, with no with some healthy thing, with what's the green thing, turmeric, ginger and fresh fruits mango and something and what we did today, we raffle all who came on. They had a raffle. They asked a question after they described what it is and they have benefits who remembered it. They won a prize and the price was a sample of it. And yes, we deliver in cb2. Doesn't matter where they live, the person that came on so they put it in the freezer and the driver came put it in a nice bag and they're feeling so good about it. We also did a raffle for the quilting. We just started today and anybody could take part in it. They draw it on the zoom platform. The center and three people won, so we hand deliver three of the kits of the material, the thread and everything, so they can work along with it, the others who didn't win, we're telling them where to buy the stuff and whatever so we're not missing anything. We have everything that we had in-house fab also did a yoga week for us two days. One week are we trying to work with them to see what else can go on to serve the seniors, so this pandemic has taught us those seniors say they can't get into. I think they know more than I do know how to get in they're familiar with the zoom platform, so we're sticking with that and they're getting better every day and lunchtime music. Today, I my staff check on because after checking people and I go on sometimes just to see, what's happening and how it is, and I'm very pleased they have lunchtime, music and the people actually get up on dance and they are so happy- and we have tea time remember this when I send the link on tuesdays at, I think it's one o'clock, if you go to my website for greenconsole.org, it's gonna say for green virtual centers. You click it. There's gonna, be a link, it tells you the program and everything. So if you don't get it just do that and the topics we're trying to end ageism, since all the agents are done, and the commissioner said you know, lyft is fostering that and we were doing it two years before so the topics the tea with flowers is like, I don't want to say wendy williams, but I call her wendy williams, but it's heart to heart and you'll be very surprised how the seniors you're alive and not because of their age. One of the topics was last week was what was the topic? I didn't mention it before the topic. Last week was a letter, they read letters in the letter. The person was talking, oh, that someone was comp. It ended up being. If you have a mother-in-law and your husband should she sit in the front seat of the car. If he come to pick you up and it you would see how the brain is going and it's very good for them and everybody's happy. This week, tuesday, there was something that you'll have to listen to was about sex and the seniors were so much involved. So tuesday, I don't know, what's their topic, I never know I just join in and tea with flowers. I think it's at one o'clock or two o'clock, but you'll see it online. So just pop in anytime. If we see you say Brooklyn, you know cb2 or whatever wheels or they'll ask who's this person's name or whatever, because we see the seniors and you're welcome to take a sample in and if you know anybody 60 and over in the community board you want to, if they're isolated, they can join our virtual centers and if they live in community board 2, it's going to be great cigar. We register them and then everything else we're going to start sending the samples of the food we make any cooking from now on. If two people win so we're encouraging them and we see it selling with isolation, I have one senior, they remember her name every day. I see her in her bed, but from the time she comes on a tent, she doesn't leave till everything is over and she takes part. So it's giving them and then some of them one senior, the daughter, came to him and realized this and she's happy. So she comes every day, help him to get on and stay on with him and participate. So we have the intergeneration program and that's all we can do in a local level because we can't well, I can't maybe some of you can. I can't get closer to the mirror and the governor and my opinion, I'm joining some group, so it really doesn't help too much. So we have to take care of our seniors on a local level in Brooklyn and in this district and everywhere else. So I want to thank you for inviting me miss church and I hope on one thing I want to say with this committee. I don't know if it would be the committee if we need any help from you, I will reach out to miss church to see what the community board can help us with helping the seniors during this pandemic. So I want to thank you. If there's any questions, I'm open well. Thank you. I really appreciate your coming and speaking to us and if we were in a real room in person and not virtually we'd, be giving you a big round of applause, I'm sure, but I wanted to ask you a couple of questions and the committee, I'm sure, may have some other questions for you too. Generally speaking about how many members do you have with the fort greene senior council and when the pandemic had in march, did everyone seem to stay engaged or was there an experience where some people became disengaged because of the pandemic, and I was also just kind of wondering about the degree to which you felt like your seniors. The people that you work with are appropriately equipped with personal protective equipment masks or if there were any issues or concerns that came up on the course of the pandemic in that regard. Okay, this was brandon right, yeah, okay, that's me, yeah, okay, a bunch of questions that I'm gonna try to. Remember start from the last that I remember the PPE. Yes, of course, it was a panic, because I remember the beginning after the 13th and it got real scary. I remember seeing all around here. Look like a ghost town. The seniors stayed at home. They were very scared and I must say a lot of seniors die from our agents from all the centers. We had about 25 deaths in the beginning from the Covid-19, so they were all inside and trying to be isolated, and then they got a little angry after a week or two that they weren't getting food. That's why I jump in that in terms of the PPE, I must give a shout out to some of our elected officials that reach out to me immediately, including our attorney general, and ask if I had PPE she was the first one that called me, and so she had sent over some stuff immediately within an hour because nobody had the mask at that time. She sent over some and after that, a couple more elected officials from the district they'd come in and do gives PPE, which we were able to distribute to the seniors home and after that, and they become more available. Even the borough president came to my house and bring some for me to get here to them. So right now we're good with the PPE, because office of the management are the oem people they're sending PPE for the seniors that are open for cooling center. So when you come into the cooling center, if you don't have one it's fine, we have it at the door and we also mailed to the seniors. So we were able to provide masks for the seniors, we're also able to distribute hand sanitizers. So those two things were able to help with and they felt a little more comfortable. Thank goodness, as of today, I don't think, there's a shortage of any mass, so it's just now they're complaining which one they want, and this one that I'm holding up here. This is the best one they can breed from and it has a metal so we're trying to get as much as these to keep and give to them when they come in because the ones we have are look this one here is what elected a fish had brought it's just a piece of terry material and they cut holes and the seniors don't like this anymore. They can't breed with it, especially when it's hot this one was also another elected official, the city. I think the people in the prison makes this one and it's a double lining, so this can be washed. This can be watched. These are disposable and we find the seniors are going more for this one. So we were able to do that and if I didn't end support, can you ask me I listen to that from the top from the bottom? Is there anything else that I missed? Oh, I was just wondering about how many total members your group your council, has, and if there was any I mean I'm sorry to hear about the folks who passed away, that I mean that that's. That certainly is tragic, and I you know our hearts go out to them, but I was what I my heart. My question was really just in the in the realm of. Were there a number of people who just became sort of disconnected from the center because they moved into the zoom culture and perhaps they just didn't take to zoom very well. No, first of all, we serve on a normal pre-cover time about 2 000 people a day for lunch and about 1500 for breakfast, and then we have dinner at some centers like this center has dinner twice a week and we would serve about 50 dinner every week or 100 between two days. Now I feel- and I don't I didn't- see- a decline from there moving away. I think the people who can't get on zuma are very upset and I'm trying my best. I don't know how advocating we can be, who know bill gates. Some of the seniors do not have an iphone nor a computer or laptop, and my wish is that those that can't afford it and don't have it and some of them do have internet. So they call in on the phone and they're missing out seeing the stuff. So that's the only challenge I have. I was on a call when they had a committee with the mayor's office. They called me- and I'd mentioned I'd like the seniors, but nothing happened. So if anybody know any private person that would willing we'd willing to give our proposal give them the names- and I know some provider may probably give them free internet because that's this is that I feel this is the new senior centers, because I don't think this is gonna, be a comeback. No time soon. I think by 2023. This is my thing, not a doctor. Things might get back for the seniors wanting to come up, but for now they all want to get on the virtual centers. Mrs macy. How many would you like? How many would you need, or how many would you want understanding that it would be limited, but what would be a good number to start with? Okay, who am I speaking, I'm sorry, emily, okay, good idea? Can I just interject for one second for and it's fine, absolutely we'll have the question answered with every presentation we're going to have we're going to have we're going to have first, the committee members are going to ask questions and then we'll have members of the public. Ask a question really happy that you joined us, though, and because you asked the question, I think it's a fair question. This may see you want to go ahead and answer yes, I love you emily, there's always a difference between a need and a want, and you did say how many I need or how many I want, if you ask me at one time, say: 10 000, to cover every senior. If you ask my need specifically now with the seniors who really are dying to get on, I would say a minimum of 150, but if we get 50 we'll give those that make a raffle so whatever it is, but what are really what they need now is between 100 150 for the need, and then we can raffle them if it's a one we'll give everybody but 10 000.. Thank you. Thank you for that. Any other members of the committee have questions for miss macy there's a feature. I know that the process of asking questions and web access ranges from the awkward to the impossible. But if you there is a feature where, if you go to the top part of the participant screen, you can click on a little button. That says that looks like a little hand and raise your hand but feel free to type it in as well or or hello for members of the committee hi brandon. Can you hear me? I can hear you, but I don't know who it is. I'm sorry this is a consular cop. This is this is not a question for miss musty macy. It's a statement. I just want the board to know that fort greene is an outstanding. It's a wonderful program. Of course I'm biased. I talk about it all the time, but I just wanted the board to know that it's an outstanding and a very special program. It services a lot of seniors in Brooklyn in the Brooklyn area and I can testify if it wasn't there, it would be truly missed and a lot of people may not have survived and may not survive, because this is a place where people come to socialize and they come to eat and they come because they know that they are loved and welcome, and that is so important, particularly at this time when there are so many people that are feeling isolated. So again, I want to say thank you, miss macy for all that you do, and I will see you next week. Thank you, nicoso, okay, brandon, it's jessica. I have a quick question. Ms macy, thank you so much. Thank you for all of the honestly incredible work that you're doing you mentioned before we were talking about the virtual sessions that you're hosting you mentioned that you're doing wellness calls and checks on members of the community. Are there? I guess I was going to ask. Are there trends that you're hearing but are hoping, but are there? Are there issues that you are referring to other agencies or is there any support? You need with that, I'm curious what is coming up and what you do with that information that you hear about. Okay, jessica, we were all frozen. At least I was frozen. So I didn't hear everything you said: okay, yeah! So can you repeat the last part cause you got caught off? You were frozen for a while. Yes, I'm sorry about that. So when you're making these wellness calls that you mentioned, are there issues that you're hearing that you're needing to lean on other city agencies for or is there support that you need? That is difficult to get I'm curious. What's coming up in those wellness calls? Okay, that's a great question. So what happens? The point for the aging has a guideline and they also have a lot of support and numbers. We can refer people to or recall for them if they cannot. So that's a very helpful thing. The part for the itching has a lot of programs, and so my staff is trained. If they have friends of somebody you can tell they want to commit suicide and you're, not a social worker. Of course we train them a little. Then they can reach out to their supervisor immediately and there's a number for them to call for difter right away. If somebody we call- and they say they had no food, so there is support and the wellness call is an addition to the virtual centers. We still make wellness call every day and whoever is not on is not neglected because they get the willingness call lately. People that don't get wellness call is because they're coming out in the street now and they're, not home you're, not staying home, because I cannot imagine and understand how they feel in the cooling center. Like the commissioner came and saw- and I heard she mentioned in a meeting- we had the other day that she feel at this time- they're not only coming for cool they're coming to see their friends even if they can't touch them they're six feet apart and they're talking- and I think you know so it's really a challenge and I'm praying that they work it out. So they can come back. You know we can have two sessions or whatever to make it social distancing, but they want to see each other's face, so we're hoping that will work out. Thank you. Thank you. So much you're welcome I'm going to ask the rest of the committee members to if you have any questions to definitely feel free to share them. I just wanted to give one sort of public service state statement here to the members of the committee. If you are speaking, if you could, please turn on your video just so that we can comply with the open meeting laws, we're trying our best we can to work in the virtual environment, but it's a requirement and important for everyone to be able to show their lovely faces here. So if you could please do. That would be great with that. Were there any other questions from members of the committee for miss macy, I'm sending my email now and miss church has it. So I think I heard somebody has a question miss macy, so I think one I'm gonna ask mr varela to ask his question in just a second, but for anyone else, who's. Not on mute if you could go on mute. That would be great because I think we have some background noise whenever you're ready, mr varela can hear me. Yes, we can yeah. Okay, great sorry, I'm having a lot of connection issues here. Thank you. Miss macy for your presentation and first talk about my condolences for all the for all the laws you mentioned earlier. I I had a question just in general, if you're noticing any trends in evictions, if anybody's reporting more evictions, very good question too, it's a lot going on. Thankfully we are really supporting our seniors and, as of today, that's one of the questions we're asking to there is no one getting evicted and nobody's in that nobody had to withhold their rent for the pandemic. Thank you. Were there any other questions from the members of the committee? Okay, I think I'm not hearing any more questions from the committee any of our members of the public who come. I don't know if it looks like we have a notice in the chat now that we're open for public comment. If you can raise your hand, if you have a question, we'll be happy to ask miss macy, no, I just want to thank you for having me. I know I have another meeting, actually carl and ben my hands to change my meeting to later, so I'm happy to be here and in the world of zoom and video, it's more it's difficult more than I'm like doing two things and I'm still in the office, so I have to join another meeting. So thank you for having me. I just sent my email and oh, I put it to fort greene comes, let's put my personal email. So if anyone has any other questions, you can email me. I will reply to you and if anyone has any backup when you sleep and wake up about the laptops or anything just shoot me an email I'll be happy about that. Wonderful. Thank you. So much for your presentation really happy to have you. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Welcome excellent moving along to the next step on our agenda tonight. We are due to have a presentation from christina reintom on behalf of Brooklyn community services. Do we have christina here? Okay, I'm not I'm not hearing or we're seeing chris christina here I there is a participant named christina on the call and, I believe, she's muted, christina. Would you like to speak? I'm cristina cordero, not ryan, hart, oh okay! Well, we're happy to have you all the same. Thank you for coming we'll be happy to get to you at the point where you, where you speak thanks for joining okay, miss church, perhaps you could see if we can make contact with miss with miss rhine tom. Is that possible? I don't have any other contact information beyond them an email, so I do not know if they're on, I doubt it well, they don't seem to be in the room, so I think we should probably move ahead to the next point in the agenda, which is a discussion of our district needs statement and budget priorities. I think it's great that we've gotten to this point here, because the district needs is really coming up in the in what is it october, we're doing district needs and it's going to be pretty important, particularly in line of presentations that we've heard in the last meetings, whether it be the maternal mortality, whether it be the presentation that we heard about the Brooklyn plaza in the last meeting and then today from the senior council there's a lot of stuff. That's going on in our community that we can. We can speak about and work on with our district needs statement and I think it'll be great to have everybody's input on that. Did everybody get a chance to see the spreadsheet that we circulated around and the draft- and I think alejandro added some comments to it? I don't know it's kind of hard to take a poll on the on the webex call, but I thought there were some interesting points in there about like mental health and NYCHA andro. Do you want to maybe mention a few things about that? So we can sort of get. The discussion kicked off sure I'll make it quick and hold on I'm just I've just pulled it up. So I just put some items that you know came up in in a cb2 email about a meeting that was had last week around what cb2 can do to to do something about the social and racial inequities that have been brought to light or that have gotten attention recently and is there something more that cb2 can do? And so I mean, if we're up to me. We just focus on reparations. That's another conversation, so I what I mentioned was that we had you know, there's a lot there's a strong effect from you know, sort of a lifetime of racism and discrimination and people are walking around with that trauma, and so I think, there's stuff that can be done from a health perspective around mental health and providing access to more care in our community. I suggested mobile health clinics because they have a long history, and so we could have more mobile health clinics that provide counseling and care for trauma and stress, and I put it both ways, not just for people who are survivors and dealing with discrimination, but also for people who are perpetrators of racism and discrimination to prevent the sort of dangerous situations that are happening all the time so to combat sort of ignorance and insecurities. So that was one thing: mobile health clinic. The other thing that I put out there was local hiring. I mean I didn't know how to frame this in a way that would be an actionable item. But I bring this up pretty regularly. There's need and there are opportunities and they're not meeting up in cv2. You know in this committee alone with liquor licenses, we see hundreds of jobs every year, but and we're always encouraging people to hire locally specifically to hire black and brown people. And then I go to these bars and restaurants throughout the year, and I don't see any black or brown people working there or even eating there to be to be honest, and so what can we do? I'm not going. I don't know what happens in the interim between the time that all of these business owners say yes, alejandro. Yes, we're going to do it. Yes, we're going to hire locally and we give them contact information to fort greene snap to the comm, the ingersoll community center to post to the Brooklyn navy yard. But then something isn't happening. So I think we're well positioned because we know so much about what's happening in cb2 and we have interaction both with the people who need jobs and the people who are providing jobs. Why can't we do more to make those connections happen? And I think I don't know what that would look like, and I put an example there, so that was the other and then the article that came up through vice that carol, the calallen sent around evictions and how we're finding that it's disproportionately landlords are evicting black women as just as compared to white women, and so what can we do from a cd2 position to monitor evictions in our district? How are they happening? Who are they happening to anyway? So that was those were the items that I put up there. Thank you for that. No, I think that those are all really interesting items I mean each one of them is an issue that we can, that really thoroughly could be unpacked and really needs a significant amount of attention and investment. I think from the conversation that we had a couple, I think it was about two weeks ago. There was definitely, I think the conversation was very much at a high level and wasn't really as focused on district needs, as it was on really everyone's thoughts and reaction to the events of the last few months and how it's impacted them and we didn't really get down to the nitty-gritty of you know of penciling out one or two or three district needs. But I think that this is what you've been able to come up with. Here is a step in the right direction on some of these items, and hopefully there's a way we can craft this in this into some additional. Some additional needs, the things that I think about are I mean certainly there's issues of equity, and I think the NYCHA survey that you suggested was an interesting idea, I'm just speaking to samantha johnson today about something else, and she mentioned that they have this. They have this scaffolding up in the in the night, in the NYCHA development, for that she lives in, for that has not been taken down for something like 10 years, which is would which is somewhat of a of a concern, because it not only causes confusion for people trying to visit the developments, but it disturbs the quality of life of the people who are at the developments, and I thought that was an interesting comment and possibly something that we could fashion into an additional need. I'm really curious and interested to get more of a voice from the NYCHA community into the into the statement of district needs, so that we can try to see ways we can. We can take something either into a budget item or a expense and try to make life in the NYCHA developments more equitable, more healthy and also more beautiful, along with the rest of our community with appropriate, upkeep and facilities. I think also, the Covid-19 pandemic has produced a situation where we saw with the Brooklyn plaza. They clearly did not have sufficient resources when they first got hit with the pandemic, to treat people for or for common symptoms, to be apprised of the right medical next steps to be given the right equipment, and I think somewhere on our needs. There has to be sort of comprehensive distribution and and facilitation of the personal protective equipment getting out to both hospitals, medical providers, as well as places where there are large concentrations of people like NYCHA developments, so that people have the opportunity to use them, and I'm continuously troubled by the number of people who just flagrantly don't wear, masks, left and right throughout our community in multiple different settings and the it I mean, it's always a struggle to balance the people's individual rights to do what they want with the public health effects that come out of not wearing masks. But it's particularly noticeable to me that you know we have all of these businesses that are serving alcohol on the sidewalk or serving food on the sidewalk. Even and every time I go by these places in our community. There are very few people at the tables wearing a mask and I I'm concerned about the health aspects that come out of that. I don't know I've done a fair amount of talking. Does anybody else have any strong thoughts on some of these things, just one more thing that I'm not exactly sure how it should show up, but I know I always talk about green infrastructure and can seem a little bit intangible or maybe not always timely, but particularly with the development that we still struggle to have a voice in controlling, and while we have other committees that are thinking about how we address things like ami calculations and the lack of affordable housing in the district, I worry a lot about air quality and street safety. I know that's a little bit of our overlap with the transportation committee, but particularly like around, like atlantic avenue and around like 85, where 80 flatbush will be like all of this congestion will really continue to compromise air quality. That is not just about new people moving into this district, but long-time residents in this district and well again, I don't really know what form that takes, but I do think that air quality and other sort of lack of green infrastructure issues that have persisted kind of contribute to this inequitable. I don't know infrastructure of the district, so I'm going to keep thinking on what that actually starts to look like, and I don't know that I think we should recommend things like testing explicitly. I don't know that we could really have that power. That's really a question, but I do think that some of these the effects of this out of control development are felt disproportionately by the same parts of our district, where there's also a lot of long-term unemployment, and it's just sort of a compounding issue. Yeah. I think that I think that's a really salient point, and certainly the extent of development that we have there has to be a consideration of the environmental impact of it. Do we does anybody else want to weigh in with anything on their on their mind? Not I think I heard somebody somewhere. I yeah, I just wasn't sure if it's still community time. Oh yes, no, just like anything just like anything else, emily. I appreciate you getting involved, but I'll give you a chance. I will I will I will I will. I will- and I think it's great- that you're that you're that you're wanting to ask a question or be involved now I'd love to get your input as a member of the community too. So I got a note that mr newmark has a question. Mr newmark, the floor is yours. Thank you, brandon. I wanted to. First of all, I wanted to say I agree with everything alejandro raised as usual. I usually agree with him. I think those are all very important for us to consider and try to develop into needs statements and hopefully related budgetary requests, and I think jessica's thinking is really big picture in terms of that as a problem, and I think I think we will need to think that through some more to see if it's possible to turn it into anything, that's actionable in any way, but I think you know it's a very key point. When you look at the child asthma rates in our in our district compared to other parts of the city, it's really horrendous, that kids are suffering and families are suffering the way they are, and that leads me to something I wanted to say, which is not really a specific need statement at this point, because I think we really covered a lot of good ground last year, also in the major needs that are there, I don't think one has to rewrite something: that's good and that's accurate and that's true. But what I wanted to point out is that we are a very diverse community district, which probably everybody here knows, and I'm saying what everybody already understands. But I don't know how needs are thought about on the city hall level if they look at community district wide. We look like a wealthy community district based on the last numbers that are on the front page of our community district community district community board statement. 61 of us have a bachelor's degree, or more only 31 percent spend 35 or more on rent, only 31, that's much lower than the rest of Brooklyn and new york city. 99 of us are supposedly near parks within acceptable walking distance, which is way above what the city's target is. 11 are at the poverty level or below compared to 21 for Brooklyn and 20 for new york city. So my point, I guess, is that what the people who are going to make the decisions about spending money and focusing on issues need to understand is that we're a district that have pockets of tremendous need and tremendously long histories of having been ignored? Now I guess that fits right into what you were talking about earlier in terms of inequity, and I guess I'm just trying to illustrate that a little bit with numbers that we can't talk. District-Wide Brooklyn heights, where I live dumbo heights were I'm. I guess I actually live in dumbo cobble hill carroll gardens park slo. You know well not park slow, but you know what before my neighbor's need is very different and at a different level than what many components of the district need, and I think that has to be repeated frequently so that the powers that be who are going to really make the decisions about spending money understand what it is that we're asking for, because if you ask for something- and they just look at these broad numbers, they think they're nuts. So that's my statement for now. That's right, that's the point alejandro! You had something you wanted to add yeah. Sorry, I don't want to dominate too much. Thank you. Barry mutual admiration society for sure I completely agree with everything you said and I would like to say that part of the problem is how the data that we're getting that community survey, which you know it really murkies up the waters here. Exactly for the reasons you said, but then you look at census tract data and we have two of the poorest census tracts in new york city right, and so we need to push for the data to get more specific to get grainier. It would be right so that I think that's really essential that we push on that level to get that data and it's there. They just need to be teased out and presented to us in a way because the community surveys- really just it, pulls everything too much together. You know just going back to the nitro conversation before and I don't want to make this all about NYCHA, but at the best of times, when we're at 3.5 percent unemployment and everyone's excited and saying new york city and the country is great, which is a 22 percent unemployment right. So it seems that there's an extent there's an acceptable level of misery, always that we don't make a big deal about, and we and right now during the pandemic. I can't imagine it's probably nearer to 40 or 50 right, and so we need to get that information and that needs to be front and center, because when you say 22 to ignore that is criminal right. We're already saying we're: okay with three to four percent right as a society, but when you say 22 and we're ignoring it, that's it's pretty bad yeah! Absolutely! You think that maybe there's a district needed in and of itself to sort of reform the community survey process and focus it more on identifying pockets of need within each community rather than just making blanket statements about the community as a as a as a big picture. Okay, I got your support on that. That's good carol, ann! Is that without within the bounds of something that we could put down as a district need. Okay, I think you're on mute carol, anne caroline you have to unmute after they made that very eloquent speech. Yes, I was saying in terms of us pulling out the data of the census tracts yeah. We can do that and focus a lot of our statement on that. I don't know that we can actually impact the american community survey, but the community health profile also actually gives a little more detail. I think, than the broad census data for our district, the one that new york city does every year, and so that's something we can use as well as most of most of the city's data is accessible online. So, if we have, you know a lot of data people, that's something we can actually get into and tease out the data that we're looking for. Okay. I think that I mean, I think, we'd be very interested in that I had in my mind you know: should we be asking the city to focus their city-wide survey on something that's more focused on the more needed areas of our community, rather than like the you know, the community district as a whole. I mean it or is that to wonky of a of a of a district need? No, it isn't, but again the community on the health, the community health profile, sort of pulls a little bit of that out. It will compare like Brooklyn heights with you know for green or a little smaller, so some of that data is actually somewhat available yeah. I think I got it, but I think what I'm hearing at least barry and alejandro, is that we need to have a little bit more geared towards the those specific aspects of the community district, because you know in several in some parts of the district, things are going fine and it's not worth really. I mean it's good to know that we have that we have that in our community and those of us who are lucky to live in that circumstance or are, can be gratified with that, but really like the focus, the focus, and maybe even most of the report should be on areas where improvement can be made. But if you can make a request that they do something for us, yeah. Okay, I feel like there needs to be more. I think there needs to be more education on kova 19, put out to by the city department of health. I'm actually not particularly aware of the extent of work that they've done. I I've tried looking at their website and they've. They seem to have information there about, like you, know common sense things to do and things to know about like the childhood kawasaki syndrome and such like that. But I'm really not aware of any major initiatives, and it just makes me feel like in the world that I see with the kova 19, where you know 50 people are not wearing masks. When I go on the street, sometimes that you know there needs to be more education, provided particularly to like small business owners in the in the city, and you know, we've had a very kind of interesting couple of months with all kinds of things going on, and I know even here locally, there have been a few bars and restaurants who've had their liquor licenses taken away because they're serving people without wearing without wearing masks on the inside, and I just feel like that could be that there's more education, that's needed, you know, and it's not like mandating people to wear the masks or but really making sure people understand the importance of it and the risks. That's my point at least, and then what is our next step with this? Can you just remind me, maybe others, so I think we need to sort of catalog out what we feel are our sort of new critical needs and we should probably have a review of the existing needs that have been in place from years past. I know that some of these things have come up and have been retired and or fulfilled, and others may still persist carol ann. What do you? Where do you think we can find the most recent catalog of what we've done in years past? I can. I can find a link. It's on the city planning website. I can send a link with the last two statements. Okay, is that what you mean yeah absolutely and I think, like what would be a really good takeaway is, if each of us can think about the things that we talked about here. You know alejandro has done his part. With his thing, I I'm going to put something on the there about the Covid-19 19. jessica. Maybe you can throw something on there about the environmental issue. We have us that this commonly shared spreadsheet, where we can log on these items, and I think we need to record what we feel are important priorities and then we'll have to have an opportunity to make comments about anything that is currently pending. Do we have time to come back on this in september caroline or do we need to make our comments and offline september? We have enough time to come in september, but we need to be looking towards making some definitive decisions, because the statement is due the end of october. So in october we need to be able to vote on the things that we've decided, as well as the priority listed, and one more thing is that we need to think. While we consider all these ideas, what is now our health priority? What do we see as the overarching health priority for the district? So right I mean, is it that we can? We can cite, but you know it, we've got Covid-19 19 and I'm wondering like what role that should play in that. I can't see if anyone has a question. I don't know if alejandro you had a question, I do I just yeah. Sorry, I just want to say a couple things real, quick one is that it will. One of will someone come back to us, maybe carol, anne after you've seen the spreadsheet if it doesn't fit the parameters of how the information or the points need to be put into the document. Will you come back for clarification or let us know if you need any tidying up number two. I tried just now to add a quick summary of that of what we talked about along the collecting data, more sort of a smaller geographical unit, but I don't I didn't wasn't didn't do well with the parameters. So, if anyone wants to add like which agency that would be, and specifically where and then lastly, I just want to as a reminder I kind of have to jump off because I have another meeting to go to. I can stay on a bit longer because I realize we didn't really get through this part and I might end up breaking quorum right. If I leave because I'm the fifth person- oh no, I don't believe you are we've been joined by miss cobb, who I believe is: oh, okay, great, the fifth person. So I thank you. I think you're okay, although we'd love to have you for as much time as you want to give us and also I just want to say to nicole mcknight welcome aboard. I know this is sort of an unorthodox way to join the committee and I'm thinking back to when I started like 11 years ago, and I didn't know when and where to jump in, because it was all moving very quickly and fast and there's a lot of sort of historical stuff. But I want you to know if you feel free to just jump in and ask questions if this is all moving too quickly and we'll stop to explain or anything I don't assume where you're coming from and with this particular conversation or with your history with cb2 so alejandra. I appreciate that, thank you and I'm just taking it all in and the the thought that came to mind when you were mentioning about the health disparities. I was thinking about the issue of getting access and ensuring that people actually have health insurance, but once they have it getting the having the access because mental health services, it has been an issue in communities for black and brown people, because we really don't have access to it. So those are the thoughts that came to mind as you were speaking. Thank you for sharing that nicole. I think that we definitely that's, definitely something that we're going to need to capture in the in the spreadsheet and in our district needs, because it's clearly one of our top priorities and it's one of our top priorities year in year out some of these things like mental health services and child asthma. I know are things that we have been talking about year upon year, trying to find ways to improve, and I think, healthcare access and if you have ideas for for concrete things, that the city can do in the form of services or in the form of capital expenditures. I think, like alejandro, has a great idea about these about mental health funds going out in the community it'll be a capital expenditure because you're you got a city would have to set aside resources and purchase a a vehicle. I guess to do that then log these on the spreadsheet. I hope you have access to this, that we shared via email, I'll, try and make sure everybody has a renewed link to that afterwards and we can have some input. Did any other members of the committee have any more points regarding district needs, not hearing anything else from the from the committee like with anything else, I'm gonna ask the community. If you have any other points that you'd like to make that are just very strong needs. You can use the raise hand feature, so I'm not seeing any raised hands he's the future peter smith, I see emily on ado and latrell have their hands raised. Oh wonderful, I don't know why. I can't see that, but thank you for letting me know. Let's see emily, I know you asked you're about to ask that before. Thank you for waiting. Do you have a point you wanted to make yes and I'm getting the hang of this so two things so just on alejandro's point about the mental health services. There's. Actually I don't know the exact details. I can connect him with for green park because, through the fort greene park, conservancy they've actually recently received grant money specifically around mental health, and so it just seems like as much as possible within some of the neighborhoods, where there's work going on, there can obviously be some kind of joining of the effort, so alejandro not sure if you're aware of that, but this is very recent work that was being done that I heard about through rosemont lecture. So I can get more details about that and connect through the official community board email address again. I just think it's worth time in conversation, but specifically just around the issues of mental health and then to barry's point about the data on the total data nerd, and so one of the things that strikes me because I was looking at the same thing. You were the chart that showed where it looks like we're doing a lot better than the actual. If you're in the neighborhoods, you experience and feel, and one of the things is that obviously they're reporting the data as means and means always erase kind of doubt like the edges of the data, and so I think one thing that would be an interesting point to start is just to even get the actual range of the data so that you are seeing the lows and the highs, because I think, particularly when I think about full green. The highs have gotten so high that it has thrown the average off considerably so that I think there is this obviously getting more granular data as alejandro is speaking to, but I think just even as a start, if there's some effort around getting the actual range of data, I think that's a great point and just for the sake of time I want to also take latrell's question. Matrell, I'm sorry we didn't get to you and but I'm happy to have you here feel free to introduce yourself too I'm a trauma, I'm a community board member. I have two points when you talk about Brooklyn heights. Farragut project is considered in that umbrella of Brooklyn heights. So when you look at the big picture, you may see like dumbo Brooklyn heights and you they may miss out on farragut and farragut housing. Development is a need. That's my first point and also with the recent virus. I believe the disability community population is going to increase, is gonna, so we need to be prepared to have a larger number of people with disabilities is shown because a lot of there's a lot of underlying. I want health concerns with people and going forward. More things are going to come out with people with disabilities commit community and it's going to be a higher number. So I think that's another important area to look into. Thank you for that. We will not forget about farragut, we'll make sure that we address that and if you have any specifics on the on the issues with farragut feel free to share them with me and or any of the other folks from the committee, but feel free to. I I'll drop you in my email short afterwards and I'll be happy to try to facilitate getting some of that information into our into our district needs statement. I think that, and certainly the disability issues are very much at the forefront for us. I want to make sure that if there are any specifics- and we should- we should think about this in our in our approach- any specifics for increasing access for areas for folks with disabilities, any different kinds of disabilities that might exist whatever it may be- physical or mental. Or what have you we should try to find a way to put something about that in the industry need state? Okay, I don't. First of all, I can't tell when people are raising their hand, so I'm going to assume that nobody else is. Oh, I think I have one more thing from barry very I'll. Give you one more question, but this will be the last one, because I'm going to move the program along a little bit yeah, I wasn't sure where this would really fit, but it I just was reminded filling out. The census is very important and we need to have a concerted effort, which I haven't really seen. That's Brooklyn wide about or filling out the census and Brooklyn is very far behind, so that effect for many years to come on those components of the community that are in the most need for the kind of response that the census could potentially offer if the numbers are accurate. So somehow we need to do a better job of helping people know how important the census is in helping them to answer it. Thank you, barry and anybody else have any other thoughts on district needs. Before we move on all right. Moving on to the next part of our agenda, we've got our liquor license review for the month. We have three liquor licenses up today. There are, they are all full on premise: liquor licenses, the first one is 264, carlton avenue lost dose hermanos. Do we have someone here from that location? Yes, good evening? Everybody, my name is anthony caraballo and I represent the 266 carlton, that's the actual address and the name of the entity is los dos hermanos and I'm joined by the applicant's son oscar rodriguez, who will be managing the premises. The applicant is rosie rodriguez, who owns the building and also owns the adjacent liquor store. Okay, thanks for joining now, I believe that we've gotten a copy of the of the application- and I just want to check with the members of the committee- has everyone on the committee gotten a copy of the application. Okay, all right, I'm just going to quickly share the application round. Okay, I think I got it to everybody who's here. Okay, I hope everybody on the committee has gotten a copy of the application. I did just forward it to you, brandon you're, saying it's in everyone's email right, yep, okay should be, and I think we've been joined by mr excuse me. Excuse me brandon. Yes, we can actually share the application itself on screen. Okay, sorry about that anthony. Are you ready to do it or should I think you should do it? Caroline? I was trying to do it earlier and I was having some difficulties so if you could, because you're not you're not enabled, if you're able to do it, that'd probably be the better way we have. We are enabling for all of the presenters, we're enabling you as your point of presentation. So that's why mr caravallo you've been given presenter privileges. So if you'd like you, can just go ahead and choose share screen from the upper left yeah, so I'm on this and I'm on the share content and I have a file, but I don't know how to get it to you guys. If you go to the upper left inside of webex and click on, share and choose share content, then choose then choose the window that has the content open. Okay, I don't know if that worked. Did that work we didn't tyler. Are you or caroline could go ahead and share it like on the community board, account yep carolyn? Do you have it open? I don't have a copy yeah. I have it. Okay, I'm making you the presenter. Then you need to I'm sorry I can't see, which is I see it? Okay, that's great! We can see it! Thank you. What's on yep, okay, mr carabao, you can go ahead with your presentation, essentially an application for an on-premises liquor license again. The address is 266 carlton avenue, that's carlton and dekalb. The other cross street is willoughby. The owner is rosie rodriguez. She owns the adjacent liquor store, as I indicated earlier, she's owned this building for over three decades, she's entrenched in the community. This is the old space that was a smooch cafe. They were there since 2005 more or less. They recently closed down. It's a relatively small premises. There's a seating for 20 inside six tables, with 14 seats, a small bar with another six and then there's an outside area that smooch also utilized in their years there, and it's actually part of the building property. The building envelope. So a DCA sidewalk cafe permit is not required in this instance and out there. The proposed seating is five tables with 10 seats. The hours of operation are from noon to midnight seven days, so the establishment will be closing relatively early. The applicants have no interest in having a late-night bar, they own the building they own the liquor store. Additionally, the menu will be comprised of tapas salads and tacos, and they'll basically employ upwards to five people. Oscar can confirm this in that area and we would address any questions that the committee might have. There's. Also four letters of support to my understanding that was sent in for this application. Thank you, mr caraballo. I appreciate the presentation. The elements background that you've given I understand and we received a rather sizable number of letters regarding this particular application. We did receive some letters of support, but they seem to have been outnumbered by a fairly sizable number of letters expressing opposition to the to the liquor license. And I I'm not gonna, go into the deep specifics of any of the letters. But I think, aside from the concern about the noise that would be generated by any outdoor cafe in a residential neighborhood, which is something that I feel is fairly a common concern that we express there were some concerns expressed in the letters about the liquor store that the applicant currently operates and specifically sort of indicating that the applicant was serving or providing an opportunity to have, as it was alleged kind of an illegal sidewalk. Cafe. Where the where folks, who had purchased liquor at the liquor store, would then go out and drink. The liquor on the street. And I guess there have been some concerns in this community about the level of noise that was generated from these experiences. And I think there were even some photos that were shared with us with expressing concerns about the amount of noise, as well as the fact that some of the staff members at this liquor store were not wearing masks or complying with the Covid-19 19 health directives. So I think the I may not have fully encapsulated all the concerns that were expressed in the letters, but I think that was definitely many of them and I would want to ask the question first, like with any an application like this. What is the degree of involvement and outreach that has taken place to date with the block association, the folks in the local community? Do we have signa signatures that are part of this application? What's the relationship with the upstairs and surrounding neighbors and is there? Is there really a feeling that the folks who are around this area are supportive and if not, what does the applicant plan to do to address any concerns? Great brandon? So, firstly, I had a meeting with miss rodriguez and her son oscar actually today in preparation of tonight's meeting, and I had discussed these issues prior with the community board and outside of the liquor store. There is a table to my understanding and some chairs and then the adjacent commercial property there's two benches, so the students of my clients, information provided to me. Basically, this was is for members of the building like for personal use, and this is for their use. So when I indicated to them that there was an issue with this, these were immediately removed. So there's no longer any seating in front of the liquor store, which again, I believe was, I believe, upon. Information and belief was one table with two chairs, and then there were the two benches on the adjacent storefront which is vacant at this time. So I would that will cease immediately in terms of having any seating out there. I believe maybe there's the people tenants or people in the community might have utilized that seating. It's my belief that the liquor store wasn't promoting this, that they're not promoting people buying liquor in the store and then going right outside and drinking. This certainly is an sla violation. The liquor store has no sla violations, also in terms of the noise that might be generated and we're at the particular premises, because basically the outdoor seating proposes to cease at midnight when the operation closes. There already was outdoor seating at smooch cafe for many years and in terms of music there's background music. Only so it's a small place inside again seating capacity inside is 20 outside is 10 5 tables, five two tops and that will close fairly early and all those complaints. You know we've listened to them that seating was removed immediately. I mean the last thing the applicant you know wants to be. Is a nuisance to the community. She's been there for over three decades, she's entrenched in this community she's a property owner. She owns a liquor store. She certainly doesn't want to be a nuisance. The ante is increased in a sense because they own the property, also they're, not transient tenants, so they do own. The property and they have a vested interest in the community in terms of the outreach. The second component of your question. We provided the four letters of support, but, pursuant to our meeting today, we can certainly get petition signatures for you, and we can certainly additionally reach out to any block associations for additional support. Okay, I'm gonna. Let other members of the committee ask questions as well too. Does any other member of the committee wish to ask a question? Yes, this is jessica. I just wanted to reiterate: I'm not sure I heard an answer to mr smith's question that are there tenants in the building and if so, have they have? You met with them about this application, so oscar I'll defer to you on this. There are tenants in the building oscar. If you want to jump in and answer that question, mr roger guess, you need to unbeat your microphone. Please can you hear me now? Yes, okay, the building is currently six residential apartment, buildings and three commercial dwellings, as it turns out due to the pandemic. We have lost three residential tenants who have currently moved out and to commercial tenants. So that is the reason why we are taking the property and trying to do something with it, as opposed to being vacant. To be clear, have you engaged with any of the tenants that live in the building? Still so good? Are there still residential tenants in the building? Yes, have you engaged with them about this application? Yes, and what was their feedback they're? All in support of us? Did you provide signatures to that? I don't think I need them. I needed them at this point yeah. We don't have signatures jessica, but again, as I indicated, we can certainly get a petition and we could certainly provide signatures of support. You know what I would reiterate to the committee is that this premises was already licensed for a decade and a half, so we're not adding another license to the community and again they're the and it's a fairly small establishment and the applicant owns the building. So the last thing the applicant would want to do is operate a premises that would be a nuisance to the place where they own and also have another liquor license in the liquor store. Also excuse me to the members of the committee. The district office suspended the collection of signatures at this time. Applicants are welcome to provide them, but we're not asking for that. Thank you carol. Those are the pandemic. No, we have, I don't mean to interrupt jessica. First, you're still I'll go ahead. Okay, I have a couple of questions. Brandon. Would that be? Okay? Sure? Okay, thank you. I guess I'm going to address it to mr rodriguez, but I'm sure mr caraballo will step in as you see fit. My first question is liquor, store proprietors on staff, had no knowledge of people buying, liquor and sitting outside their store and drinking it oscar. I think that question is directed to you. Obviously, our customers come into the store and purchase the lecture once they leave. We have no control of what the community does outside the public room. That's not what I asked you, sir, please what I asked you is that you have knowledge of customers sitting outside the liquor, store and opening up the purchases and drinking from them. That's what I asked you yes or no well from our establishment or across the street, because we have overflow from this otters that actually comes over and sits down on the benches. Okay, so you're not going to answer that question. I hope that's noted to participants. My next question is: would you consider closing the establishment sunday through thursday evenings earlier than midnight, since there are families with children who need to go to sleep at a reasonable hour and a lot of the neighbors face directly onto the property that you are seeking to get a look at the license for so barry, I'm going to jump into that good evening. Barry. How are you, how are you doing well? Thank you, sir. So I think the midnight is a fair closing time. I mean, as you guys know, generally, you know bars and nightclubs and establishments of that nature stay open significantly later. I know you guys as of last year or so are really our new establishments want. A 2 am closing and we're not even anywhere near that I mean we're at midnight and I would bear in mind that the premises is small also. So I think our midnight is extremely fair. That's what the answer is. No the answer's not no barry the answer's, not no! This is a give and take we want to work with you guys. You know, I just think if we could pull what would your compromise be? If you want to work with us, mr caraballo, the compromise would be we'd, certainly be willing to close the outside seating area. Earlier than indicated, that was a concern of the community, so we would close. We would be willing to close that area at 10., so we discussed that today and rosie and oscar were certainly open to that. They had no issue with closing that at 10 o'clock. Okay, I'm not sure if I think that's adequate, but I appreciate I appreciate the movement in that direction. Thank you, okay, for other members of the committee. Are there any other questions from? Mr caravallo or mr rodriguez, mr chair, I have a observation. Mr harrison. The floor is yours. Thank you, sir. So I actually I have to apologize to the committee. I actually love to get to the meeting on time and the trains weren't exactly with me, but I experienced a lot of difficulty. I guess I'm just not as tech savvy in just even though I pre-registered in getting this going. So I and I got renwick my partner to help me sign on today, but I did read the material that carol ann sent in advance and thank you for sending it carol ann. I did note between the lines so to speak, of the numerous I'll, just call them complaints. That may not be a fair assessment of the group, but of the issues raised in the letters received by the board office. Not in support of this application. There seemed to be an underlining theme about how it's a family neighborhood and we don't want a lot of noise, and this happened with people not wearing masks was one issue another one sitting outside and consuming liquor that came from the liquor store. Well, we've sort of discussed those questions, but what I found amazing in his response to either his presentation or response to some of our colleagues. Mr carabello raised certain points about the history of closing times that have been allowed by this committee. There is also the fact that he mentioned that there was a history of there having been an establishment at this address, and then there is the fact that for some time, right against the or adjacent to this address on decal from vanderbilt to- I guess, carlton, perhaps a little further. Now there has been at least more than one chair of the board has said. Well, it's kind of a commercial strip where we have a lot of establishments and we have. We have allowed numerous of them whether they were restaurants, whether they were bars that serve food, whether there was something else that license to take hold and flourish there, because it's seen as a kind of a nightlife destination zone, and so at times in the past, this committee, or its individual members or more than one member, had been discouraged from being too hard or too harsh. And those of you have been on the committee jump right in and say when I'm misstating the facts. A lot of what was raised that I saw in those letters were presumptions of what might happen if this establishment were allowed to operate the way it was asking to do and in the past again, this committee has sort of taken a position more than not not always, but often we cannot. We can't predict what's going to happen in the future, and we can't, if you will, blackball or or encourage the executive, a letter of no support, because what is perceived to perhaps future then again, there there's the interesting of the fact that one of the plaintiffs or one of the people that sent in a letter of not a letter of complaint, a letter of issue or letter of no confidence against this against this entity's application was someone who was a mover and shaker in the neighborhood was very big at developing parts of the neighborhood, and some people have seen that development as as as a good thing, but in all instances it has, I think, brought traffic and brought life and business is promoted, businesses and yet with when this establishment, that's just trying to take hold, is in that individual's backyard. He's not very much for it so interesting perspective. In that regard, thank you for letting me okay, brandon you're. Welcome any other questions from members of the committee for mr caraballo or mr rodriquez not hearing any any questions from members of the public on this application. Yes, how many about how many questions do we have? I am I able to make a statement, or is it only questions? This would be if the only thing that you I would just ask for anybody making a statement or a question just try to keep it somewhat brief answer in the hour and and direct your comments to the chair and to the committee, just because the based upon how we do this when we're in person, we normally ask folks in the community to do that. So I guess a couple of questions then statement. So I would challenge the idea that the owners not aware of the amount of drinking that goes on premises because their employees engage in it they're, given cups that come from inside that establishment. So I would challenge that information is just being patently false. I would also ask the question of I hear that rosie's name is being used a lot, but I would ask how much she is actually going to be involved in the business. I would also ask that, for this supposedly being a community that cares about others, I would ask why those tenants are not there and I would not leave it to just understanding that, oh code, I would ask what the relationship was with the landlords and it's very pro-business, but I would ask the committee to push on these issues and to push on the idea that the people who own the liquor store are not aware. I live around the corner, I have engaged in the behavior there I have been given cups. I have been given alcohol to drink outside, so I just again, I want to push and say that it is patently false if anyone who runs that establishment is claiming that they are unaware. Thank you. I just want to also see if there are any other members of the community who have a question for regarding this application as well too I'll give the applicant opportunity to respond. Ms cordero, thank you for waiting, and did you have a point you'd like to make yeah? Thank you for having me. I just want to make a point. I live right across from the address, and I was here when switch was here. I had a lot of problems laundering littering noise. They would blast music late at night and I'm concerned that this is it's a bar, that's being requested to have a license in a residential neighborhood and I think 12 o'clock is too late. I mean people have to work, people have to go to school and you know again the noise. So my main, I have a big concern that, with the problem with solution, there was no liquor what the issues are going to be when there is liquor and what was happening on the corner. Thank you very much have a good evening. Thank you. Miss cordero was there anyone else in the community who had a question one once going twice: okay, I'm not going to get into a back and forth between anyone and it's hard to do that in the webex world anyway, but mr rodriquez and mr caraballo, I just want to give you an opportunity to respond to the comments and questions that were raised by the members of the community. Sure thank you brandon. So I think the issues pertaining to the liquor store are extraneous to the application we have before you today in the absence of substantial sla violations, which aren't there we're aware of what's been stated tonight, but we're before you for an application for a license at 266 carlton, I think the application is fair. I think a midnight closing is very fair, as the industry goes right now that proves they're, not a raucous bar. They don't want to be open until late night. They only have background music. We've agreed, as I indicated, to barry that we would close the outside seating. Even earlier, we've agreed to an earlier closing time, so we're willing to work with the community. I think there was a license there at this premises already and I think again the nature of the establishment. That's small, closing at midnight, the outside seating, closing at 10. I don't know how it can be portrayed as a bar that will disrupt the area. Quite frankly, that would be my retort to some of the questions and issues that came up. Okay, I think just to kind of leverage. One of those points a little bit too, mr rodriguez, you wanted to make a point also. I wanted to comment occasionally just about almost every single weekend. We do have tastings and we do have people vendors from sla, they're aware they have permitting to actually do tastings. They provide cups and people do drink wine outside absolutely, but that's strictly. They have permits to do that through sla. It's got nothing to do with us. As far as the vacant apartments, we do have vacant apartments and we do have vacant commercial dwellings, but that's all due to non-payment, I'm down over 50 000 in back rent, which I will never receive and to barry's point absolutely. We are willing to compromise when it comes to. As far as the hours are concerned during the week, we don't have an issue with that, and I believe that was christine. That mentioned that from like maybe sunday to thursday. That's we would be more than willing to compromise with that. Absolutely okay, I think really both to mr carabello and to mr rodriquez. I just wanted to follow up on one of the community members questions. How much will there be on-premise management and oversight of both the indoor and outdoor, really the outdoor area surrounding both the liquor store and the this restaurant? I was a little troubled that I didn't really get the feeling of a sense of responsibility for the for the outdoors, and I don't think anybody is going to say that as a property owner as a as a as the owner of a store or a business, that you know that the that you're responsible for everything that goes on outside your business- but I just do want to get a better sense as to the feeling about one. How much is how often is there going to be on-premise supervision of the outdoor area to make sure things don't get out of hand with customers being loud, or this is a very residential neighborhood and the only way that this works in residential neighborhoods from our experience is if there is really strong supervision- and I think also there was a the question would naturally be raised. I guess what will be done in the event that there's too much noise and or there's excessive concerns being raised by the community oftentimes. We have these discussions after the applicant has already met with the block association, but- and I understand we're in Covid-19 time so things are somewhat challenging, but it's sort of difficult to to get an understanding about. What's going to happen in that regard, you know with the with the concerns that have been expressed well to your first topic on the supervision my mother and I have currently moved into the building, because there was several four big four vacant apartments, so there'll be 100 supervision at all times. Here all right, I don't think that'll be an issue, and I think that we address the issue with the outside noise and the seating there'll be no more outside seating on the liquor store. So that's going to be completely well, it's already eliminated. So I don't think that'll be an ongoing issue from this point on okay, and I also just want to ask regarding the allegations that the that folks, who were employed at the liquor store not wearing masks. Will there be an emphasis on wearing masks and will mass be required for employees and to what extent is that going to be part of the experience of this restaurant as we're in the state that we're in now absolutely obviously, things have been more heightened than they were in the past, and we've been addressed already with that. My brother and I and my mother have all addressed that it's all been taken care of. Obviously, this business probably won't be opened up until the next four to six months. So then we'll address that with the time being, okay- and I just want to get a sense as to the hours that you're okay with, I think there was a discussion about sunday to thursday and closing early on those hours. I and I think we discussed like 10 p.m, but is that indoor and outdoor is that just outdoor that you're willing to do that for and what about? On friday and saturday? No, I mean oscar. You want to take that. I will let you address that anthony okay. So again, as I stated earlier, the outdoor seating will certainly close at 10 o'clock, seven days a week and the midnight again not to be repetitive, and I apologize, but the midnight is extremely fair, midnight's, usually to cut off a lot of community boards, and I believe you guys do that as well. Have administrative approval for certain apps if they close at midnight, so midnight's like the threshold that you're really not going to be a raucous bar and you legitimately a restaurant or a cafe. So again we think midnight is fair. I mean if the committee thinks, otherwise we will listen to you right now. If you want to do a poll of committee members, but again, midnight is a fair closing hour and reducing the outdoor seating by two hours. We've already worked with the committee in response to the concerns that the community has okay, would you be willing to do 10 o'clock seven days a week on the outside? You already stated we would yes, we stated that. Okay, that's done. Okay, no issue at all right. We're gonna need to wrap this up because we're nearing the what, when maybe the close of our meeting, because some folks on our committee need to go. So I would just ask if you have, if I can probably take, maybe one more question from the committee. I see mr harrison you're interested in asking a question. If you could just make a brief point, please I just wanted to follow some a question on the applicant's response. What I heard him say is by saying no it's going to be addressed is and anthony or the applicant. I'm sorry whose name I've forgotten just it's a closed end question. So, regarding the issue of mass, they will be warned correct. Yes, thank you brief enough. Okay, great, I asked the members of the committee. Do we have a motion on this application? I I'd like to just ask one more brief question before we vote and then I'll be happy to make a mistake, mr caraballo and mr rodriguez, I appreciate your and your consideration to the community's concerns. Can you assure us that, once hopefully, god willing you're able to open and you're successful, do you agree that if the community has concerns and questions and brings them to your attention, you will be open to discussing the concerns of the community and knowing that will be also put before this committee, I'm sure by your community members? So can you assure me the case, and there will be a good relationship back and forth I'll, be willing to provide everyone? My parents, member email, address anytime and address any issues you may have. Thank you very much. I appreciate that response. Does anyone in the committee wish to make a motion? Yes, mr chairman, I move to approve second, okay, a second for miss thurston discussion on the motion. Yeah. I have a point of discussion. I just want to share that. I think I really appreciate mr rodriguez, that you said you would be amenable to sharing your cell phone number and having that conversation people come to you. I just have to say that when we receive this level of pushback from the community, we're here to listen to that, and I'm really concerned about what I've heard and the lack of ownership over what has happened. So I will be voting all right. Any other discussion of motion more discussion. Okay, so we unfortunately have to go by each person because it's webex miss cobb. How do you vote you're on mute? Ms cobb brandon? Can you hear me? Yes, okay, all right approve. Okay, mr newmark jessica's. I don't know if I'm no jessica's point about the community concern is a great concern for me, as well, obviously, by my questions but john's point about giving people who are offering to be reasonable, a reasonable chance and opportunity to prove their medal resonates to me as well. So I am surprising myself to say that I wanted to thank you from there giving you our recommendation for a local license. Okay, who's! Next, mr thurston. Mr harrison! Yes, I think we have anybody else. No, it's not me. I vote no fail. Excuse me did nicole vote. No, I didn't that was great hello. Mr mcknight, I'm sorry I'm sorry! I vote yes. What's our outcome, for you know, okay, I'm sorry motion is. Thank you all very much for your time. Great. Thank you. So much everybody have a great evening stay safe and develop. Thank you guys. Thank you very much. Next up we have 78 rockwell place project noir. We have someone here from that location. Yes, hey. Can you please I'm mute eleanor mooney hi, I'm also from project noir. My name is right. Do we have a way to present and maybe in the meantime, you can start giving your presentation? Yes, I can actually start that again. My name is sum I am the owner of coffee project new york on 78 rockwell place. This is the original location for a cafe spot and we've been here for about two years now we have multiple locations around the city and this is closer to where we live in, and we met eleanor and chris, like maybe about a year ago, and we have been doing a lot of like community event for coffee community. So our space is vacant at night, so one day when the both of them join us during a community event, they are like this place is beautiful and since we've been offering a spot for the coffee people in the morning and we're feeling like maybe at night, we can open up ourselves also for more, like speak, easy doing a little bit of cocktail using chris, which is our partner's expertise in this beverage field. So therefore we're thinking about, like maybe expanding our hours at night, from five onwards, to just do a little bit of a cocktail liquor bien wine. That is a little bit more easy going, a lounge feeling to it. And then we decided to start this partnership. The rest of the presentation, I'll probably have to pass it to chris and eleanor to tell us a little bit more about like the whole operation, but I'm going to let them continue that we have chris or eleanor. I think they might have some issue with sound just to clarify with you. You've got no outdoor seating. Your hours are from your open hours are from seven a.m to one a.m monday through friday and eight am to one am saturday and sunday, with a close on alcohol service at midnight seven days a week, we do not have any outdoor sitting, but because of Covid-19, the coffee shop actually has approval for open restaurant, and we finish early so right now there is an outdoor space with barricade and build out and depending on when we're getting our liquor license approved. When we start, if there's still a chance, we can utilize this space. If not, then we don't have any sidewalk cafe. Okay, any questions for this application from the members of the committee. Sorry, can you hear us now? Okay, great sorry about that? Oh we have cr. We have must be chris and eleanor. Yes, I've got your you on the line here, but I just want to give the committee a chance to ask any questions off the off the bat in light of the hour. Okay, I would just ask you guys one question which is that here at the health committee, we are very interested in local hiring and we wanted to have you speak briefly about the number of people you want to hire and give our some available options to consider between grasshall community center, fort greene, snap and the Brooklyn navy art, which are great resources in our community? Yes, of course, so we were listening on conversation earlier and what barry and alexander we're talking about, including you know, local residents. Sorry, it's very important for us to hire locally and to have the community be a part of our clientele and we would love to have the resources you have in terms of hiring locals some already hires two locals from the neighborhood out of her 13 staff members currently at coffee project and, of course, for the for the cocktail bar expand upon that and in terms of having we would love resources in terms of reaching out to locals, to be able to find community-based programs that we could get clients in we reached out to. I don't know if you have seen our signatures. Let me fill up our signatures here, so we went out last week and we have local business signatures and then the sorry signatures here, oops the coffee shop also had signatures from local residents and businesses. So we have, you can see here some local businesses who are 78 rockwell. Can you move on for the signatures? Really quick? I just feel like I don't I don't want to. I think we get that you've got the signatures. We appreciate it. It's wonderful! I know it's a difficult time with getting signatures, but if we can, I guess maybe move off of that. Thank you all right, yeah. If we can move along from that would be great. I want to give the chance for the community anybody here to ask questions about 78 rockwell. We have any questions for members of the community. Any questions for members of the community, I'm not hearing any. Are you able to? Are you able to advise or anyone? If there are any questions? Let's see, I don't see anyone, okay, all right! In that case I asked the committee: does anyone wish to make a motion jessica jump the gun there on you barry? So she gets the motion, but I'll give you the second any discussion on the motion? Okay. Well, I I'm gonna say my usual. I should have asked this as a question, but we assume that should any concerns come up from the community while you're in operation, you will be accepted to discuss those concerns and if they seem to have merit resolving them in a way that works as best as it possibly can for you, as well as the people's concerns. Yes, okay, I'm gonna go forward with the vote. Miss cobb, just unmute gonna vote. In the meantime, mr newmark sure I'll vote to approve okay, miss cobb. You are unmuted, so confident we can hear you okay. Yes, I approve okay, miss thurston, hey mr harrison, that's something that people have been trying to do for me for 40 years. Yes, I thought yes here, that's the comment of 2020. you're on mute, miss mcknight. I approve all right and I vote to approve as well too. Thank you very much for your presentation. Thank you so much. Thank you thanks. Everyone. Thank you. All moving right along we've got 154 carlton, avenue, piquin inc, dba taqueria for green. Do you have anyone here from that location, hello, everybody! My name is nicolas I'm owner from target fort greene, hi nicola hello. I'm sorry- and this is my wife louie in case I can explain english, because not first language she's going help me to translate okay. Do you want to give a brief summary of your of your application and in the meantime, maybe we can try to pull up the actual material. Absolutely last december, on 22nd I used to work in for green in 2001. I know very well. The neighborhood I know is oriented up to the family was a attack in lafayette and other fight. Also, I used to have a food truck in 2008 next to madiba, and now I have the opportunity to come back to the neighborhood and open this restaurant, the mexican food, okay, and just looking at your application, it looks like you have no outdoor seating and your location will be open until 2 a.m, thursday to saturday and 11 p.m. Sunday to wednesday, is that correct? Yes, this is more for spring because I know in the winter, in the neighborhood after 10 30 is nobody there. Okay and clarifying you have background music. Only! Yes, only ambience for the inside the restaurant. No, this hey! Okay, have you spoken with any of the residents in the area and what has their response been? Well, I don't have the opportunity to talk with many neighbors, the kobe in my team. What about is next to my restaurant is only one bill. They owns the chinese restaurant and I believe 90 percent of the attendance is the employee for the restaurant, the chinese food, but he did have a signature from someone from he got the signature from the people that live in the neighborhood, not particularly the people that live right next to the restaurant across the street. The person across the street basically signed the petition. We have a petition there that was signed and then the direct tenants, the owner, the landlord who's, the owner of the restaurant of the building he signed he approved of the application and and also in terms of the tenants themselves that live right next to the restaurant. They are the workers from the restaurant, so he never had an opportunity to get their signature, but we got from everyone from that area blocks around there. Now the restaurant is in operation right now. Yes, okay with that and right now do you have beer and wine, or you have no reason right now. Okay, have there been any concerns or expressed by any of the neighbors in the neighborhood about noise or any other issues that are coming from the existing restaurant? No idea any questions from members of the community for this application. Sorry from the committee any questions from members of the committee from this application. Yes, mr chair, mr harrison, what are the cross street the crosstree mirtol widow? We do milton avenue yeah milton avenue, and we widow is one before the calf yeah, it's myrtle avenue and carlton.

Yes, next to the fire house, yeah next to a firehouse, I think it's only two apartments there. I know the location. Surprisingly. Thank you any other questions from members of the committee. Any questions from members of the community do we have anything for this application going once going twice: okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna assume there are no questions and I'll ask the committee. Do I have a motion? Second I'll?

It's a lot of things I wanted to talk about, but I'm not going to really put that off until next month, because I know we're at a pretty late hour tonight. I thank you jessica for going to the hearing on the cashless establishments. That was really great and I really just want to encourage everybody foremost to put the district needs that you have and your thoughts into the document. You know it really takes thinking and putting the things that we talked about from this into concrete actions going into that spreadsheet. So I really hope everybody will take the time to do that at least put one or two things in there and then we can have a more final critical discussion in september when we wrap things up. So with that, does anybody have any other business they'd like to raise on the committee? Just one point, mr chair. Mr harrison, you had one point. Yes briefly, that would be great, since we are the health and environment and social services. I just I know it's a pain, but I just I'm wishing and I'm hoping and I'm strongly suggesting courteously that everybody when they go out, even if it's just for a second wear, a mask. Yes, okay, got it. Excuse me brandon. I just want to note for the record that mr andrews was unable to log in and so at 6 15 619 he sort of gave up, and so his apologies and that of miss richardson, who had a member of her family, got involved in a car accident this afternoon. Oh no, so she was on april. It's certainly understandable and very sorry to hear that and absolutely all I know she said that she was headed to the hospital. So why that we wanted to raise at this point. Okay, I'm just going to say samantha johnson, sent me these photos of this scaffolding of the NYCHA establishments. It looks enormous, but I'm going to share them around via email with everybody. Moving on to the last part of our agenda community forum there, any members of the public who would like to make a statement or note their thoughts. This is this. Is your time. Okay, I'm not seeing anything. But then again I don't know do we do we have confirmation as to whether there are any questions. I don't see any questions, miss lois, nothing from you today. I recognize you. Okay, all right! Well, with that I'll entertain a motion to adjourn barry, you got it, you got it good job barry appreciate the speed. Can I get a second from john great all right? Everybody have a nice day and we'll look forward to getting you the next one. Thank you very much welcome and welcome. Nicole. We look forward to you good morning, great, maybe next time today someday we'll be back. Thank you. So much bye-bye good night, everyone stay safe, stay, safe, stay, safe, stay, safe, stay, safe,.
