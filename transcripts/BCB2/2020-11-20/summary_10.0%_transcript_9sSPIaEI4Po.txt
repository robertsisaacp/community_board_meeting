The application is submitted by the department of city-wide administrative services pursuant to section 197c of the New York City charter for disposition of city-owned property located on the west side of Pearl Street between New York and front streets, block 52, lots, 15 and 17 presumed to zoning Brooklyn, a bar of Brooklyn community board.
We are here talking about a project that I'm going to give a brief overview from the EDC and city perspective.
The action here is a transfer of development rights, city unlocks, underneath the Manhattan bridge, the private developer, to add to their presidential project and there's a commercial restriction, commercial office restriction on the development rights that will be transferring it's 100,000 square feet of commercial office space that is going to be transferred from the city-owned lots to ravsky to add to their as a residential, project.
Steven will talk a little bit more about the tenanting strategy and the developer's view on what the commercial office space will look like and the rest of the program.
This is a good opportunity to realize value from you know otherwise unusable development rights from those lots again because they're under the bridge, and also to secure some commitments for things like local hiring and mwbe commitments.
We still believe this is a project that makes a ton of sense and actually what we're seeing is that you know demand for commercial office in places like Dumbo will continue to grow as we move, forward.
I think we're seeing you know, increased desire for live work neighborhoods and for people to have jobs that are closer to where they live, and so in that vein.
I know, I saw from the Dumbo bid in terms of what the commercial office workers have meant to the neighborhood and the small businesses there, and obviously the city's fiscal and budget context is something that you know has to be acknowledged and it's very different from when we first started.
You know the city has lost looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of 9 billion over the past two fiscal years and still is looking at over 4 billion in a budget gap that needs to be filled in the coming fiscal year.
So, you know, in addition to all the other benefits, I talked about, I, think the ability to generate some revenue for the city to fund good things in Dumbo and across the city and borrow it is not something you know that you know we can ignore.
My name is Stephen Hayes and, as Ricky said, I work for the Ravsky group, which is the owner of 69 Adams Street on behalf of the development team.
Construction property management will be involved in the 69 Adam Street Project Arapski is a substantial company with over 2 billion dollars in development, and that includes over 2000 housing units in New, York City, that are many of which are in mixed use.
We are going to have and we will have a dedicated staff person who will be the point person the conduit between communication of conduit of communication between the developer team and the community board, particularly as it relates to construction, where we will come to meetings.
You can see that as the gray square on that property, the merger will allow the city to sell approximately 98,000 square feet of office floor area from its lot for use on the private lot for use on lot.
Next slide, please: In order to create the lot merger and effectuate the transfer of the office development rights, the city requires Euler action to authorize them to dispose of those rights.
It's part of the as of right development for 69, Adam Street, and that's going to be approximately 225 rental market rate units.
Aim of this residential or sorry office component is to create a additional space for the creative tech sector that is already doing very well in in Dumbo and in other areas of Brooklyn, but particularly Dumbo.
Users are evaluating on a cost benefit way, whether they're going to be coming back to offices in the future or on a part-time basis, maybe a little bit longer they're.
These things will be incorporated in the design, and we know that those will be ineffective of where we are at present and people rethinking office, space.
That I just mentioned at first the bottom left-hand corner, and it goes into the second floor and retail, is on the ground floor and part of the conversations that we've had with the retail with the community has told us basically that or taught us that retail along front street is going to be quite important to continue the corridor on both sides of the bridge.
Job generation is quite important to everyone in New York, particularly now, and we did hear through feedback that jobs should be, to the extent possible for people who are residents of the community in which this project is being developed, and that, of course, is done.
They have obviously their two NYCHA or a couple nature developments in this community and they have a really extensive network on helping NYCHA residents get hired during construction.
You talked about how the city will generate revenue as a result of this development rights.
So we've been struggling, I'm wondering why would the city sell you property to develop in an area where they have not bothered to provide the adequate services that are necessary to accommodate all the folks that they are thinking are going to move into this area.
You know, as I said, original RFP, goals, work to maximize current office development, and that is, development.
Otherwise, the there's a market rate presidential project, as of ski, can build and the city development rates are just going to be going to commercial office.
I mean I'll say we certainly expect the board to, and residents of Dumbo to advocate, for you know, investments that would be important for them.
Basically, what we're if this goes, through, what we get as a result of this ruler and granting this action is commercial office space that then, presumably Ratsky will rent out to who knows who, and.
On, the permanent side, one of our community members wrote in a letter which I'm going to quote here, that buildings don't create jobs and that's I, think definitely true.
If you can speak to how you can ensure that the res the tenants who come into this office space that you will be able to build as a result of this Euler will actually be beholden to these nwde and local hiring goals.
We understand that, but I guess what it comes down to is that who, five years from now, who's, going to make sure that Rafsky's, following through on that, you guys will be locked on the building, will be built and there'll, be some turnover of commercial, tenancy and booth, ensuring that those people are hiring local residents and Mwbe.
Second question is maybe more concerning to you, which is how do we ensure that our tenants will act in good faith to hire locally and what that takes a variety of mechanisms and the most obvious one is that we put it in their lease that they need to do these kinds of standard things to go out and interview and make a point to hire.
I'd, really love to see an image of what this would actually look like if this is not approved and we don't have the office space because it would actually be about the size of beacon tower, which would be a totally different feel for the neighborhood.
On behalf of the partnership, I'd like to express our support for the city of New York's proposed sale of unused development rights for commercial office use at 69, Adam, Street.
We believe the action will facilitate the construction of new space to support continued job growth in Brooklyn in alignment with the mayor's New York works, jobs, plan.
The, building's mixed-use model will include 225 residential rental units built as a freight and approximately 99,000 square feet of commercial office.
We believe the new commercial hub will provide opportunities for additional expansion of the district's technology and creative hub and will be designed to provide safe work environments and adapt it as needed to reflect the evolving market in coming years.
We believe the proposed project will also create new jobs for brooklynites through a commitment to local and mwb hiring and know that ratsky will work with the NYC EDC to prioritize local hiring for both construction and permanent jobs, with a 50 local highlander hiring goal and will work with the NYCHA office of resident economic empowerment and sustainability and other community organizations to post open positions and recruit candidates.
Adams is a project that will enhance the greater downtown Brooklyn area, support job growth and bring additional hiring opportunities to the local community, and we encourage the committee and the board to support this proposal.
Although I'm speaking on my own behalf, I first want to just say thank you to the committee members who raised I, think really important questions, John, Karen and Daughtry, and also that I support some of the earlier testimony, especially Doreen and Aaron.
I. Think I'm, a jumbo resident, and one of my main concerns is that the infrastructure of Dumbo can not keep up with this project and also that there's no benefit to dunking.
There is no demand for commercial commercial, real estate in Dumbo, right now, and anyone that is off that lives or works in Dumbo knows this is pre-Covid pre-code a Wall Street Journal article from 2019 talks about how a tech company grouped a handful of employees based in a co-working space to staff.
Mr Gupta, Dumbo isn't easily accessible for some parts of New York City by public transportation, subway delays, slow, buses, creating long commutes, cameras.
Okay I'll have to tax time because we still have a bunch of people, but I think you may thank you all right, Next, Paris.
I am also a member of the Dumbo action committee, but I'm speaking, just as a Dumbo resident, I'm speaking in opposition to the 69 Adam Street Euler, the neighborhood is filled with underutilized commercial space.
The shoe look should not proceed unless EDC renegotiates, real public benefits for Dumbo and the people that come to live work and visit.
I. Think you've heard from a lot of our neighbors this evening about the kind of tipping point that the neighborhood is at in terms of infrastructure and I.
As, the the earlier presentation showed, we could have a large residential building, but I think that the matter at hand is really about the public benefit.
We have seen, as Cali noted, an explosion in office space in the Dumbo area as a result of the conversions of the watchtower buildings.
I. Understand that you know the revenue generated from this site is unlikely to offset the full capital needs of the York Street station, but we could put a down payment down and start negotiations with the MTA to try to get some progress and instead thank you.
Instead, we're getting off the space which we're not asking for I, also think that it's dubious of the city to be proposing to be supporting a development project that has 100 market rate or luxury housing.
I want to say that I really feel like it's important for the city's economy as a whole to lean in on office, space and commercial districts that have a proven track record right now of generating economic activity.
Is, the office market of first choice in Brooklyn, and has really driven the the development of downtown Brooklyn into a central business district again as an employment center, and we need to be investing and keeping that going strong one minute, on.
Don't think that another development is going to do Dumbo any good.
We're, not talking about those needs in this presentation, as a user as an occasional user of the York Street station, I and Karen will know this.
Removing what I have here, some existing brick and installing new brick relocating doors at the parlor and second floors, and installing a new door at the third floor, applicant anticipates LPC staff approval for what I have here for ironwork notice, a investigation of replacing a rear, facade, okay, 18 Willoughby go ahead and give us your name good evening to the committee and the rest of the community who's attending.
Accordingly, our next sheet, drawing l003, articulates in better detail the existing and proposed modifications to the rear facade, which will be presented for both your consideration and for consideration at a public hearing with the landmarks Preservation Commission, the bottom right, hand, corner image shows the existing rear facade in its current condition and the lack of any kind of historic, material or fabric.
Yes, Judy I'd, like to move that the committee approves that I think the symmetry in the windows is lovely.
Right we're going to let it approval in a second any further discussion.
The proposal builds on zoning text, amendments that were put in place shortly after Hurricane Sandy to help coastal neighborhoods recover and rebuild quickly, but those running flexibilities which were passed as temporary emergency measures are beginning to expire, and the department of City planning has conducted many years of research and outreach over the past several years, which have uncovered several issues that communities are still facing, and the proposal is now seeking to make many of these provisions added after sandy permanent and also expand on them.
It's important to note here that these regulations are optional and would be facilitating buildings to either meet or even exceed flood resilient construction standards set forth by FEMA and enforced by the city's building code in Appendix G.
By allowing any lot that's located within both the one percent and the point, two percent annual chance flood lanes to have access to the proposed special rules that help enable resiliency at the building.
The point two percent flood plain serves as a proxy for the higher end projections of the 2050s one percent annual chance floodplain, allowing the city to advance a resiliency in the longer term, as it would also allow property owners to proactively undertake resiliency improvements, even if it's not required by the building code.
This set of rules would promote good, long-term resilient design of buildings and how they meet the sidewalk through floor area.
Community boards are being asked to submit their recommendations to the city planning commission by December 28 2020.
The committee will need to make a recommendation tonight so that the full board can vote at the December general meeting and that's what means.
The board and Committee leadership asked city planning to make this a 10 minute.
So there are multiple neighborhoods in community district 2, for which the the zoning text amendment is applicable and even with Brooklyn bridge park.
That's coming up along the shoreline here in CB2 is going to be larger, again, multiple dwellings, larger commercial spaces, and that means that it will be additional floors will be added that the idea of the old, your mechanicals in the basement just won't work in this kind of environment and that it will have the mechanicals left to be put upstairs and it'll.
The committee approve the work of the Department of City planning for the zoning for coastal flooding, resiliency.
We are always working with our engagement team to understand people's needs, and we can certainly communicate this to our team.
I want to ask the board office if they've received any further communications or applications or anything from the Brooklyn music school and the developer are regarding how they want to proceed or on how they will proceed with 130 Saint Felix, Street, Mr, Paris I, don't know if you have anything on that or where we're still in limbo on that they have filed their application.
We probably need more stuff, stop talking about anything capital in community district 2, specifically the projects that come before the community board that we think are approved and are in some status.
