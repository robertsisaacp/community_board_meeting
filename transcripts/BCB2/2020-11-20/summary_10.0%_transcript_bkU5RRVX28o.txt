Cases is an agency that's been around since the 1960s and has a history of providing alternatives to incarceration services and in the last 20 years and services that are also focused on and people that have mental illness who become involved in the criminal.
I'm talking to you from our downtown Brooklyn office, which is I'm located on Lawrence Street, and this evening, I'm just going to go through the range of services that we have to serve.
I, just want to frame who we know becomes involved in the criminal legal system in New, York City, and we know that is generally people of color black people, latinx people, both youth, and there are other populations that are over represented.
We find them in our jails we find them routinely within our courtrooms and people who are also homeless are over-represented in the criminal legal system in New, York, City and other populations that are also over-represented include members of the community and who are gentle, who are transgender people we find are over-represented in the criminal legal system, particularly black, transgender and latinx transgender folks, and also folks, that have medical conditions we find are over represented.
One of the themes is that we are trying to disrupt the involvement of folks in the criminal legal system and really address some of the social problems that people face in community, where we believe through effective services, that there is community safety for everybody.
People may be arrested on more serious crimes called felonies and they could be at risk of and having that crime adjudicated and with the sentence of imprisonment, and we know that our prisons in New, York state are run by our state, agency, and so cases runs an alternative to incarceration program for youth and young adults.
A lot of the youth and young adults that we serve, who are Brooklyn residents, have either dropped out of school or under credited or not involved in school or currently would not be identified as folks who, the Department of education would be trying to get electronic devices for because they're not connected to education, although there should be so.
We always make sure that we have social workers and other staff members who are able to intervene and support folks to get connected to the services that they need, particularly if they have serious mental health needs and serious substance.
Our alternatives to incarceration program is also to just make sure that young people who are involved in the criminal legal system also give back, and so we do a lot of work around community benefit projects where young people engage in really giving back to their community.
You know we are, as we work with young people, really trying to have youth and young adults connected to their communities in a very positive and meaningful way, and.
That young people can begin to experience success so that they feel like they are residents in the neighborhood, particularly in Brooklyn.
Addition to alternative to incarceration services and cases also provides community-based services that are accessible to young people who may be on probation.
Like education, employment are just really central to our work, as well as mentoring, services and after-school services for young people who might be on probation, who may live in certain communities.
So we provide services that are out in the community and throughout Brooklyn or that are serving young people directly and, like everybody, else.
So cases has been providing these types of services for 53 years and so that alternatives to incarceration services in New, York, City, really started.
So I just wanted to stress that you know we're very fortunate in New York City, that we have a very robust providers who provide these services to support community safety by ensuring that people get the problems.
And, that's humane and is able to allow people not to have bad decisions resolved by spending a lot of time in jail prison, but then leads to significant consequences that may continue collateral consequences that continue for folks.
You just have a goal that you go for and, as I've said, with young people, in particular for us that pathway is really focused around education and employment services that folks can get, and so another large range of services that cases provides in Brooklyn is for people that have mental illnesses and a lot of our focus and for the last 21 years actually came to cases 21 years ago.
To start our alternatives to incarceration programs for people with serious mental illness.
Maybe, supportive mental health, housing and other supports to hopefully address homelessness and mental health treatment needs that we have been in this space for over 21 years, working in the court system to ensure that people with serious mental illnesses are able to also be diverted into the community in a way that's safe and healthy and supports the individual in their recovery from mental illness and many people in the criminal legal system with serious mental illness also have co-occurring substance, use, disorders.
Nurses, social workers case managers to the community, a team that wraps itself around the person with serious mental illness and provides treatment in a mobile way in the community that the person doesn't have to come into an office into a mental health clinic and so for.
This model called assertive community treatment, which is an evidence-based model for people with serious mental illness as our way to address the needs of people with serious mental illness that become involved in the criminal legal system.
So for now, 20 years we've had the Nathaniel Act team that works with people that are arrested in Brooklyn and also in Manhattan, who have a serious mental illness that they get connected to our treatment.
Who've lived experience of mental illness, who we call peer specialists who work with the person as a team engaging the client in their community in the shelter where they might live in supportive, housing.
Over, the last six to seven years and New, York City's made an investment in assertive community treatment and created teams called forensic, assertive community treatment teams that are working with people with serious mental illness that might be returning.
We serve a lot of folks who are returning to the Brooklyn community, who were in state prison as well as people that were arrested in jail.
Assertive community treatment team serves a lot of Brooklyn residents who actually have serious mental illness who are coming out of city hospitals, so Brooklyn hospitals and we are engaging those folks in mental health treatment and then a new model that the city had created some five years ago is called intensive.
It's, the same configuration of staff for psychiatrists psychiatric nurse practitioner registered nurse case managers and mental health clinicians, who are working in a mobile way in the community and with a smaller caseload of clients, and so our focus at cases is really on the over-representation and the criminalization of people with serious mental illness who become involved in the criminal legal system.
And we work with the Brooklyn courts, as well as the Manhattan courts, to identify those clients and to provide treatment and people stay with us for a very long period of time in the Nathaniel.
A lot, and so cases is the supervised release provider for Manhattan and one of the things that we did when there was bail reform in 2019 in our state, and there was new investments in supervising people who previously would have bail set, you know sometimes as low as 100,500.
Although cases is the Manhattan supervised release provider, which is providing the supervision to people who judges have released under supervision, it's called in New York state we and in 2019 and created an office where I am now at Lawrence Street to provide those services to Brooklyn residents in Brooklyn, because otherwise it would mean that if you were a Brooklyn resident and you were arrested in Manhattan for a crime that you would have to report to our Harlem office, that's where cases is based in Manhattan.
It was really important for us to ensure that Brooklyn residents could get easy access to the supervision services, which include screening and assessment, reminding people about their court dates and monitoring.
Folks in the community, supporting folks to get access to services, which include a lot of referrals to mental health.
We see a lot of folks with mental illness and substance use disorder to come in to supervise release the bail services, and so we just we deliver those services to Brooklyn residents in Brooklyn, and you know, like other services.
We we're doing a partial in person and a lot of virtual supervision services and to ensure that folks, who were arrested, you know attend their virtual court.
You are less likely to be sentenced to jail or prison, and you know this means with bail reform that if you've been arrested for a crime you're not going to lose your housing, you can keep your job.
You know, attend your court appearances and be held accountable if you're going to plead guilty or be found guilty, but a lot of cases.
We ensure that if you live in Brooklyn that the bail services that cases runs are accessible to you, so I just wanted to share.
We have had clients in the program who you know stole chewing gum out of Dwayne Reed, like that is a petty larceny, as well as people that you know maybe stole other items, and so it's the norm.
New York has a really robust alternatives to incarceration and different types of community courts, and you know, like they face of you.
Actually, don't have a lot of interaction because we're working out of the Brooklyn criminal and supreme courts and then in Manhattan, as I said, then serving people in Brooklyn who are Brooklyn residents.
How it works is that in New, York City, the main funding for alternatives to incarceration comes from the mayor's Office of Criminal justice, so that entities you know oversees coordinates with the district attorneys with the courts with probation like they are the central coordinator of the criminal legal system in New, York, City.
Then we present a plan around how the person is going to be supervised, the nature of the services, how we're going to be working with the person and then someone could be released, like supervised release like bail reform without taking a plea in some instances, some people have to and plead guilty to get access to the services, because that's that might be what the court requires, and so this is, you know the story about bail.
You experience ongoing discrimination about employment, you know, and so in bail, where people are able to get services and get cases resolved without pleading guilty like this, you know, is really stopping the issue of some of the collateral consequences that we see.
We even have agencies this one called youth represent that helps young people, who may have been in a diversion program who years later, are experiencing collateral consequences which could be access to housing.
You know at this time when I came to cases you know in Brooklyn the Brooklyn mental health court was started.
You know that's a different discussion, because that would mean that we wouldn't expect cases wouldn't need to exist, because what we are doing is we're, like you, described, helping people that have a number of social problems who become involved, and so social problems should be addressed with social responses.
You know one of those private correctional health entities that were just not doing a good job, but in the last I think, maybe about 10 years now.
It also means that you've completed your legal case, but you know as we're working with people that have serious mental illness.
We run services, mental health services also for people who no longer have a legal case.
Some cases is part of a community of other providers, which we call the New York City alternatives to incarceration and re-entry coalition, and our agencies have definitely been involved.
Those services, you know, I, described that we are supervising 300 Brooklyn residents now in pre-trial, but overall in our program across the city across Manhattan.
You know we take people only arrested in Manhattan, but you have the equivalent in Brooklyn run by the center for court.
If the prosecutor agrees, if the judge agrees they're going to you, earn this by you're, you know doing the right thing in the community.
And, you know a population that we find get arrested over and over again for low-level crimes might be people that have mental illness who are homeless.
And, I, think the prosecutors you know in Brooklyn and throughout our city, I think generally recognize because of mental illness and substance use.
Think I read some a data set that in Brooklyn you know nearly over 80 of Brooklyn residents are eligible for a public defender, which means that the people are being arrested.
And I, know that they're currently pushing around just court fees because at the end of cases like people are charged court fees, and.
Are there other voices, either peer organizations or people that you work, with, that you think are worth bringing to the community board's attention, cool and thank you.
Do, you know, like that's a real public safety, issue, the for people to be stabilized to work on goals that the homelessness is just critical to that really addressing homelessness.
It just goes like we work with a lot of people that are are homeless, New, Yorkers.
And, so I'm just going to talk specifically about people with mental illness who are homeless and so.
Now, and so you know, I, just have to leave all of us with that conundrum, and so when I first came to cases, we would refer people to mental health.
Understanding, maybe talking to some of the mental health and supportive housing providers that the exist in Brooklyn, the Institute for community living has a lot of critical mass in Brooklyn they're, really excellent.
We started our work 20 years ago around people with serious mental illness involved in the criminal legal system.
If you all, are also interested in ensuring you know around the decriminalization of mental illness around thinking about public safety, so public safety is community safety, everyone's safety.
I, didn't know if you intended to okay, Julianne I need to add that it's important to note that community board 2 did not vote to close rocket right.
We can, on our own, decide what issues we want to bring to the board, but I think we, you know.
I. Think John has a good point that if we do want to re-engage with that discussion, it should be a larger community discussion and probably not dealt with at this small level of engagement, and we should look to invite more organizations to speak to that and have a larger, a broader engagement on it and with Covid-19 right now.
They're not start looking at building until late next year, so right, now, I, think everything, even although they're getting their permits for different parts of the buildings and whatever they're not going to be doing any kind of building until late in 2021.
And I wondered what past experience has been like with evictions happening in community district 2 and the response from the law enforcement and how we can wrap our heads around that, as housing court begins to open again and evict people.
You know the community board doesn't like the issue of affordable.
And I think you're, trying you're somewhat saying the same thing with you know: evictions on being a public safety, issue.
I'm, talking about through traffic, I'm talking about people who remove the who can very easily remove the barricades drive through at 25 miles an hour or more, and you know, leave the barricades open so that cars behind them keep going right.
But I, agree that if they're going to do it, there's got to be both an enforcement mechanism and a way of getting people to more to work with them.
