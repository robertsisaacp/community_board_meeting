And then we'll do the meeting complete. You know again, it's being recorded, so just at this time, I guess I have the my I am unmuted and everybody's hearing me so I'll be doing a lot of the talking. So, let's all right, let's get started. What I'm going to do on the hearing is just we'll. Do the brief description, we'll open it up then, to the presenter we'll I'm going to then read off the names and a brief summary of the letters in support and opposition that the office has received and then we'll take the testimony. I guess we call it live or against over the as live as possible. Testimony of the people who wish to speak in regard. We have seven presenters, so I'm asking each person who's going to do testimony other than the presenter for the two minutes used to do two minutes so give everybody a chance to be heard. Okay. So here we go. It's a application for at sea two zero: three five six Ppk for 69 Adam Street! The application is submitted by the department of city-wide administrative services pursuant to section 197c of the New York City charter for disposition of city-owned property located on the west side of Pearl Street between New York and front streets, block 52 lots, 15 and 17 presumed to zoning Brooklyn, a bar of Brooklyn community board, two okay, so presenters. This is your turn, members of the committee and the community board. My name is Ricky Acosta, I'm the assistant vice president for government and community relations at the New York City Economic, Development Corporation, I'm joined by a few colleagues you may hear from later. In addition to some representatives from the developers team. Let me go ahead and share the presentation. If you'll give a moment, Rob previewed this for me everything's good. Until it doesn't. Okay, can everybody see my screen? Yes, okay, great! So again, thanks for having us tonight, you know obviously we'd all rather be doing this in person and I'd be remiss if I didn't also acknowledge that today was a bit hectic for parents of public schools. So I just thank everybody for being here to listen to our presentation. So, as the chair Gordon mentioned, we are here talking about a project that I'm going to give a brief overview from the EDC and city perspective and then I'll hand off to Steven Hayes who's representing the developer, the Ravsky group. So this project is a result of an RFP that was put out in 2017 with a goal of including office growth in commercial districts outside of Manhattan the you know. This is kind of an interesting project, because it's not our typical EDC or certainly a typical EDC real estate project that you may have seen. The action here is a transfer of development rights city unlocks, underneath the Manhattan bridge, the private developer, to add to their presidential project and there's a commercial restriction, commercial office restriction on the development rights that will be transferring it's 100,000 square feet of commercial office space that is going to be transferred from the city-owned lots to ravsky to add to their as a residential project. Certainly from a strategy perspective. It makes sense to have this kind of use in the kind of growing Brooklyn tech triangle. Steven will talk a little bit more about the tenanting strategy and the developer's view on what the commercial office space will look like and the rest of the program. But from our perspective, this is a good opportunity to realize value from you know otherwise unusable development rights from those lots again because they're under the bridge, and also to secure some commitments for things like local hiring and mwbe commitments. You know, obviously, the context that we're in today is a little bit different from. We were when we first put the RFP out in 2017. We still believe this is a project that makes a ton of sense and actually what we're seeing is that you know demand for commercial office in places like Dumbo will continue to grow as we move forward. I think we're seeing you know, increased desire for live work neighborhoods and for people to have jobs that are closer to where they live, and so in that vein, I think this makes sense from a planning perspective and also in terms of timeline. The Stephen will get into a little bit more of the details, but the goal would be for the project to be delivered in 2023, so we're still some ways off from the project being delivered. Stephen will also get into some of the job goals, but you know I just want to say you know at a time where it's 14 unemployment in both the city and the borough, you know every opportunity to add potential jobs. I think is meaningful and I. Think that was highlighted in the testimony. I know, I saw from the Dumbo bid in terms of what the commercial office workers have meant to the neighborhood and the small businesses there, and obviously the city's fiscal and budget context is something that you know has to be acknowledged and it's very different from when we first started. But you know the city has lost looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of 9 billion over the past two fiscal years and still is looking at over 4 billion in a budget gap that needs to be filled in the coming fiscal year. So you know, in addition to all the other benefits I talked about, I, think the ability to generate some revenue for the city to fund good things in Dumbo and across the city and borrow it is not something you know that you know we can ignore, since we had a an informational presentation with the board a couple months ago, we've done some one-on-one engagement with some of the neighborhood groups and I think we've heard a lot of things. We are still exploring potential public realm and open space improvements that can be realized. In addition to all the other things that we spoke about, and you know I think again, just thank you for being here. I, look forward to hearing more of your perspective and I think at that point. Sorry, at this point, I'm going to hand it over to Stephen Hayes on behalf of the Ravsky group, and if you want to flip to the next slide, Ricky all right, hi everyone, my name is Stephen Hayes and, as Ricky said, I work for the Ravsky group, which is the owner of 69 Adams Street on behalf of the development team. Thank you all for your time and your consideration of the Shulip application, particularly in these strange times, where there's a lot of personal challenges and stresses. We are grateful for your time working with us on this, so I wanted to introduce Ravsky and the team, and then I'm going to pass this off to our language, Council Ray Levin, who will talk about the land, use actions and then he'll pass it back to me and I will talk about the program for the project, the building design and then jobs as well. So let me start by talking about the development team. Ravsky is a Williamsburg based, multifaceted developer that was founded in 1993 by Yadler, Rabinowitz and Simon Duchinsky. Hence the name Ravsky. Besides the development arm and side, there is also a construction company side and a property management side and all three development. Construction property management will be involved in the 69 Adam Street Project Arapski is a substantial company with over 2 billion dollars in development, and that includes over 2000 housing units in New, York City, that are many of which are in mixed use. Projects. I wanted to introduce the team that is on the call right now. Our architect is Fisher, Mikui and Ihob. Our environmental consultant is Philip, Habib, Associates and Lisa. Geordi is on this call, and our Land News Council is Herrick and Ray Levin, who I mentioned and Rob Hooverman are on the call as well one last thing about the project team and this results in some feedback that we received from speaking to the community stakeholders. We understand that there has been, in the past lack of communication between some of the developers and the developments that have happened in the community, particularly as a regard in regards to construction and what's happening during construction. We we are going to have and we will have a dedicated staff person who will be the point person the conduit between communication of conduit of communication between the developer team and the community board, particularly as it relates to construction, where we will come to meetings. Keep everyone posted on what's happening with construction talk about impacts that are happening and mitigation measures that can happen. We want to be a good communicator, so with that I'm going to, we can go to the next slide and I'm going to pass this off to ray. Who can talk about the land, use actions, I hope ray? Can you come in? I'm here perfect, I'm here district, which allows a five far for commercial use and nine far for residential use. Lot. Four, which is shown on this on this drawing is privately owned by Rapski it is vacant and under existing conditions it could be support. A 285 foot tall building with approximately 225 apartments or with 156,000 square feet of floor area. What's being proposed, is the merger of this private La 4 with the city, lots, 15 and 17? You can see with the hatching on them in this drawing which are used by DOT department of transportation for vehicle parking and storage and there's a small one story building towards the back of the lot. You can see that as the gray square on that property, the merger will allow the city to sell approximately 98,000 square feet of office floor area from its lot for use on the private lot for use on lot. Four, the only other property on the block, as you can see, is the home to the beacon apartment, building, 23 stories of residential building. Next slide, please: in order to create the lot merger and effectuate the transfer of the office development rights, the city requires Euler action to authorize them to dispose of those rights. The approval being sought also will grant a 30-foot wide light and air easement starting above the Manhattan bridge roadway and that allows windows on that side of the building next slide. Please the this. These drawings illustrate the difference between the building with and without the additional office floor area. The building on your on your left is an as of right: building it's a little bit thinner same height, but a little bit thinner than the building on your right, which Steve will come back and explain the different layers in that building, but that building's a little bit thicker and that's where the while. The additional floor area is contained in that building the office on the lower floors and residential on the upper and the building gets a little bit thicker. The residential portion gets a little bit thicker, but it's that they're, both within the 285 foot height limit Steve you're back on okay, thanks ray. If we could just go to the next slide. Ricky. Okay, I wanted to summarize the pro programmatic elements of this project and I'll go through it reasonably quickly, because I also want to talk about the design which is informed by this program. The residential component of the project, as ray mentioned, is owned by Rabski. Already, it's part of the as of right development for 69, Adam Street, and that's going to be approximately 225 rental market rate units. We haven't determined the exact unit breakdown. As of yet that will depend on market conditions as we go forward, as Ricky mentioned, this project will be, is expected to be open and the second half of 2023. I did want to talk a little bit about the location of the entrances to each of these components, and if the diagram on your right is an elevation standing on Adam Street. Looking at the building the left hand, corner is perpendicular to front street. If you look on the bottom right portion, you can see what is the entrance to a parking garage which I'll speak to in a second just to the left of that is the entrance to the residential component of the project. The next portion of the project is the office component. That entrance is just to the left of the residential entrance. That I just pointed out to you, as Ricky mentioned. The aim of this residential or sorry office component is to create a additional space for the creative tech sector that is already doing very well in in Dumbo and in other areas of Brooklyn, but particularly Dumbo. I did want to talk a little bit about quickly about office and Covid-19, because I'm sure some of you are probably thinking you know. What's he doing talking about office space when nobody's going into offices at present? So here's a couple of thoughts on that we've been thinking those exact questions. Here's a few things on that. As I mentioned, this project will be coming online in the second half of 2023, where we should be in a post-covid environment where people are back to normal routines. I don't mean to sound insensitive to the horrible situation we are in at present, but certainly indicators are showing vaccines and progress happening next year. So we believe that we will be in a you know in a better, certainly a significantly better place by the summer of 2023. That being said, there definitely will be some changes in the approach to office, both in terms of demand and supply. With regard to demand, as I'm sure many of you are aware, people are office. Users are evaluating on a cost benefit way, whether they're going to be coming back to offices in the future or on a part-time basis, maybe a little bit longer they're. Also looking at you know, opportunities to shrink offices, space, there's, definitely sectors that are looking at that, but there are also sectors that are looking at that already know. That cost benefit is not in their favor, that there are waning efficiencies and significantly waning levels of creativity and those sectors are definitely in the creative tech sector. Somebody mentioned to me the other day they feel like they're, basically treading water in their business at present, and that is not ideal. Maybe it's a it's actually pretty good for the current situation, but it won't be ideal going forward. So we know that there will be a demand for this office. Space in the future supply will also change, and right now we haven't designed the interior of the office space, but we do know that gone are the days of a bullpen, and you know freeze overall free space. There will be more definition in terms of individual workspaces, there'll be larger conference rooms. There'll be different pathways through office space. These things will be incorporated in the design and we know that those will be ineffective of where we are at present and people rethinking office space, so we're pretty we're feeling pretty confident with office. The other two elements of the of the project are the retail and parking is accessed at that area. That I just mentioned at first the bottom left-hand corner, and it goes into the second floor and retail, is on the ground floor and part of the conversations that we've had with the retail with the community has told us basically that or taught us that retail along front street is going to be quite important to continue the corridor on both sides of the bridge. So we will have retail that will be fronting on front street primarily. So, if we go to the next slide, I like to talk about design, also feedback that we've gotten is that there have been some concerns that there haven't. Some of the new projects haven't been architecturally responsive to Dumbo, and we don't want to be that type of project. So we've certainly studied context. I listed some of the contextual pieces that we've looked at color texture shapes the bridge itself scale and we've also looked at the building in terms of understanding the mixed uses within it, because Dumbo's unique in that it's a mixed use area, so we've divided the building into four pieces and I want to go through them with you. If you look at the drawing on the right, the ending on the right, the we're looking at the corner of Adams and Front street right ahead of us and that's Adams Street that we're looking at the majority and the bridge in the distance down front street. The first component is the public realm component, which is the ground floor and that's going to be where the retail is and the lobbies that's going to be quite transparent, there's going to be signage lighting street trees, street planting all along that first piece. The next section of the building, which goes up really from the third floor to the ninth floor, is the office component of the building, and that is reaches the point which is just above the top of the bridge. In the background, and that's where it then sets back to the third component of the building, which is the next two floors, 10 and 11, which is amenity space, which includes balconies, overlooking the bridge overlooking the other area, it it cuts back in and sets back. The upper portion above it'll include many spaces for both the office and the residential component, and it also will include a some of the mechanicals and then above that, up until the 20 25 floors and a a an interpretation of a cornice is the residential building and then there'll be a roof deck. On top of that. So that's the design. If we go to the next slide, which is the last side of the presentation, Ricky I just wanted to highlight job generation. We know job generation is quite important to everyone in New York, particularly now, and we did hear through feedback that jobs should be to the extent possible for people who are residents of the community in which this project is being developed, and that, of course, is done by so we we hear that and we, as you can see. The next line says the approximate number of jobs, 250 construction, 470, mainly commercial jobs there. So there's a significant amount here, and because this is an EDC project, we are working with EDC on two hiring programs and the first one is local hiring, which is a significantly important portion of this project. And the second is the Mwb Construction Ironman I want to talk about both briefly. The local hiring, which is higher NYC through EDC, has two components: one is a construction component and the other is an ongoing operational component. There are a variety of mechanisms and tools that EDC has and has used successfully and has had other groups used successfully to encourage local hiring local participation in the operations of the building. We're going to be tapping into that one example here is that we noted here is NYCHA office of Greece Resident, economic, empowerment and sustainability. They have obviously their two NYCHA or a couple nature developments in this community and they have a really extensive network on helping NYCHA residents get hired during construction. We started the conversations with them and we're excited to work with them on the construction site. As well as the full-time portion, we have a robust hiring goal of 50 local hiring in these jobs. So we're very serious about this, and the last piece on this is hiring is the Nwb participation program, obviously hiring minority agreement. Business enterprises is important to everyone and we have entered an agreement or we've been doing agreeing with EDC to follow a lot of the protocols and the processes that they have in place to help encourage Mgb participation in this, and we have a hiring goal there as well so and I. On behalf of the team. We appreciate your time on this and I'm going to turn this over to Ricky, to coordinate questions and I. Guess: I'll answers it back to the chair and members of the committee, I guess: I, don't need to share my screen anymore, all right. If you're willing to take questions, any questions will come from members of the committee or board members. Only committee or board member's own I have a question. If you can speak a little bit to you talked about how the city will generate revenue as a result of this development rights transfer. How much are we talking about and how is it going to be? How is it going to circle back to our community? Meaning? Is there any agreement in place that money would directly benefit Dumbo and or community board too thanks? It's a good question. So the terms of the financial considerations are not going to be finalized until after Euler that doesn't get executed. Until we have an approved project, I can say that the development rights would be valued at what would be considered a market and, in terms of you know what happens to the funds. On the other end, those decisions haven't been made yet, and you know, as I said, obviously we're in a different fiscal context than we were when we first started this project. So you know I think we're definitely open to ideas for how some of that funding could go directly back into the neighborhood, but I think that'll be weighed against the balance of the larger fiscal situation and I guess needs across this city and also you know, needs money to pay for lots of services that you know, schools cops teachers, firefighters, so you know we can't do this now, but we remain open to hearing more about. You know things that would be important, so no guarantees Carlton. Can you hear me John? Yes, are they ready for more questions? Yes, okay, can you give us the square footage or some other factor which describes how much larger your as of right building is going to be increased by that'd, be approximately 98,000 square feet and what is that by percentage greater than your as of right? Well, the as of right on our on the footprint? That's only our property is about 156,000 square feet, so 98 additional is about two-thirds more so about 66 percent. More something like that. Okay and in doing your analysis, because I've been on this community board for well over 20 some odd years, we did an a rezoning many years ago and part of that rezoning called for the city and the state to do some upgrades of all of our train stations that are not ADA compliant. The York street, which is station, which I'm understanding is the closest to this proposed development, is not only not ADA compliant. It has only one entrance and it's a steep entrance very difficult to access. So we've been struggling, I'm wondering why would the city sell you property to develop in an area where they have not bothered to provide the adequate services that are necessary to accommodate all the folks that they are thinking are going to move into this area? So it's a very general question, but it's important for this community board that we represent our community and frankly, we did loads of ulurping way back when thinking that we were not going to get any more Euler and now we're getting more. You have to actually examine this very carefully to make sure that it's appropriate for the community, because we do have a lot of concerns about this. My final question is your building is going up near the Manhattan bridge. Did I understand that correctly? Yes, so, yes, I would like to understand what views you're going to be blocking from other folks that moved into Dumbo, but there's a certain expectation that they were going to have a particular view. That's now going to be blocked if your building gets erected Alex our building is up against the lot line, the back wall of the beacon which there was no expectation of use from that wall, it's mostly a brick wall on the other side across the street from us, it's a new building where they were across the street. They had no expectation of views, I, don't know, and on the other side of the bridge, it's a I guess 100 J street building, but none of those properties had any expectation of views. The zoning allowed tall buildings and I'm sure that everybody's offering statements indicated that there could be tall buildings nearby and to the question about the York Street F station. That's one that we are aware. That's you know, obviously come up in the conversations that we've done with folks in the community. The city has ongoing dialogue with the MTA about capital needs across the system. The MTA has I think everyone's been somewhat precarious financial position. So you know I expect there'll be an ongoing dialogue there, but you know we don't have anything to say about it right now and or whether this project could actually you know meaningfully address the needs there. I understand their financial need is quite significant, but okay, thank you, John any other board members of committee members with questions for the presenter I have another question, but I will wait for another person to speak. If there are other questions, I wanted to ask just if you all at some point considered having any below market residential units yeah, so I can say from the city perspective. You know, as I said, original RFP goals, work to maximize current office development, and that is, development. Rights are going to be used, the rights that are going to be transferred and and yeah. Otherwise, the there's a market rate presidential project, as of ski, can build and the city development rates are just going to be going to commercial office space. So I have one question. So as far as the money goes, we will not find out how much money you're making or the city is making, and we don't know where it's going because after you learn, that's decided, but we don't know now before we make our decision, how that is going to go down right, so you're asking us to accept the project without any kind of idea of how much money or where it's going. That's what I'm understanding yeah I mean I'll say we certainly expect the board to and residents of Dumbo to advocate, for you know, investments that would be important for them. But you know again the terms aren't final until after the transaction is executed at the interview alert. So you know, I can't tell you today how how it would be spent Ricky it's Rob Paris will EDC be coming back if the Euler application is successful, will EDC come back with the term sheet? Yeah I would defer to precedent. I yeah I can double check and get back to you. That sounds reasonable, but perhaps Rob Holbrook could answer that question and then more generally Karen. The money all goes to the general fund money. Never it very rarely is money earmarked for anything specific. So you know unless there's some codification, that the developer Edc agrees that as part of this action they plan to do something specific that is independent of the land use actions themselves. Okay, understood just makes it less. Yeah and I mean look. The only thing I'll add is you know we are in a public review process again. You know. We expect that members of the community will advocate for things that they'd like to see those funds go towards and I think we're open to hearing more about that as we move through the business. Okay, don't you I think one question I have several more, but I will try not to waste take too much time. My next question is really about the job creation and the commitments that you spoke about earlier. Basically, what we're if this goes through, what we get as a result of this ruler and granting this action is commercial office space that then presumably Ratsky will rent out to who knows who, and so I'm curious how you can help us feel more confident in those goals of Mwbe and local hiring goals. On the permanent side, one of our community members wrote in a letter which I'm going to quote here, that buildings don't create jobs and that's I think definitely true. So if you can speak to how you can ensure that the res the tenants who come into this office space that you will be able to build as a result of this Euler will actually be beholden to these nwde and local hiring goals. Right, yes, so, oh sorry, but before Stevens I just want to say that the local hiring and mwb commitments are written into the contract. That EDC and Rafsky are entering into so those are, you know, binding commitments again, I see a program for local hiring which, as many folks knows, provides the first folks in the community yeah. Sorry to interrupt that. We understand that, but I guess what it comes down to is that who, five years from now who's, going to make sure that Rafsky's, following through on that, you guys will be locked on the building, will be built and there'll, be some turnover of commercial, tenancy and booth, ensuring that those people are hiring local residents and Mwbe yeah. As I said, the commitments are written into the contract, Stephen I, don't know, I didn't mean I. Think there's three points to this. That I I'd like to point out that the first is that the commitment that Ravsky is obligated to do in the contract has I believe it's a in your reporting period of and there's a rep there's a significant amount of reporting of efforts and results from those efforts to hire locally, as well as higher mwb through construction. Obviously, construction stops when construction is done and the local hiring stops when the construction on the building is done as well for construction, but for permanent hiring, there's an obligation that lasts longer than through construction. There are I think your question. At least my interpretation of the question is: there's two sides to it and correct me. If I'm misunderstanding, this there's the way to get local residents and inform local residents about jobs, to get them to apply for the jobs and then there's the question of how do we make sure that our tenants and we ensure that they are hiring locally with the commitment that we've committed to the first is a is, maybe a little bit more straightforward and that there are a whole variety of mechanisms that EDC has worked with to go out and solicit jobs from the local population and I can certainly give you a lot more detail on that. I think. The second question is maybe more concerning to you, which is how do we ensure that our tenants will act in good faith to hire locally and what that takes a variety of mechanisms and the most obvious one is that we put it in their lease that they need to do these kinds of standard things to go out and interview and make a point to hire 50 local and we make an obligation in the least in a variety of ways, there's other ways of doing it as well. Certainly we are the operator of the building and there those jobs are in our control, but you're exactly right. The tenants are have to be obligated, we're obligated to meet these requirements. Tenants, obligated and there's you know the lease is the mechanism for one of the mechanisms. Yeah and EDC has a robust in-house compliance Department, whose sole focus is to make sure people are living up to the terms of the commitments that they enter into with us. So you know: they'll be yeah, keeping close launch to make sure that all those commitments are adhered to. We can I mean we can also we're reporting to EDC. We can report if interested to the community board on local hiring, particularly the local hiring portion and that's they're, a whole ways of creating these kinds of reports. We've done it in other projects, and we can certainly do it here. We can certainly start with construction and outline the efforts that we're making and the outreach that we're making all along from you know, start of construction all the way through operations all right. Thank you. Well, it's getting a little later, so I'd like to move on to the people who wish to be heard. First I will just list off briefly the people, the letters that the board office has received. I'll, give a name and a very brief summary of the letters that we have received in no particular order. I have we've received John Santos from local 32Bj, Seru who's indicated support for, and they had, they said they had good relations with Rapski we have received from Randy. Oh yeah of the Brooklyn chamber of Commerce has also indicated support. We have from Nicholas De Santos who's indicated opposition they're concerned with the situation of the F train. Carolyn Puente, as in the indicator, also sent us an indicated. Opposition also concerned about conditions of the F train, Ivo Stratus Janus, I'm saying the name wrong, there's opposition and they were concerned also with the York position. With the York Street F train station, we have Neil Bardov Md at 100. J Street has also indicated opposition the downtown Brooklyn partnership, Eugene Meyer, has indicated support and they believe that jobs will be created. We have, let's see what else here. Nick Nick Ingham has indicated opposition located, nicking him from 98 front street with indicated opposition to and is concerned with, the effect of the project. All right. So now we're I think I've read off all the names of people who sent us a written, I guess a testimony. We have nonsense. Mr chairman! Yes, this is Bill Fenoy, I'm sorry I had a little problem. Getting in may I ask a couple questions before you turn it over to the public. Do one try to do one and I want to get moving on yeah, but you can not a problem. Okay, just for clarification, I apologize I had problems actually signing in. If it's, let me make this clear. The air rights okay, have they been transferred, as of yet no, the transfer wouldn't happen until yeah. You know okay, now as far as that's what Europe is about, is the city getting authorization to transfer the development rights? No problem? Thank you. Okay. Next students are curious about the there's two items here: the disposition of negative easement to development of site corresponding to the sale, the approximately 98,446 square, feet of development rights for commercial use for the Dod site. Okay, is that something that we are currently deciding on right? Now? That's the uf! Yes, okay. In addition to that, the disposition of permanent easement for the purpose of light air and the development site to serve residential uses above a certain limiting plane located on a D.O.T site. That's also something that we're considering tonight. Also, yes, Sir. Okay, it also mentions, beyond the discretionary actions listed above, the prop the proposed development will be as a as of right. Building that will comply with zoning resolutions. Yes, the zoning is not being changed, so it's complying with zone because current zoning, okay, so okay, thank you. That's what I need to hear. You're welcome, okay, I, guess: Rob Paris I! Guess you have the list of people who wish to testify over. You know and I guess: ask each chef person to testify so I limited to two minutes so because we have a lot of people and a lot of work and I would add a couple of other things. Mr Gordon one is that there were some additional written testimony that was submitted late this afternoon, but it just got to a point where it was so late that from experience, I had little optimism that committee members would be able to read them. So it's been noted in the chat room that there were some additional. There was some additional testimony, including at 602 pm, but you know you have not received those. They will be added to the testimony folder and then a number of people have asked to testify. Some of them I know are affiliated with certain organizations. They may or may not be speaking on behalf of those organizations so when they introduce themselves, I would appreciate it if they would make that clear, and that goes doubly so for people who wear more than one hat. So the first person who asked to speak tonight is Doreen: Gallo, hey hi Rob. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, good on behalf of the jumbo neighborhood alliance? I'm writing I'm! Well, I'm not writing we. We do not support the fuel application in its entire entirety. We do not support extending a commercial corridor considering the site's proximity to the bridge and the current climate of businesses, leaving the neighborhood and struggling prior to Covid-19 in the as of right. M15 R9-1 zoning for 69 atoms Dna asked that an appropriate percentage of the units be marketed in an affordable rate and in keeping with MIH guidelines. I submitted late testimony at five today. So it's in the folder, but I'd like to say a couple of things from our testimony: New York, City EDC, seems determined to sell air rights that are air rights to a public space. How can public air rights be sold without considering the public? These attempts, these assertions perpetuate unacceptable initiatives, void of any and all public safety concerns demonstrates myopic scope regarding the planning not to mention attempting to set bad precedent for every municipal entity, no mention regarding the restoration of the underbelly of the Manhattan bridge, which would serve as a gateway through our neighborhoods connecting them all to the or the river, thereby exhibiting a vision for the future, benefiting all residents, businesses and tourists. The city is selling air rights. Currently, yes, one minute. Okay, the city is currently selling air rights utilized by DOT for solely industrially used occupying every parcel under the Manhattan bridge prior to 2004. Dna is on record requesting that the DOT cease and desist from the continued misuse of these parcels, consolidate their operations and relocate to a more suitable and appropriate location for their industrial uses and storage area. The irony is that through zoning city, planning has managed to sanitize any industrial uses out of jumbos manufacturers, builders, artists, cross people and school. Yet in the heart of Dumbo, our neighborhood is segmented by D.O.T parcels that are eyesores, segmenting, North, South, East and West neighborhoods, pre-existing public transportation with boundaries made of aluminum sheaths fencing, barbed wire and astroturf I just want to because of time. I just want to say that you know the infrastructure. Conversation should have happened in the 2001 rezoning. We had more than 20 years to figure it out. The F train needs a second egress. It's long overdue. The dna and the Dac groups are on record asking that immediate consideration be given to making the station safer in the interim by moving the turnstiles further away from the entrance to cluster. That's the only entry, okay time, thanks John for talking about the subway. Okay. Thank you. Okay! Next one, the next speaker is Aaron. Komino Smith I saw Aaron's name earlier. Hey. Can you hear me damn great cool yeah? Thank you, everyone for being here also in addition to parents, also teachers that will have to deal with everything going on. So I'm a little confused by the image that ray showed earlier. I'm really surprised because I know the lot. I did some quick research, it's just over 17,000 square feet and the image was saying that if this doesn't go through, if this is not approved, that there will still be a residential building built to the 80,280 feet or so, and that image that was shown basically had the same building envelope, the with or without the office space. And what confuses me is that he said it was 156,000 square feet before the 98,000 is added. If you divide that 156 by the full lot size of about 17,000, you only get a building. That's about 9 stories tall, so I don't really understand how that would go fully all the way up. Even if you cut that in half to make a tower about the size of beacon. That would still only go about 18 stories tall. So it feels like that part of the presentation was almost more of a threat to the neighborhood of saying, hey. This building envelope is going to be the same size, no matter what you may as well approve this. Let's get some office space, so I, don't understand. I'd, really love to see an image of what this would actually look like if this is not approved and we don't have the office space because it would actually be about the size of beacon tower, which would be a totally different feel for the neighborhood and then we don't have to even have as much of a discussion about the F train and all that, but I guess that's the thing that just feels disingenuous about this process. To me, I know this is just my opinion, I'm always for more development. Bringing more people in the reality is that if there was a fire marshal giving Dumbo a capacity, we've been over capacity for what five six seven years. At this point, back in 2014, the F train had to be shut down. The York Street stop was shut down during this festival in light. That won't be a random occurrence, as we continue improving stuff like this will just get worse. It will just get we're going to have a weekly occurrence that no matter how many jobs you have local or further away the F train is going to just be dangerous and get worse and worse. Yes, it will be great to get improvements to parks and things like that, but it's only going to get worse so I guess that's what just feels a little frustrating about this project. Sorry, if I came across aggressive well in terms of the first part of your comments we can certainly provide. You can certainly provide the for the foreign that show you how it gets to 285 feet. Okay, I want to go back and forth. This is just the the testament we will we can have. During discussions and the in our meeting there will be discussions in the hearing from board members and into something that should be raised. They will raise it. Okay, next Rob Paris. The next speaker is Caroline Perry from the downtown Brooklyn partnership. She also submitted written testimony on behalf of the Ldc's President Regina Meyer thanks Rob. Can everyone hear me? Yes, I can hear you great good evening to Gordon and members of the committee. As Rob mentioned, my name is Caroline Perry and I am the real estate and planning manager at downtown Brooklyn partnership. On behalf of the partnership, I'd like to express our support for the city of New York's proposed sale of unused development rights for commercial office use at 69, Adam Street. We believe the action will facilitate the construction of new space to support continued job growth in Brooklyn in alignment with the mayor's New York works jobs plan. The building's mixed-use model will include 225 residential rental units built as a freight and approximately 99,000 square feet of commercial office space. As we heard in the presentation earlier via the transfer development rights, we believe the new commercial hub will provide opportunities for additional expansion of the district's technology and creative hub and will be designed to provide safe work environments and adapt it as needed to reflect the evolving market in coming years. We believe the proposed project will also create new jobs for brooklynites through a commitment to local and mwb hiring and know that ratsky will work with the NYC EDC to prioritize local hiring for both construction and permanent jobs, with a 50 local highlander hiring goal and will work with the NYCHA office of resident economic empowerment and sustainability and other community organizations to post open positions and recruit candidates. One minute we support that. Ratsky is also committed to mwb hiring during construction at a level equivalent to 35 percent of the total development cost. 69 Adams is a project that will enhance the greater downtown Brooklyn area, support job growth and bring additional hiring opportunities to the local community, and we encourage the committee and the board to support this proposal. Thank you. Welcome. Okay. Next up is Melissa Prober hi, I'm Melissa krover from the Dumbo action committee, although I'm speaking on my own behalf, I first want to just say thank you to the committee members who raised I, think really important questions John, Karen and Daughtry, and also that I support some of the earlier testimony, especially Doreen and Aaron. I. Think that everybody kind of gets it I submitted a letter at 4:30 I. Think I'm a jumbo resident, and one of my main concerns is that the infrastructure of Dumbo can not keep up with this project and also that there's no benefit to dunking. We've heard zero benefit to Nubo and I. Believe respectfully that the committee has been sold to build a bill of rights. There is no demand for commercial commercial, real estate in Dumbo right now, and anyone that is off that lives or works in Dumbo knows this is pre-Covid pre-code a Wall Street Journal article from 2019 talks about how a tech company grouped a handful of employees based in a co-working space to staff more than 25 of its own in the office in Dumbo, however, Mr Gupta began to notice some of the Brooklyn's limitations. He couldn't find enough local engineers to top geographical and informational system skills and ended up opening an office in Seattle when we realized we needed a lot more talent, I think we lost you're unmute now Miss Trevor you're on mute. Well, sorry, Brooklyn's, transit challenges have been a drain on productivity at camera. Mr Gupta Dumbo isn't easily accessible for some parts of New York City by public transportation, subway delays, slow buses, creating long commutes cameras. Entire office now works from home every Thursday, partly to give employees a break from their commute. They thought about doing a second day. I, wouldn't want to be where transit options are so bad that we have to that. We use as an excuse less to see each other in an office. Lackluster public transportation, dissuaded, startup, founder Jimmy Chen from renting in Brooklyn. His company propel, which was founded in 2014, builds financial products for people who use foods. Blah Dumbo had a lot of availability, but brook propel executives decided the neighborhood wasn't accessible enough via public transportation. They ended up signing a three-year lease. Now. I want to make two points real quickly, we're already at capacity even though the current commercial capac, the commercial rentals, is below they can't fill without capacity, even though they can't kill the current rentals. Okay I'll have to tax time because we still have a bunch of people, but I think you may thank you all right, Next Paris. Next one we have yes. Next is Cali Cat hi everyone, I am Calicott. I am also a member of the Dumbo action committee, but I'm speaking just as a Dumbo resident, I'm speaking in opposition to the 69 Adam Street Euler, the neighborhood is filled with underutilized commercial space. Already, the panorama development on the border of Dumbo and Brooklyn heights consists of over 600,000 square feet of class a commercial space and it is empty. There's not one tenant there. The Dumbo heights development on Prospect street is virtually empty too, with the exception of Etsy. 29J is a new commercial development that will be breaking ground in the neighborhood next spring, adding 225,000 square feet of additional commercial space to the neighborhood that simply can not be absorbed. So no there's no benefit of additional commercial space in a neighborhood that already has plenty of vacant space in it. Dot currently owns many per, and they should not be able to sell their rights. I can I yeah there you go. Okay, sorry! Let me summarize what I said above, which is that there's a massive amount of underutilized commercial space in the neighborhood already upwards, almost a million square feet that is not currently occupied. D.O.T currently owns many parcels of land throughout the neighborhood, and they should not be able to sell their air rights without giving neighborhoods something in return. Many of their parcels sit vacant and are an eyesore to the people that live work and visit. Our neighborhood I can envision a grand promenade from Prospect street, walking all the way underneath the Manhattan bridge to Brooklyn bridge park. What a grand entrance to Dumbo that would be the shoe look should not proceed unless EDC renegotiates, real public benefits for Dumbo and the people that come to live work and visit here. Thank you. Okay, any other testimony. There is Mr Gordon and in case you've been counting. We have a a couple of additional people, so if you okay, we'll take them two minutes understood. The next speaker is Suzanne Quint hi, everyone, I'm going to say hello and then turn my video off. So hopefully it can be smoother. So hello, I am a Dumbo resident and I'm a member of community Board too, and I'm speaking in opposition of this project, aligning with a lot of what has been said up to now, the proposal as it stands, Ravsky and NYC EDC benefit at the expense of Dumbo's residents and workers. There are no guaranteed give backs to the community. This project I personally, would refute the notion of jobs for the community being a benefit. I heard several times stated that hiring 50 for permanent jobs was a goal. As someone who's worked in the tech industry, I don't really understand how that goal could even be met. This isn't Wegmans. These are tech companies with very specific jobs. Looking for very specific spinning as a realistic, give back I agree with the statements earlier about the course under the Manhattan bridge alone that the DOT is has without any use for the community on them. We would ask for give backs on that land to the community. This were to go forward, although my testimony is in opposition and lastly, I would just mention that it just seems perplexing to me. You know there. May it may not be required that in 2020 in the environment, we're in not to offer affordable housing, which would be a benefit to the larger community, the Brooklyn community and so I would add that into the mix as well. Thank you, okay, Mr Gordon. The next speaker is Jeffrey Salvatore hi, everyone, I'm a double resident and a member of the Jungle Action Committee, but I'm speaking on myself, so I think you've heard from a lot of our neighbors this evening about the kind of tipping point that the neighborhood is at in terms of infrastructure and I. Think we all know that this project could go forward even without civil rights transfer. As the the earlier presentation showed, we could have a large residential building, but I think that the matter at hand is really about the public benefit. So you all, as the community board, have the opportunity to demand more from this air rights transfer than just the hopes of a payment to the city as a result of the air rights. There's a lot of DOT parcels in the neighborhood that are all under utilized they're spaces that are frankly junkyards for the Department of transportation's vehicles. Any of their you know, they're just used as junkyards and I think that the neighborhood at minimum needs to get that space back as a benefit in response to this development. Thanks for your time, you're welcome. Do we have anybody else in the lineup rob we have two more Mr Gordon and the next speaker is Lincoln wrestler Great. Thank you. So much great. Can you hear me? Okay, thanks so much yes and rob it's good to be back as a former member of the land Use committee on CB2, it's great to see you all I want to thank folks from Dak and who commented and Dorian from Dna and the dumbbell residents who have taken the time to share their concerns. I have serious concerns about this. I'm still learning more but as I understand it. There's 150k as of right development and the city is handing over a hundred thousand square feet. Development rights and all we're getting is office space and a soft commitment on local hiring. We have seen, as Cali noted, an explosion in office space in the Dumbo area as a result of the conversions of the watchtower buildings. This doesn't seem, like a community benefit that we need. It's certainly not what the Dumbo community is asking for. What we need is to address the major infrastructure issues in Dumbo, most notably the York Street. Stop I, understand that you know the revenue generated from this site is unlikely to offset the full capital needs of the York Street station, but we could put a down payment down and start negotiations with the MTA to try to get some progress and instead thank you. Instead, we're getting off the space which we're not asking for I, also think that it's dubious of the city to be proposing to be supporting a development project that has 100 market rate or luxury housing. We should be advocating for affordable housing on every site when we're when the city is contributing to to the development. Look I understand the Euler negotiation process and we're months away from a deal, and I'm sure Steve Councilmember Levin and is going to try and get us a better agreement here, but I am very disappointed that the city would come to the community with such a proposal that fails to meet our needs and hope that the city will reconsider their approach here as well and how they can do a better job and being partners with the Dumbo community. Thank you very much Carlton. Thank you. Lincoln yeah, Mr Gordon you're, still at two to go. The next speaker is Alexandria Sika go ahead, Miss seeker thanks all I want to agree and disagree with everyone else here. I want to say that I really feel like it's important for the city's economy as a whole to lean in on office, space and commercial districts that have a proven track record right now of generating economic activity. We need places that people want to come that businesses want to locate. We are seeing an uptick in activity versus Manhattan right now and we have created the kind of ecosystem that draws tech companies that draws creative companies to Brooklyn Dumbo is the office market of first choice in Brooklyn and has really driven the the development of downtown Brooklyn into a central business district again as an employment center, and we need to be investing and keeping that going strong one minute on the so I'll take my second minute to strongly agree with all of my colleagues throughout the community that we should be getting a big benefit from this, and the benefit is obvious: you're selling air rights to from a lot that is covered in fences that is keeping you know the views and vistas of the Manhattan bridge from the public, and we deserve an open space there. It's kind of the least that you could do with some of this funding. I also think that space has a huge opportunity to become potentially an alternative transportation hub right. You could see lots of CitiBikes lots of scooter parking. This is a unique opportunity and that should go hand in hand with this proposal. I have more detail in my testimony, which I'll be submitting. Thank you very much yes and before I introduce the last speaker who is evostronic. I want to mention that Bro President Adams will be holding his public hearing on this application at 6:00 p.m. On November 30th, that's a Monday, I've posted the date and time in the chat panel and as well as a link to the hearing notice and with that announcement, I turn it over to Evo. Thank you and thanks for everyone for the testimony, and also thanks to the developer for some of the document documentation they shared because it was very useful. My testimony was submitted. So I'm going to keep this short and sweet. The F train is a disaster. Everyone knows it's a disaster. The additional 870 residential units that are going up in the neighborhood are going to make it an even greater disaster. Approving this would compound the problem. Further. The Mta's budget issues mean that it was never going to be fixed nowhere in the immediate future. So you know what the hell are. We doing like it's kind of crazy and the developer knows. This is an issue it hasn't been addressed or even acknowledged anywhere in the lead-up documents. You know, there's just no effort made to fix that problem and it's kind of a slap in the face in the community, especially given that multiple people raise this issue in June. Thank you all right. Thank you appears. That is the last testimony. So I will now, since it's the last the end of the testimony and it's 7:22 p.m. I'll now close the hearing regarding 69 Adams Street, we'll now be transitioning over to our regular landmark land Use Committee meeting Karen. Just are you ready to continue? You ready? Okay, very good, okay. So at this time we are now starting up our regular landmark land, Use Committee, meeting Karen Johnson's our secretary now I know that other people will be presenting so again speak clearly and give you know spell your name. If you have to just speak, make sure you can get it and we will and Irene Janner is our culture and I am Carlton Warden at this time now we will move into discussion of the committee discussion by board member and committee members. That's just for 69 Adam street I will start with Karen. I did promise to give her the first shot since she is in the community and it's unless you want to advise what Karen this one's yours. Thank you very much. I just have to, of course, echo everyone's concerns. Just because the MTA and the city budgets are low, doesn't mean that we need to accept development. That is not going to do our community any good. Even if we were operating at you know, full capacity for commercial development. I just I, don't think that another development is going to do Dumbo any good. It will do at home because we can't get people in and out of the neighborhood, that's just the thing and so dumping another building on us is not going to help that and again I'm with Lincoln on thinking that the city is a little reckless and not even requiring any MIH on this no affordable housing, no community give backs nothing specific to the neighborhood that has to host this development so and also John Ju often reminds us. We are a community board serving the community and we've heard a lot from the community on this one which is encouraging so I would have to say a no on this one. Thank you very much. Any other committee members board members. Yes, this is John Dew and I'm going to move that we disapprove this application for all of the reasons that have been articulated very thoroughly throughout the course of this meeting. My second dessert in that second, okay, take anyone Karen all right. So the motion. Okay, we have a motion and it's been duly seconded. Is there any further discussion? Although we've had a lot of discussion, any further points to be made, it's all going yeah I'd like to continue. This is Bill Flutoy, yes, bill yeah, based on everything, that's been said: I we are a community board and the community is strongly against us. I, of course, would love to have the jobs, but you know the offset is not beneficial to the community. There's a lot of issues that are going on the subway. The fact that my feeling basically is we should have a hard pause right now, a hard pause for development in this area. There's a lot of development, a lot of vacancies, both in commercial residential and for right now, I think we should take a hard pause on any new development within this neighborhood full stop bill. This will send a message to the city that they did not keep their agreement with the community board to make every station ADA compliant. Well, that's something else. Also they've been saying: yes all along. We have to take a different stance now because saying yes, we still have not gotten any indication that there's any thought of what needs to happen for the York Street station that that's a horror show station itself would have to close down on a couple of occasions, Mr dude you're, absolutely right. We also need other infrastructure also, and it's not just a subway, there's a lot more things that we need added on before. We can think about new construction. Full stop right and I would just add to that. Just reminding us that our the district's top three priorities are affordable. Housing, schools and general infrastructure upgrades specific to the BQE specific to the subway accessibility, Et cetera. So those are our top three needs. We're not talking about those needs in this presentation, as a user as an occasional user of the York Street station, I and Karen will know this. That I, when I stop by to have a glass of wine I will come up and I'll I. Almost it's a struggle, especially during the I, would say around 5 p.m. I've struggled to come up that ramp and people are flooding down that ramp. At the same time, it is a struggle at York at the entrance, the single entrance at York Street any further. If not, will Mr Paris, you can run off the roll I. Thank you, yeah I think I should add. Yet a yes is to reject the proposal and Mr Gordon. How do you vote yes, Ms Janner, yes, Ms Ali. Were you able to join us by phone I? Guess not Mr Augustus Miss Blanc Miss Christopher? Yes, Mr Howell! Yes, could you hear me Rob Esther? For yes, I did not, but thank you for chiming in Okay Mr Sproul, yes, Mr Washington, yes, Mr! Do yes, Fennoy, yes, Mr Scala were you able to join us? Is he still in the committee? He is still on the committee. Yes, thank you Mr Paris Mr. This is now unmuted, Mr Augustus. How do you vote I will come back to you, miss Johnson and Miss Danton? Yes and Mr Augustus. We can't hear you so hold up one finger for yes, two fingers for no three fingers for I abstain or, if you're going to mute yourself, you can communicate orally. Still can't hear you, sir, how about calling you bro? Maybe he could call your phone number ask him to put it in the chat technology can't live with it can't live without it. I think we have a since you asked his calling in would actually not be compliant with the New York State open meetings law, but he seemed he seems he had one finger okay and that means they're coming by see so Mr Gordon. The the vote is unanimous. I, don't have the count I'll provide that later, but unanimously in favor of the motion to recommend disapproval. Thank you very much. Thank you to all the presenters and people and participants. Now we're going to move on to the Landmark Preservation Commission application for 18 Willoughby Avenue, it's in fourth green historic district. So the presenters for 18 Willoughby Avenue get ready to go on come online. The application is to replace existing one over one windows at the front facade with two over two windows and the existing openings and at the rear facade to install new windows and doors in the existing and modify and modified openings, removing what I have here, some existing brick and installing new brick relocating doors at the parlor and second floors and installing a new door at the third floor, applicant anticipates LPC staff approval for what I have here for ironwork notice, a investigation of replacing a rear, facade, okay, 18 Willoughby go ahead and give us your name good evening to the committee and the rest of the community who's attending. My name is Ben Bischoff, I'm the applicant of record and architect for the project. Thank you for actually a very thorough summary of what we're about to present. But, as you had mentioned there, we are working on a four-story landmark Townhouse built in 1864 and the italianate style common to the neighborhood. The property has an existing two-story rear edition that was constructed sometime between 1904 and 1915 per the Sanborn Fire insurance maps. We've provided diagrammatic analysis up in the top left hand corner of this sheet. The proposal is to Consert convert the existing four-family home into a two-family home. The scope of work, as you've already summarized include some interior renovation, replacement of windows and minor restoration on the front facade, which has already been restored, approved by landmarks at the staff level, as well as modifications to the rear facade, which is visible, as you can see, on our next sheet, l001 in more detail which shows the views, because it's on the corner and the adjacent property has a small, is smaller in size. There is partial visibility, not direct visibility of the rear facade, as you can see in the bottom three photos on this sheet. The other photos on the top of this sheet show the visibility of the front facade to set up the context for some minor roof improvements which are not visible from any public thoroughfare on sheet l002. Our next sheet you'll see that we are adding a rooftop HVAC condenser, which is damaged and a small goose neck for kitchen exhaust, but as seen by our diagrammatic drawings. Here, none of these will be visible from any public thoroughfare. They'll be set back and positioned on the roof. Accordingly, our next sheet, drawing l003, articulates in better detail the existing and proposed modifications to the rear facade, which will be presented for both your consideration and for consideration at a public hearing with the landmarks Preservation Commission the bottom right hand, corner image shows the existing rear facade in its current condition and the lack of any kind of historic, material or fabric. On this edition, it's not clear at all when the 1904 to 1915 extension was modified, but there is little rhyme or organization to the window layout on those lower two floors. The upper two floors at the third and fourth story have had some minor modifications over the years to add change, windows into doors and access, roofs and fire escapes, but does maintain the existing three window. Historic opening on each. The third and fourth floors. Excuse me second and third floors. Our rendering, in the top right hand, corner shows our proposal to make alterations to the basement and first floor level to kind of clean up and better organize the organization of the window and masonry openings and on the second and third floor where we will be adjusting and changing some of the windows into doors. The photographs on the left hand, side of the page show a variety of mechanical, hot tub, cabling and wiring, and that is kind of run haphazardly onto this facade that we will be removing all windows on both the front and rear facade will be in a two over two style, as mandated by the LPC row house manual with italianate brick molds they'll be constructed of wood and painted dark in a color from Benjamin Moore called midnight just to clarify. If you're like look like the pinkish I, guess, that's the that's. What it's going to look like aft, you know with the work has been done. The proposed work are you referring to our rendering in the operation, I'm looking at the yeah? That's what it's going to look like. Yes, that is what it's going to look like. Yes, all right, new windows and everything else yep go ahead. We can move forward to the next sheet. Please Christina Front elevation, showing the existing condition on the left and the approved at staff level, replacement of historic wood windows on the right next sheet. Please. These are two drawings showing the existing condition on the left and the proposed modifications on the right with the replacement of all of the existing windows with new wood, two over two windows or french doors, where appropriate. As you can see on the upper two floors, we are maintaining the three historic window openings and lowering the sill on the east side of the second floor and the east side, which is on the left-hand side of the drawing here of the third floor, to allow them to become doors which access either the roof deck or the fire escape and replacing the companion windows with new windows on each of those floors. And then the modifications at the basement and first floor level where we are replacing an existing set of sliding doors and triple windows at the basement, with a pair of french doors and a pair of windows and changing out the single door and single window at the first floor for a single door and a triple casement window. At the first floor, as also mentioned from the photos, there are lots of notes here about mechanical electrical and various other equipment. That's being taken off the facade to clean it up next sheets, please and as required by LPC, the following sheets, which we won't go through in great detail. Unless there are questions about these are the detailed window drawings to show the existing conditions being replaced with new wood units to match the historic conditions in all shapes and profiles and dimensions, and so thank you. That concludes our presentation of the project and we're available for any questions. Okay, thank you. Did you show the picture of how your extension lines up with the other extensions on the block in the backyard and we're seeing that yeah? We could if we go to some of the earlier sheets, where we have the site plans and some of the photos, the extension is, that's probably the best one here really small. You don't have anything that we can see. That's bigger I mean I can't. Even here we go okay, yeah. We are not making any modifications to the size or dimension of the extensions. It's it's only changes to the window configurations. That's what I thought it was that the this was the uncaught, the original extension, but this was an old extension that was placed and you're not making any changes to it. No, there is no there's no zoning or yeah or expansion to the building in this application. Okay, no zoning changes. Carlton I'd like to make sure yes, Judy I'd like to move that the committee approves that I think the symmetry in the windows is lovely, I, think it's a very nice proposal. I think we should approve it. One second I said John Do seconds it all right we're going to let it approval in a second any further discussion. Oh yes, okay, one time to get up to the roof deck is that ladder the only way you got to do a Bruce Willis, or is there an internal way to get up to that room? There is an internal stair with a roof access ladder from the interior, but to to be clear, there is no deck on the roof of the building. Okay, there is a roof, but there is no deck on the roof. It's just for service. Is that correct, Ben, the access stair to the roof? Yes, it's just the code required access stair to bill I think you had something: oh yes, the neighbors. Let's get! Let me give this one to bill and then I'll get back to you John. Thank you. You anticipated the receiving LPC staff approval on the ironwork in the back. Are you still asking us to approve it? Also? No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. I'm the entirety of the rear is up for review at the public hearing. I think that may have been a misstatement in the initial summary. The LPC has approved the front which they can do at staff level. Okay, but the iron work in the back are. We is existing. Also if we go to the photos of that, you said you anticipate LPC approval on that. So yes, because we're not making any significant modifications to it, they have indicated that they are very likely to approve it. Okay, I just want clarification that we're not proving that you anticipate approval from LPC. Yes, thank you. Hey John, yeah back to you, I just thought. Well, I asked about the neighbors. We always ask if the native neighbors have been notified, that you're going to be making those improvements and I think it's a very handsome upgrade neighbors. Thank you. The neighbors would be notified as the part of any DOB requirements to begin construct construction project with the appropriate 10-day notification process. Mr do I believe that I neglected to ask this applicant for for notification of the neighbors. So that's on me not on the on the architects. Okay, well, a neighborly thing to do I think as a practice. I would hope all of our applicants do that without not. You know not waiting till the required 10-day notification but introduce themselves to the existing neighbors and explain what they're doing yes, we will. That is good advice, and we will certainly do that. We understand that it not always be comfortable to live next to construction site and we, you know, take it upon ourselves to make it as inform them and be as communicative as we can good. There's, no further question or comments or questions all right, we'll and we have in motion and some second okay, Miss Paris is due to roll call I favor the application. So you can check me off. Okay, miss Janner I'll, come back to Miss Janner Miss Ali. Were you able to join us Augustus? Are you able to unmute and express a vote orally? Miss blunt approved? Yes, thank you. Miss Karstarfin, yes, Mr Howell, yes, Mr Sproul, Mr Washington! Yes, thank you. Mr! Do yes, Mr Fennoy, yes, Ms Ginsburg, Irene Janner is yes. Thank you Janner Miss Ginsberg. Are you able to there? We go sorry. I'm yes, Ms Johnson, Miss Stanton is the maker of the motion. I think we can guess, but please tell me yes and Mr Augustus. Are you present and able to okay? The the motion carries unanimously 11 in favor, not opposed no abstentions, Mr Augustus say no vote. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. Okay. Next now we're going to the shoreline, and this is the zoning for coastal flood resiliency, which is n two one: zero, nine five and one. Let's leave off the left, number Z R Y- and this is it's a. We had a presentation about who, a year or two ago, from the the from the city planning which gave us basically what they're trying to do is to protect the shoreline short communities, especially like Dumbo. We know Dumbo flooded from the last hurricane and they're. Looking to try to see make changes in zoning and planning so that won't happen again. We have presenters Amirita Mashi, a senior urban designer at the Brooklyn office of Planning Katie were to see Ferrara the planning team from over in the Staten Island Office and Kate, with a cave, Ricardo, resiliency, planner and also with the Department of City planning. So whatever order or whoever wants to start off, go right ahead. Thank you so much for the introduction good evening. Everyone thank you for giving us the opportunity to present tonight. I'll just give Kate a second to share her screen. It looks like I. Don't have share access is their way to re-grant that positive okay. Can the office pick up on that we'll have to help you out there we go. Thank you. So my name is Amrita Mahesh, I'm an urban designer at the Department of City planning's Brooklyn office, and I'm also the liaison to Community Board too I'm here with Kate Richard who's sharing her screen at the moment, who's a resiliency planner in the Brooklyn office as well. We're here tonight to provide an overview of zoning for coastal flood resiliency, which proposes updates to the zoning resolutions, Article 6, chapter 4 and other related sections. I'm going to share a summary of the proposal and highlight certain provisions of what is a very detailed text. Amendment I'd be happy to answer questions and also point you to materials that describe the project in greater detail following this presentation. The proposal next slide. The proposal builds on zoning text, amendments that were put in place shortly after Hurricane Sandy to help coastal neighborhoods recover and rebuild quickly, but those running flexibilities which were passed as temporary emergency measures are beginning to expire, and the department of City planning has conducted many years of research and outreach over the past several years, which have uncovered several issues that communities are still facing, and the proposal is now seeking to make many of these provisions added after sandy permanent and also expand on them. So communities can have greater flexibility for adaptation. Ultimately, zoning for coastal flood resiliency will help those living and working in the flood plain to reduce damage from future coastal storms be resilient in the long term by accounting for future risks and potentially help save on flood insurance costs. It would also assist with the recovery from future disasters, including the present situation, with the Covid-19 pandemic. Next slide after engaging with communities in the floodplain on a wide set of issues, we were able to establish four overarching goals that help us move from sandy recovery to a longer term. Resiliency strategy next slide goal. One speaks to the applicability of the proposed regulations. It's important to note here that these regulations are optional and would be facilitating buildings to either meet or even exceed flood resilient construction standards set forth by FEMA and enforced by the city's building code in Appendix G next slide. Zcfr would expand the applicability of the current text to a broader set of buildings that are also exposed to flooding in the event of coastal storms by allowing any lot that's located within both the one percent and the point, two percent annual chance flood lanes to have access to the proposed special rules that help enable resiliency at the building scale. The point two percent flood plain serves as a proxy for the higher end projections of the 2050s one percent annual chance floodplain, allowing the city to advance a resiliency in the longer term, as it would also allow property owners to proactively undertake resiliency improvements, even if it's not required by the building code next slide. The second goal is to support long-term resilient design of all building types by offering flexibility in the zoning framework in Cd2, the one percent annual chance or high-risk floodplain includes around 240 buildings and the 0.2 annual chance or moderate risk. Floodplain includes over 400 buildings, and they comprise a variety of building typologies with a wide range of uses. So it's really critical that we provide enough flexibility in zoning to address all of these built conditions. Next slide, starting with the building envelope, these rules would allow building owners to physically elevate habitable spaces and other building support features above expected, flood elevations by offering more flexibility with building height yards and floor areas, so buildings can be made resilient without having to choose between retaining usable floor area or making their homes resilient next slide regarding ground floors. This set of rules would promote good, long-term resilient design of buildings and how they meet the sidewalk through floor area exemptions. The proposed rules would encourage internal access and active users to be kept at the sidewalk level to the extent possible for communities in the flood plain to continue to be vibrant and accessible next slide. The current rules allow ground floors and existing buildings that are wet flood proofed to be exempt from floor area. This helps buildings become resilient again without having property owners to choose between losing a portion of their buildings, and the Cfr would allow this exemption to apply to both existing and new buildings to apply the allowance more consistently and support new buildings, also adapting to climate change next slide. The proposal would also modify existing dry flood proofing allowances to only allow the first 30 feet of a space that is dry floor, proof to be exempt from floor area, provided that the space is used for non-residential uses complies with certain design requirements such as minimum transparency and provides internal clearance efficient internal clearance. This would help encourage active users to be kept closer to the sidewalk level to promote safe and lively pedestrian environments, while also making sure that buildings are not out of scale next slide. As a reminder, all of these allowances can only be used if buildings fully meet Appendix G to ensure that buildings meet the full resiliency standards and, in addition to that, to ensure that resilient buildings contribute to their surroundings, we would also be mandating a set of streetscape requirements so that ground floors, ground floors of elevated and resilient buildings are improved next slide goal three is to allow for adaptation over time through partial resiliency strategies. We know that it's always it's not always practical or feasible to fully retrofit or elevate a building or dry flood proof it, and to address this, we think there should be enough flexibility in zoning to allow for partial resiliency strategies. Next slide. We learned that raising mechanical equipment is often the first and most cost effective step to make buildings more resilient, so the proposal would enable more options for the placement of mechanical equipment above the flood level, either on rooftops or in a separate structure, for example in tower in the park or campus style development. Next slide goal. Four is to facilitate future storm recovery by removing regulatory obstacles, rules that assist with reconstruction of damaged buildings or after a future storm or other type of emergency should be readily accessible to expedite the city's response and recovery. So this goal really relates to rules that would, for the most part, apply on a city-wide level, not just within the flood plain next slide. Sandy showed us that storm's effects can go beyond the floodplain, especially across our energy grid, so this proposal would also allow power systems, including generators, solar energy systems, fuel cells, batteries and other energy storage devices to be considered permitted obstructions in open areas across all zoning districts to facilitate their installation next slide. In addition to ensure that all areas of the city are can easily provide ADA access, the proposal would classify both ramps and lifts as permitted obstructions in all required open areas to facilitate accessible designs. Next slide, Sandy also showed us that a lengthy process to update zoning regulations can present obstacles to the necessarily fast-paced disaster response, so the proposal would include rules that could be made available to facilitate the recovery process from future disasters, some of which could be implemented now to help address the Covid-19 pandemic and its associated economic impacts. The first one would give property owners who hold special permits or authorizations an additional term, so they can complete their original plan for construction on a longer timeline. The second one would support businesses that do not conform with zoning use regulations by allowing them more than two years to return to operation. So the current limit of this continuance is two years, so this would extend that period next slide now in terms of next steps, this citywide text amendment is being referred out to all 59 community boards, borough presidents and to the city council as part of the Euler process. Community boards are being asked to submit their recommendations to the city planning commission by December 28 2020. more information about the project, including an annotated version of the proposed zoning text, can be found at the DCP project webpage, which is noted on the bottom of this slide. Nyc.Gov Zcfr. Thank you for allowing the time for this important update. I'd, be happy to take any questions so make sure you are asking for approval of your what you've come up with so far at this time. That's right! You have until December 28th to submit your recommendation. Do you want our recommendation now? That's up to you. We'd refer to you on that community boards do have until the end of December to follow. The committee will need to make a recommendation tonight so that the full board can vote at the December general meeting and that's what means okay, so we will need a emotion or and we'll have content, and also we have comments from our community members questions. First, okay, yeah questions: this is flood water resiliency. That applies essentially to our border areas. That's a question like the Brooklyn navy yard and the Brooklyn bridge park. Does this apply there in any way? That's right. So this applies in the one percent annual chance, floodplain and the point two percent annual chance, floodplain Kate. If you flip to the next slide, we do have a link to this set of applicability maps for community district. Two we can share those with you and you'll be able to take a closer look of the exact geographies where this applies. Maybe if you had specified when you were making your presentation, what we should be considering as a community board would be helpful. Apologies for that not being clear Karen that we don't even have in our district. So since this is a city-wide text amendment sorry, I'm trying to understand how this applies to us and I wanted to further ask. If you made this presentation to the Brooklyn navy yard and to Brooklyn bridge park, we haven't presented to specific entities, not this particular version, but during the outreach process over the last several years, we have engaged with multiple stakeholders, I can't say for sure. If the Navy Art was one of them, I can check and get back to you, but we have engaged with residents, businesses and other local entities across the city's entire flood plain well John. It also applies to us again because I'm focusing on Dumbo, because Dumbo is basically a coastal community and again we it they did get flooded in from the last hurricane. So yes, this. These proposals do affect our community board and residents, but the only now I guess. The problem that you have is that most of the I guess presentation is really for smaller houses along shoreline communities throughout the five boroughs, and but in this instance we have a shoreline community. That's let's say it's: multiple dwellings, bigger office type commercial buildings and it does apply to us as well. So it's important that the, but the proposal doesn't face that we have to consider the Dumbo place. I didn't include that initially, how could we make recommendations unless we hear from the Dumbo folks? Well, that's why I have Karen here Karen? What are you, what does Karen? What does gumbo feel about I mean anything that can help us be resilient is great, but the presentation is so kind of it's not put in lay people's terms. I have no idea how it would actually apply to buildings in Dumbo, because you haven't given us any kind of way to understand that, but again I mean I'm sure the text amendment is only meant to do good, so I'm going to have to go with that and say that it's probably a good thing. Apologies for not including examples that may be specific to Cd2. We can certainly follow up with that information, but I do want to clarify that the text amendment does apply to those types of typologies as well, whether it's a loft building or a multi-family building. It does have provisions that apply to a whole range of building typologies and in this presentation, there's the the last slide includes a number of links to resources that kind of breaks it down based on different geographies tonight. We can't do links right now, because we have to vote right now. So apologies because we tried to kind of condense it and highlight a couple of key provisions. We may have left out certain things we'll. We can certainly follow up if that's helpful, Mr Gordon, if I could make a few comments. Yes and one of them is in defense of the Department of City planning. This is normally a 30-minute 20 to 30, minute presentation and the board and Committee leadership asked city planning to make this a 10 minute presentation. So if there are things that have been left out, they've been left out at the request of board leadership. The other comment that's related to that is, you know this material was provided to the committee in advance. If they didn't have the chance to look at it, then they did not, but the opportunity was there and then the last comment has to do with geography, which is that you know our waterfront areas. Dumbo and the Navy yard are obvious ones. Almost the entire Navy yard flooded during Sandy and when I say flooded, I mean several feet, not several inches, but even in a major storm. There's a there's: the potential for flooding in community district, two in Borum Hill, when when a surge comes up the Gowanus canal and and into that neighborhood, which is somewhat low lying. So there are multiple neighborhoods in community district 2, for which the the zoning text amendment is applicable and even with Brooklyn bridge park, we have that new housing developments there and that could be affected as well. So again we have housing and buildings along. You know community board to the shoreline that need protection in case of another. You know huge storm that could happen. That's right, many of the more recent one, the time exactly to approve what does the approval entail? What are we voting on it's a zoning text, amendment, which means all future projects will be subject in these areas, will be subject to these recommendations. Is that right, Enrique? It's a zoning text amendment, but it's entirely optional provisions, so these are provisions that buildings in the floodplain can choose to use if they want to make certain resiliency improvements. That's right and what's all that's required- is the existing appendix g of the building code, which is the portion of the building code that has to do with flood resilient construction. So that's not that's, not changing. That's what's required today and would be required with the new zoning regulations. These just make it make these zoning flexibilities available to more people right. So two points, one is that it's optional that everybody has to comply with the building code? That's not for discussion right now right what the text is providing is flexibility around how you one might make their make your building more resilient. That's right! I'm assuming this can result in increased heights. I mean the pier House is a good example where 30 feet were stacked on to the top of that building, to put the mechanicals on the roof height, flexibility, sorry, flexibility and height is definitely something that is included as part of this text amendment. What we have learned is that, in order to make resiliency improvements, additional height is incredibly important. Oftentimes people lose usable floor space when they have to meet a flood resilient construction standards, so this tends to descend a disincentivized, resiliency improvement and we're trying to avoid that by allowing people to make their buildings more resilient, in other words, higher make their abilities taller not necessarily significantly taller. In some cases. That's right. One of the other provisions that America mentioned was that these partial resilience strategies. So if, instead of elevating an entire home, someone might have the option to undertake other strategies, one or two at a time. So that might not look like elevation that might look like like relocating the mechanical equipment. Like you just asked about or other strategies that are less major construction exactly it could be an additional three or four feet. Okay, given what we have in this district, where the small homes that you that you're, mostly dealing with, are not going to be built along this shoreline. Anything on anything that's coming up along the shoreline here in CB2 is going to be larger again, multiple dwellings, larger commercial spaces, and that means that it will be additional floors will be added that the idea of the old, your mechanicals in the basement just won't work in this kind of environment and that it will have the mechanicals left to be put upstairs and it'll add a couple of floors to a anything, that's being constructed in that area. Okay, hi! This is bill. Clinton hi, bill, yeah I have a couple questions in general. You can help me out here now. As far as the resiliency plan is concerned, the time frame that people have to actually accommodate the conditions that you're asking them to do. What is that time frame? So none of these are requirements. It's really people seeking to implement resiliency strategies. They have the option to use these regulations which provides additional flexibility. So none of this is a requirement. The building code and FEMA regulations are the baseline requirements that apply the reason why I asked that question is I'm wondering how it affects flood insurance federal flood insurance? If an individual does not do the resiliency work and they're in a flood zone and they get flooded? Okay? How does that affect their federal insurance? Do? Is that null and void it, or is that still in place, so they have higher rates of flood insurance when they haven't made resilient improvements, which is another reason why we have these flexible regulations, because by making these improvements, people can seek lower flood insurance rates. So, let's say, for instance, how do you notify those individuals who are in a flood zone that they have to do these resiliency modifications? So anyone with a federally backed mortgage is required to have flood insurance, those that do not have a mortgage. There are a number of city and state initiatives and outreach programs that try to help people understand the implications and invest in blood insurance. One thing that I can point to is a website called floodhelpnewyork.org, which includes a lot of information and resources for property owners to learn more about their property, specific conditions and the options that are available to them. Now, if I want to actually do this, you know the remediation or the resiliency that I want to do, but I don't have the funds to do it. How does that affect me? Also? Is there anything in the text amendment that affects those individuals, so the text amendment doesn't necessarily have any financial resources or anything like that. However, the city has programs that could potentially fund this. One thing that comes to mind is Hpd's home fix program which offers low income loans for improvement. So there are other resources, and the city is constantly advocating for additional funding for grants and such to enable property owners to invest in these types of improvements. Okay and this text amendment, does it restart the clock or is the clock still the same? This is a non-euler text, amendment it's being referred out in a similar timeline as Euler just for the sake of more opportunities for the stakeholders to weigh in I'm sorry, let me clarify that, let's say, for instance, you're asked to do resiliency remediation two years ago. Okay, with this now restart your clock. This doesn't this isn't associated with any set timeline. If there are certain criteria where property owners are required to make these improvements, for example, new construction is subject to building code and FEMA requirements and that exists today. These regulations are essentially an update to existing provisions in the zoning, and these are all optional provisions. So the criteria that controls properties and flood zones today isn't changing. This just provides additional flexibility for people to go through with these measures and that's in both zones Zone one and zone two, the new zone that you're doing outreach to so the one percent annual chance flood plain is where these regulations apply today. So we're expanding through this proposal, we're proposing to expand it to the point two percent chance flood zone as well, but again as optional provisions. Okay, thank you. I. Just want to clarification in those items appreciate it. This is Eric one last question: here's this Eric's bro I, have a question I recall during Sandy and during some other storms that properties in New Jersey could not get flood insurance because the insurance companies refused to provide it because it was too much of a risk would prop. Would that would suck? Would such a situation happen in these flood zones that we have in New York City, so these provisions essentially help property owners mitigate this risk and make their homes less vulnerable, and that could potentially mean they are more insurable. I can't speak for the insurance aspect, but there is that correlation where, when people do make investments in making the home more resistant to flooding, the rates come down and the property is more easily be able to be insured. Okay, do you have anything to add to that answer? I? Don't, but I can we can look into it and share more details if you'd like? Thank you. Okay, if there is nothing further, I am going to move to make a that. The committee approve the work of the Department of City planning for the zoning for coastal flooding, resiliency. Okay, any further, nothing further Rob Paris, let's read off the the additional outreach. Can we get those folks from what whatever areas this applies to send comments directly in to city planning into your office? We don't need to be intermediary in this is too confusing. We are always working with our engagement team to understand people's needs and we can certainly communicate this to our team. That's working on this particular project and see how we can collect this feedback, but the formal feedback from Cd2 would have to be through the community board. Okay, thank you. Well, we're also welcome. There will be a Cpc public hearing for this most likely in January, and so any groups or individuals who would like can submit written testimony or speak. Then that's right. Thank you all right, Rob Paris! We have a roll call Mr Gordon. How do you vote? Yes, Ms Janner? Yes, thank you! Ms Ali. Were you absolutely? No, that's unfortunate Mr Augustus. Have you returned Miss Brown? Yes, thank you. Miss car Starfin, yes, Mr howls! Yes, Mr Sproul, Mr Washington, yes, Mr Dew, I'm going to abstain, Mr Fennoy, yes, Ms, Ginsburg, yes, Ms, Johnson, Miss, Stanton Judy! Are you with us? I, see you or something whatever we're going to Judy's on yeah. I'm sorry, I'm stating too, I'm not completely clear on what it what what's happening, yeah but yep you got ta, do the homework one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine ten in favor, two abstentions. Nobody opposed all right! Thank you! So much. Thank you. Next. We just want to get a approval of the October minutes. Karen did a great job. Are there any objections to the minutes? Anything in the minutes that have to be added all right. Thank you all right, all in favor, I guess we're all in favor. Thank you all right. Next is the chairs report I receive well hey. This is what I'm going to do with the chairs report. I received a no a request from John Dew concerning 130 Saint, Felix Street, which is not unfounded at this time, but he sent an article. I wasn't able to read the article, however I, just what I want to do with it is this I want to ask the board office if they've received any further communications or applications or anything from the Brooklyn music school and the developer are regarding how they want to proceed or on how they will proceed with 130 Saint Felix, Street, Mr, Paris I, don't know if you have anything on that or where we're still in limbo on that they have filed their application. My understanding is that they probably not be certified until the second quarter of 2021 at the earliest. Your applications, their applications, yeah I, submitted the request to discuss this, not just because of the application, although that's a part of it. The issue is that the executive committee made an approval for this landmarks without any input from the Landmarks committee members. So the issues that were important for the community were not included because they were not discussed at the meeting. This was done in June during the pandemic and it was an executive committee meeting which did not include any landmark members. It is online, it is on YouTube, so we can circulate that particular link, but the committee did not hear from the community and did an approval on this 24-storey. Building that Landmarks Commission recommended one floor be taken off the implications of that building are in some ways the same as the implications of the building that we just denied in Dumbo, because we did not hear from the community is not in favor of this 24-story building being built. It would with shadows, and if you look at the presentation, the presenter gave you the angles that looked cute and didn't give the shadows that will result on Saint Felix's place for that block, which has gone through heck in the last 20 years of being totally revamped because the collapsed. So this is a really interesting block and the details that are associated with that particular block were not discussed. We didn't hear from the community and it was Mr Gordon. We had the same conversation last month. Yes, no, he did. Yes, I'm giving. You know I s if you can watch the YouTube video say the same thing. I said last month: yes, testimony from the committee was provided to the executive committee said this on camera last month. I've said this in email, I, don't know how many times, and yet the accusation keeps being made. It's not true. It's just not true. Now you can have a disagreement with how the meeting was conducted and there have been people who have expressed that opinion, but to keep saying that no testimony was accepted from the community and that no one on the executive committee heard that people in the community did not like this building is not true. That's not what I'm saying the Landmarks Committee. We do this as a committee and those of us on the committee are able to contribute at that particular meeting John. We will get it's now going to be coming to our committee at some point and we'll have that discussion. So I'm finishing up my chairs with that was it gave you time for my chairs report to deal with that now, I want to move on to Mr Gordon. We seem to have lost your audio Mr Gordon. Can you hear us Irene? Do you want to take over who's the co-chair I'm here? Do you hear me yeah I, don't know what Mr Gordon was going to say. This was the chair's report and I do not know what his plans were. We've done the approval for the minutes. We have to wait on Mr Jordan's Mr Gordon's signal keeps coming in and Out Carlton. If you can hear my voice, I recommend turning your video feed off, because it appears that your audio is trying to connect unfortunate timing right as I say. I do not know what the chairperson was going to report on. So at this point I'm going to move to I. Remember the business yeah. I'm sorry I overlooked the correction that I need to make to the October minutes. Okay, the first LPC application item 81 pure pond35, love lane, the presenter on that was not mark Fabrice. It was Michael, Ingrid, okay, Karen! You want to you note that mine saying that one more time Michael Ingwy the architect, was the presenter on the first LPC application 81 per panel 35 leveling that was Michael Ingley, not Mark, Favres Fabry. Are there any other corrections for the minutes? Okay, again, I do not know what Mr Gordon was planning for his chairs report, so I'm moving on to other business. Does any committee or board member have any other business for this committee hearing none I'll call for a motion to adjourn Irene. Yes, I do have an item for other business. Oh okay, we have a number of projects that are outstanding in our district and we usually review them once a year. We don't have a mechanism for any follow-up throughout the course of the year. That is routine now, maybe that's part of what the back office is working on, but this is a request that I have been talking about for a long period of time. We have lots of projects, we don't actually track them in an organized way. We talk about them when they come up, but we don't actually revisit them and we don't have to actually talk about them. We just got to get an update to see why there is or is not movement on any particular project. For example, the Tillery Street project, I think is done. It's finally done after 10 or 15 years, but we don't actually know formally. That project is officially done, so we should just be on top of all the projects that are outstanding in our community, particularly the ones that are in progress or about to start, but, more importantly, because they're all important the ones that we would like to get started that we think in the pipeline. But we don't know where they are in the pipeline and, for example, we had a long discussion about the York Street train station. Today, that's been on the calendar for 20 years at this point, and we know nothing about it so now we're dealing with applications that are not appropriately addressed, because there are other issues that have not been taken care of. So we need to actually get a little bit more formal contact and updates on all of the projects in the district. It's a spreadsheet and columns that talk about the status of the project. I would suggest, as a point of reference, that Brad Lander's office did this for all the all his community district capital projects that we could it's just in Excel and it tracks everything where it is and what the status is Mr Paris. Do you have any comments on that? Mr Paris is no longer on the call, but I'm taking notes furiously and Daughtry I just wanted to capture that you're, suggesting something similar to the Excel Spreadsheet that Brad Levin keeps Brad Lander, yep Redlander, sorry Daughtry, where does he get the information from is so I think this is in regards to the participatory budgeting projects that happen in his district. His office tracks exactly the status of each of those, so that's they get the money for the project and then they track how the progress is going. I'll try to dig up, I haven't looked at it lately, but I will try to take it up and send it around. Yeah it'd be interesting where he gets the source information from sure. Thank you and I'll follow up with with Mr Paris in the office. I. Don't think we're talking about participating. We're talking something much larger, though than participatory budgeting I, think we're talking about all these Euler's and BSA, and all these things that we have had through the years and some of them. We don't know if they're built being built or what's happening with them. We probably need more stuff, stop talking about anything capital in community district 2, specifically the projects that come before the community board that we think are approved and are in some status. We never know where it's at and frankly, I just heard the comment about Councilmember lander we are I, don't know that we're checking up on the status of where we are in all of these projects. I can tell you that the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the wheels tweaking we ain't, getting greased okay I will bring. This up was that the tracker you were referring to excuse me actually was that the tracker you were referring to yeah exactly so and I would say in order to not overwhelm us that maybe we start now looking forward and then work backwards, as we can to John's point about how we've been talking about certain projects. For years it's but John, if you're willing to work with me on that, I will work with you and we can start would love to okay. Thank you. Is there any other business? Okay, now I will ask for a motion to adjourn I'll, throw it up there, one more time. Well, I heard what Judy yeah I'm going to adjourn, but could somebody I don't have Carlton's phone number, but I'm worried about him. He disappeared all of a sudden from this committee meeting. Could somebody call and check on him he probably just lost his Wi-Fi. Well, all right, it looks like he lost his Wi-Fi. He slowly drifted away. I'm sure he's okay, Miss Stanton. It did look like a technical error on this end. Oh good, okay, yeah, because if something happened, we're done now right, yes, okay, so we can turn off the recording okay motion to adjourn.
