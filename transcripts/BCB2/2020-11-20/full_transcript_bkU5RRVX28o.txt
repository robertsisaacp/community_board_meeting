I really appreciate it, and so thank you, everybody, and for inviting cases to speak to you all this afternoon about the work that we do in terms of working in Brooklyn and also and with Brooklyn residents. Cases is an agency that's been around since the 1960s and has a history of providing alternatives to incarceration services and in the last 20 years and services that are also focused on and people that have mental illness who become involved in the criminal legal system, and I've worked at cases for 21 years. I'm talking to you from our downtown Brooklyn office, which is I'm located on Lawrence Street, and this evening, I'm just going to go through the range of services that we have to serve Brooklyn residents that are involved in the criminal legal system, how we deliver those services, I'm looking forward to taking and questions and in terms of our services. I just want to frame who we know becomes involved in the criminal legal system in New, York City, and we know that is generally people of color black people, latinx people, both youth, and there are other populations that are over represented as well, and that includes people who have substance use disorders we find are over represented. That's true of New York City, that's true across the country in the United States, and also people with mental illnesses. Another behavioral health public health need are also over represented in our criminal legal system. We find them in our jails we find them routinely within our courtrooms and people who are also homeless are over-represented in the criminal legal system in New, York, City and other populations that are also over-represented include members of the community and who are gentle, who are transgender people we find are over-represented in the criminal legal system, particularly black, transgender and latinx transgender folks, and also folks, that have medical conditions we find are over represented. There's a high rates of folks who have HIV infection find themselves in the criminal legal system as well as folks who have other medical conditions and, as you would know, as well, people that are homeless. So there's a range of folks who find themselves in the criminal legal system, and we see this as national trend, a state trend and also in New, York, City and also in Brooklyn and I. Think one of the common theme it doesn't matter if folks are homeless, that black people are just significantly overrepresented in the criminal legal system. So, as I talk about our services, you know, one of the themes is that we are trying to disrupt the involvement of folks in the criminal legal system and really address some of the social problems that people face in community, where we believe through effective services, that there is community safety for everybody you know and which is just an important mission and value that we have here at cases. So I'm going to start with our youth programs and I'm going to start by describing alternatives to incarceration programs. So, just in terms of understanding what is an alternative to incarceration program, it's a program that is set up to intercept the flow of people to either jail or to state prison, and so in New, York, City, New, York state. Sometimes, people are arrested on low-level crimes called misdemeanors and they might be at risk of receiving a jail sentence in Rikers island other times. People may be arrested on more serious crimes called felonies and they could be at risk of and having that crime adjudicated and with the sentence of imprisonment, and we know that our prisons in New, York state are run by our state agency, and so cases runs an alternative to incarceration program for youth and young adults. It's called raw and it stands for reframing opportunities, alternatives and resilience, and it serves young people who are aged 16 to 27. The focus of the program is once someone is under arrest. If they've been bailed out in community or if they're in Rikers island, we have staff that are able to go screen and assess folks, and then we have a range of very comprehensive services. You know, and I'm just going to give some some highlights, and so for youth and young adults. We really do focus in on education services. A lot of the youth and young adults that we serve, who are Brooklyn residents, have either dropped out of school or under credited or not involved in school or currently would not be identified as folks who, the Department of education would be trying to get electronic devices for because they're not connected to education, although there should be so. For the last. I've been at cases for 21 years preceding me. Cases has always ensured in its youth services that we always have on-site education services. So we always have teachers as part of our package for alternatives to incarceration services for you as re, as well as really robust services around education and employment, and one of the things that we also want to address is the whole needs of the youth, and so, as I've mentioned before, we see really high rates of mental illness and substance use and also really significant trauma. I'm sure folks are aware that this is just true of all, just as impacted folks that there are just really high rates at which young people and young adults have experienced adverse childhood experiences. And then these traumatic experiences are really a mediating factor for, and youth and young adults becoming involved in the criminal legal system. So we always make sure that we have social workers and other staff members who are able to intervene and support folks to get connected to the services that they need, particularly if they have serious mental health needs and serious substance. Use disorders and part of our reframing in all. Our alternatives to incarceration program is also to just make sure that young people who are involved in the criminal legal system also give back, and so we do a lot of work around community benefit projects where young people engage in really giving back to their community. You know we are, as we work with young people really trying to have youth and young adults connected to their communities in a very positive and meaningful way, and we've done- and we do this through community benefit projects, as well as ensuring that young people have seen successes. As I mentioned, a number of our youth participants are not actively involved in education or, just you know, no longer engaged in education, and so we make sure, through paid internships and other opportunities, that young people can begin to experience success so that they feel like they are residents in the neighborhood, particularly in Brooklyn. In addition to alternative to incarceration services and cases also provides community-based services that are accessible to young people who may be on probation. We run mentoring services, I'm just showing you a range of different programming and also really employment and services that really help young people and develop soft skills and hard skills for the pathway to employment. Like education, employment are just really central to our work, as well as mentoring, services and after-school services for young people who might be on probation who may live in certain communities. In Brooklyn who were arrested, they might be in family court because they are 17 and under or they might be in the adult system, because they were arrested for a more serious crime for which even we've raised the age that their case may be still adjudicated in the adult system. And so we provide services that are out in the community and throughout Brooklyn or that are serving young people directly and like everybody else, we've had to pivot because of Covid-19 to ensure that young people can still access these services and you know be providing and technology and plans and smartphones to ensure that the young folks can continue in our education services. Continuing our after-school services can continue in our mentoring services, and so we know that that's true of everyone else, but particularly the folks that we're serving like they just don't, have those resources in the home, and so it's really important for us to ensure that they do have those services. So cases has been providing these types of services for 53 years and so that alternatives to incarceration services in New, York City, really started. You know more than 50 years ago, and so we in different configurations with different names, have been serving youth in Brooklyn and other places throughout our city for over 50 years, and so I just wanted to stress that you know we're very fortunate in New York City that we have a very robust providers who provide these services to support community safety by ensuring that people get the problems. The needs, the risks that they might bring with them to the criminal legal system, addressed in a way and that's humane and is able to allow people not to have bad decisions resolved by spending a lot of time in jail prison, but then leads to significant consequences that may continue collateral consequences that continue for folks. His life as I just wanted to share a quote from one of our young graduates. I think he was a 17 year old. What he said about his experience of being in the alternatives to incarceration program was that he said. I learned lots along the way, but the most important lesson that I have learned is that life is too short to be wasting time. Disappointing yourself just find something you love to do and chase it until your legs break. You know and that for me just really epitomizes the idea of a young person finding you don't need to just be doing stuff. That is not helpful to yourself to your community, to your family. That just disappoints yourself to just to find something that, hopefully all of us have realized that takes you out of the criminal legal system that lets you address. The you know like that. You just have a goal that you go for and, as I've said, with young people in particular for us that pathway is really focused around education and employment services that folks can get, and so another large range of services that cases provides in Brooklyn is for people that have mental illnesses and a lot of our focus and for the last 21 years actually came to cases 21 years ago to start our alternatives to incarceration programs for people with serious mental illness. So for people who are living and with diagnosis that you might be familiar with, such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and diagnosis that can really impair someone's functioning for which people need. You know really robust psychiatric treatment for which people need. Maybe supportive mental health, housing and other supports to hopefully address homelessness and mental health treatment needs that we have been in this space for over 21 years, working in the court system to ensure that people with serious mental illnesses are able to also be diverted into the community in a way that's safe and healthy and supports the individual in their recovery from mental illness and many people in the criminal legal system with serious mental illness also have co-occurring substance use disorders. So we're really I'm working on supporting people and address serious mental illness as well as co-occurring substance use disorders. So how we do that at cases that we have treatment teams and so assertive community treatment known as act is a model that was actually started in Wisconsin in the 1970s and by a psychiatrist. Who was really concerned that people with serious mental illness kept on coming back to the hospital, and so what he decided to do was to bring the hospital team that included the psychiatrists nurses, social workers case managers to the community, a team that wraps itself around the person with serious mental illness and provides treatment in a mobile way in the community that the person doesn't have to come into an office into a mental health clinic and so for. Over around 18 years, we've been delivering. This model called assertive community treatment, which is an evidence-based model for people with serious mental illness as our way to address the needs of people with serious mental illness that become involved in the criminal legal system. So for now, 20 years we've had the Nathaniel Act team that works with people that are arrested in Brooklyn and also in Manhattan, who have a serious mental illness that they get connected to our treatment team. As I said it includes. A psychiatrist includes registered nurses, social workers, case managers and people. Who've lived experience of mental illness, who we call peer specialists who work with the person as a team engaging the client in their community in the shelter where they might live in supportive housing and it's and this model is an assertive engagement model, which means the team is responsible for going out and working with the client in the community. Over the last six to seven years and New, York City's made an investment in assertive community treatment and created teams called forensic, assertive community treatment teams that are working with people with serious mental illness that might be returning. We have a Brooklyn team that maybe is working with folks with serious mental illness who are returning to Brooklyn from state prison. So folks, who have serious mental illness were convicted of a felony crime, went to prison and now they're returning and so in our Brooklyn forensic assertive community treatment team. We serve a lot of folks who are returning to the Brooklyn community, who were in state prison as well as people that were arrested in jail. Our Brooklyn assertive community treatment team serves a lot of Brooklyn residents who actually have serious mental illness who are coming out of city hospitals, so Brooklyn hospitals and we are engaging those folks in mental health treatment and then a new model that the city had created some five years ago is called intensive mobile treatment. So we have for about five years, had a team called the Brooklyn intensive mobile treatment team. It's the same configuration of staff for psychiatrists psychiatric nurse practitioner registered nurse case managers and mental health clinicians, who are working in a mobile way in the community and with a smaller caseload of clients, and so our focus at cases is really on the over-representation and the criminalization of people with serious mental illness who become involved in the criminal legal system, and we work with the Brooklyn courts, as well as the Manhattan courts, to identify those clients and to provide treatment and people stay with us for a very long period of time in the Nathaniel. Acting that I mentioned people are in that treatment services for over two years, close to three years before. Maybe their life has settled and they're in a position, maybe to transfer to an outpatient mental health clinic, and it's just a it's, the highest level of intensive outpatient mental health treatment that we have in New, York City, and so we also for cases have a response to bail reform, which I'm sure you hear about in the news and it's a really big issue. Our police commissioner talks about it a lot, and so cases is the supervised release provider for Manhattan and one of the things that we did when there was bail reform in 2019 in our state, and there was new investments in supervising people who previously would have bail set, you know sometimes as low as 100,500 a thousand dollars. I'm sure that you know the majority of people in Rikers island are there for pre-trial detention, so they haven't been found guilty of a crime or pled guilty to the crime. It was the and before we had Bell reform in the state that they were in and Rikers island are waiting for their day in court and with their reform. There were certain crimes that for which judges could no longer set bail, including low-level misdemeanor crimes and violent, and excuse me a non-violent felony crimes. So, although cases is the Manhattan supervised release provider, which is providing the supervision to people who judges have released under supervision, it's called in New York state we and in 2019 and created an office where I am now at Lawrence Street to provide those services to Brooklyn residents in Brooklyn, because otherwise it would mean that if you were a Brooklyn resident and you were arrested in Manhattan for a crime that you would have to report to our Harlem office, that's where cases is based in Manhattan. So it was really important for us to ensure that Brooklyn residents could get easy access to the supervision services, which include screening and assessment, reminding people about their court dates and monitoring. Folks in the community supporting folks to get access to services, which include a lot of referrals to mental health treatment. Again, we see a lot of folks with mental illness and substance use disorder to come in to supervise release the bail services, and so we just we deliver those services to Brooklyn residents in Brooklyn, and you know like other services, we we're doing a partial in person and a lot of virtual supervision services and to ensure that folks who were arrested, you know attend their virtual court. Appearances can get access to the services that they need and are supervised in the community that they don't miss a court date. Nor do they incur a really excuse me. A new arrest. You know, bail, is really critical if you believe in justice, because one of the things that the research shows is that, if you are in jail, you are more likely to be at risk of receiving a jail or prison sentence. If you are walking into the courtroom as a person, you are less likely to be sentenced to jail or prison, and you know this means with bail reform that if you've been arrested for a crime you're not going to lose your housing, you can keep your job. You can, you know, attend your court appearances and be held accountable if you're going to plead guilty or be found guilty, but a lot of cases. You know that we have in New, York City are also dismissed. You know, which is you know, just an important thing to also share so for us up in Brooklyn. We ensure that if you live in Brooklyn that the bail services that cases runs are accessible to you, so I just wanted to share. Also my contact information and I'm really happy to take any questions. I think I'll put my camera wrong and I'll stop sharing. You guys do a lot of great work and it seems, like you've, been a very fun component of the neighborhood, including our neighborhood, for a long time. So, thank you, one of the things just to piggyback off the last component of your presentation. Could you speak a little bit more about how you're finding the success of bill reform and how how you guys are seeing so one of the things that I will say is the city. It really has invested in rigorous analysis of rail reform. So there was an extensive report and I can send you the link, and that was done by Mdrc, so a really rigorous evaluation. You know the data indicates the majority of people and so who are supervised under supervised. The program program's called supervised release so under bail reform in New, York City are attending all of their court dates and a very small percentage of people when we have looked at our data, like 90 of people, are not incurring a new arrest and what the Mdrc evaluation alway also found is that people under supervised release are supervised longer than people who were Roi so they're at risk for a longer period of time of incurring a new arrest and failing to attend a court appearance. So it's you know like in the media. You're, definitely going to hear the those you know, those the stories that hit the headlines and but that is not the norm by any regard and I just looked at the data in Brooklyn the majority. So currently we are supervising 335 Brooklyn residents out of our Brooklyn operations, and the majority of those folks were arrested for a misdemeanor crime. You know a lower level crime and so we're not talking about, like the majority of people arrested for a violent felony crime, you're really talking about people arrested for maybe misdemeanor drugs for petty larceny, which is stealing you know something that's of value less than a thousand dollars, which is generally things out of pharmacies is our experience you know like you. Can we have had clients in the program who you know stole chewing gum out of Dwayne Reed like that is a petty larceny, as well as people that you know maybe stole other items, and so it's the norm is not what you hear in the media. That's not our experience a lot. We make a lot of referrals for people for mental health treatment and there's just a lot of poverty. We're helping people to get access to the things that they need to have and for us I think we believe. A lot of these crimes are even related to people's substance, use disorders or survival crimes, and if you would like, if members would like to raise their hand so that I can call on them. Okay, John. Yes, thank you. We had a presentation several months ago in regard to the red hook: community court. What's how do you interact with them because they do some of the same things that you try to do? Yes, so we we really don't I, think you know, as I was sharing New York has a really robust alternatives to incarceration and different types of community courts, and you know like they face of you, know folks, you know out of red hawk and- and you know- and we do have that, so we don't. We actually don't have a lot of interaction because we're working out of the Brooklyn criminal and supreme courts and then in Manhattan, as I said, then serving people in Brooklyn who are Brooklyn residents. But we should you know, I. Think the message is the you know: I've traveled across the country sometimes providing technical assistance that we are really fortunate for the robust diversion services that we have in our city. Can you speak to a little bit more? How you fit into that structure? Do you have contracts with the those those court systems? How do people get diverted to you? Instead of the the criminal justice system or the detention centers yeah, so how it works is that in New, York City, the main funding for alternatives to incarceration comes from the mayor's Office of Criminal justice, so that entities you know oversees coordinates with the district attorneys with the courts with probation like they are the central coordinator of the criminal legal system in New, York City. They don't have oversight for NYPD, that's directly to the mayor, and so how- and so they fund programs that have eligibility criteria. The mayor's office of Criminal Justice, they coordinate with the criminal legal stakeholders so with just judges with prosecutors. Many prosecutors offices and including the Brooklyn Da's office has done a really great job. You know, over the decades of creating their own specialized staff, who coordinate with programs like us. They train their assistant district attorneys to make referrals to diversion programs. So sometimes the referral will come from the district attorney's office. Sometimes it will come from the Defense Council representing the eligible client. Sometimes it will come from the judge, or sometimes a combination, sometimes from a family member who might reach out to us. We then you know just how the process works is that you know a client represented by defense counsel. You always have to get the lawyer's permission. You know once we have the lawyer's permission, then we will, you know, do an assessment of the client and submit our recommendations to the prosecutor and the judge and and then in some legal cases the prosecutor has to consent. You know it's interesting, you might think the judge rules everything, but for some cases you have to get the prosecutor's consent for the diversion and others. The judge can fully make that decision. You know and then we present a plan around how the person is going to be supervised, the nature of the services, how we're going to be working with the person and then someone could be released, like supervised release like bail reform without taking a plea in some instances some people have to and plead guilty to get access to the services, because that's that might be what the court requires, and so this is, you know the story about bail. Why bail is so important that there are just so many collateral consequences once you've played guilty that continue to follow? You know like you could be excluded from public housing. You know you. Could you experience ongoing discrimination about employment, you know, and so in bail, where people are able to get services and get cases resolved without pleading guilty like this, you know is really stopping the issue of some of the collateral consequences that we see. You know in New, York City. We even have agencies this one called youth represent that helps young people, who may have been in a diversion program who years later, are experiencing collateral consequences which could be access to housing access to go to college. You know the barriers that you know persist for years and years afterwards. It sounds a little one-off, though the diversion to your programs, as opposed to a real structural system like everybody that fits into it into this category comes to you. Are there any recommendations that you have for improvement of like how that funnel to you happens? So I think that's a really excellent question, and so, when I came to cases 21 years ago and I think for the first nearly 10 years, it was very hard to divert somebody. Do you know what I mean like I would sometimes be in prosecutors office begging, the prosecutor to let us have the person out, because you know like generally, you would find that the prosecutors, the district attorney's office, you know, is concerned about risk, particularly you know, when I first came that there wasn't a history of diverting people who had serious mental illness. You know at this time when I came to cases you know in Brooklyn the Brooklyn mental health court was started. You know with Judge Demick who's. Now our administrative judge in Brooklyn and Josh Demick really took leadership and really created a culture of as a judge on the bench and he's now. Our administrative judge in Brooklyn really helping to facilitate a culture of promoting that what I will say and what our staff who work in the courts will say is sometimes it's unclear to us why someone doesn't is not allowed to come to us. Do you know because a similar type of person yesterday was allowed to come to us? So sometimes it's about the assigned district attorney. You know who's in charge of that case and the bureau that they work in and their decision and their power, particularly in cases where the judge must get the prosecutor's consent for diversion, whereas in bail, what's happened in bail reform is the you know at the state legislative level, the state of said. You know you can no longer set bail for misdemeanor crime, so a judge can now put the person under supervision or roar them. So that's like the system that you are describing and so in, even with the robust services that we have you know. Sometimes the prosecutor will just say no John I think you had your hand up briefly I. Thank you. You hear me. Yes, okay, Miss, Anne, Marie I want to thank you very much for your very comprehensive review. I just want to go backwards. A little bit. You have this responsibility at the end of the process. Our society has been designed from the birth of black men to make sure that black not successful. You did mention earlier that our prisoner prison is filled with majority African-Americans, don't smoke or pilfer more than other Americans. So why do they represent such a large percentage of the jail population which costs 70,000 to keep a prisoner in jail for a year? How much of that could you give to that family to help support the family and give the kid an opportunity well from the very beginning, as opposed to getting in the criminal justice system and then having to avail themselves of all of your services because they otherwise can't get on their feet? So my concern is that you're at the very end, how do we move this process forward to get black kids, black male kids, essentially on an even heel at the beginning of their lives? That doesn't happen again. You're dealing at the very and, unfortunately, society is geared to get black men incarcerated as early as possible so that they get a prison record and they can't get a government job. For example, it's just as a the knee proverbial proverbially is on your neck from the time you were born, so I appreciate what you're doing at the end. How do you collate all of the information and maybe get a center of New York, one to be able to explain the program to the larger community and to give folks knowledge that are alternatives, because you have to get in the program to know that the program exists? We at the community are not fully aware of this until tonight. I, don't know how we're going to circulate, but we need to do that. We need to get the word out that there are these services at the very end and then the other part of our society has to begin to address this problem at the front of it. I wish we didn't need your services, we do, but we need them. Yeah. No I really do appreciate your comments. You know I. The reason I'm in this job here at cases is because there was an advocate she's, a lawyer. She does. She works for human rights watch and 22 years ago, Heather was suing the city because in New, York City and people with mental illness were let out of Riker's island at three o'clock in the morning with a token, no connection to mental health treatment, so she sued the city and you make a really important point about structural changes, and so you know what the data shows is that if you were born in 2001, the likelihood of incarceration for black men is one in three. So if we were saying it's one in three, so one in three black men who are now 19 are at risk of incarceration for men in general. I think it's one in 56 for latino men, it's maybe one in 17 and for white men, it's one in whatever 56 or 76, but one in three black men who are now 19 are at likelihood of incarceration. So if that was cancer, I think we would have a different response, which goes to your point around. There are many different pandemics that there are in the United States. You know one of the things that advocates are really saying which I hadn't appreciated when I first came to this job and I heard it is that in the Us there is also a school to prison pipeline to you know: there's a school to prison pipelines like which just sounds really quite fascinating, but it's really talking about who's exposed to expulsion from school. So this is why we really focus on education, and so I really do need to look at schools as a pathway, a pipeline to prison, because if you know kids, who are suspended, arrest in schools, you know there's an over representation as well as I. Think you're, like the wider point that you're making and I don't have to say that the criminal legal system is racist, that's obvious, and if you don't believe that. Well, that's weird! You know, but you know the wider point that you're making is that the default can not be to expect the criminal legal system to address social problems. You know that's a different discussion, because that would mean that we wouldn't expect cases wouldn't need to exist, because what we are doing is we're, like you, described, helping people that have a number of social problems who become involved, and so social problems should be addressed with social responses. Thank you. So much get out get the word out. Please thank you for that and I will send all of our communication materials. There's a new brochure about all the Ati programs and the mayor's Office of Criminal Justice I will send it to you all so that you can circulate I. Think it's really important as you describe that we do you know, and for cases as an agency, it's important that we engage the community more. So people do know about our resources, because at that moment, when someone is arrested or a loved one is in jail. It's a crisis moment and it's very hard to navigate when you're under stress in crisis, and so you know, I really do appreciate you all having me here and you know and I'll send our communication material. As you know, as residents in Brooklyn, it's important that we do get the word out. Thank you so much for that. We'll follow up with you. Thank you. Are there any other committee members that would like to Brian and then Sid and then zero go ahead? Brian. Thank you very much for presenting to us I have a question that is related a little bit to Juliet's question about who is able and who's not able to access your services. I'm curious if anyone is ever turned away because of a lack of resources. Oh in terms of cases, no, we would. Even if the city gives us caps for services, we would never turn anybody away or we would find a path like we know the other services and that there are out there. It's I think we're in a an interesting place, so providers, like cases, would always say we always need more money. I actually think we're at this moment where the current administration have put in some additional resources for alternatives to incarceration. So it was the new funding cycle and the new funding cycle started July 1 of this year, so we're now on a a basically a new six-year cycle. Currently I believe that there is enough money. You know for there's been a big investment and Covid-19, and the fact that the court systems are going in and out is really impacting our ability to serve folks. You know particularly folks who are in custody, because what we've had with the because of Covid-19 is that many court appearances are being put off. Do you know like so? Judges are just administratively adjourning cases, so someone may be sitting in jail or might be in the community and need our services, and we may not be making those connections so I don't currently, because the city has made a really and they added new funding and that started as of July. So you know right now. The issue is not about funding and I. Think that's really important that the and you'll see in the brochure that I send around all the different programs that are funded by the city, that we are funded adequately. I would say, and we just need- we need clients we're seeing that, but we are seeing a lot of clients in the Bell services, because that's easy for a judge to do, because people are still being arranged if you're being arrested, and you have a first call appearance legally. That has to happen, but we do have the issue for us is currently as it as we exist today. It's not about funding. Thank you very much and Sid. You are next no questions, but thank you. It was very informative. Thank you thanks and then Cyril. Thank you very much. Miss, Lewis and I. Think your organization is fantastic. The work that you do is extremely important, especially with the mentally ill I. Think. That's the area where I think all of us have to do more about, especially the criminal justice system would be well served by your organization. I had a couple of questions, but I'm going to limit them because you've given us such a wide range of information, but my question is how I still want to understand? How does the attorney for the I would call them defendant? Is that your first contact generally, the majority of our referrals, do come from defense attorneys, but we do get them from prosecutors and judges, but generally it's the defense attorney that reaches out before Covid-19. Our staff would physically be in the court buildings and in the particularly in arraignments looking for clients and just have a physical presence in virtual we're not able to do that. So we are, you know before Covid-19, like the physical presence, was also a way that we reminded attorneys. You know. Sometimes people have big cases they're very busy. They forget about considering a diversion program, and so you know that's one of the reasons. I was saying the issue. Currently, the currently is not about money. It's around us ensuring that anyone that's eligible is getting diverted, but generally the defense attorney. Defense attorneys are our biggest referral sources. Yes, this is the defense we're having a hard time hearing you Cyril, I, think he's cutting in and out we'll come back to you, Sarah I can't find my hand to put up okay. Can you hear me? Oh wait, Mr, listen. Can you hear my question I? Can't? Yes, I was just wondering other than the defense attorney. Does your organization is your proactive? Actually, if I'm a defendant and I have no idea what to do and I would really need your help. My question in practical terms is what would I do I ask my defense attorney. The fir is that the first person I would contact and say I need help or they would relate to me because that doesn't always happen. The defense attorney doesn't always do that. They're not really equipped or they do. Sometimes they don't even care. They just proceed with their typical. You know justice system, that's it yeah, so they're, sorry, I'm getting feedback, but clients can contact us directly and we get referrals all the time from family members and loved ones that just reach out. You know and there's it's on our website, our court staff get. You know those calls from folks that reach out in Rikers island. You know another, you know in the last I think, maybe seven to eight years. Maybe longer you know, health and hospitals runs the Correctional health services so before it was run by a private entity. You know one of those private correctional health entities that were just not doing a good job, but in the last I think, maybe about 10 years now. You know the city had brought in correctional health services. You know health and hospitals who run kings, County hospital, they run the Correctional health services, and so they have social workers on Rikers island who also make referrals lots of referrals to our services. So what would happen? Is the social worker on Rikers island would say? There's someone who's eligible for the cases program. Then we would get the referral. Then we would contact the defense attorney to get their consent to interview their client. One more question: Madam Chad. What you mean you quote young graduate. What does graduation mean in your exactly so graduation in alternative great, a great question. Thank you. So graduation, in an alternative incarceration program means that you successfully completed the court supervision. So when someone is released to our program as part of an alternate history, incarceration and I didn't say this, and thank you for the question. Then. Every month, for every other month, we have to go with the participant. The client to court for a court appearance in front of the judge where the judge is monitoring the person's progress. So graduation means that the judge is satisfied that you have achieved all of the goals and the community supervision that the judge has been monitoring. It means that your legal case, your criminal legal case, is resolved in a way that doesn't result in incarceration, and it also means that cases then is that an opportunity to help you work on certain goals so as well as completing your a young person, might complete their legal supervision and have their legal case resolved. Maybe they also were part of our education services. They got their high school equivalency. Maybe they were in a vocational program. They're now con. You know continuing in that program, they're in the community, for people with mental illness. It also means that you've completed your legal case, but you know as we're working with people that have serious mental illness. The person will continue in services, sometimes with cases. So we run services, mental health services also for people who no longer have a legal case, but you know if you have schizophrenia. Generally, it's a long. You know a lifelong of being involved in treatment and to maintain your recovery from the mental illness, but when I was using the word graduate, it really meant that you completed your legal case and achieved your goals, as was defined in the plan for you. So really great question I appreciate that. Thank you very much for your service really appreciate it. Thank you, Madam Chair, thank you Cyril and Patrick, mostly just to say this is such an impressive program, but also curious. Have you been involved at all in the Rikers closure, design, planning or program planning? So some cases is part of a community of other providers which we call the New York City alternatives to incarceration and re-entry coalition, and our agencies have definitely been involved. We've participated in those meetings and you know we do support the closing of Rikers island and then just by default. The pre-trial supervised release program that I had described is even more so than the alternatives to incarceration and services. Like those services, you know, I described that we are supervising 300 Brooklyn residents now in pre-trial, but overall in our program across the city across Manhattan. You know we take people only arrested in Manhattan, but you have the equivalent in Brooklyn run by the center for court innovation. That also runs the red hook and community court program. So Cci runs your the Brooklyn pre-trial program in Manhattan in our program across we are. We currently have just under 2,000 New York City residents who've been arrested in Manhattan. You know some of them are Manhattan residents. Some of them are Brooklyn residents as I described 300 of them. Some of them are Queen's residents. Some of them are Bronx residents. So really the supervised release program is the most effective initiative that is reducing the Rikers island population. Thanks yeah I know. One of the goals of that effort is to reduce the travel time literally, the time people spend in jail and also it seemed as if the jail itself was being designed to be to make the whole experience less punitive. It seems it I. You know, overall, it's a great change anyway. Thank you, Emery. This is really inspiring. Thank you all it's great to meet community residents who are involved and active in their communities, and that's it's really great. So thank you all for spending the time to listen to the work that we are doing and if you know have our contact details. If you want to get involved, you know cases is always looking for folks from the community to be involved and to share more and we would love to do that. Are there any other members of perhaps the community Board Miss Latrell? If you would like to ask any questions, otherwise I will open it up to the public. Okay thanks! Thank you. Latrell, yes, I have a question. First of all, thank you. So much I think it sounds like a really great program in general, but I have two questions for the youth. If the youth I want to explain this correctly, so if the youth, if they had committed a crime when they was younger, it would say hypothetically as they get older, do they get another crime? Would they get a second chance to go through the program? Does it say hypothetically, if you know if they mess up a second time, Exac exactly I, think you know that's a really important point. So for all of us who are slightly older, we all remember being young, you know and what it means to be a young person. And yes, you know the simple question responses. Yes, they totally do in New York state as well. We have an adjudication which is called youthful offender, which means that if you are under 19 and when you have been arrested and maybe pled guilty on a felony, a judge can give you an adjudication call youthful offender and offender you generally have to you have to earn the adjudication. Maybe, by being you know, in an alternative to incarceration program or supervised by probation for a period of time, so a youthful offender status gives the person the opportunity, even though they may have pled guilty to a felony. If you get that adjudication, if the prosecutor agrees, if the judge agrees they're going to you earn this by you're, you know doing the right thing in the community. You actually don't incur a conviction, you know, and it's the criminal legal system recognizing that young people do make mistakes. You know they should be held accountable for those mistakes, but it shouldn't again have long-term consequences that you know people are experiencing when they're 20 when they're 30, when they're 40 when they're 50. so but the simple answer is yes, people can have an opportunity, and it's not just once that Hap that happens- and you know a population that we find get arrested over and over again for low-level crimes might be people that have mental illness who are homeless. You know, and so we are really trying to intercept that as well and I think the prosecutors you know in Brooklyn and throughout our city, I think generally recognize because of mental illness and substance use when people are being arrested on low-level crimes that you shouldn't use. What researchers tell us is the most ineffective response, which is incarceration and do y' all ever follow a client even after they finish the program to see how far they how many goals they achieve after they finish the program like any major success stories. Yes, we have, over the years cases has run alumni groups. That brings folks back. You know we have young people that have gone through our program that have gone off to college that have come back. We've had people that were who graduated from our program become employees at cases and one of the areas that we really look to you know. Part of our work is to ensure community safety. Is we look at the rates of which and people that left our program are then re-arrested and reconvicted and so for graduates? We see even for people with mental illness and young people, that when we look at that data that they're very low rates of people being reconvicted of a new crime once they've graduated our program and the majority of people do not so sometimes 70 to 80 of people, don't incur a new conviction. You know which is really important, that you look out at what happens post and is it I'm not sure if this question was asked already, is it a criteria of financial be for somebody to be a part of cases? No, so there are no program fees. Our program is fully funded by the city in, and the city incurs all of our program costs that you do not have to pay any fees like we see that around the country in certain places where you might be on probation and you have to pay for supervision, you might be on bail supervision. You have to pay, for that happens in other states, but and in other jurisdictions, but not for us in New, York, City and that's also true for and bail and the supervised release services that I described the the cost of the services are incurred by us. As you know, residents of New York City, you know, and through our taxes, it's not for the individual which, when you think about like who is in our programs, I think I read some a data set that in Brooklyn you know nearly over 80 of Brooklyn residents are eligible for a public defender, which means that the people are being arrested are so poor they're. They can't they need. You know like they must have a public defender, so it would be if people are eligible for a public defender, then to have to charge them would be like they're just going to fail, they're going to not be able to pay those freeze and also end up in jail or prison because they can't pay those fees. The controller and Scott Stringer in his office a couple of years ago and I know that they're currently pushing around just court fees because at the end of cases like people are charged court fees, and so you know this is another way. It's like a tax on the poor, like they're, very concerned about the fact that people could be arrested or warranted because they didn't pay the court fees. You know, then they have a judgment against them. You know it impacts their credit rating. It has you know, collateral consequences, so the child. Those were really excellent. Questions I, really appreciate you asking me those questions and getting me to respond. Thank you for that. Thank you for what you do now. Moving on to members of the public, I think Miss Greco had a question that you put in the chat. You can feel free to ask it thanks Juliette and thank you so much for your presentation. I'm really! My question actually is twofold: it's just that if there are issues that you encounter either in your work or in the work of your peers, that you really wish elevated more now that there is attention to these topics, but that don't necessarily get covered, and second also in order to continue this kind of conversation. Are there other voices, either peer organizations or people that you work with, that you think are worth bringing to the community board's attention cool and thank you. So it will be no surprise that one of the biggest stresses that we experience is the rate of homelessness. You know like homelessness and the lack of housing is a public safety issue. Do you know, like that's a real public safety issue, the for people to be stabilized to work on goals that the homelessness is just critical to that really addressing homelessness? It just goes like we work with a lot of people that are are homeless, New, Yorkers, and so I'm just going to talk specifically about people with mental illness who are homeless and so New York has made a lot of investments around supported housing. We call it for people that meet criteria because they're homeless and have a serious mental illness. There is less. So, even though we have more units, there is less vacant units and access to that housing. Now, and so you know, I just have to leave all of us with that conundrum, and so when I first came to cases, we would refer people to mental health housing. There was limited housing, but we were able to find some. We worked with housing organizations who created housing stock, and so this is like. Homelessness is a public safety issue. You know like so as, and so you know- and maybe that might lead me to as you think, about public safety around in engaging with folks that do work around housing understanding, maybe talking to some of the mental health and supportive housing providers that the exist in Brooklyn, the Institute for community living has a lot of critical mass in Brooklyn they're, really excellent provider. They do mental health treatment, substance, use treatment, primary care, treatment, they've been around for decades and decades, but it's a really critical and then I just think the and I will because it's changed the advocacy around the closing of Rikers. You know we're in a a fiscal crisis and because of Covid-19, and so it's there's clearly a commitment to close Rikers island, it's unsure if that will happen, and so we engage with folks who are really trying to keep that on the agenda. I think a phys like I've been because of cases like we. You know we started our work 20 years ago around people with serious mental illness involved in the criminal legal system. I've been to communities, I've been to Idaho, I've been to Kentucky, I've been to California, I've been to Ohio, I've been to many places across abuse of Florida and I've gone into jails in those places and they and not that in any way, am I promoting a jail, but I've seen more humane jails in Idaho than Rikers island in New, York City in this progressive city, and so that's like that is just fascinating to me, and so we are really concerned about the fact that, with the fiscal crisis, the closing of records may not happen and I know that the advocates are as well I. Think the you know, another point around is around the city. You know last week announced that there you know in Brooklyn, we've had some Brooklyn residents that were killed at this moment of psychiatric crisis with NYPD and I. Think the you know. Last week the mayor announced that they will and start to pilot in February of next year mental health response to crisis, and so, if you all, are also interested in ensuring you know around the decriminalization of mental illness around thinking about public safety, so public safety is community safety, everyone's safety. So if someone is in a psychiatric crisis and the outcome is that they lose their life like, none of us would want that terrible outcome and to be a reality, and so some of the work that we do is really also around and promoting and public health response to public health issues. Question. Thank you. So much is there. Are there any other questions? Brian I think you have your hand raised. I didn't know if you intended to okay, Julianne I need to add that it's important to note that community board 2 did not vote to close rocket right desire. Let's make sure we made that part of the discussion. Community Board 2 had an opportunity to vote to close Righteous Ireland because we have a jail in downtown Brooklyn and we did not support the closing of regular virus. We did not support the jail down that boat, just as a matter of note when we talk about this community board should respond to that. Thank you. That's interesting, yeah I feel like it had we had this discussion a couple of months ago. We recently prioritized the budget needs and hearing you say that now it is given the budget concerns that you're afraid that Rikers island may not close, is really scary to hear, and we probably would have put that on our list of priorities- zero, oh you're, on mute, zero I would definitely that was just the question. John that I was going to ask. I was going to ask in a different way. Would it be a manager? Would it be feasible for our committee to actually make just a resolution that we would endorse the closing of Rikers island that we would like to submit that to the General Committee? Is that something that we do? Maybe John Quinn could explain that how we would do that, not by just by a resolution that we would be committed to that or continue to be committed to the closing of Rikers island. It's not a parliamentary question. It's really. If it goes on the agenda, then it's something we can take up at a at any subsequent meeting. We don't need to have a presentation. We can on our own decide what issues we want to bring to the board, but I think we, you know, it's all very my own view. It's all very fluid at the moment, because until the emergency is over and we see what the you know, it's hard to tell what the jail population is in reality because of what they've done to try to meet Covid-19 by reducing the jail population. So I think it probably has to wait because a the city's not going to do anything about it in this terrible budget crunch and shortfall and I think that we would need input from all of the organizations that have come before us before we have a serious discussion of it. Brian Ryan we're referring to the the Euler for the jails. I know, I speak for some others, but primal I'll speak for myself. Voted against that plan, not because didn't want to see Rikers close, but was worried that if we built new jails we would persist high rates of incarceration longer into the future. So it wasn't so much a don't want to close Rikers but want to see Rikers closed and not necessarily build new geos either. We don't need to have this discussion here, but what you're proposing is not what we were presented with right, but I. Think John has a good point that if we do want to re-engage with that discussion, it should be a larger community discussion and probably not dealt with at this small level of engagement, and we should look to invite more organizations to speak to that and have a larger, a broader engagement on it and with Covid-19 right now. This is probably not the right moment is. This is any other discussion on that all right, I'd like to thank you very much, Miss Lewis and for joining us this evening. You are doing fantastic work. You've really educated us I, think that is part of our process as well. We want to learn more about how alternatives to criminal justice work so that we can help, rethink it and help to advocate, where possible, great, so nice to meet all of you. Thank you ever so much take care. Everyone be safe, happy thanksgiving to everybody. Thank you please thank you and thank you everybody else. There are a couple of items. I'm just going to review the agenda. We are going to do chairperson's report and in that report I wanted to review the DOT tracking item list and then Carol Ann made it as a Google spreadsheet. So we can continue to add on to it after our meeting and then also I would like to invite Cheryl to speak about the comstat reports and any update on the President Council meeting. If there have been any of those, so maybe we should actually do that first Cheryl, if you're I can share the precinct constant reports. If you'd like to say anything about the council, the Airport recent council is not having any meetings. Hopefully, they'll have a Zoom meeting in December I to discussing the precinct reports. I would not take that upon myself to discuss the 84 and 88 precinct reports. I, think you can just look at the numbers for yourself and see what it is, because we have no real contact with e88 and the 84. They are just business as usual, as the precinct captain said last month, they're just focusing on making sure we're trying to keep people safe, but that's I think they might have they're thinking we're having a turkey giveaway this Saturday at Farragut houses and that's all coming from. What's his name again, who was in charge of Madrid Chief Madrid, although he's at 1pp he's still, you know keeping an eye on what's going on in Brooklyn, so he may be giving a turkey giveaway as opposed to their Christmas sleigh ride. I, don't know if that's going to happen, but I hope it does and they can still give away toys having children socially distanced, but hopefully we'll have a zoom meeting for the 8-Fold council in December. Thanks Cheryl I have a comment about the 84th and 88th precinct. Both precincts are light on officers because those officers are assigned to the Barclays, Center and other areas as a result of all the protests that begin downtown Brooklyn and it's not necessarily known until the protest happens and they distribute the information on where folks should gather that the police are then called from whatever they are doing to go to, whichever location is advertised as being the connection place for the folks to gather to do their rally. But it's a John and you're right, because in downtown Brooklyn all the precincts are patrolling everywhere, because I see in my neighborhood a lot of 76 cars. We're not really a 76 precinct, but those are the cars I'm seeing 76. So 84 is probably closer to Barclays and you see 88 cars I think they're just sending the cars when needed, Barclays used to be in the 88th precinct, but when Barclays was built, they carved out and gave it to the 84th, which is two blocks from Barclays which for us, the community board made perfect sense that the present closest to the arena ought to be responsible for the arena. But for no other reason. It cuts down on the transportation time, never credit against an area that is expected to have a lot of police activity. A note is not in physically the ADA, but the ADA often has to deploy offices, because the meeting place is in the ADA, the other piece that I'm not sure the community board is aware of. Since you raised this issue, is that the community board did receive a notice to close Fort Greene Park that Fort Greene Park was closed because they had gotten a notice that there was going to be a rally that gathered at Fort Greene Park. So I'm just mentioning that, because it was a source of contention as to what extent the community bought ought to be involved in closing off well, I think the way that happened was when that notice went out. There was discontent with the closing of the park, which ended up, yielding the decision makers decided to keep the park open after that discontent was expressed, but that's my that's exactly my point. How did the community board get involved in notification that a public place was closed off to the public? This is a free speech matter. This is pure free speech. People have a right to protest. Public places are just that. So why would the community board assist in closing off a public place? I, don't understand how this decision happened. Can somebody simply call up the community board and say this is what we want to do and all the rules go out if such sounds good. What's the principle by which the community board will develop a community a public spot, the can I speak Juliet on behalf of the office yeah, so the community board was not at all involved. We received a notification from the agency and we followed it to the community just so that people would know we were not at all involved in any other manner. We were not consulted, we simply received a notification and we followed it as we do with other notifications, I'm not suggesting that you were consulted. I'm sure you were not part of the process in making that decision, but you were part of the process in supporting that inappropriate decision. I, don't feel that way, John. That is a attribution of intent. That is not necessarily accurate and I. Don't think I can either say whether they supported it or not. They furthered the information. You could even think that they furthered in the information because they didn't support it and they wanted to get the community upswell to counter that. But we don't know what the intent was behind it. So I really I. Don't think that this is the appropriate venue to surmise about things that we don't know about and that we're not going to know about so because it wasn't when I got noticed. I immediately contacted the community board and said this is not our role in this community board, because, if they're not in the park they're outside the park that didn't solve the problem, he closed the park. But you couldn't stop the activity. That's the point where I'm trying to generate. We can not stop people from protesting, so you can't close off what is a public spot and expect the people to show up and do what the decision was not well thought out in terms of the role of the community board period under the stars. I think that is your opinion. John I, don't think that is necessarily the opinion of the administrators of the community board or the staff or the chair, but I understand that it's your opinion, there's no discussion about this. There doesn't need to be that's fine, so I wanted to take a moment to go back to the agenda to take a look at the Comstat reports that were distributed, but I just wanted to make sure everybody was able to take a look at it. So if Taya you could allow me to share my screen. Thank you so I know you guys can look at it yourself, but I just wanted to point out. The murder is up the last month, there has been a murder and the murder is up a hundred percent from last year, as is rape and as our shooting victims and incidents, but all of the other crime stat reports, comstat reports of crime data are down from last year, so I thought that was interesting to point out and this may be Covid-19 related or some other reason, but other than the ones that we know are issues like the shooting violence. Many of the other items are down, and that was the 84th and then now just looking at the 88th, it seems to be about par with last year. Grand larceny is down, most of the other items are on par with last year. Assault is down and, as we know, shooting is way up and, as is a big problem, especially in the 88th. It's way up from that 20 victims, 15 incidents, really, which is why that is one of our most important priorities- is the shooting violence in our neighborhood. So moving on to the D.O.T items list, can everybody see this I can increase the size? Let me want to zoom in how's this okay I took some of the items from a previous update and put them into this format. So the first one I just I put in is the BQE. We haven't heard anything in a long time. Let's ask them for an update, so this is pr. This is DOT items. It's not MTA items, it's not public safety items. Our goal is to get this over to DOT so that they can give us a real update and I put the Atlantic Avenue Interchange in there sandy, because it had previously been a separate question, but we can either consolidate it or make it a separate question. They had said that it was funded with the BQE I, then added Brooklyn, waterfront greenway to just get an update on all the uncompleted parts of it seems to be taking forever and Brian. You had asked about certain parts of it and I thought that those parts were pending asap. They didn't happen. So let's ask them for the update. This is an older one. Artillery and Flatbush avenue. I know there was a I. There has been a traffic improvement project there. I, don't know if that project addressed pedestrian safety or not and feel free. If anybody has any opinions on whether this should come off or stay on, you know we can add or subtract downtown sorry what I thought it was resolved. Okay, so I can potentially take this off, remove and maybe Caroline you could just look into it before we leave it on the list. This one downtown Brooklyn traffic calming just to get an update on that down. Flatbush avenue, downtown Brooklyn safety improvements. There had been funding for work from Livingston to Pacific. We should get an update on where that they are with all of that get a list of all of the planned safety and pedestrian safety improvements slated for down for community district. Two. Likewise, with the bike lanes, this one was old, I, don't know if it's still an issue. Subsistence problem at on Vanderbilt at various intersections decal will be Myrtle. I'm going to remove this one, and then this is one of our new items, which is. We had supported converting a car lane into a bike lane car lanes into bike lanes on the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, and these were some old items that I'm not going to go through because they're old, but if people could look at them and maybe make notes about whether they're they need to be updated or removed, that would be great. These are very specific items like say this one, exactly association like now that we have a neighborhood advisory council for A.D Flatbush. Perhaps we do. We no longer need a a dvd presentation to the Burham Hill Association about 80 Flatbush's traffic mitigation plans. I know we would start out with association and still like that, I don't know if, okay, how Howard Collins feels about it and Cheryl? Is that something that you yeah but they're not more far? What turn off that thing? They're not start looking at building until late next year, so right now, I think everything, even although they're getting their permits for different parts of the buildings and whatever they're not going to be doing any kind of building until late in 2021, I see okay, yeah I've already added a few items to this list when you've had Caroline distributed to the committee earlier today, I was actually focusing on the larger projects that are in the community board that we don't get regular updates on, for example, the BQE is one of them, of course, but we had a project to get underground parking at the Willoughby Park that is not yet completed and the underground parking was eliminated. One of the goals of that parking was to take all the permit parking off of the streets of downtown Brooklyn and give them an actual place with cameras and all that good stuff, but they get their cars, but the car wouldn't be right outside, for example, of the precinct, and we would get rid of all that side, Ward Block, which has become a problem now that area is fully developed. We have a lot more traffic there and we have all these cars parked in the street, so that problem has still not been solved. We still have all this permit parking, so we have to figure out what is our next step, given that parking option was eliminated, we also asked for a public bathroom downtemper that was included, and we don't have any information on where that is at. In terms of funding and location, we were told that it was moved over to Willoughby Street near Adams, because that's where they have underground infrastructure. Now all these either I'm talking to you. This is what I've heard. It's not documented anywhere, so we don't track it, and so, if you're, not tracking you're, not asking about it nothing's happening, we have to call and get the appropriate folks on board with it and then get them to begin to think about it, and I should share with you that yesterday we had a euler for Dumbo. The Euler failed because it's a large complex and the only subway station is the York Street station. That is not ADA compliant and only has three turn styles and a very narrow platform. Yet they want to introduce hundreds and hundreds of more people into that area that doesn't have adequate transportation. That station has been on the list for ADA compliance. It's going to be very difficult, but it's been on the list for ADA compliance and there's been no discussion of it whatsoever. So development is now being prohibited because you can't get there. These are issues that affect all of our subway stops. That is supposed to be addressed. It's supposed to be federally addressed and there's no plan for it and nobody talks about it. We actually got a half million dollars for the Hoyt Street station to study how to do ADA compliance. Who knows where that money is certainly who's going to be doing the study and what are the parameters of the study? That's why I'm asking for this there's a lot going on in the community that we don't get regular reports on, so we don't know what's happening. I can go on, but I'm finished for now. Okay, thanks John and I'm sure Carol Ann will be able to enter in Caroline. Do you have John's items that? Could you enter them into the spreadsheet when you get a chance you're on Mute Carolyn? Did you say? Yes, I am assuming you did, okay, thanks just and if anybody else would like to add any now, I'm happy to talk about it. Otherwise, maybe we can move on, and this is a live document living document that you all have access to. So we can edit it on a ongoing basis. Can I just make a comment on what John just talked about, while it's still for John? There was a bill introduced today in the City Council by council member 11, as well as Speaker Johnson, created a new program modeled on the citizen, reported idling program which allows anybody to file a like notarized complaint, along with evidence that a truck was idling for more than three minutes and you can get 25 of the fine amount, and so a similar bill was introduced today to create a program to hold people who misuse placards accountable. I, don't know what will happen with the bill, but I wanted to update, given that we were talking about placards yeah I, wonder if there could be some kind of collections on the fines. For that. That's the idea, that's in that in the belt. So far we can take some of those folks in that program we heard about earlier and tell them that they can stand on certain corners that we're having a problem with and get fifteen dollars or thirty dollars. Every time they write a ticket, yeah, that's being creative for sure, okay, I think we should agree to a deadline for this so that we can then send it off to DOT. Do you think that December first is enough time to think about ideas and enter? Let me just see what the is this Lt related items. Is it D-O-T? Let's see what the December 1st it's about almost two years, non-guilty items we should create a different tracking spreadsheet for discussion is not DOT xmta and that's MTA items yeah, so John. If you wanna, you can send me or Carol Anne your list of MTA items and we'll create a new spreadsheet. For that because we do have I do have. Someplace else are all of our MTA items too from last year's discussion, so we can start to populate a different spreadsheet with that all right, we'll do that sounds good okay, so December 1st deadline for this item and then we'll send it off to DOT great and then just going back to our agenda. I think the minutes. Approval are, I'm not sure. What's the next agenda item, let me see oh and you can take back the sharing of the screen, Tia other Business Julia, opening it up for other business. Of course, I have an issue, I'm making a request that we explore again. The use of Zoom Webex is too chunky we're getting too many folks who can't get in for some odd reason that is unexplained. They have all kinds of issues with registration. I thought I was the only one complaining yesterday in the meeting. We had all kinds of complaints that board members could not get in to vote because Caroline, could you speak to that other community boards use zoom? The city council uses it. Yeah Taya could probably back me up on this, but so Zuma a gift to the Brooklyn community boards by the borough president, and even though there have been problems with it. The board leadership has opted to remain with it, because there's a feeling that in the beginning, zoom had some privacy issues and then Webex was more secure. So for the time being, the feeling is that we should remain with Webex. But of course it's a topic. That's always open to discussion, because the platforms are improving almost daily and John I'll bring it up at the executive meeting on Monday Julia. Could you please ask Carlton Gordon to explain all the difficulties we had yesterday in getting community members to be able to vote? Yes, I'm sure other people will chime in I think you're right I. Don't think that this is the easiest platform to use and the registration process is onerous as well. The zoom registration process, auto I, mean I. Don't know if that's a protocol decision, but in other community boards you just register and then you're automatically approved to join the meeting yep Community Board three is like that: yeah Webex doesn't allow that I wanna I agree that zoom is much better. I mean there is a waiting room and there is a way to control people coming in. But if we're a community meeting when we used to have an open meeting- or we just have a physical meeting, how could we keep anybody from walking in the door? So how can we what's the purpose of having registration? How why do we put the onus on somebody at the board to decide who to let in the only reason to have a waiting room is maybe to look for you know people are signing in without any identification, but I don't know how what the purpose of this pre-registration and I never got. An invitation I had to rush to get one today so everything's right in the in when I get invitations to zoom meetings. It's right there in the email and there's no reason to do anything but come on, and if you have a waiting room, then there's some way of checking, and this is what it looks like Juliet I would echo that also I think I had a hard time getting into the last meeting and I had to contact the board and I had to go on a different thing: the consensus of our committee, that it is difficult to operate on Webex and now, given the improvements and advancements of zoom and now that other community boards are evidently using zoom that we consider switching as well I'll make that case. So I think Taya made a comment that we've also reached out to do it and the borough president who've denied. The request was that yes, a lot of community boards have switched to zoom regardless. Was that a recent work request, because I'm considering it's only been a couple of months but I think within the last month we talked about it. Okay, so that's something to consider I see Caroline has having audio problems. So I'm going to read her a point of clarification. Bike Lanes Navy at Sands does that count as Navy Yard, Greenway or protected bike project. I know it counts as both okay. So oh there are recent crashes there. I was not aware of that, but I don't think she can speak. Oh, can you speak you're off me? Okay, great. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, excellent, yes, on the 9th of November, a car hit someone on a bike, a driver crashed into a cyclist and the cyclist went to the hospital. I, don't know what the outcome was, but I do know that intersection is dangerous. I do know. Rob did tell me that the the Navy Street improvements that they came to talk to us about have been put on hold until 2021. I. Don't think that is considered. Greenway I think that's considered bike lane that was Navy Street between Flushing and sands, but the Flushing avenue part is considered Greenway. Thank you for sharing that. You also had another comment. Caroling evictions, yes, I, wondered about. If you know a lot of you have lived in the neighborhood, much longer than I have and I wondered what past experience has been like with evictions happening in community district 2 and the response from the law enforcement and how we can wrap our heads around that, as housing court begins to open again and evict people. Does anybody with longer term experience than me and community party want to speak to that? I'm sorry, I didn't capture the entire issue, I, like with everything happening now with the police and relations between the police, they're, also the ones who are expected to draw out the evictions of people living in apartments and because there's no eviction moratorium right now. It ended October 1st, I'm concerned for our neighbors, who are housing insecure right now, and what evictions could look like well, I can't I certainly can't do the specific eviction piece, but I could tell you that there is a great move afoot to remove from the police all non-police activities so that they would not be arresting turnstile, jumpers and doing oi, and they would not be involved in with folks that have mental illness, because what that does is it puts them again, as we had the discussion earlier in the police system for an issue that is not police related and then the police have one response. Besides taking you to the hospital which is arresting you, and so you get people that have mental issues, that wind up having records and don't get the treatment, because the initial response is a police response, so we are actually looking at and you hear this mantra of cut the police budget. It's really not cut. The police budget is redirect resources to the areas that need them and stop the police from being made responsible for anything else. That no other city agency is made responsible, for that would mean opening up a lot of these agencies to 24-hour service that currently close at eight or nine o'clock at night or whatever. But you have that additional funding, supposedly taken from the police department that can be applied to other services. This is at the very beginning because they have to analyze all the service that the police are currently called for and determine how they're going to move those services elsewhere. Whatever that elsewhere is it's the beginning of a thought process around that, but I haven't heard anything specific to the police being involved in evictions. Where else would they go and Brian brought up a point on evictions enforcement just that that's handled by the sheriff, because it's a matter of civil enforcement, not criminal enforcement, okay well, either way it's law enforcement, yeah. So I guess! My question is in the past: has anyone in this entity seen an eviction happen and was it particularly violent or non-violent? Under Covid-19, you have to be crazy to go and try and forcefully remove people from their place with the danger of connect getting this disease so that whole component has I'm not even aware of what you just said, but I can't imagine that they're going to implement any measure that brings folk in contact with other folks where a mask isn't involved and there isn't some kind of decorum you're going into people's apartments. You don't know what they have going on. This is a health issue before to anything else. So, thanks for bringing that up, but I have not heard that moratorium was about to be lifted, I thought it was postponed until next year it was lifted either yeah, but I think you bring up. Go ahead. Evictions are happening across the state in Rochester and Albany and Troy, and there's no reason to think that Brooklyn won't be next yeah I think you bring up a good point. You know the community board doesn't like the issue of affordable. Housing is a priority with community board two, but it doesn't have a home. You know the interesting topic of homelessness being a public safety issue, really resonated with me when Miss Lewison brought it up and I think you're, trying you're somewhat saying the same thing with you know: evictions on being a public safety issue. It's it is a health issue, but it's you know it's a it. It's not just a mental health issue. It is critical for people have the to have those basic services that just basic to have a home, and so I mean I. Don't know that you know we can take on the whole topic of affordable housing, but I think homelessness is something that we can take on as a committee and that had been brought up a while back, but maybe that's something that we can have as an agenda item in the new year. Well, Julian. If I could add to that, we have a huge homeless problem on Flatbush avenue under that landing by Fulton Street, because it is covered. It tends to generate a very comfort area right near the entrance to the train station yeah Nevins. We have tried to get services to go over there and collect folks. We did this through Myrtle Avenue because we're having a problem on Myrtle Avenue. Also they tell us that it takes from eight to ten interactions with a homeless person to try to convince them to go and to wear a homeless shelter. Those places are not comfortable, so the problem of the homeless, again like we were talking earlier, is much deeper than identifying the homeless because they're homeless. For a particular reason, a lot of it is mental health and so that'll all have to be coordinated. So homelessness is an amalgam of things. There is no single solution and those solutions that have worked have taken minimum of eight visits to homeless, folks, who convinced them that the alternative is not going to be a homeless, shelter, yeah, maybe just thinking about what you're saying John. Maybe it would be interesting to do a joint committee meeting with the health and Human Services, Committee I, think that's absolute yeah, and if anybody has any ideas for organizations to reach out to, if you could email, Carol, Anne and cc me and Cheryl, that would be great. Carol Ann has an idea. Yes, hi. Yes, so in January the health Committee, Health and social services will be hearing from Canberra, which is a major housing provider, and they also deal with homelessness and people with mental health issues as well, so that will be first Wednesday in January and I'll. Send the committee a special notice when that meeting is being announced? Maybe would it be possible to have our committee meeting be joint with them sure we could talk about the logistics of that okay, all right community forum opening up to members of the community for other issues. You would like to bring up. You can just speak. You don't have to raise your hand, hi Christian, the same thing that I was posting in the chat before I'm curious about the open streets and whether there's going to be any increased enforcement in the future. Personally, my experience in Fort Greene, especially on the I, think south it's either South Oxford or South Portland between Fulton and Dekalb is often open. Drivers will come up, remove the barricades and just drive through at a high rate of speed, past pedestrians, who are walking in the middle of the street. I'm curious, if you know, there's any possibility to make this a little bit better as people you know, lose places to walk and lose outdoor comfortable spaces when, as we go into the winter months and as Covid-19 cases start to spike so more like institutionalizing the open streets, so that they're not just like a barrier that can be easily moved, is that kind of a proposal or just keeping cars out of them so that they are open to pedestrians? I know the open streets are still shared streets, and so, if somebody lives on the block or is moving into a yeah, I'm talking about through traffic, I'm talking about people who remove the who can very easily remove the barricades drive through at 25 miles an hour or more, and you know, leave the barricades open so that cars behind them keep going right. Isn't it open streets is a D.O.T initiative or as a city initiative, so I'm going to put it on my D.O.T list. Absolutely. This is Cheryl, there's absolutely no way and Sid. You can back me up on this because we live in Bournemouth, there's actually no way of stopping cars from coming through those shared streets. You know you put the barriers up, it says come true at five miles an hour. You can open and close it, but there is no way to stop them and I wouldn't suggest that anybody take it upon themselves to go out there to try to stop them, because Howard can tell you about what happened with him. So there's no way to enforce that rule. There's nowhere to enforce it. It's a shared. So it's not so we should just give up it's not a role. You're. Not I'm not saying you should give up. I'm saying it is the people who live in your communities and people like we say everybody should wear a mask. It's up to you to do it right. It's people should take the offensive. Like you, don't live in this neighborhood, but you're driving through the neighborhood. You see the barrier up. You come out of your car. You remove the barrier, take the time to close it back, but most of them don't and when you do go over to them and try to say hey, you know you should have closed the barrier. Oh no, it's war! So you get into arguments so we're like on our blog. We're like do not approach them. If they leave the block, if they leave it open because we've seen what happened, you know people get out of their cars and would assault you so Julie I want echo Christian's comment. We had that open street barrier on owl block and it didn't work really I. Think and it's correct. You can't really enforce it. Some people did put the barrier back, but then you have other delivery trucks coming through to deliver merchandise and stuff and they do it and sometimes they don't do it I. Think it's a good idea, but I have a hard time wondering how that could ever be enforced without getting yourself in trouble as Cheryl just mentioned. But it is a good idea. Well, I, don't know if it's an official rule with the city about the speed limit of being five miles an hour. I know that that's it was an interim rule and it's an interesting question. I must tell you I mean that unfortunately, I mean the one on Wykoff and Hoyt is probably one. That's moved a lot, but it goes back it's on it. You know it needs you move it back. I mean I, move it back, I, don't get in confrontation with people I just move it back now. I must tell you that there was a very bad crash, some with someone trying to go around one, the one on the corner, Voi of Wyckoff and Hoyt, that there were two cars seriously damaged because of somebody going around him and that that's probably a bad car, a good commerce for the person who did it but I, agree that if they're going to do it, there's got to be both an enforcement mechanism and a way of getting people to more to work with them. I mean the streets that work best are streets that really are not shouldn't be used as as through streets and where there's an easy alternative and that's obviously something the D.O.T should look at I mean it's something that they should study. If we're going to continue the program, there's got to be both an important, you know: look, we have cameras enforcing everything all over the place and that may have to become an enforcement mechanism for them too, and Brian you're next yeah I am I'm going to disagree with the need for greater enforcement. I use the open street on State Street, quite a bit, and every time I have ever biked down any block of that open street. I've had to put the barriers back and what they found. City-Wide is really that the open streets that work well are ones that tend to be. You know long stretches of streets as opposed to single blocks and that people can use like the ability to activate the space. So the ones that have worked out really well have had different neighborhood groups or different organizations take on maintaining them, often they're, actually bids. For the restaurant ones, as they do close some streets, restaurants, but that the ones that are essentially left to the NYPD doesn't fail and I think there are. They are looking at solutions now, but they're not going to be enforcement ones, they're really just going to be a matter of I know if you guys are familiar with like diverters and bike boulevards, but essentially at the end of every block. You can put you know a concrete curve or something that allows people to access each and every block. But if you want to drive down, you can't drive more than one block, you're forced to turn every block and I. Think if we're I know that those are this, those conversations are being had right now by DOT and other community groups, and really it's only a matter of filling the space with people or making it physically impossible for people to drive through them again. But you I, agree, I understand what that Christian was trying to say and Brian you're one of the few. Who would do that, but those street barriers it? It's us who live on the block, who put them out every morning, bring them move them over at night, and you would be surprised that we have lost the so many have been destroyed because the cars just drive over them, I'm not supposed to move them, they just throw them away and you want to close the block. Sometimes, if there's a kids on the blocks playing, but people just move the block and come down at 20 miles an hour, even although they see kids on the block you're like. Why is there a big sign that say street sharing five miles an hour? If you come into the block and the kid would see you that you're coming into the block? Slowly but hey, nobody cares. It I think is selfish, that somebody will drive down or block, remove the barrier and don't close it back. It's just selfishness and they don't care well, I. Think Brian's ideas of physical impositions into the space like the diverters or speed bumps or whatever was the terminology that you used will do the trick better than enforcement. So DOT I think that is a nice. It's our available delivery. We can't just close the streets off. Amazon delivers it on every block. Every day the Amazon driver is not going to get out his truck and then move the barriers and then go back after he's done the delivery. The street closure program was I, don't I think it's a good program, but there's no enforcement. It's not illegal to drive down the street and I. Think you're right, I think the enforcement is not the thing that we should be focusing on. I think we want to slow down the traffic, so the kids that are playing in the street are not going to be hit by the cars going 25 miles an hour, Julian, truly yeah. Sorry, you've been waiting just one last point, I'm on Willow, Street and Midog, and we had one we had to bury up and I put it back and forth many times. However, eventually it was totally destroyed, as Cheryl, complemented just totally destroyed by the trucks or other cars. I do think. John has a point in the age of Covid-19. Many people are getting much more deliveries at their home at the stoop level. You know in front of their home I think it's very difficult to keep these trucks from actually paying attention to it. After a while, it's a very difficult thing: it's a good idea. I'm not sure enforcement is the really the way I mean. Maybe O'brien's idea is what we should look at, but it doesn't work out. It was finally just towed away. It was just destroyed and gone so it didn't really serve its purpose yeah and now it's going to be 29 degrees. So it's not as it's not going to be as used as it was a little earlier, but Christian you brought up a topic. That was a very fiery topic. Thank you. Are there other community items that would like anybody would like to speak about it's 8 o'clock, so otherwise I will start to wrap up the meeting. I have one for other business, but oh yes, Brian go ahead, I'd rather anyone in the community who had an issue to speak before me. Okay, I, am on Twitter. A I saw a tweet a couple weeks ago from someone from a woman who was biking in Clinton hill and had a terrible interaction with drivers who, essentially, you know, harassed her just because she was biking and then when she gave them the finger they got out of their car and you know tried to assault her and her husband and then spit in her face, and certainly you know, we as a community board, can't prevent people from being sociopaths and aggressive drivers, but I told her that I would relay what she had written to. The committee and I know that in particular, because I want to say when we don't have protected bike lanes and space that people can bike in and not have to worry about, being harassed or passed aggressively by drivers. These interactions are more likely. I was wondering if I could share the twitter thread with the committee. Please do thank you. Juliet I have one more issue. I would like you to bring to the executive committee, one Second John Brian's still sharing. Okay, oh I. I've shared the thread in the chat and that's all I have to say. Thank you, okay got it. Thank you. Yes, John very quickly. We have at last count. I was told 1400 people on our email feed with a community board comprised of 140,000 people. We don't have a mechanism of communicating with the larger community. We have only that very small, less than one percent of folk on the email feed I've discussed this a lot. Can we get a twitter feed quickly we're in the age of Covid-19? There is a lot of information that we need to be communicating with our community relative to this pandemic. That is not going away for years and we have to be more engaged with our community. We are not engaged enough to penetrate enough of our community. Why can't we get a twitter feed that just spews out information that the community needs to know about? Does the district office have? Is it something that you guys are working on just in terms of general communication? It might not be twitter, it might be Instagram whatever it might be social media. You know, there's been a lot of technology movement lately, yep Taiya. Would you like to take that sure? I just wrote this in chat as well. Digital communications is being addressed in two and actually three other committees. The website revision is currently underway and social media is going to be launched by or before January. Thank you, Tia. No problem look forward to seeing what you guys are going to be doing with that. Thank you for that update great and just before we close out the meeting. The minutes I just wanted to note John, there's a Lorem ipsum in the minutes other than that. If anybody else has comments on the minutes, please email the district office and, with that I'll take a motion to adjourn John. Thank you. Cyril and I wish everybody a wonderful thanksgiving, whether you're spending it with family Julia, Holiday, Happy, Thanksgiving Healthy one. Thank you bye. Everybody bye, everyone thank you bye-bye and for organizing everything today. Thank you. It was great. Thank you. Taya I agree, bye-bye happy, Thanksgiving stay safe.
