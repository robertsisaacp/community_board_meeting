I, want to thank everyone for joining this evening's community general meeting.
I serve as a chair of community Board too, and what I would like to do at this time, in accordance with our agenda.
Is turn to my good friend Toby, to give us a presentation or update on the Pacific park, more commonly known to some people as Atlantic Yards, but Atlantic yards encompasses compasses, a lot, and so with that Toby the floor is yours.
I hope you and yours are doing well in these very interesting times that we're living in as chair single Terry mentioned, my name is Toby Jaisimi I serve as the Ay CDC director and project director for Esd Empire Development, which is the governor's economic development agency on the state.
You'll, be hearing from Scott a little bit later after I finished the introductory portions of this presentation, so Esd Empire State development is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of the development of the Atlantic yards.
There have been significant upgrades to long island, railroad, train yards, the addition of a new substation, significant infrastructure, work, the West Portal access point, and then there will also be eight acres of publicly accessible, open space and community amenities, such as a DOE middle school, a health care facility which is already opened and being operated by New, York Presbyterian at V3, and a community center which is planned for one of the future sites.
As I mentioned, earlier, the Atlantic yards project was approved by the Esd directors and in 2014 there was a subsidiary established, the aycdc, the Atlantic Arts Community Development Corporation, which serves in an advisory capacity to the Esda directors.
Meeting information are usually distributed to the community via email and also available online at Esd's website in term.
Now going to turn to my colleague, Scott Solish who's, going to provide a more in-depth presentation on the construction activity and the project's development.
Well, as the completed rail yard, the Carlton Avenue Bridge and the projects that are currently under construction.
There are currently four completed: buildings, 550, Vanderbilt, 535, Carlton, 38, 6Th, Avenue and 461 Dean Street, the Barclays Center, and there are currently four buildings under construction, so the first building I want to mention is B4, also known as 18 6th avenue.
So and we've been going through all the ongoing punchless work to close this out, but we're glad that all this work is has been completed and the railroad is now fully in control of this project.
Right now, as well as planning work happening in the office.
So I just wanted to go through some of the metrics of where we stand as a project right now in terms of completed housing.
What was the AMI distribution, so the b3 and D14 were built used with in partnership with New York, City, Housing, Development, Corporation and city community capital, using you know, a bond financing program.
I want to remind board members that Mr Dwight Smith serves as the community ward 2 representative and, as you all know.
In fact, and so we want to thank Mr Smith for his work and being our representative John, Vaughn Dunn, and so with that, I'm.
Pacific park is different from other projects, given the general project plan and the conflicts of the the zoning through the design, guidelines, and so we're always looking to figure out ways to deliver larger units within the confines of the project, and we continue to look for opportunities to do so.
And, we're always in conversations with the city and state agencies, the affordable housing agencies regarding opportunities to work together to finance these projects, to try and get the right mix of AMI's to get to get units to places where they're needed, most, especially in a public private project such as this.
It just means that we're going to continue to work over the coming months to try and meet the goals and meet the demands of the neighborhood and the community.
Think, if the vault, the buyers qualified and you know, work through all the process, that's laid out by the attorney general of New York that oversees condominium offering plans.
Therefore, the district manager and our colleagues who are on the phone carol and Church and Taylor, whose background you know handling all the technology we can identify, who you are continue to move in a very expeditious manner through the meeting without having any glitches.
Next Tuesday night with assembly, women elect Ferris, Front Forest and some healthcare advocates regarding the New York Health Act, I'm, going to drop a link to that in the chat.
If you are looking for work with the hottest state, Senate team coming into Brooklyn, I'm going to drop a link for that in the chat as well, and please reach out to us.
And, if you're, not interested in the full-time work but want to, you know, still be part of the team.
We appreciate you being a part of this night tonight's meeting and we look forward to working with you as you represent us in Albany.
One I want to take the time which is customary for us to acknowledge, thank and appreciate all of our veterans.
I may not have the opportunity to thank you tomorrow for your service to our country, but wanted to take this moment to acknowledge, although the veterans, whether you are directly on the phone, whether you have family members who serve you, can never thank the people who provide service to our country and put their lives on the line for our safety and comfort.
The new format is a bit of an adjustment and we will get that out to board members as soon as possible and just to remind everyone, I, have been very intentional and somewhat say, deliberate about working with the office about revamping the report, one so that it would be more encompassing of what everyone in the office is doing and not so much having everything rest on the shoulders of the district manager, but also a way of giving a better insight for the type of issues.
And, so I, I'm, happy to say that working with the entire office, we are making progress and modify modifying the with the district report and hopefully, you'll recognize the difference when you receive it, but like an old commercial cell, will serve no wine before it's time.
This time, I'm, going to turn it over to Mr John Quint, who serves as the chairperson of our nominating committee.
Anybody wants to be heard, put your name in the chat box and I'll, give a chance for anybody to appear if not and then going to ask for hands.
Anybody, who I'm going to ask for a motion to close the nomination for each position and then for a second I'll, announce them based on the hands that I see.
Launching this as a new program and they're, going to partner together trained professionals to work with and really not just respond like in emergency settings, but really be there in the park.
We had a normal slew of liquor licenses that all got approved at the at the November meeting, and then we had a long discussion with the Tillery hotel who residents have raised concerns about the noise coming out of their second floor.
Brandon I appreciate the report, he's got you and your team keep doing good work for the community.
Your committee- continue to meet and do a lot of work.
Unfortunately, no community board members will be granted access to the pool other than that we will be meeting next week on the 18th.
Tell you in a couple of minutes, because, right before this meeting started, I went online and got some incredible information, and it's all thanks to Taya.
It's been two years in the making, but I just wanted to share that information with my committee and any members who didn't know that.
They also work with Fort Greene Park to do the community heroes and they're, also offering online programming.
This is where I'm really excited thanks to Taya, as you can see, we're honored to have the capital budget director from the Brooklyn borough president's office, Candace Julian, and we're all coming prepared with questions for her to see how the capital funding impacts on our city, parks.
We can work on shortening getting a shortened url for it, but if you put in Google a community board to Brooklyn New York, you will go to our wonderful calendar.
I think is just another example of how well the office is working together to provide us with more tools that bring about a level of excitement within the board and within the community, and this will allow us to be able to serve our constituents in a greater capacity.
The state would authorize a program that would have the city for going restructuring property taxes and reducing those in exchange for an understanding between property owners and commercial tenants that they get a long-term, affordable lease in place that restructures any arrears and also provides long-term stability for small businesses that are so committed critical to our community.
I'm sure you've talked about this a little bit tonight, but Covid-19 numbers are going.
I, don't know, I, don't think any of them are in the CB2 area, but we do all need to continue to just you.
I know you have a busy agenda and wants to talk about, but I'm happy to have questions if people have them for is taking the time to update us and brief us on the things that are happening throughout the state and again.
We heard a quite an extensive report from the Brooklyn public library, so I'll focus on that during the Covid-19 times, they've been exploring and implementing new ways to offer their services virtually and.
They talked to a great length about the capital projects in our district, so I want to report on them.
They can leverage the collection of the Brooklyn historic society, as well as the Brooklyn collection in the central branch, which will be moved to Pierpont, I, believe and use that for research into you know the neighborhoods and communities and history of our borough because of the Covid-19 they had to close the Ramson Street temporary branch.
So before we get to the next item on the agenda, which is open, session, I do want to take this time.
It's customary when we are meeting in person to give a moment for the dignitaries who've signed up to speak this evening and at this time I'm going to call on our Caroline Church to call the names of the dignitaries I'll remind you, that.
So you know, we've been going through a lot of trauma, both experience and felt, and we do have a hotline 888, New, York, City.
On average every day we respond to six to nine emergencies, local emergencies, helping people with financial assistance, housing, mental health situations at any rate, I, don't want to keep going on and.
And, it's good to see people active and working in the community like this and know that there are people out there who are volunteers like yourself who are on the streets and helping people in need.
Let them know your desire to want to present, and in this order you should present to the health, environment and Social Services Committee.
Just let everyone know that our church continues to serve those who find themselves in places of Need, Monday, Tuesday and Friday.
You're, always welcome to have a platform at community Board, too, and I keep up the good work for whatever goes on in the Navy yard.
