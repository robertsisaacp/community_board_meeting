Oh seven I want to thank everybody. I want to thank everyone for joining this evening's community general meeting. I am winning Singleton I serve as the chair for Community War Ii I serve as a chair of community Board too, and what I would like to do at this time in accordance with our agenda, is turn to my good friend Toby, to give us a presentation or update on the Pacific park, more commonly known to some people as Atlantic Yards, but Atlantic yards encompasses compasses a lot, and so with that Toby the floor is yours and it's good to see your smiling face good evening chairman. It's good to see you as well hello. Everyone just give me a minute there. I'm going to share my screen, so you'll be able to see the presentation all doing well tonight. All right my screen should be sharing shortly. All right is everyone able to see the presentation not yet okay, there might be a delay and then just give me another second I see the presentation. Oh there, it is just absolutely either question: have we confirmed right? You have the capability as co-host or host able to in order to share your school. The presentation should be up now. Is everyone able to see it yeah now we're starting to come up we're starting to share now awesome well, good evening? Everyone, it's a pleasure to be before you tonight. I hope you and yours are doing well in these very interesting times that we're living in as chair single Terry mentioned, my name is Toby Jaisimi I serve as the Ay CDC director and project director for Esd Empire Development, which is the governor's economic development agency on the state level. Tonight I'm joined by my colleague in this development project, Scott Solis who's representing England USA you'll, be hearing from Scott a little bit later after I finished the introductory portions of this presentation, so Esd Empire State development is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of the development of the Atlantic yards project. While members of the board may be familiar with projects that go through the Euler process, the uniform land use review process. Atlantic Yards has something that we, you know easily call as the Gpps the general project plan. The general project plan is adopted by the Esp Board of directors after a full public review process and the finalizing of environmental impact statements is a map of the project. Atlantic yards is generally bound and known to start at the intersection of Atlantic and Flatbush, where you'll find the Barclay center on the Barclays Arena Plaza, as what we known know as B1 the there's, the ability to build a building there, but the plaza has come on to take a life it is of its own, and so this is where B1 is planned to be on the general project plan. This is site 5, which encompasses the Pc Richards and the models location and then just navigating around the map. We have here 461 dean, which is open and occupied known as b2 36, 38 6th avenue known as b3, which is open and occupied B4, which is under construction, you'll, hear more about that again from Scott and then just following through the circle of the map. We have sites b5 through b10, which would be developed over the long island railroad platform, and then we have b11 just 550 vanderbilt, which is also open and occupy sites 12 and 13 that are under construction. Currently, this is 535 Carlton, also known as b14, open and occupied, and this is site b15, which is currently under construction. Again, you'll hear more about that from Scott I'll note that the Atlantic yards project, as I mentioned through the Gpp process, was first adopted in 2006, and there were subsequent occasions in 2009 2014 and more recently in 2019. All of the relevant project documents and information are available on Esd's website. That site will be listed up on this slide shortly, but it's Esd at Atlantic Yards, I'm sorry, Tsd.Ny.Gov, Slash Atlantic, now in terms of the project itself and what it encompasses. It's a total of a 22 acre site and the Atlantic yards project. Of course the Barclay center is open. The arena was opened in 2012. there's the new MTA entrance, which comes into the arena. Plaza there's been significant infrastructure upgrades and improvements, which include a reconstructed, Carton, Avenue Bridge. In total, there will be 16 residential and commercial buildings. The project will deliver 6,400 residential units, 35 of which 2,250 units would be affordable. There have been significant upgrades to long island, railroad, train yards, the addition of a new substation, significant infrastructure work, the West Portal access point, and then there will also be eight acres of publicly accessible, open space and community amenities, such as a DOE middle school, a health care facility which is already opened and being operated by New, York Presbyterian at V3, and a community center which is planned for one of the future sites. Over the platform. The now, as I mentioned earlier, the Atlantic yards project was approved by the Esd directors and in 2014 there was a subsidiary established, the aycdc, the Atlantic Arts Community Development Corporation, which serves in an advisory capacity to the Esda directors. The aycdc is unique because it's governed by 14 directors, there are nine gubernatorial appointees, and there are five appointees from various elected officials. Brooklyn borough president is represented by Sy Richardson New York State Senate by John Heyer, the New York State Assembly by Gib Vacaoni, the New York City Council, is represented by Ethel Tius, and the mayor's office is represented by Lee Wachowski. The Aycdc meetings are available on webcast. The meeting information are usually distributed to the community via email and also available online at Esd's website in term. Because of the project's impact and the full scale of what's happening. There are a few efforts that we take on as it relates to community relations. One would be the two week look ahead, which is a document that serves as a summary of upcoming construction activity, so that residents and those in the area are aware of what's happening. If there are any major scopes of work, there are new changes to the development. The two-week look ahead is organized according to project site, so that you're aware of what's happening. If you live close to B4, if you live close to b15 you're able to note what the advancements are at those two sites, there's also the quality of life meetings. These meetings are held about bi-monthly their public meetings, which pre-covert 19 were held at the Shirley Chisholm State Office building and are currently being held. Virtually the next meeting is actually scheduled for Tuesday November 17th so a week from today and that will be held via virtual conferencing. I've provided the meeting information on the screen, but it's also available on Esd's website as well. I'll note that future aycdc meetings and quality of life meetings are still expected to be held quarterly. I'm sorry virtually and any information on those meetings again will be distributed to the community or and will be posted on Esd's website. I'm now going to turn to my colleague, Scott Solish who's, going to provide a more in-depth presentation on the construction activity and the project's development. Thank you Toby and good evening. Everyone hope everyone's doing well. Let me just take a moment here to share my screen. Oh all, right, I hope everyone can see the presentation. Yes, great okay, so thank you. Everyone thanks for having us tonight hope everyone is well and I'm glad to be with you virtually here. This is a picture recently taken from of Pacific park. Atlantic yards looking from Vanderbilt towards the west below you can see. 535 Carlton, as Toby said, was B14 one of the first. The building we first broke ground on in 2014. as well as the completed rail yard, the Carlton Avenue Bridge and the projects that are currently under construction. I'm sorry, let me introduce myself. My name is Scott Solish, I'm the executive vice president of development for Grem USA, I'm here on behalf of the joint venture, that's developing the project, Greenland far city partners and I'm here to give you an update on everything that is currently happening at the project. So, as Toby said, there are currently four completed buildings, 550 Vanderbilt, 535, Carlton, 38, 6Th, Avenue and 461 Dean Street, the Barclays Center, and there are currently four buildings under construction, so the first building I want to mention is B4, also known as 18 6th avenue. This is at the corner of Atlantic Avenue and 6Th Avenue. This building started construction in April of 2019. It will soon complete its superstructure work, so the concrete work will soon finish and facade work has been going on for several months now, so we expect again this building to top out later this year, with the facade work ongoing with, we expect some of the first apartments of this building to be ready about one year from now, maybe a little bit sooner it'll have approximately 860 units in on the building, with some retail at the base. This is right next to the Barclays Center kind of diagonal to this and across the street from 38. Sixth avenue is what we call b15, also known as 662 Pacific street, this building most excitedly besides, the architecture will have the new department of Education Middle School and that's at the lower four floors that you see here and I. Don't know if you can see my cursor, but everything that I'm kind of highlighting from this level down is the new department of Education, Middle school I think that they are calling Ms-1. So this building is 26 stories tall. It completed all of its concrete work. Several months ago, it is in the process of finishing the handblade brick patterning in windows and is also expected to open sometime next year. It's expected that the middle school will be the will be turned over for the FCA to do their fit out work and right now, I believe their schedule shows that the school will open in September of 2023. But obviously you know that's. The Sda and Department of education are fully responsible for that effort. Although the core and shell of the work has been completed, this project is being developed by the Broedca organization. This picture is again, it's another photo looking towards the buildings that are currently under construction, and you can see this construction equipment here I'll get to that in a second that's for b12 and b13, but I also want to highlight what you see here is an empty rail yard. But that's one of the key components of this project was the construction of a brand new storage and maintenance facility for the long island railroad. So it's got new modern infrastructure, new substation, new offices, new servicing equipment, new lighting, and so this these seven tracks were turned over to the long island, railroad in 2019. So and we've been going through all the ongoing punchless work to close this out, but we're glad that all this work is has been completed and the railroad is now fully in control of this project. So another great milestone here, as I mentioned right now, they're just working on the excavation. This is in between 550 Vanderbilt, B11 and and 535 Carlton B14. This is b12 and b13. These are two projects that are being developed by Tf Cornerstone as part of the overall project, so they broke ground on these in the summer of 2020, and work will be going on for the next approximately 24 to 30 months. I, don't have the exact schedule right now, but these are two rental buildings as well being built. In addition, they will also be building open space that will rank the current courtyards that are open next to 550, Vanderbilt and 535 Carlton and complete the first major section of the open space. That's another key component of this project. Additionally, while we've been working on the construction, we've also been planning for the future platform buildings you may have seen or may not have seen. The first building that will be developed as part of the on the platform will be the B5 project. So we are currently in the design and approval process with this, with both for the platform of the long island railroad and for the vertical buildings with the department of buildings. So the first one up is B5, which I'm moving. My cursor over here will be directly across from B4, which I showed the pictures of, and that's currently under construction, and then we'll continue moving from West to east down to Atlantic Avenue towards Vanderbilt. So this is a rendering of what the block may look like we're, also in pre-planning phases for b6 and b7. So, while there's actually while there are completed buildings that are filled with brooklynites, we're also currently in the construction of four projects and in the pre-development phases of the next three projects, so there's been a lot of activity going on, even through this horrible pandemic that we're all dealing with, but there's still a lot of construction activity happening at the site. Right now, as well as planning work happening in the office. There were some questions that we received in advance, so I just wanted to go through some of the metrics of where we stand as a project right now in terms of completed housing of. What's at the project right now, there's approximately 1300 apartments that have been completed actually 1282 of those that have been completed to date. 61 of those are affordable units, rent, regulated apartments and the other 39 are market, so b2,461 Dean Street is 50 market and 50, affordable, b3,535, Carlton, B3,386, Avenue and 535 Carlton are 100, affordable projects and 550 vanderbilt is a market rate condominium, so 61 of the units completed to date are affordable. Another question was of that of those units that were that are affordable. What was the AMI distribution, so the b3 and D14 were built used with in partnership with New York, City, Housing, Development, Corporation and city community capital, using you know, a bond financing program, so this graph shows that 32 of the units that have been completed to date of the affordable units of those 782, so 32 of them are 60, AMI or below a small sliver. 10 are in the 100 AMI range and the ballots are between 100 and 165 AMI. Other projects under construction you'll see that this would bring once we're completed these projects, adding what's what's finished to date, as well as the projects under construction, we will be of the total projects that are completed. That means that we will, then the ratio will change from what I showed you before of 61, affordable down to 57, affordable, 43, affordable and 57 being market and just to see. There was another question about well: how do those AMI units break down among unit sizes- and this is what's already being completed, working with HTC, so you can see here like for 38 six avenue. There were 14 units in the 40 AMI range and about one third of them, or a little bit more than one-third of them were two-bedroom and three-bedroom, and the city out of the 16 three bedroom apartments, they're spread throughout in an equal distribution based upon the number of units that each income band throughout each category. The one thing you'll notice, that's different here compared to between these buildings- is that 461 Dean Street does not have any three bedroom units. They only have studio one and two bedrooms, but the other units, the other buildings, do have three bedrooms so, but there's an equal distribution based upon the distribution of the units and the income bands, so Toby I'll just handle this. You know this is our contact information both for Esd, the Atlantic yards team, is on the left here. So that's the phone number for the Esd Office, as well as the email address and the website that has all the project, documents and information about company meetings, and here is the contact information for the joint venture of Greenland Varsity partners in our Clo office. So there's both an email address and a phone number and we received you know anytime. You have a question about ongoing work or upcoming work. Then you can feel free to call that number or send an email and we will respond as soon as possible. There is an office for the clo, that's at 550, Vanderbilt b11, but it's been closed for the most part. Since this whole thing started, so most people have been working from home, so we for the time being, we are relying exclusively on the phone and email but are trying to respond as soon as we get any inquiries or questions. So that is the presentation portion of the project. We can leave this up or take it down, but thank you for having us and happy to answer any questions you may have Scott I want to thank you and Toby for this presentation. I was very informative and detailed generally appreciate. This I want to remind board members that Mr Dwight Smith serves as the community ward 2 representative and, as you all know, if those who've had the opportunity to be witness to Mr Smith's presentation, it is always thorough and full of detail. In fact, and so we want to thank Mr Smith for his work and being our representative John, Vaughn Dunn, and so with that, I'm as customary to our meetings I'd like to ask if any community Ward 2 Board members Community Board, 2 board members. If you have any questions for the presentation or for the presenters, and so let's do this and I'm going to take a little risk tonight normally go through. Normally, we would ask the district manager to facilitate calling names by having people go through the chat, but I'm feeling a little risky tonight. So I'm going to ask individuals to ask their questions. Just unmute yourself. Ask your question when you're done so we can manage the background noise. If you wouldn't mind, go back on you. Is there any update on what's happening at the Pc Richards site? Who is that asking the question Sid Meier Hey Sir? Thank you one more thing. If you would introduce yourself so I can get familiar with the voice. Thank you. Sid said your background. Looks great I wish that I was on a beach or a tropical destination as well. That you know, of course, is virtual right. Yeah I know I'm of the travel constraints, so the Pc Richards and the model site which I presented at site five Esd about a year ago, had filed condemnation papers with the courts to move ahead with condemning that side. Esd is the state agency that has the ability to exercise condemnation powers and we also have the ability to override zoning for those who may not be aware, and so we filed those papers in the courts about a year ago, currently there's a separate litigation between Pc, Richards and Forest City, which has to do with a manner not related to Esd or with Greenland USA and Esd's condemnation. Proceedings have been stayed until there's resolution to the court litigation between foreign city, Pc, Richards and Forest City. That answers your question. Mr Singletary a question: it's Jessica hi, my name is Jessica Thurston. You know we hear a lot about the need for more three-bedroom, affordable units or three bedroom units in general. So what can be I just want to raise that issue, but also what can we do for the remaining units that have been designed or built? To advocate for more of that in this planning process? Sure I can have that speak to this, but it's it it's. The process is through the relevant public entities that fund the development of the affordable housing and also HPD plays a key role in the affordable housing lottery process. I think the question I. Thank you Jessica for the question and thank you. Toby I think your the comment is, we've heard the comment and the need- and we always try and accommodate it. Pacific park is different from other projects, given the general project plan and the conflicts of the the zoning through the design guidelines, and so we're always looking to figure out ways to deliver larger units within the confines of the project, and we continue to look for opportunities to do so because, even through the lease up I mean we saw the demand there. So you know as just as a business practice. We look to try and design things that meet the demand. So you know we try we're going to try and do that. To the greatest extent we can okay. Thank you. It's Hazra Ali. Is it possible to make this a copy of this presentation available to the board, so we can all have get a copy of it yeah. We sent a copy of the presentation to the district manager, I'm not sure what the process is for distributing the materials, but it it's available with the board and I'm happy to resend it. If that's the request. Okay, Toby. Thank you for sending the presentation we'll take care of distributing it so that I'll answer this question. Thank you. Sierra scholar, here good evening, I had a question about the fact that, since you're in the process of also building, are you making any provisions for climate change changes that have occurred since you started the project, certain things like renewables or solar, or things like that? Have you begun to look at that? Thank you for that question. Our project requires that we try to achieve weed silver and so right now that is our target and we're always trying to find things that are both energy efficient and as green as possible through the DOB. That are that you know. Sometimes the DOB code hasn't caught up to best practices so or new practices, so, but we're always striving for weed silver and actually Toby and I were just talking about the state's new greenhouse gas reduction plan. That includes buildings, as well as the city's new greenhouse gas and energy codes that are going to impact all buildings, both new and old, and so everything is trending in that direction anyway, and so we're going to continue to try and you know, achieve best practices and achieve the especially in those topics that it's just it's smart development have a question. Hello. Dad could Betty ask a question: yeah: okay, in the b 15 building, which includes the school, is there any open outdoor space for students to play in have recess? That type of thing? Is there any outdoor space? Yes, there is a private play yard just reserved for the students, it's on the fourth floor and protected from you know, protected on all sides, but open to tons of natural light and fresh air. So it's a private yard just for the students. Thank you. This is John Du speaking. First of all, one of your apartments was already featured on one of those million dollar apartment sales shows, so that's already a sign of success in 550 on your top floor. My question, though, is you mentioned the substation? Is it? Is Pacific park totally electric supply from an independent plant, or are you part of the what we know as Carnet grid? That's a great question and I should have been more clearer in my presentation, so the buildings are on the Con Edisonison grid. You know each building in New York City, when it's constructed basically pays for a new vault and a new transformer that they bring in, and then Kana provides power through the overall city-wide and regional grid. What we did as part of the long out the construction of the long Island railroad's new yard was install a new substation that provides upgraded power for the long island railroad operations, so they have their own substation within the yard. They've been running off of a very old substation going back decades, as well as some temporary power in like in these kind of mobile power trailers, and so through this project. As part of the creation of the new yard, we installed this new substation that is specifically for the use of the long island railroad to help improve their operations and the reliability of transit for New Yorkers. And can you speak to the affordable housing occupancy to date? And how do you determine who wins the lottery? Is there a community preference for community district two? So it's been a while, since the lottery is finished, all of the buildings were run through an HCC lottery. There was community preference because Pacific park touches so many community boards, both on what side of the project you're talking about. The community preference was spread throughout multiple community boards, but the lottery was done, overseen by Hdc and the affordable units are fully occupied and they have been for for a long time. So, even through the last six months, our occupancy has remained extremely stable, so we're very excited about the community we have in the building. It would be helpful if you could provide those statistics to the Community Board Office Mr Perry, so we could just- and we just want a general sense of the figures that you have described earlier and the types of folk that are being able to access those units miss Morales. You had a question: yes, hello, my name is Maisha Morales, so I understand you already have Va in my set when it comes to developing or am I, don't know correct me: if I'm wrong, is there any opportunity in the state of homelessness, especially with so many people that have you know that how Covid-19 has affected the economy any opportunity to lower the AMI, so we can have deeper affordability. We talk about affordable housing, it's affordable for who and we need to focus more on giving opportunities to low-income housing. So my first question is there room for that? Are you looking into that? The second question is as far as local hiring for the permanent jobs within the development. Are you working with any of the kind of job assistance organizations in the community? So I'll answer the the second question. First, thank you for both questions. Maisha I, hope, I said that right, yes, so in terms of local hiring, you right now with all the buildings are staffed by 32 BJ workers, so we rely on 32, BJ and their higher outreach, and so we're always looking for qualified people to come and work in any of the buildings for the building service staff and we're proud to be to work with 32bj and all the projects in terms of the AMI's. You know. Obviously we understand the need. You know as a Brooklyn resident myself. You know I totally understand the need and we're always in conversations with the city and state agencies, the affordable housing agencies regarding opportunities to work together to finance these projects, to try and get the right mix of AMI's to get to get units to places where they're needed, most, especially in a public private project such as this I mean obviously I. Think we all read the news that these last six or eight months have devastated our city and state budgets and with the state of the federal government as it is, it's been a challenge, but that doesn't mean that that's a final answer. It just means that we're going to continue to work over the coming months to try and meet the goals and meet the demands of the neighborhood and the community. Mr Singletary I had a question if I'm a Brandon's children. Thank you very much for your presentation. I just had a question about the market rate housing and the condominiums that you're offering are any of these condominiums sold on an all-cash basis, meaning without a mortgage attached to it, and if they are, is there any method or a practice that you engage in to identify who the people are buying the condominiums or where they got the money from yeah? So we've been, the condominiums have been for the most part are sold. There are a few left, I think, maybe one that was on million dollar listing that comes with hiring one of the people from the show, as your weed broker. So I don't have all the information, I'm sure that out of the 278 units, there were some that were done with all cash, but if there's still banks and title companies involved, but I don't have any specific answers about how many or if any or you know, but you know the buyers or the buyers backgrounds. Okay, just to clarify so I would I understand you don't have any details about how many there are, but you don't do any additional steps to identify who the buyers are. Is that what you're saying with respect to those I? Think if the vault, the buyers qualified and you know, work through all the process, that's laid out by the attorney general of New York that oversees condominium offering plans, then you know it will pass any condominium developments in the city's requirements. I don't have a specific answers for you, though, I'm sorry thank you. Listen again. Thank you both to you, Scott and Toby, for the presentation. This is very helpful. I believe it's answered for many of us some questions that were either not clear or had a certain amount of ambiguity, or in some cases we just weren't. Aware of so thank you for that. As always, you don't have to come back to us through invitation. If there's a need- and there are updates that are happening and that you feel a material just call the board office we'll be happy to give you the platform again. The collaboration is always best when it's proactive, because it allows us to get information together, but I will say once again: Mr Smith is doing a fantastic job as our representative and providing us with the information. So thank you both happy holidays and have a great evening. Thank you has been shared in the chat. So if folks have follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us, atlanticyard.esd.ny.gov or community liaison at pacificparkbrooklyn.com. Thank you and thank you very much for having me and I hope everyone has a happy and safe holidays with their families. Thank you. Happy veterans, Day to those out there. Thank you so, moving on with our agenda I'll entertain an approval of the agenda. Boring there aren't any additions, so someone can raise their hand or yell out vote, so moved Mr, Du. Second Mr Jordan. Is there any objections with the approval of the minutes? Saying none. Thank you. Has everyone had a chance? I'm actually I'm sorry has anyone. Yeah has everyone had a chance to review the minutes from our September 9th meeting? If there are any edits, I would encourage that you email the board office and our Secretary Jessica Thurston and then we'll address those as it's. There. Excuse me Lenny Storythea. There was one thing in the minutes: I just wanted to point out and Juliet's last name became Thompson Manning, so I think somebody can take care of that she's, not Juliette Thompson man, I, don't want to send that to the office. I think that's easy enough to take care of right away, yeah. No, we don't need to go through 23Andme to fix that. We can fix that. So thank you. I appreciate that catch. Thank you. Bye, you're welcome. So now we're moving into the chairpersons report. I really don't have much of a report this evening. I do want to mention one thing before we move forward outside of the gentleman that I'm about to acknowledge. If there are any of our community representatives, our dignitaries, those who are when we're in person those who are accustomed of signing the sign-in sheet, so that we can call you at the end of the meeting, to help accommodate that, if you would send your acknowledgement through the chat. Therefore, the district manager and our colleagues who are on the phone carol and Church and Taylor, whose background you know handling all the technology we can identify, who you are continue to move in a very expeditious manner through the meeting without having any glitches. So anybody who would do that I appreciate it at this time. I do want to acknowledge that our senator Elect, Jabari Bresport I hope. I'm saying that correctly is on the call and I did want to acknowledge that he is on the call, because you are still the Senator elect. You don't have a dedicated time slot, but I will give you a portion of my community with shared personal report. If you just wanted to give greetings and have everyone be familiar with your voice, all right. Thank you so much chairperson. So everyone I'll be brief, since the chippers and Singletary was so gracious with this time, I'll just take a quick minute, but I wanted to say hi everybody introduce myself quick. My name is Jabari Brisport Current middle school teacher in crown heights, but starting January, the incoming state senator for the lovely district 25 pleasure to be here. Thank you all for being on the call. I'm excited to work with y', all and I hope you all were able to breathe a good sigh of relief after last week and I just want to share a few things: real, quick. If health care is important to you- and you know, you believe we need to rethink about how we do healthcare, I'm doing a town hall. Next Tuesday night with assembly, women elect Ferris, Front Forest and some healthcare advocates regarding the New York Health Act, I'm going to drop a link to that in the chat right now and also I am hiring. So if you are looking for work with the hottest state, Senate team coming into Brooklyn, I'm going to drop a link for that in the chat as well, and please reach out to us looking forward to hearing from you and if you're, not interested in the full-time work but want to, you know, still be part of the team. We are looking for volunteers as well too. So thank you for your time and contact information is in there too, but also type that the chat and have a great, oh I, sent the prize as a private message. I'll send them to everyone and have a great night everyone. Thank you Jabari. We appreciate you being a part of this night tonight's meeting and we look forward to working with you as you represent us in Albany. So thank you. I, don't have much of a chairperson's report this evening, but I do want to continue to do a few things. One I want to take the time which is customary for us to acknowledge, thank and appreciate all of our veterans. I may not have the opportunity to thank you tomorrow for your service to our country, but wanted to take this moment to acknowledge, although the veterans, whether you are directly on the phone, whether you have family members who serve you, can never thank the people who provide service to our country and put their lives on the line for our safety and comfort enough. So I want to make that statement clear and then I also wanted to just remind everyone that, as we enter or should I say as we are in the flu season, it is important for everyone to be as diligent as possible with your health. Let's do all we can to comply for the recommendations that help with achieving those goals as far as wearing masks and washing your hands and keeping a safe social distance, and if you, those who can and are comfortable get the flu shot. I mean it's important, probably now more than ever, to get the flu shot so and take as many preventative measures to ensure a good health as we go into these winter months. So with that concludes my chairpersons report. I'll. Take the opportunity now to turn this portion of the agenda item number four to the district manager. Robert Paris, Mr Singletary, as you know, and I'm happy to share with the board members staff and you and I continue to work on a revised district office report. We'd hope to send that out on Friday. Then we hope to send that out today. The new format is a bit of an adjustment and we will get that out to board members as soon as possible and just to remind everyone, I have been very intentional and somewhat say, deliberate about working with the office about revamping the report, one so that it would be more encompassing of what everyone in the office is doing and not so much having everything rest on the shoulders of the district manager, but also a way of giving a better insight for the type of issues. Questions comments, information that comes out of the office that unless you have the opportunity to sit in the office and witness sometimes the report doesn't always tell you that and so I, I'm happy to say that working with the entire office, we are making progress and modify modifying the with the district report and hopefully, you'll recognize the difference when you receive it, but like an old commercial cell, will serve no wine before it's time. So I'm glad that we're taking the time to get it right. Next, up on the agenda item number five committees for action. At this time, I'm going to turn it over to Mr John Quint, who serves as the chairperson of our nominating committee. Thank you Lenny. As you all of you know, you received the notice in your board packet and I remind those new to the process and those who forget from year to year that this is the only time when we have nominations. We, the nominating committee, doesn't make the nominations. We sit to receive the nominations and then to process them and bring them to you so and I want to tell everybody that to ease everything, if you use the chat box, I'm following it and I will recognize anybody who appears in the chat box and wants to be heard. We've you we receive nominations only from the end officers, so the four your four officers, Mr Singletary Mr, Jordan, Ms, Zayler, Gringer and Miss Thurston- have each put their names in the nomination for the position they already hold, I'm going to open the floor and, as we always do, what I will do is I'm going to open the floor for any other nominations? If anybody wants to be heard, put your name in the chat box and I'll give a chance for anybody to appear if not and then going to ask for hands. Somebody I have a screen in front of me. Anybody who I'm going to ask for a motion to close the nomination for each position and then for a second I'll, announce them based on the hands that I see. You don't have to put that in the chat box and then we'll move on to the next office, so we can do this as efficiently as possible. So, as I said, the only nomination for chair is the new Singletary I see no one. Is there anyone else who seeks to put another name in nomination? Seeing nobody in the chat box can I have a hand for somebody who wants to move to close nominations: Mr Harrison, a second who else is raising their hand, Mr Smith and since there's only one nomination, I'm going to just ask for show hands all in favor to close nominations. The eyes have the are closed. Now we have. The only nomination for first vice chair is for Miss Leonard Jordan Jr I see no other nominations appearing in that chat box. I'll wait a few seconds seeing nothing a hand, a motion to close nominations: Mr Scala, a second from Miss five Bush all in favor, raise your hands. Thank you. The only nomination for second vice chair is Barbara. Zayler Gringer I see no other nominations. Anybody. Now anybody wants to move to close nominations. My miss Quint has raised her hand, Mr Cohn, a second thank you all in favor, raising your hands high passes and now the only nomination we have for Secretary Jessica Thurston I see no one coming up in the chat box to want to take her on a motion to close from Mr Laszlocki, a second from Mr Meyer All in favor raise your hands. Thank you all. So we have. The four incumbents have been nominated. We will actually go and elect them at our December meeting and at which time we'll do it even quicker, because our bylaws say when there's only one candidate, our secretary will cast the vote for the entire board. So that concludes my report. Thank you, Mr Singletary. Thank you. Mr Quinn and I appreciate everyone for making sure that, although we are virtual and I'm not sure when the bylaws were written, they were they took into account virtual meetings. We are doing as best as we can to adhere to the bylaws and I want to thank you all for participating in that effort. So thank you again, Mr Clint and to all the members of the committee which are Mr Brendan, Smith, Miss, Esther, Blunt to John Harrison, Mr, Theater, Thompson, Manning, no relation to Julia Thompson, Manning, Miss, Catherine, Yearwood, Young and Mr Allen Washington. So thank you all for serving on that committee. I appreciate your time and effort moving along with item number six on our agenda committees to report. First up is Mr Bill Folenoy economic Development and employment. Mr Singletary Bill Flenoy had technical issues and was not able to join the meeting if Ms Peterson is on the call she can perhaps report on behalf of the committee. Let the minutes reflect. This is the first time we don't have any voice from the Economic Development Committee I knew something was strange: I didn't from bill all meetings, so I'll. Let the committee read it Mr chairman: yes, it's Ms Peterson. How are you and everyone I'm well? How are you I'm glad you can make it well. I've been here, but unfortunately I'm glad you can make it whether you were here or beginning or not. I'm glad to hear your voice. Are you going to give a report? Yes, no well, I don't have one to give because I was excused from the meeting last week, so I apologize for that and my chair and I haven't gotten the opportunity to talk about exactly what happened, and so my apologies. So we need to we'll find a way to make sure that we get the report. If, when you have a written report, you would give that to the board office. That would be fantastic. Absolutely. Thank you. Okay, Next committee to report is health environment and Social Services Mr Brandon Smith Good evening everybody nice to speak with you again. There's been two meetings, I believe, since the last time that we spoke, I will just briefly give an overview about them, because we've already been through some discussion at executive and at the committee to a great degree, but our October meeting featured Rosamond Fletcher and some other really excellent staff from the Fort Greene Park Conservancy, who spoke about a really dynamic, great program that they're doing in light of you know all the concerns that have been raised about NYPD, responding to mentally disturbed individuals and disastrous results. Pursuing they're engaged in a process that, where mental health professionals go out into particularly Fort Greene Park they're. Launching this as a new program and they're, going to partner together trained professionals to work with and really not just respond like in emergency settings, but really be there in the park get to know these people establish relationships with them and and build a build, a network among them so that, in the event that something gets escalated in the future, it can be. It could be handled by better trained professionals and I think it was a really wonderful presentation. We had a good Q&A with those folks and really look forward to seeing what they're able to do. We had a normal slew of liquor licenses that all got approved at the at the November meeting, and then we had a long discussion with the Tillery hotel who residents have raised concerns about the noise coming out of their second floor. Beer garden, and our committee has had five meetings over the course of five years with the Tillery Hotel and the different concerns raised by residents, which are mainly associated with this beer garden and the hotel had promised not to play music out of the off of the beer garden because it faces directly on this residential neighborhood. But it seems after the Covid-19 restrictions were lifted and they were allowed to go back into business and do some kind of outdoor serving. They really picked it up with a fair amount of music and it went against what they had agreed to do with our committee in the past. So over the course of about an hour's discussion with the Tillery and the residents. It came to be the case that, despite the resident's concern, children still insisted on going forward with several events that they had booked for the month of October, and our committee voted and agreed to send a letter to the state liquor authority, notifying them that they were not in compliance with their liquor license. So that was our November meeting in just last week. It was really a really exceptional meeting and really hats off to the board staff. For arranging this, we had the unique opportunity to have the department of the City Department of Health come in and really do a retrospective on the entire Covid-19 crisis. Lessons learned different different ways in which they're trying to reach more at-risk populations and how what we can expect in the future. It was really an incredible conversation. I encourage anybody, who's interested to go, look it up on the YouTube archive and we had another group of liquor licenses which we we approved in large respect. So, overall, it was a really a great couple of meetings and you know again encourage anybody to go to the YouTube archives and check them out. Thank you. Brandon I appreciate the report, he's got you and your team keep doing good work for the community, so thank you as everyone is doing, but you in particular you and your meeting. Your committee continue to meet and do a lot of work. So thank you. Next committee to report is land use, chairs, Mr, Carlton, Gordon hello. Can everyone okay, great? Thank you all right. So last month we met and we approved a landmark preservation. Commission application for 81 Pip one play street and 35 love lane. There's a joint project on that one for two buildings will be combined. The highlight of that is, will be a they'll, be building a basement swimming pool. Unfortunately, no community board members will be granted access to the pool other than that we will be meeting next week on the 18th and we are scheduled to have a Euler application for 69 Adams Street, the property there. That wants to do some larger work there and there's also going to be a presentation, that's supposed to be scheduled from department of City planning for the zoning. Okay, it's a lot of work. Zoning coastal resiliency because we want to try to get essentially the prevent what happened at the last hurricanes, which was a lot of it especially was flooding into Dumbo. So they're looking to try to do a coastal resiliency to try to stop when the waters are starting to come up, they'll still have a place to you know, be able to enjoy the waterfront but will be more resilient. For you know, trying to let's say flood us, you know especially flooding people's properties and basements while I have you here. I was someone that asked me who came up to me on the street and asked if there is a I'm trying to say: hey: oh, yes, food Stamps office, someone came up to me off the bus and asked me if there's a food stamps office in our neck of the woods anyone's anyone know if that's I couldn't answer the questions. Does anyone know if somebody wants to apply for food stamps? Can they get it done in our area or, yes, it is okay. Great, do you want to know where? Yes, that would be nice? Oh, but I'll keep it in mind for future because it really is so the better way for them to apply. They can apply through their mobile phone or they can apply by telephone which is really encouraged, but if they want to go in Mr Harrison John hold on before you do, that can I ask you to follow what has been a loose the technical protocol, in the sense that the information you're about to share verbally. Can you just put that in the chat, so that way, it'd be easier for everyone to gather it? I'm unable to do that. I'm unable to do that at this time: Mr, Chair! Okay! So if you look in the chat, Taya I believe has listed the site from the city that allows you to get snap benefits in the food program page so Carlton. Do you see that I see 495 Claremont revenue, that's correct! Okay, that's it all right, and so now that it's been confirmed by Mr Harrison, you now have any information. All right, then I can keep that in mind the next time. Somebody comes up to me and asks me because I assume I somehow get these questions, while I'm walking to the subway, but thank you I get it so in context with the agenda. Do you have anything else to report on? No, that's that was it okay! Thank you moving along parks and Recreation Ms Barbara Salad Gringer. Thank you, Mr Chair good evening. I want to start and end this presentation with a major thank you to Tia, Mueller and I, can't tell you how excited I am I'll. Tell you in a couple of minutes, because, right before this meeting started, I went online and got some incredible information, and it's all thanks to Taya. Anyway Taya. Let me give credit to Taya she put together this lovely presentation. We want to invite everyone to come to our meeting. Our next meeting is next Monday. The 16th I'll get to it in a minute and existing board members. If you're looking for a second committee to join, please come and we'd love to. Have you I find that, even if you're not fascinated by parks, once you get involved, you understand how wonderful they are and how important they are to our to our city and to life here, I'm showing this screen in case you haven't, walked past the municipal building. Lately it has been renamed in honor of Justice Ruth, Bader Ginsburg. We had discussed this at our meeting in September, which took place only a few days after she died. So this is a wonderful development. It's been two years in the making, but I just wanted to share that information with my committee and any members who didn't know that yet so I wanted to talk briefly about our meeting on September that took place on September 21st. We highlighted Photoville. The exhibit is still on to the end of November 29th until November 29th the end of the month. If you haven't had a chance to look at it, it's all outdoors, it's perfect for Covid-19 times the photographs are fabulous. You can find them in Brooklyn bridge park. Here you see under the Brooklyn bridge and also in Dumbo they're, really fascinating. They also you're, probably familiar with fotoville. They also work with Fort Greene Park to do the community heroes and they're also offering online programming. At our meeting, we also had a presentation on Golconda Skatepark if you've never been over there, it's between it's, the intersection of Nasa and gold streets under the BQE, it's a great place for people to skateboard. We, some of us have visited it and they have a a friends group that looks after the place, they're very good about taking care of it as a result of our discussion with them, we have put in into our district statement of me needs a request for winterizing their bathrooms. It's one, pork that is used all year round. So, if you haven't been over there, you might want to and you're interested in skateboarding you might want to go over there. At our last meeting on October 19th, we had a presentation from playground NYC, which is a non-profit group that operates child directed adventure play yards where children can modify and create their own environments. They're very much as you can see in this picture. They encourage kids to not to be scared, but to take advantage of what they have and to try new things. Their lead project, you might say, is the yard at governor's, island they've, operated that for four years and they're very proud of that. So we're they did a pop-up program right at the tip of cove at the beginning of Covid-19 or right before it at outside city point. You might have seen it and we are going to be in continued discussion with them, we're hoping that they will bring one of their projects here to community board 2 and possibly in one of our playgrounds or parks. So more on that to come. Then. Finally, our next meeting- and this is where I'm really excited thanks to Taya, as you can see, we're honored to have the capital budget director from the Brooklyn borough president's office, Candace Julian, and we're all coming prepared with questions for her to see how the capital funding impacts on our city parks. Now the really exciting part is I can now say. Thanks to Taya, you can go to community Board 2's website. All you have to I. Don't it's a long website address? Maybe we can work on shortening getting a shortened url for it, but if you put in Google a community board to Brooklyn New York, you will go to our wonderful calendar. You can click on the date of next Monday and sign up right. There register for the meeting. That is fabulous, so thank you, Taya and I'm so done. We're happy that you you're excited and passionate. More importantly, we're glad to hear you, because typically we don't see that luckily, but in the middle of Barbara's, excitement I think is just another example of how well the office is working together to provide us with more tools that bring about a level of excitement within the board and within the community, and this will allow us to be able to serve our constituents in a greater capacity. As I've said in the past, this pandemic has been difficult, but there are a lot of good things that are coming out of it depending on the lens and the optimism you have and the technology is wonderful because it clearly brings out better participation from the board in the community. You can see how excited I am so thank you again and I encourage everyone to follow up and if you have the time, participate in the parks and Recreation committee meeting next item and next committee to report is a transportation and public safety. I don't see Julia Cullen Chung, but perhaps the co-chair is on as well Lenny. This is John Quint I, don't see Cheryl either, but I'm the secretary, if you want I'll, give a quick report on our two. The two meetings we've had since the last board meeting actually absolutely before you do that. Senator Kavanagh is on the line and he is making multiple stops tonight. If it's possible to give him a few minutes. That would be great I yield absolutely Senator. Cavanaugh. Thank you for joining. Are you in a rush or can I get Mr Quinn? To give his brief report, I could wait for his decline. Quentin, that's I, do have a few stops but I think you'll. Like his report. His reports are usually great, I. Think you'll, like it yeah I'm going to give it a try. I wasn't planning to speak at all in our September meeting. We heard from the Revel scooter people who are back on the street and they told us all about all of their plans to make sure that people wear helmets and people don't leave their scooters in the wrong place. At our October meeting, we heard from captain Rayna of the 84th who talked about the problems that every precinct is facing and what's especially facing our precinct in regard to gun violence, and we also heard at the October meeting from the Brooklyn bridge the Brooklyn forest, the Brooklyn bridge forest proposal, which is for a redesign of the walkway of the Brooklyn bridge, which includes basically taking over. It involves the roadway also because one of their plans, which they're pushing is to turn one of the Manhattan-bound lanes of the bridge of the vehicular part of the bridge into a dedicated bikeway. There you'll see the minutes that will describe it all, but that's what the committee did and we meet again a week from Thursday and everybody is invited to join. Thank you. Mr Quinn I appreciate you giving a report Senator Cavanaugh again glad that you can make the meeting in person and the floor is yours, I think you're on mute with Senator Cavanaugh thanks. Is that better yeah? Thank you it's great to be with all of you, and that was indeed a great report. Well, we well worth waiting for so I, just I'm going to just a few brief updates. You know I just to begin by thanking all of you for convening tonight and for all the you know, work you do to keep our communities informed and connected, even in spite of difficult challenges and for the opportunity to speak with you briefly. So just a few updates. First of all, you know, as the housing chair I've spoken with you about this before, but very focused on the housing aspects of the Covid-19 crisis. We really are to make sure that this public health and financial crisis doesn't become a homelessness and eviction crisis. So we have pushed very hard for a moratorium on evictions to remain in place that we called for that almost immediately when the crisis descended on us and it's been extended in various ways by a combination of gubernatorial executive orders courts, it is not, it is no longer a blanket moratorium and evictions. There is some processing of eviction cases that is permitted to happen, but tenants still have lots of rights, including extended periods to respond to the cases. But people should you know. Tenants should understand that the courts are now functioning. At least you know slowly, and so they should be. You know if they're getting notices from their landlords. They should neither assume that the landlord is correct, that they can be pushed out, nor that they can simply ignore it. Because of the moratorium. We passed a piece of legislation called the tenant Safe Harbor Act, which says that rent arrears that are caused by Covid-19 because of a hardship can not be the basis for an eviction now or ever, and the governor has extended that through an executive order to include arrears that predate the Covid-19 pandemic. So, there's a lot going on there. It's, unfortunately, not as easy to summarize than I would like it to be, because I would. What I would like it to be is to say a blanket, no eviction moratorium in place, and we have legislation that would do just that. There are a couple of bills, including one that I sponsor and one that my colleague zellner my response that would statutorily create a comprehensive moratorium. We will continue to work on that and continue to urge the governor to to you know gives tenants the strongest predictions possible during the public health crisis. At the same time, we still are working on our effort to cover the cost of rent to cover the cost of this long term. That is going to require substantial input. Financial assistance from the federal government I think I've talked about this here before, but we have been pushing for 100 billion dollars from the federal government nationally to cover Rent New York might get as much as 10 billion. Of that, that's our ask, and that should allow us to pay the rent of all the tenants statewide who have been unable to cover their rent because of hard financial hardship. Obviously, if this crisis continues, that number may grow, but we are hoping that the next round of stimulus will include that, similarly, we're still pushing for what we call the recovery lease act, which is intended for commercial residents, the state would authorize a program that would have the city for going restructuring property taxes and reducing those in exchange for an understanding between property owners and commercial tenants that they get a long-term, affordable lease in place that restructures any arrears and also provides long-term stability for small businesses that are so committed critical to our community. I know this is a nonpartisan setting. I will say that, in my view, last week's election results gives us a white house that I think is going to be more attuned to the needs of localities and hopefully, if not, if not soon. At some point, we will get real relief for our government agencies that have our government budgets and also for tenant protections and other critical needs. Just a few other items. We are still working on a bill. A couple of bills related to the BQE, including a bill to allow this city to in effectively enforce or overweight truck restrictions. They are a real reason why the BQE is in as bad shape as it is, and we think we can extend the life by having effective enforcement there and the goal is to create an enforcement program that does not require stopping the traffic and taking the truck off the road, but allows sensors in the road to actually they're called way in motion systems and they allow enforcement that needs to be authorized by the state. I've been working with John Simon on that and hopefully passing that when we're back in session and obviously the city of New, York and the city Drt is a big part of that effort as well. Some Good News, Verrazano split tolling is finally going into place. The verrazano has been the subject of a huge one-way double toll that causes lots and lots of trucks, cars, even large freight operations to divert traffic up the BQE and ultimately across Manhattan, and it was a you've, been a very long-standing effort to get state a federal legislation passed and then the MTA to implement it. They've announced that it will take effect on December 1st and that should reduce traffic congestion and air pollution for our communities and really have a net benefit for the whole metropolitan area. So that's a little bit of good news. I think our press conference, announcing it was going to happen, was pre-Covid, so it's been a while, but we're happy to you're happy to see that happening. Just just a word. I'm sure you've talked about this a little bit tonight, but Covid-19 numbers are going up. They are obviously out of control. Still in much of the country. They are going up to quite significant rates in neighboring states and New. York is now hitting you know, rolling seven days average that are real concerns. We also have some red so-called red zones. Where there are. You know clusters where, with very high rates of positive testing, none of those are in my district I, don't know I, don't think any of them are in the CB2 area, but we do all need to continue to just you know: do our part to make sure that, especially as it gets colder we're not gathering indoors in large groups, people wearing masks and all we're doing all the things necessary to try to do what we can to keep our rates down. So we can continue to. You know: try to get some kind of a normalcy and recovery going and obviously some good news on vaccines at the national level recently. So hopefully we'll get. You know greater and sure relief soon, I think I'll. Stop there I know you have a busy agenda and wants to talk about, but I'm happy to have questions if people have them for is taking the time to update us and brief us on the things that are happening throughout the state and again, thank you for your leadership. We really appreciate you same here. Thank you Lenny. This is Carlton. I just wanted to underline what the senator said as a housing court per former housing court person, any non-payment or any actions that were brought against attendance. They still have to answer it, even during the even during any kind of whole, you know stopping of actual evictions, so they anytime, you hear of anybody who gets any legal notices from the owners for housing court make sure they tell them get to the court answer it file the answer. If they don't file an answer, they could wind up in big trouble, so I just want to have underlying what the senator said. Yeah. Why don't I add also that this? The city is also running legal assistant hotlines and they are waiving some of the normal requirements for that kind of, for at least general advice about. What's going on, you know the normal kind of income requirements another so the tenant hotlines are supposed to be bill for everybody to get advice if you're getting if tenants are getting notices as well. But thank you for that for underlining that. Yes, thank you both and caution. Thank you for amplifying that point next item on the agenda: youth, education and Culture Affairs, Committee, Ms, Betty, Fibers good evening. Everyone. This is a tough act to follow. Everyone has given such comprehensive and excellent reports. I'll try my best. We heard a quite an extensive report from the Brooklyn public library, so I'll focus on that during the Covid-19 times, they've been exploring and implementing new ways to offer their services virtually and, of course it brings to mind the challenge of the digital divide. They're constrained ready the full use of their buildings, but they're opening up more of the branches, especially to what they call grab-and-go. They talked to a great length about the capital projects in our district, so I want to report on them. So due to the Brooklyn heights library and the sale of that which gave the library system additional funding, we have several initiatives and improvements. The Brooklyn heights library itself is moving ahead well and they anticipate the summer of 2021 to open, and it will include two of the groups of panels. The bar relief that were part of the old entrance that I know. We talked about extensively the Adams Street, which is going to be in 35 Plymouth, which is a new leased space. They have a temporary space on John, Street, they're, building relationship with the neighborhood. Excuse me, they're doing story, time and they're open. If you put a book on hold, you can pick it up there so that they're moving along nicely, the Wall Whitman will be building outdoor space, they'll be having a garden where some more of those Barbie leaf, freezers will be placed and they'll be sprucing up their indoor space. Now we heard for the first time about the south side, which is the 10 Lafayette cultural Building, and we're going to hear more about the other cultural institutions that are going to be there, but the library is going to have a 2,700 square feet facility, which will be a Brooklyn public library with Wi-Fi a small collection, and they will have a special focus on arts and culture, so that will be a very exciting addition to our cultural community and finally, and very exciting way. The library joined these the Brooklyn historic society, so they're incorporated together now as the center for Brooklyn history on Pierpont Street. So they can leverage the collection of the Brooklyn historic society, as well as the Brooklyn collection in the central branch which will be moved to Pierpont, I, believe and use that for research into you know the neighborhoods and communities and history of our borough because of the Covid-19 they had to close the Ramson Street temporary branch. I, don't know if you call it a branch, but it's a temporary site. I guess because of ventilation or you couldn't have people sitting there and there wasn't really a lobby so they're going to be opening some limited service at Pierpont, Street, apparently soon. So these are all ways that the library is in enhancing our cultural life yeah. So we were very pleased to hear that. Thank you Betty. So before we get to the next item on the agenda, which is open session, I do want to take this time. It's customary when we are meeting in person to give a moment for the dignitaries who've signed up to speak this evening and at this time I'm going to call on our Caroline Church to call the names of the dignitaries I'll remind you that, while we haven't done this in a while, certain things are still in place. We ask that you take two minutes and no more than two minutes to give you an update and if there's anything that goes beyond the two minutes, and you feel this material if you would email that to the board office and we will be sure to share it with the community board. Thank you. Carol Anne, Caroline you're mute get caught every time, so I'll call the elected officials representatives. First, we have Edward Cerna from the mayor's office to be followed by non-blackshare from the borough president's office. Good evening. Everyone Edward Cerna here mayor's office of Community affairs, happy to see everyone. Some of the items that I was going to touch on other folks have mentioned already, such as the announcement the administration made today for the creation of the mental health teams, beginning in February 2021. The city will launch these mental health teams. That will be in partnership with NYPD in the Department of Health, and it will be the first time in our history, where you know trained. Mental health professionals will be the first to respond to calls for folks that need help. I, don't know. What's going on, okay and just to give some quick stats. Last year over 170,000 mental health calls were made to 911, and the majority of them were for people who just needed help. So you know, we've been going through a lot of trauma, both experience and felt, and we do have a hotline 888 New York City. Well, so, if folks, you know want some mental health service health services, they can certainly call that and receive it. I want to quickly say that the Department of Health also launched a new, updated data page that has data that's more up-to-date and it's updated quickly and by zip code. So we'll encourage folks to go there. There's a test and trace hotline that has resource navigators that can connect folks to food, to your nearest testing sites to even hotel space that folks need to successfully quarantine. That number is 212-268-4319 or 212 Covid-19. Lastly, I just want to remind folks that you know have children and parents that there is an opt-in period for folks that, were you know, fully remote, but now I want to switch to blending in person learning the window is quickly closing it's only through November 15th. So if folks want to, you know decide that they want to send their children to in-person learning. They can go online and fill out a survey where they can certainly do that. I just wouldn't say that some parents did express concern that it was going to be only one period and it was so soon, but at the where we're at currently it's to provide stability to DOE and to both teachers and students and to you know appropriately assign resources, so yeah would encourage folks that want to take advantage of that to do so, and then, hopefully you know, given the situation we have to revisit that conversation, we will I'm happy to take any questions other than that Happy holidays. Everyone good evening there good evening. Everyone can you hear me? Yes, hello, hi I was having some technical difficulties, so please forgive my device being on twice as the bird as the district manager just sent me a text I just wanted to say to everyone. Thank you so much for all your condolences, I'm still receiving them. I, really appreciate the outpouring from community board too. So I just want to say. Thank you once again. Also from Borough Hall today was very busy. We just celebrated Brooklyn Covid-19 heroes. We had a ceremony on the steps of Burr Hall and in the plaza where we recognize brooklynites from all walks of life who have gone above and beyond during the pandemic. Among the honorees was Dr Anthony, who was born and raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn and, as everyone knows, serves as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and infectious diseases. Ms Dr Fauci appeared to us to receive his citation, which was mailed to him earlier to deliver remarks during the ceremony virtually so we had two tvs set up out on the plaza so that everyone could hear from Dr Fauci and the thanks that he had for receiving the award and basically he said to everyone just look out we're coming close to a vaccine, so everyone please be patient. So that was wonderful. Just to just remind everyone that there are a series of events going on in Barrow Hall for the veterans. We are having a summons on how to respond to summonses for New York City enforcement agencies. Yeah was that Dr Fauci calling you Nan you have to unmute man. Are you still with us? Are you talking the doctor found you? Okay, I was dying laughing, actually so just real, quick. There I, don't know whether you heard about the announcement I made about the veterans. Yes, okay, good and then the last announcement will be about how we're calling all civic, homeowners and tenant associations together on November 18th also, but at 1 pm, where the homeowners can learn about property taxes and benefits, that's available to condo owners and coal holders, and also how to find out about the history of your water charges and also to find out about rent freeze for those that are tenants. So there's a lot going on. Please go to our website www.brooklyndashusa.org to find out how you can access zoom, so you can be a part of it. Thank you everyone and have not only a wonderful veteran's day, but have a fabulous thanksgiving celebration such that we could have. Thank you Nan. We appreciate your report as always have a wonderful holiday and know that you know you continue to have the support of us even as we go into this holiday season. So thank you. Next. We have thanks.

Speaking, okay, Tracy Mantron from the library followed by Pastor, Zach, Martin, Richard, Morrow, wait hold on Carolyn hold on pastor Zach would be someone who would speak doing open session, I'm still trying to get through dignitaries. Do we have any other dignitaries? I know we have the library. Do we have anyone after the library? No okay, great? So then yeah, let's just roll right into it, continue I'm sorry, okay, so yeah so busy man Tron from the library followed by Esther Martin Richard Morrow from greater New York Red Cross I'll follow hi good evening. Everyone I just want to announce that Clinton hill is moving to grab-and-go lobby service on Monday, November 16th, so starting Monday you'll be able to return your books and pick up your holds at the Clinton hill library. Our lobby service hours are going to be Monday, Wednesday and Friday 10 to 4 and Tuesday and Thursday from 1 to seven I'm going to put in the chat the Facebook page for the Clinton hill branch, which is where we're posting our programs and our children's librarian is putting up movies. Well, he's putting up videos, he's done of story time and craft programs that can be watched for different children's programs. Also, they mentioned earlier about the Brooklyn heights branch. People with outstanding Brooklyn heights holds are going to be able to pick up their holds in December from the center for Brooklyn history, they're going to be sending out emails and more information about that. So, if your holds were at Brooklyn heights, you'll be able to pick them up if all goes well in December and we're looking forward to seeing you at Clinton hill on Monday. Thank you Tracy good evening. Everyone, I'm Richard Morrow from the greater New York Red Cross. Thank you for having me here. It's a little difficult for me. I'm not used to it, but at any rate be that as it may, I just want to report. In that the Red cross, you know we talked about Covid-19. We talked about the this whole disaster, but when you really think about it, the Red Cross was right there with working with feeding helping the people who are helping the people with coronavirus. So in a way we were that the back up to the people who were in the front lines and I was amazed by that. I'm only in this organization now for about a year taking a lot of training, but I was just totally amazed that the volunteers are volunteers, all right. So what happens right now across the United states? The Red Cross is working on about average about 60 different disasters. We recruit people from all over the United States to go to these areas to work with volunteers that we go there. We do so right now in the United States 65 emergency situations, where the Red Cross has to step in the greater New York area. This week alone we dealt with and assisted 107 adults and 19 children in 55 different local disasters, 55 of them. That's how many people, on average every day we respond to six to nine emergencies, local emergencies, helping people with financial assistance, housing, mental health situations at any rate, I don't want to keep going on and on I'm excited about it, because I'm learning and I think it's a great opportunity. What I wanted to suggest was. We have a since this Corona virus has added to this virtual programming and we have a citizens, preparedness, core training program and it's 45 minutes, and we want to get it out so that I took the course. It's not a core I mean it's just electrics. Give you some great ideas things you just may have never thought of come out of it, and what I'd like to suggest is that, at one of your meetings, if you can give us 45 minutes, we we'd love to present that and train, as many people came to the to the meeting as possible. So with that, I want to say, good night stay healthy, stay, safe and it's good to see people active and working in the community like this and know that there are people out there who are volunteers like yourself who are on the streets and helping people in need so good night, and thank you so Richard. Thank you for that presentation. What I would suggest is that you contact the board office. Let them know your desire to want to present, and in this order you should present to the health, environment and Social Services Committee. If you've not already done so, and then there we can set aside some time to have you give a presentation to schedule permits at one of our general body meetings but simply put just email, the board office. Let them know your desire to want to present and then they will walk you through the steps to get you on the committee agenda. Wonderful that'll be great, but I won't be presenting it. We have special trained people that it's just an amazing organization of amazing I'll, defer to your judgment, as of who presents. But yes, that's the invitation. Be sure to take me up on it all right, I'm doing it. Thank you very much all right. Thank you all right, great who's. Next Caroline, Sorry, Zach, Martin and I see a representative from the Brooklyn navy yard, but they didn't indicate they wanted to speak Ethan, Mulligan, so Zach Martin, and if Eagan Mulligan wants to speak good evening, everyone just grateful for the opportunity to share a little bit of what's happening at our church. So just let everyone know that our church continues to serve those who find themselves in places of Need, Monday, Tuesday and Friday. We do hot meals from nine to ten we're doing showers from nine to noon on Mondays a mobile shower unit outside of our space. So if you or someone you know needs help with any of that, you can also support the work by checking out our Amazon wish list to provide towels, toiletry kits and other items that we use to support our folks through the community shower. We also are in need of winter coats, so in partnership with a number of organizations we're trying to get winter coats for our folks again we're serving somewhere between two and 300 folks a week with the food services, so we're trying to get a collection of coats. So if you don't have a spot to drop it off, please don't hesitate to drop it off to our church at any point. During the week, we're also doing a curbside Thanksgiving the day of Thanksgiving from 11 to one. Our goal is to serve 300, curbside, Thanksgiving meals, and so again, if you don't have I need somewhere to be we'd love to have you. But if you know someone who needs a meal that day we're looking particularly we need. We have lots of volunteers, but we're looking particularly for pies. So if you want to bake a pie and provide this as we aim to serve again more than 300 folks every year through this curbside thanksgiving meal, you can bake a pie and drop it off at our location. At any point, before thanksgiving, we freeze the pies and have them prepared our as a side now side note trellis my community development, non-profit. We do community heroes, so you've seen that in Fort Greene the banners are still up there. We continue to invite the community to nominate community heroes as we prepare to unveil more heroes in Fort, Greene, Park and Commodore Berry Park I'll put the information in the chat box and how you can do that and then. Lastly, just to make sure you're aware that our organization also runs a youth mentor program where we're running a virtual fundraiser to provide stipend opportunities for youth in the community to make sure they can be paid for community services opportunities. So again, I'll put that information in the chat box, I really grateful for each of you and the opportunity to be a part of this community. Thank you, pastor. Zach.

So much I just have a very brief update from the Brooklyn navy yard. On Friday last Friday we launched our third annual holiday market. Some of you may have attended it in person in previous years this year. It is all virtual, so I'm going to just put it in ether. Somehow you went back on mute. Can you take yourself off mute? Thank you, chairperson. I'm sorry just so you can shop for a variety of goods in from our local businesses, at the Brooklyn Navy yard, in categories such as home, goods, fashion accessories, food and beverage, there's even PPE that has been produced at the yard and I'll put that in a separate link you can purchase PPE and also our Brooklyn Navy yard, official branded merchandise, including shirts, hats, water bottles, pencils, notebooks, all types of stuff, so I'll put that in the chat, and we all we appreciate your continuing support. Ethan. Thank you for that update. You're always welcome to have a platform at community Board too, and I keep up the good work for whatever goes on in the Navy yard. I had a tour of the Navy yard not too long ago. There's a lot of stuff happening down there. I don't know that everybody knows, but there's a lot of stuff happening down there. So kudos to you and your team for the work that you do miss church. Do we have anyone else, Mr Watkins from Brooklyn Dia's office? Is he the last name? You have Caroline? Yes, it is okay, so he perhaps he may be having technical difficulties. Let's move on to agenda item number eight. Is there any other business all right great?
