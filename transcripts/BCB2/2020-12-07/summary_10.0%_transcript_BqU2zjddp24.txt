You want to introduce yourself sure, good evening, everyone, I'm, Nicole, Mcknight, Committee, member Excellent, Miss, Cobb.
Okay, Maybe we can come back to Miss Cobb Miss Kai Akaso Akab is a value member of our health environment, Social Services, Committee, Meeting, Committee, And I, believe we're joined by some board members, who are also who are not members of this committee, but they're members of the board at large, and we welcome any anybody like that to our meeting Miss Maso.
We're going to be talking about reducing asthma triggers we've got Dr Reed Caldwell here from Nyu. I'm I should note that I'm also joined by Hannah Wade from Nyu Government.
The reason why this is coming up is I know that asthma really affects people of all ages in the neighborhoods that are covered by community board too, but particularly there's a particular burden on kids.
You can see a woman there using her inhaler and there's a whole bunch of icons that show you what some common asthma and allergy triggers are most commonly and ones that you know we can focus on in New, York, City and in our communities is smoking.
There's been some studies that show that kids that grow up near highways and busy streets have a higher incidence of severe asthma than those who don't general stress and then also just common allergens, some foods, some molds dust mites in the home and pollens for some people, and.
You know difficult for this group to try and address or focus on, but in addition, things like exercise and cold air can be triggers.
One thing that we can focus on is reduction of cigarette smoke, If you're thinking about kids, We can really work to continue to reduce tobacco use and cigarette smoke, so that kids are not exposed to that.
That I already talked about, and then the other component is the bronchoconstriction, and we know that people who have significant psychosocial stressors in their lives, whether it be children or adults, can it can really impact their asthma.
If you're, concerned about where your meal is coming from, Obviously your baseline level of stress increases and therefore so can your asthma things like being a part of our witness to domestic violence in internal conflict as well as family conflict about gender and sexual orientation, and then things that I, don't think have been well studied yet are impact on particularly kids and young adults of social media, as well as the psychosocial stressors of our current pandemic.
Just that I wanted to bring those things to your attention because kind of overall well-being like a happy healthy kid definitely has psychosocial stressors eliminated or reduced when possible.
We certainly see a lot of asthma and can take great care of asthmatics, but we hope that kids and people have access.
The medications for asthma are good and they work, but that requires that people be able to access them and it means that they know how to use them and are using them regularly and then, Lastly, is an action, asthma action plan with support.
Just this was a quick brainstorm of just some ideas that I can bring to you of ways that we can start to think about improving asthma in our communities.
If we have either free or reduced medicines, we need to make parents and families aware of where that, where those are and provide guidance to access and then good emergency care, and that's where my team and I come in and having 24 7 good emergency care, prevents mortality and then also emergency providers like myself like to do this, which is community outreach on the topic before we move to questions.
In addition to the labs that are indicated for their emergency visit, We have a head injury prevention campaign which we're rolling out, which is teaching about head injuries and the ability to discharge patients, both kids and adults, with a free brand new bike helmet after an accident where a helmet was either damaged or not worn, and then I also want to express to you that we, particularly at Nyu, are working on keeping our emergency departments safe for all patients.
I just want to remind everybody on the committee tonight, like any night, we're going to try to expeditiously work through the agenda and what that means is that you know everyone's comments and thoughts are absolutely welcome, but I just ask every committee member particularly, and certainly all board, members.
We see, we certainly see all age groups and people from all different neighborhoods, but kids with that aren't being actively managed by primary care and don't have a lot of parental involvement in their health.
We look at our district, where there tends to be, you know, also quite wealthy neighborhoods, and that thing, and so a question that I have is around the connection between asthma and bugs in the home, As you had in that circle, as well.
Or is there one of those triggers that you think is really the most important for us to be focused on, because my question is really getting to like.
It's, so multifactorial that any kind of angle that you want to take for the well-being of our population probably will have a positive impact on asthma, whether it be New, York, City, Housing, Authority, Pest reduction and cleanliness.
I do know at Nyu, Brought, more broadly Nyu, Department of Population Health and pediatrics as well as pediatric pulmonology are always working on asthma.
Think it's a great question, I think in some ways your point about asthma being multifactorial means that a lot of our varying departments are focused on asthma.
If they're focused on smoking, cessation in one area or focused on housing in another area, out of the department of Population health that they are looking at, that we did have a specific initiative that was funded through Disrep, where we were doing asthma in home assessments to try to help people reduce asthma, triggers.
I'm, just trying to think about it, because, as a community Board committee, we get to go and make budget requests and expense priorities on an annual basis in the city and for public housing.
Think I can see close to all of you, but if you want to raise your hand or make a comment in the chat, I'll be happy to recognize you and allow you to ask a question.
You, know I'm sure the community board would be willing to participate with the hospital on getting that word out, and.
It seems like a very useful and low-cost way to assist people who may be suffering with asthma sounds like a good idea and something that it's really interesting, and you know perhaps that's something we can pick up when we have a conversation as a committee about some things that we want to do out of this and other presentations.
You know if most of the patients who come into the emergency room for asthma related issues if they have health, insurance.
I think that a greater proportion, the greatest proportion of people we're seeing for asthma rescue care are on or under insured thanks.
Heavily Imp has been and is heavily impacted by allergic triggers, and my next question is now that the numbers are going back up for the Covid-19, and so asthma is like an underlying issue and it starts with the upper respiratory.
The only thing that I would say is that you know most people having a pure asthma attack wouldn't have fever.
We have submitted signatures of support, I, don't know if they went through from our block, but as you can imagine, a lot of people did not want to stop to chat or sign.
Longer, they've reached one o'clock and there was multiple people who had more questions and wanted answers to them, because these are basically art, shows.
Okay, that's good any questions from any other members of the committee.
If you will you open, if you get this permit going for like a special event, I know we're already.
We currently have a full liquor license that was approved by the community board, so we could actually be open now if we wanted to, But it's not the type of place to open.
Just want to be able to be a really hospitable place because it looks like a small culture, a very small one.
Earlier, and you know the type of things going on are: Don't do not attract a crowd of rowdy when they're leaving Miss Church.
Any questions from members of the board, who are not members of this committee, members of the public, If you could just so indicate, I'd, be more than happy to ask regarding this application.
Reflects that and no extraneous tables outside or anything like that, where people end up sitting down and being served or anything in that regard, I just want to make sure, because I think I recall from Cafe Bungusto.
God only knows if there's that City Street dining program, but that's a pandemic issue, we're just moving forward as if that will be behind us when we finish the renovations and if he does he'll be before your board.
Okay, I'll open it up to questions from members of the committee.
All right, I'm, not seeing any such questions as anybody want to make a motion in regards to this application.
This time for approve great, It looks like I got everybody on video, Mr Andrews.
Okay, So I, don't you repeat the question I think I got the question here so for customers who have who come in with a wheelchair who need access to your restaurant.
If you were ever going to do any renovations, I think the department of buildings would require you to follow, along with your daughter's recommendation or suggestion, which would be to expand the size of the bathroom so that it can manage a wheelchair and have the necessary hand railings and whatever else is required by the ADA requirements.
Okay, any questions from the members of the board, who are not members of this committee or from members of the public about this application.
Okay, I've got, Mr, Harrison moved to approve I'll, give Victor the second, because I think I heard him simultaneous to that.
As for their vote, and you tell me, We do okay, great thanks, Jessica one question, I'm, sorry.
I know, I am looks like everybody.
I, Don't have a whole lot to report for the evening, but I do just want to check in on this barber that we were gonna have at the meeting tonight to see if what the plan will be for going, forward.
Basically, He had to you know, register, to come in on to the meeting and basically just express the concerns of people in the community about the health and how he did a project before.
Okay, great I, Just not like him not to respond, because we spoke yesterday for some time right that makes sense.
I mean look I think we all know things happen, So you know we're completely understanding of that and let's try to pick this up and see where we can get them in the in one of our future meetings.
Logging in, because I want to make sure that we that, if anybody, has feelings that or concerns about this, that I know them and can vocalize them if I need to on behalf of our committees.
I've had to ask the board office to indulge me in registering me because I attend the meeting from a tablet, and we all know that, besides being kind of an idiot, That I am like a dinosaur with technology, but I have followed the instructions given by this church and staff of the have followed.
And I think, This committee here, if you, If anyone has any ideas about future meetings, feel free to shoot me an email and follow up or through the board office, an email too.
But you know I want I like to try to keep capture everybody's views in that regard, particularly in regards to the environment which I I'm hoping to bring more into the meetings for the spring of this year, because we've really focused on health.
And I think there are going to be some other good things coming up.
We can really identify some things that we want to take forward from these past few meetings in this meeting, the one we had with Fort Greene Conservancy and even going as far back as that great presentation, We had on maternal mortality that happened right before the pandemic.
I just wanted to mention that the transportation and public Safety Committee has requested a joint meeting they'd like to participate in our meeting with, and the Department of Homeland services, they're interested in learning about the support services that are afforded to homeless people in the city, and since I mentioned that, If you, if I may, please, If you have any questions for either canva or DHS, please send them in while the meeting is not until December 6th.
I feel deeply about, and I think that the community board should be focusing on it very intensively right now, which is what will happen for communities that we already know have been hit very hard by the coronavirus.
I think it's still a lot of an unknown, because we don't know exactly how the plan is going to go.
Think the Department of Health class last month made some statements about outreach that they were conducting in regards to the public housing communities and to communities that were in the most need.
I mean Tanya, Richardson I, think lives in a housing project and be curious to see whether or not she's seen any outreach by the Department of Health or anybody.
Take, this away, too, is try to think about specific plan or a specific project or motion that we can make in a future meeting to try to talk about, to try to focus this into something that we can work.
Think we have the opportunity to take a look at this and did any member of the community or the committee.
I. Also attend the CUNY School of Public Health, and I've just been interested in looking into things to advocate for one of the items that I wanted to discuss today was a resolution that was passed.
The reason I wanted to bring this up at this community board meeting was just to just get some support in kind of revisiting it and possibly amending it.
