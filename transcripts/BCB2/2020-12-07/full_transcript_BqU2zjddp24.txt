You want to introduce yourself you're on Mute Miss Cobb is unmuted, but we are not able to hear her so I think I believe that's a microphone issue. Okay, maybe we can come back to Miss Cobb Miss Kai Akaso Akab is a value member of our health environment, Social Services, Committee, Meeting Committee. So we'll look forward to her input. Mr Newmark. Would you like to introduce yourself sure thanks, Brandon, Barry, Newmark, Public, member, excellent and I believe we're joined by some board members who are also who are not members of this committee, but they're members of the board at large, and we welcome any anybody like that to our meeting Miss Maso. Did you want to introduce yourself hi good evening the trauma so Committee war Member? Thank you, okay! Thank you for coming and really nice to have you again. Do we have Mr dew on the line I the unknown, John? Okay? Well, we can come back to him. Miss Mcknight, I, don't believe I introduced you because your square jumped away from me and I apologize.

Is Mr Anthony Ferguson here not seeing Mr, Anthony, Ferguson and I believe it's only appropriate. We go to our next presentation for the evening, something I'm really looking forward to we're going to be talking about reducing asthma triggers we've got Dr Reed Caldwell here from Nyu, Langom and I will officially say, take it away, Dr Caldwell Welcome! Thank you for coming and we're really looking forward to seeing your presentation. Hi everybody thanks for having me. I'm I should note that I'm also joined by Hannah Wade from Nyu Government affairs she's, my colleague and partner on projects, and we work together often so she she's joined me like I, said. Thank you a lot for having me it's great to be here. Let me I know that you can kind of see the behind the scenes stuff. We weren't able to get it going to make it like a nice presentation view I. Think that's going to be the best that we can do is that? Okay? Can you see it? Can you I can see it and it's fine by me? Okay, great! So thanks for having me, so my understanding is we're going to talk about asthma. Today, if you ever want me to come back and we can talk about another topic, I'm happy to do so quickly, a little bit about me like he like was stated. My name is Reed Caldwell and I am the chief of service at the Nyu Langone Kabul Hill Emergency Department in Kabul Hill Brooklyn heights, I'm also the Ems Medical Director for the Nyu Lankan Health system. Prior to this role, I was with Nyu at the Nyu Brooklyn, formerly Lutheran hospital, where I was the associate chief of the emergency department. There, I've lived in Brooklyn for 14 years, and I've lived in Fort Greene for three and a half and I myself am a lifelong asthmatic. I'm a Colorado native but consider like, as you can see, I consider Brooklyn my home and again. This is gonna, be a relatively brief presentation and we have lots of time for questions in the end for anyone who's not familiar. Cobble Hill is over on Amity Street, Amity and Hicks. We are in the former Lich hospital. We do not own the hospital, we are we're tenants here and we actually are in the process of building our own facility, which is directly behind the old Lich property, our current location and we're going to have a new emergency department that is on Atlantic and Hicks. So that's coming and then our main campus here in Brooklyn is in sunset park and that's the old Lutheran Hospital or the Nyu Langone Brooklyn campus, so I just wanted to make sure everyone was familiar with location and geography of where I am so talking about, asthma, the first starters and the asthma of any age and I know. The reason why this is coming up is I know that asthma really affects people of all ages in the neighborhoods that are covered by community board too, but particularly there's a particular burden on kids. The main thing to understand with the disease asthma is that it is a problem of both bronchoconstriction and inflammation, so it you and you also get increased, mucus production. So you can see there on the right some normal airways. You can see a lung nice open normal airways passage of air and then when people with asthma get excess, mucus production get a lot of inflammation and then the smooth muscles that surround the Airways get tight, and then that causes the wheezing, the shortness of breath and the air hunger. Unfortunately, asthma comes closely aligned with closely coupled with allergies as well. So that's where the people with significant allergies experience quite a bit of inflammation of their airways, all of the medications for asthma and all of the aims at reducing asthma in communities and treating patients are focused at reducing the inflammation and reducing that bronchoconstriction on the left. You can see a woman there using her inhaler and there's a whole bunch of icons that show you what some common asthma and allergy triggers are most commonly and ones that you know we can focus on in New, York, City and in our communities is smoking. This comes commonly cigarette smoking, but really smoking of all types. It's secondhand exposure as well as actual use of vaping marijuana cigarettes, cigars, any tobacco both for the user and for bystanders that that's really problematic pollution is another. One. There's been some studies that show that kids that grow up near highways and busy streets have a higher incidence of severe asthma than those who don't general stress and then also just common allergens, some foods, some molds dust mites in the home and pollens for some people, and so you know difficult for this group to try and address or focus on, but in addition, things like exercise and cold air can be triggers. So what do we do? What do we do about? Asthma? There's I wrote up there at the top there's a pedia I, getting ready for today, I surveyed, some of my pediatric emergency doctor colleagues, some of my pediatrician friends and colleagues, and there's also a large asthma study that is out of Boston children's and also I, looked at the emergency medicine literature. So one thing that we can focus on is reduction of cigarette smoke. If you're thinking about kids, we can really work to continue to reduce tobacco use and cigarette smoke, so that kids are not exposed to that. Next is dust and mold all kinds of dust, all kinds of mold, particularly ones, found in your household, so not, and this isn't just unclean homes. It's this isn't a matter of just getting out pledge in a rag. This is pollens molds dust that are brought in by animals in the home, things that live in mattresses and pillows, things that live in stuffed animals, pollution and exhaust I already mentioned. There's some people that can more easily escape pollution and exhaust than others, but just the acknowledgement that this is a problem also. So those things are all focused at the inflammation component of asthma. That I already talked about, and then the other component is the bronchoconstriction, and we know that people who have significant psychosocial stressors in their lives, whether it be children or adults, can it can really impact their asthma. General levels of anxiety, general levels of stress can increase that bronco constriction, that's around airways, and so this is where some of the social determinants of health come in like food security and food insecurity. If you're concerned about where your meal is coming from, obviously your baseline level of stress increases and therefore so can your asthma things like being a part of our witness to domestic violence in internal conflict as well as family conflict about gender and sexual orientation, and then things that I, don't think have been well studied yet are impact on particularly kids and young adults of social media, as well as the psychosocial stressors of our current pandemic. So just that I wanted to bring those things to your attention because kind of overall well-being like a happy healthy kid definitely has psychosocial stressors eliminated or reduced when possible. How do we further affect asthma focus on primary care? We certainly as an emergency doctor. We certainly see a lot of asthma and can take great care of asthmatics, but we hope that kids and people have access. Kids and adults have access to primary care before they need emergency care. The medications for asthma are good and they work, but that requires that people be able to access them and it means that they know how to use them and are using them regularly and then, lastly, is an action, asthma action plan with support. You talk about any pediatrician or any er doctor. They talk about asthma, action plans and it's. What do you do if you're having an asthma exacerbation there? You need to be able to build a tool belt at home to manage your asthma rather than coming to needing emergency care. Every time and I wrote with support, because we see too many elementary middle school and high school kids that are trying to manage their asthma on their own without sufficient parental sibling or family support managing their disease. So I just this was a quick brainstorm of just some ideas that I can bring to you of ways that we can start to think about improving asthma in our communities. Some ideas that I had were focused are focused around trigger control like parent education of second-hand smoke, and you know like dust mites and reduction of triggers in the household environment. Some landlord education we got to keep air systems clean. We got to keep the hallways and buildings clean access to covers, I, don't know if what they cost or where they can come from, but I know for me, when I put, the kind of sealed covers for my mattress and pillows. My asthma analogies are immediately better and respiratory infection prevention in this right now. That means a flu shot. Primary care screening and school involvement like I mentioned medicine access. So if we have either free or reduced medicines, we need to make parents and families aware of where that, where those are and provide guidance to access and then good emergency care, and that's where my team and I come in and having 24 7 good emergency care, prevents mortality and then also emergency providers like myself like to do this, which is community outreach on the topic before we move to questions I just really want to I want to briefly tell you about some other a couple other community health initiatives which I'm driving along with Hannah right here in our community. I've started a diabetes screening initiative, so patients who come to our emergency department who fit a certain criteria which is age over 40 and a bmi over 25 Nyu, does a free ads on a lab and does a free diabetes screening for, in addition to the labs that are indicated for their emergency visit, we have a head injury prevention campaign which we're rolling out, which is teaching about head injuries and the ability to discharge patients, both kids and adults, with a free brand new bike helmet after an accident where a helmet was either damaged or not worn, and then I also want to express to you that we, particularly at Nyu, are working on keeping our emergency departments safe for all patients. During this time of Covid-19 we've developed covered separate areas and respiratory isolation units, so patients with covet-like illness and patients without Covid-like illness are not sharing the same space and the same air. So that was quick dirt, quick and brief, because I want to make sure that we have a couple minutes. I see I'm at 12 minutes, I think I had 15. so I. If I have I. Think three minutes for questions. Yeah we've got a little bit more time, so we're happy to have you. Thank you very much for that excellent presentation, fascinating and great work that you're doing there I want to give the committee a chance to have questions, but before I get into that. I just want to remind everybody on the committee tonight like any night, we're going to try to expeditiously work through the agenda and what that means is that you know everyone's comments and thoughts are absolutely welcome, but I just ask every committee member particularly and certainly all board members. If you're going to make a comment or a thought about these. This presentation, please try to keep it somewhat brief, like maybe two minutes or so I really don't want to have to cut somebody off, but I will cut people off if we have to and at the end of the meeting and other business. If there are other things that we really need to take a look at and follow up on, I'll be happy to give you some time to speak at that point, and the community will give you will get an opportunity to ask questions throughout this presentation. Dr Caldwell I really want to get back to you. Sorry I had to make that brief interlude, but I just wanted to ask you about your presentation briefly one given that you're in Cobble Hill. What have you seen or is there anything you can say you've seen about the demographics, the experiences or the particular incidences of asthma that have been occurring in our community here locally and to what? Inter what? In what extent can you speak a little bit about the interaction between having asthma having Covid-19 sure so, I hear two questions. The first is: who do we see with asthma in our emergency department here in Brooklyn? You know the so: asthma and allergies are a disease that no know all age groups and know all social economies and backgrounds. So certainly all people can be affected. We do know that there are throughout New York City as well, as you know, our country, that there are disparities in health care and this disparities of health all over the place. So, unfortunately, we see patients that are most heavily affected by those disparate healthcare disparities in our emergency departments, because those are people who have again have less access to primary care, sometimes don't have as much either access or understanding of how to appropriately access to medicines or ability to utilize on their medicines as prescribed- and you know have- can have some increased psychosocial triggers psychosocial and environmental triggers. So we see we certainly see all age groups and people from all different neighborhoods, but kids with that aren't being actively managed by primary care and don't have a lot of parental involvement in their health. We see a disproportionate number of those patients in the emergency department with regard to Covid-19, when we, you know back when we first started wave one, our thought was that patients with respiratory illness would be most heavily affected as they have it with flu and common cold in the past. Now that we have some more data, we know that there was not a morbidity mortality relationship necessarily to people with asthma and respiratory illness. We've now learned that patients with renal disease patients with obesity and patients with diabetes are at our highest risk groups. Thank you. Questions from members of the committee. Yeah I have a question. This is Jessica Hi, Dr Caldwell. Thank you so much this is I mean really informative and something we know affects our district, a lot, something that you know. We talk a lot about the public housing developments in our district and how they're often under resourced in a number of ways and underrepresented in averages. When we look at our district, where there tends to be, you know, also quite wealthy neighborhoods, and that thing, and so a question that I have is around the connection between asthma and bugs in the home, as you had in that circle as well. My assumption is that well, here's the hypothesis I have that. Maybe I'm trying to prove too much, but I'm curious if this holds up for you, that you know where there are homes with mold there's also maybe more likely to be bugs in the home, and these are also in potentially public housing developments that are adjacent to big highways, like the BQE in our district and before I go out and make that statement, and that correlation too loudly am I correct in assuming those things are likely to be correlated and compound the effects of asthma. Or is there one of those triggers that you think is really the most important for us to be focused on, because my question is really getting to like what resources can we realistically advocate for knowing all of these things are triggers in a lot of the developments in our district, yeah I. Think I hear what you're saying and expecting places of residents to be clean and bug-free I think is a good step as a good start. You know, like things like cockroaches people, including myself, are, can be very allergic to cockroaches, and that doesn't even mean a cockroach needs to be like on your skin. It means just around them where they're, shedding and defecating and just kind of exist, so like dust mites, cockroaches things like that, if those can be reduced, you are reducing allergen, reducing pulmonary inflammation and asthma. Great, thank you guys, so multifactorial I hope I expressed to you adequately. It's so multifactorial that any kind of angle that you want to take for the well-being of our population probably will have a positive impact on asthma, whether it be New, York, City, Housing, Authority, Pest reduction and cleanliness. Whether it be a domestic violence focus would be a teenage Lgbt support, all of the whether it be smoking, cessation and reduction. All of these things will likely have positive impact on the breathing of kids. Great. Thank you. Any other questions from members of the committee. Sure I have one it's Nicole. Does the hospital have any special projects or initiatives focused on asthma? That's a good question in my in emergency medicine. I, don't know that we do I do know at Nyu brought more broadly Nyu Department of Population Health and pediatrics as well as pediatric pulmonology are always working on asthma. So Hannah, do you know? Can you speak to that question better than I can I doubt better than you can but I think it's a great question, I think in some ways your point about asthma being multifactorial means that a lot of our varying departments are focused on asthma. If they're focused on smoking cessation in one area or focused on housing in another area, out of the department of Population health that they are looking at, that we did have a specific initiative that was funded through Disrep, where we were doing asthma in home assessments to try to help people reduce asthma triggers I'm actually not because disrupt ended, I, don't know if that's still happening, because the funding isn't there, but I can look into that and get back to you. Thank you. I also know that at our Nyu Brooklyn campus a couple years ago, I was part of an initiative that helped we made kits for parents to take home to help their kids with their medicines. A lot of the inhalers look the same, and you know the some inhalers are a daily steroid, and so some inhalers are a rescue inhaler and if you mix the two up, the patient is not going to do well like if you're, using your daily inhaler as a rescue. It's not going to get you anywhere, so we made kits to make it easier and clearer for parents and patients to understand the right medicines for the right problem. Mr Newmark did you have a question: Mr Newmark? Yes, thank you, Brandon Dr, Caldwell again, thank you so much for a very informative and concise presentation. We really appreciate it. I, I'm just curious about whether there's any familial and or genetic component that's been discovered. Yet with regard to asthma yeah, there is it's when we call somebody who's who has kind of the combo of asthma, allergies, eczema, we call people, we call that those people are called Atopic and it basically just means that you are in this pro-inflammatory state, where you kind of lean towards wheezy allergies and asthma and eczema, and certainly that can be passed. My entire family has allergies. So do I my dad is quite a bad asthmatic and so am I. So certainly again you're you can be it's both nature and nurture right. So you can inherit some kind of underlying Atp where you are likely to have more likely to have asthma allergies, but then your psychosocial wellness, as well as your environmental triggers, will set you on a path on how severe that might be. Sometimes thanks a lot Dr. Thank you. Brandon we've been joined by some other members of the committee and I. You know: I I'll give a quick opportunity for them to introduce themselves Mr Andrews. I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you earlier. Would you like to briefly introduce yourself hi guys, I'm Victor, I'm on the committee. I was having trouble trying to log in so I'm here now, oh we're happy to have you Mr Harrison. Do you want to briefly introduce yourself? Mr Harrison is disappeared, Ms Richardson. Are you on the line? Would you want to briefly introduce yourself seems like there might hi? Well we're happy to have you regardless and thank you for joining I'm sorry, your video won't work. We've been in the process of fielding some questions for Dr Caldwell here regarding his asthma presentation. I did want to ask the committee or there did the committee have any more questions from Mr Caldwell Mr Andrews did I cut you off on a question you were about to make. Okay, that's fine. I had one more question: Dr Caldwell, you made a reference to venting and like I, guess, improving the ventilation in the different places in the course of addressing some of these issues. I would think I just want to explore the point further. You know we covered it a bit with regard to pests and insects with regard to mold, and particularly, like particular matter in the air, would you be able to go into a little more detail about the kinds of adjustments and or steps that could be taken with respect to ventilation? I'm just trying to think about it, because, as a community Board committee, we get to go and make budget requests and expense priorities on an annual basis in the city and for public housing. You know we could possibly consider making some kind of recommendations to address any kinds of issues and I would think mold might be something to consider in that regard. Sure, and you know I, don't know if this is I, don't know if this is relevant because I, you know it would I air filters come to mind and I don't mean like stand-alone filters, I mean if there's if there is a heating unit or a cooling unit, with a fan, those almost all of them have a filter that should be regularly cleaned and or disposable, one that should be changed that that's a really straightforward intervention on how to clean up the ambient air. Thank you would be leaking pipes right. So if you have any leaks in this in ceiling or in walls, that is going to that's going to create mold and put allergens in the area. So having things have like replacing old, ruined ceiling, tiles and figuring out, you know leaks and drips behind. That would be another intervention. I can think of sorry, no thank you. I want to give an opportunity for the board members who are not members of this committee. Did you all have any questions to raise? I have a question. I know you said that you worked directly with the emergency piece, but do you ever have any partnerships with the local schools in your in the district Hannah? Do you want to take that? Well, we don't have any formal partnerships with local schools in the district, but we're always looking for opportunities. So I can put my information if you want to reach out in the chat. I have done some lectures and q and a sessions similar to this, but you know longer and more in depth with some area schools. I've done some that are focused at faculty meetings and I've done some that are student focused. So, like Hannah said, we don't have any ongoing partnerships, but certainly I've spent time in schools throughout Brooklyn doing requested initiatives and topics. Thank you. I was just asking because of the concern. One of the concerns you said was like young kids. So I was thinking. Maybe that's if you can't really get to the parents. If you get to the kids in the school to outreach to them at that level, thank you great idea. Thank you. I want to open this up to the members of the public. Who've come to see if any, if anyone, if any of you, have any questions, I think I can see close to all of you, but if you want to raise your hand or make a comment in the chat, I'll be happy to recognize you and allow you to ask a question. I have a question, so I'm thinking is it possible to do a campaign around mattress covers that seems pretty simple. It isn't very expensive and it could be part of an education campaign and Dr Caldwell says, and it's really great results for him. You know I'm sure the community board would be willing to participate with the hospital on getting that word out and maybe even well I guess this is more in the hospital, I'm sorry to be putting things on you, but maybe we can find a supplier we'll be willing to make some donations we partner with NYCHA. It seems like a very useful and low-cost way to assist people who may be suffering with asthma sounds like a good idea and something that it's really interesting, and you know perhaps that's something we can pick up when we have a conversation as a committee about some things that we want to do out of this and other presentations. The other thing is that a lot of the covers are kind of serve a dual purpose and there are their bed bug barriers as well as dust covers, and so it can be a kind of a double pronged effort. You can with one initiative, you can solve multiple problems. All right were there any other questions for Dr Caldwell and his and people jumped around Miss Reed I have one more, I'm just curious. Do you know if most of the patients who come into the emergency room for asthma related issues if they have health insurance? And if you do, what type do you know if they have public health insurance such as Medicaid I? Don't know the data I, don't know the data for certain, but I think the but I think that you're right I think that a greater proportion, the greatest proportion of people we're seeing for asthma rescue care are on or under insured thanks. That's a good question. Thank you. Paul yeah, any other questions for Dr, Caldwell or Ms. Wade I have a question: Tanya Richardson! Oh hey, Tanya plea! Please go ahead: okay as a child, I had a history of asthma and my children and I wanted to express that a lot of it is from allergies. So do the hospital refer a lot of the patients from to allergy specialists to try to bring the rate of the attacks down yeah, so asthma is unfortunately so common. Asthma and allergies are so common that a lot of asthma care rests with general pediatrics and in an allergy and asthma management and care they hold, that's become a kind of a cornerstone of a general pediatrics practice. So yes but yeah. But yes, your point is well taken and I. My asthma is very similar. Heavily Imp has been and is heavily impacted by allergic triggers, and my next question is now that the numbers are going back up for the Covid-19, and so asthma is like an underlying issue and it starts with the upper respiratory infections. So do everybody? Can you tell the difference if someone is having like a upper respiratory infection or a asthma attack, then complications of the virus? You can't always tell that's a that's, also, a great question. The only thing that I would say is that you know most people having a pure asthma attack wouldn't have fever. So if there's a fever with difficulty breathing, you know I think I would be concerned that Covid-19 could be at play if they're, if there's no fever and it's purely weaving after exercise after chemical exposure, fume exposure or after you know, allergen exposure I think it responds well to a rescue inhaler. I think you can be pretty confident that it's primarily asthma is that, does that make sense, yeah, excellent inhaler and the other type I can remember, and the steroid and I interchange them sometimes and so I think it's important for doctors to provide education to their patients. I know what they're for, but I, never think about it when I decide I'm going to use one over the other a lot of times. So I think that doctors should be aware that it needs to be an education process when they give all these inhalers. I totally agree. This doctor tells his patients to keep your steroid inhaler by your toothbrush and never move it, because it won't help you, if you're in a rescue situation, so my recommendation is keep it by your toothbrush use it in the morning when you brush your teeth, use it in the night when you brush your teeth and then keep your rescue inhaler on your person either in your car, your purse or your pocket, and then you won't be confused. Thank you great well. Thank you very much. Dr Caldwell and thank you, miss Wade for coming to us and speaking, and we really appreciate your time and the information that you've provided to us, we'll looking forward to take some interesting and more knowledgeable next steps, as a result of that. Thanks for having me thanks. Thank you great. So next on our agenda this evening, we're going to move into our liquor, license review. We've had a few items laid over and just to confirm. This church is 690 Fulton laid over. We don't know Mr, Smith I, don't know, I have not communicated at all. Okay, we'll get to that. When we get to that, then I'll start off with new full on premise: 224 Green, Avenue, Cafe, Park Lake. You have someone here from that location, hi good evening, Michael Kelly, representing the applicant with me, is Antony owner and lily. The manager should I start. It is an application to change the hours of operation for art domain LLC, doing business as cafe bar laker, we're located at 224 green Avenue between Grand Avenue and Clay Cloudson Avenue, we're closer to grand we've been open for over two years. Anton is also the founder and owner of Eflux he's an artist. He uses the venue to promote his passion, given new unknown and accomplished artists a chance to display their works. He also does art, shows and silent movies at the location, besides serving some food and drinks. Additionally, he does screenings and lectures our current hours of operation. Right now are 7 a.m to 1 a.m. We're looking to expand the closing hours to 2 A.M Sunday through Wednesday and 4 A.M, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. We have 12 tables 34 seats and a bar with four seats, which is 10 feet in length. We do have an occasional dj, but they play music on our system at a low level between 5 p.m and 10 p.m. Only the rest of the time we'll have background music if we're not doing a show of some type we're at tavern with a limited menu because there's not a full kitchen, and there is no outdoor seating or plans for it. Anton and Lily the manager are the only occupants living in the building. Anton owns the building. We have submitted signatures of support, I, don't know if they went through from our block, but as you can imagine, a lot of people did not want to stop to chat or sign. They did go through. We've had no problems that we've become we're known of or I mean any neighbors have complained to us about, and it's known that we Anton and Lily do live in the building. We don't see the place, staying open to the requested hours, all the time or even a lot. We do have occasional shows and q and a's that run late and we're going to have the later hours. So we can keep these events open and not have to worry about. Closing at 1 am thank you just as an initial question is Mr Anton still living in the building. That's great questions for members of the committee. Yeah I got one for him, Mr Andrews at this location, Michael since you're, the attorney talking, do we have any accessible bathrooms or how can a wheelchair person get in if they came with one yeah? There is an ADA bedroom. If you look on the plan, we have it in the way the plan is situated. You bottom right, okay, and what about trying to get in? Is there a ramp or something they can or there's no streets, it's leveled with the street, so there is no need to have a run. Okay. Well, could you go into a little bit the reason for why the need to change these hours is coming about? Maybe I missed it. I just wanted to I, guess better understand why 1 am wasn't satisfactory enough for this location and what, if all is going to be going on between 1 am and 4 am on Thursday through Saturday rose right was explaining to me. He's had some questions in two days that have gone on longer, they've reached one o'clock and there was multiple people who had more questions and wanted answers to them, because these are basically art shows and then he's having silent films with people commenting afterwards, we don't see the 4 am happening, an awful lot. It's not a bar, it's not a hangout, it's never been. It's mainly used for you know his art shows and his passion he and lily live upstairs and I. Don't think they want to be up 4 a.m. Every night, like people downstairs, have there been any complaints or concerns by anyone in the neighborhood or nearby over the course I guess. You've got the last time you guys came here is April 2016, so I assume that was about when you started this place. Yes, we have not had any complaints or concerns. Okay, that's good any questions from any other members of the committee. Yes, just quickly, are you currently closed or do you know, do plans to reopen or anything like that? We've been closed since March 13th and basically because we can't do outdoor seating where we have a bus and we don't have any other outdoor space and the way our left is basically it's not possible for us. So we'll open shrimp for the type of place they have it's more into doing the art showings and things like that so operating at 25 would not make any sense whatsoever. So then, they're not really interested in what they could be doing like selling drinks to go so they're, not interested in telling the alcohol to go yeah they're more interested in their shows that are happening inside okay, hey thanks for explaining I. Have a question. Wait, I think I saw Mr Newmark had a question first Mr Newmark. Did you want to go ahead? No, that's okay! I just wanted to ask them to get back to the chart that showed the hours, because I had not recalled what it was that they were requesting. But while the answer was being asked and answered previously, they came up to it again, showing it again. Okay, thank you. Okay, Great Mr Richardson floor is yours. What is the capacity it's? Basically, we have 12 tables with 34 seats and a four seat bar, so the capacity would be 38. Okay and if you remove all the tables, what is the capacity standing room? I? Don't think, we've ever done that no we've never moved the table. I, don't know what would you say, maybe 40 something up there. The legal capacity probably would be 74, which would be basically under the 75, but you can have other places that you can fit 15 people with 15 people in it and they have the 74 because there's a letter of no objection. Okay, any other questions from the committee. So how do you go ahead? Ms, Richardson, I'm sorry to cut you off. Please go ahead. Okay, so I want to know how do you expect to like social distance and stuff during these hours of 8 a.m to 2 a.m and the 4 a.m? It's like to me: it's like you want to have like a big old party. If you want to have alcohol these hours and so forth, where that's where I'm that's, how I'm looking at it sure yeah, look like you want to explain: go ahead, yeah we're not open now, because we're not really a bar, we're not catering to a bar. So the next time we open is when this pandemic is closed. When the pandemic is gone, we're not going to be open next week, looking to stay open to 4 a.m. We're going to be closed until this is over. We do. We are able to open now and say if people wanted drinks to go, we're able to do that, but we don't do that, we're not that type of place and that's why we've been closed since March. So if you will you open, if you get this permit going for like a special event, I know we're already during these hours no pandemic is over. Will we currently have a full liquor license that was approved by the community board, so we could actually be open now if we wanted to, but it's not the type of place to open okay, it sounds confirmed that your location has not been open since March and will reopen only after the conclusion of the pandemic. Exactly Mr, Newmark, yeah I do have a question and I hope you're not offended by this. But why can't you, when you're, when we're able to open again when this is all passed up, then we're all feeling healthy and safe and we can enjoy ourselves again and you and your following are able to get back together? Why can't you start your patients and your programs earlier to ensure that they're finished by one sure? It's because people have to work yeah so normally most of our audience most of the people that come here have a job. So by the time they finish working and most of them work in the city by the time they get to Brooklyn. They can't really do anything with a good audience until about eight nine ten o'clock in the evening, because people have to eat and all of that right and then sometimes it grows quite late. If it's an interesting like a screening of a new film or something and people would like to have a conversation, a discussion afterwards just want to be able to be a really hospitable place because it looks like a small culture, a very small one. The reason I ask is my concern is in looking at the surrounding area. It looks like it's a very brown, Stoney kind of residential area and, aside from the fact that you were permitted to be open until 1 am the idea of people coming out at 4:00 in the morning is of some concern to me. That's why I asked them that there's a way to accommodate that time. Issue! That's totally construction! That's totally understanding we're I mean we're it's just not a rowdy crowd at all. I would say yeah, it's not that kind of bar. It's not like a big party. It's usually cultural events and people are quite pretty quiet. You know it's not like partying yeah, these the hours are going to be occasional and the people on the block know us. We live there or they live there. I'm sorry we have a 38 occupancy as it is, and even if we are open late one night, two three four in the morning, we don't expect to have that 38 occupancy people get tired. I would be one of them going home earlier, and you know the type of things going on are: don't do not attract a crowd of rowdy when they're leaving Miss Church have we received any complaints from about this location in the past four years? None that I recall. Okay, all right! Any other questions, remember to the committee. I, don't see any for the purpose of expediting time. Any questions from members of the board, who are not members of this committee, members of the public, if you could just so indicate I'd, be more than happy to ask regarding this application. All right, I'm not seeing any so I'll entertain a motion regarding this application. I'll move, Mr, Chair, Mr Harrison moves. Is there a second? And what is your motion? Mr Harrison? Are you moving to approve? Okay, you have a second I think I heard victor before I saw Jessica, so I'm going to get Victor. The second discussion on the motion hearing none all in favor. If you can just raise your hand, I think I can probably see it and I'll ask Miss Richardson. How do you vote honey say that one more time please I think it was a yes, okay, Mr Andrews? How do you vote yeah, okay, I? Think it's unanimous! Thank you all very much. Oh wait! Mr Newmark, I'm sorry! I didn't get your vote! Mr, Newmark votes! No! Okay, we'll mark that I apologize for not catching you Mr, New, Mark! Okay! Thank you good night. Thank you very much. All right. Next we've got 690 Fulton speed, Broccoli bar, who very well may not be here. Do we have 690 Fulton Street here anyone from broccoli bar going once going twice all right. No broccoli bar I think there they are laid over. We didn't have an application for them: either 72 Clark, Street, Clark, Bone, Gusto Corp. You have somebody here from that location, Thomas, Mcallen, hello, Thomas, I, think we had discussed. Maybe the board okay, great we're going to get your application presented here. Please go ahead. My name is Thomas Mcallen, I'm representing Nasa Gorchien, Nasa Gorchian is an experienced operator. Restaurateur he's had at least six or seven restaurants. It's a similar formula. This small italian cafes he's operated in your community in the past. In fact, he operated at this address: 72 Clark Street back in 2005. For a few years, it's been on Henry Street he's been a few areas in Brooklyn and he's presently operating in the Upper East side of Manhattan. If you have a chance to read the application, I don't know, if you can it's a pretty standard formula, it's lunch and dinner all right. The hours of operation will be from noon until 10 p.m, across the board. All right, it's background music. Only and it's a dining experience. It's not a tavern experience and it's got a tremendous track record. Never had any issues with the state liquor authority with any of their community groups or residents. No outdoor dining proposed operates on two levels: they'll be dining on the ground, floor level and there'll be a bar there for patrons waiting for tables or eating at the bar and then there's a lower level. Smaller dining area, no security required and, like I, said, he's been in the community and it's part of what I'm seeing more and more of Mr Mccallum after you said part of something after you said part of something more of a. We lost your audio. So, okay, we got you back, though now yeah somebody was calling in on I'm on a phone, it's Murphy's law. So again, Mr Gorjun's, experienced operator the place has been dark. It's under some renovations and he's operated in this community and in east side of Manhattan for a number of years. So he's has no adverse history and he's been a quality operator wherever he has had the boldness to open, and this is a place that it's gone. Dark and I have a few clients that are looking to dip their toe in, and you know, God help them God help all of us. If they, you know they can open up and succeed. Is this related to the similarly named former cafe bon gusto on Montague Street, absolutely yep same gentleman? Okay, I, understand that and there there's no outdoor seating here right, no proposed outdoor seating. At this time, that's the application, I, don't even know if it's eligible, it's kind of a quirky thing based upon proximity to curb cuts and farts fire, hydrants, etc. So, at this point now, there'll be no outdoor, dining that I'm aware of okay application reflects that and no extraneous tables outside or anything like that, where people end up sitting down and being served or anything in that regard, I just want to make sure, because I think I recall from Cafe Bungusto a number of years ago there was a. There was an issue with the sidewalk cafe and whether it was within the resident within the property line or not, and I just want to make sure we're very clear. There's no outdoor seating in this yeah. God only knows if there's that City Street dining program, but that's a pandemic issue, we're just moving forward as if that will be behind us when we finish the renovations and if he does he'll be before your board. Obviously, but at this point this application has no outdoor dining okay. What was the location prior to this? Do we know it was a different restaurant or I? Don't know what it was honestly I mean I tried to look at some photos most likely you can probably get a better glance than I have I haven't been out there and I did not I didn't pose the question, but it was a restaurant again. Mr Gorchien operated this back in 2005, so my instincts tell me it's probably been a series of, if not licensed, restaurants, probably you know, retail, perhaps food perhaps just take out. Perhaps just retail I, don't know the answer, what it was previously: okay, I'll open it up to questions from members of the committee. Any questions for Mr Mccallum about this application, Mr Newmark yeah, I'm just out of curiosity- is he closing the location that he moved to on Montague Street from the first location, my understanding is he's not okay, yeah he's a pretty entrepreneurial gentleman I'll give him that. Okay! Thank you. When do you all plan to open again, there's looking at the photos? I didn't ask Nando that specific question. So I don't think he has the target data everything's moving glacially, so I can't give you I would only be guessing okay do we know how many people he expects to employ eight I think he listed. Eight I think he listed eight, which would be some servers and kitchen. Okay and Mr. Nasser is not here this evening, but are you, do you have any sense, or are you able to say anything and for everyone else we do make a rather strong suggestion that folks consider hiring locally and particularly from communities of color and communities of need within our local area. Is that something that's been on the horizon or considered in that regard? I need again. Mr Smith I'll speak to him about that. He may be familiar with that because we've experienced it in other community boards and I don't see why he actually wouldn't at this point in time he has a connection to the community, but I'll convey that to him he's actually working I spoke to him later this afternoon. Okay, any question other questions from members of the committee. Any questions from members of the public or other board members who are not members of this committee- all right, I'm not seeing any such questions as anybody want to make a motion in regards to this application. Mr Harrison, you were on mute, but it looks like you said you moved to approve. Is that correct? Sorry about that move to approve okay, I got a second from Acosta Casa will beat you Barry, so I'll give her. The second are there any? Is there any discussion on this application? Any discussion not hearing any, so we will take a vote. I see a show of hands from everybody. I'll try to make this work this better. This time for approve great, it looks like I got everybody on video, Mr Andrews. How do you vote hey? I'm not hearing Mr, Andrews or seeing him in the meeting. There's Richardson. How do you vote? Yes? Okay, Mr, interesting vote. Yes, so unless we hear something from Mr, Andrews I think we can mark him as abstain. Well, if he's not in the meeting, I just reduce the total that sounds appropriate thanks. Okay, thank you very much, Mr Mcconnell Mccollum. Thank you for your courtesies. I'll pass along your comments and everyone stay safe and healthy out there. Good luck, I wasn't saying anything important. It's okay, 82 Livingston street new restaurant wine. Do we have somebody here for that location, Chair, Smith and Miss Thurston Ms Richardson was unable to unmute for the first vote and she would like to register that her vote for the first one was no okay, thanks, Sonya, no problem. Thank you. I hope. Tony can hear me great hi. This is it's. My turn right. 82 Livingston is that you yeah 82 Livingston great hi. This is the restaurant. It's k, it's a seafood, Cajun seafood restaurant, but with the we do most of the takeout. So, okay hi. Sorry, I'm sorry, my friend's, not very good, so I. Let my daughter just explain it to everything. The name of the restaurant would be dynasty crab dynasty, it's at 8, 82 Livingstone street. In Brooklyn the owner's name is Hulu and our home address is 661,573, verse. 4.! That's great, could we just get your name, the daughter, thank you for explaining that I just wanted to record you with and then Cindy Sorry. My name is Renee great. Thank you very much for explaining that to us. So looking through the application, it looks like you're going to be open from 11 a.m, to 10 p.m, on Sunday, through Thursday and 11 a.m, to 11 p.m. On Friday and Saturday. Does that sound right? Yes, okay and it also looks like you have no outdoor seating. We just moved into the restaurant, so there is it yeah, there's no outdoor city, but we have a like full table inside, but the most of is the takeout right. Now, not we don't like really take up people's sitting. Okay, that makes sense, and this is going to be what kind of food Cajun food I saw. Something about that on here. Seafood yeah asian seafood, great excellent: when do you plan to open we already opened one week, so we try to apply the legal license. I hope you know, maybe make it better. Okay, thank you. Are there any questions from members of the committee for this application? Ms Thurston? Yes, just a point of clarification, I think on the application. You've checked both restaurant wine and full on premise or if you could it's right there, where you have restaurant wine and full on premise, do you know which one of those it will be? Or what do you are you seeking a full on premise license or just wine and butter just y and be it let's say: okay I would just amend it, amend this and cross out where you've selected full on premise and just initial it if you can okay. Thank you good catch. Thank you, Jessica. Any other questions from members of the committee. Mr Chair, I'm back I had trouble secure great to have you back. Do we know if it's wheelchairs from the outside and do you guys have a accessible bathroom in the location itself? Okay, so I, don't you repeat the question I think I got the question here so for customers who have who come in with a wheelchair who need access to your restaurant? Will they have the ability to access the restaurant? Is it either at ground level or is it on? Is there a ramp that goes up into it that that's the first question it's on ground level? Okay, so somebody could just come right in their wheelchair and it would be very easy to get into the location. Yeah, that's no step anything, then the second question was: do you all have a bathroom that will be accessible to someone with a wheelchair? No, the only thing we don't have the handle, but I think the size nah really can go in. That's gonna, be a problem. Okay, well, I! Think! If let me if we can just think this through a little bit, I would ask you don't feel, like that's I, think Mr Andrew said that this is going to be a problem. It's not going to be a problem. It's this is going to be. This is something that we will just discuss as a committee and try to figure out what what's going to happen with this location, and then we have to take a vote at the end of it. So I want to clarify that. But could you just explain it? Maybe a little bit more about the. What kind of bathroom you have is it is the door wide enough for somebody to go in there with the wheelchair I think the door's enough to go in there about the base space in the bathroom. It's not good enough for the wheelchair to fit yeah. Okay. So what would the plan be, then? If you have a customer who has a wheelchair and they need to use the bathroom excellent? Are you gonna look into? Are you gonna look into potentially making it accessible for people with a wheelchair, or what else are you gonna tell those customers? We could probably expand the size and add those bar railings, where the goes with the wheelchairs could hold on to get on the toilet. Okay, that's good to know. Mr Newmark, yeah I was just gonna. Follow up on that it's my understanding. I could be wrong, but it's my understanding that if you were going to undertake any renovations to a restaurant- and that may not be your plan or opened it at this point. But if you were ever going to do any renovations, I think the department of buildings would require you to follow, along with your daughter's recommendation or suggestion, which would be to expand the size of the bathroom so that it can manage a wheelchair and have the necessary hand railings and whatever else is required by the ADA requirements. Correct Mr, Newmark Correct thanks my man, any other questions for members of the committee. Okay, any questions from the members of the board, who are not members of this committee or from members of the public about this application. Okay, I'm not seeing any, could I ask the committee. If anyone has a motion to make move. Okay, I've got Mr, Harrison moved to approve I'll give Victor the second, because I think I heard him simultaneous to that. Do we have discussion on this motion? Hey Miss Cobb. Did you have a point of discussion? You wanted to raise no she's saying no. Okay, great so, at this point we'll take a vote. Everybody in favor can I see everybody's hands for that. Looking around got that okay, Miss Richardson. How do you vote? Yes, okay, Mr Andrews? How do you vote yes great in that case, I believe we have. It unanimous looks like it great all right! Wonderful! Thank you very much. Thank you for your presentation and good luck. Plucking your new locations! Thank you! Beautiful all right! We're on to renewals! For the evening, we've got four renewals on the list here: the 925 Fulton Street Hanson Dry 487 Atlantic Avenue Eastville, Comedy, Club, 54, J, Street, Olympia, Wine, Bar, 127, Atlantic, Avenue colony, Mr Church. Have we had any complaints or concerns expressed from the community about any of these applications? Any of these renewals miss church you're on mute, and if you can unmute yourself, that would be great I guess it would be. Thank you. In general, we haven't had any complaints, but there was a newspaper article that was founded to our office concerning Eastville comedy at 487, Atlantic Avenue hosting comedy shows at this time within the regulation, even if it seems a little edgy right. Is this still the case that we need? We haven't heard any concerns from the community about that location. Yeah. The only thing we got was the newspaper article from a committee member okay. All right does anybody have any further discussion or comments about the renewals or not? Seeing any can I ask for a motion on the renewals? Okay, are you moving to approve the renewals Mr Andrews? Yes, okay and I'll give Tanya the second I heard a second there from Tanya I think on second great all right. All in favor of the renewals, okay I got myself Mr Newmark and Miss Mcknight Richardson. How do you vote yes, Mr Andrews? How do you vote yes, Mr Harrison? How do you vote yes, Miss Thurston? How do you vote I'm going to abstain specifically because I'm concerned about the Eastville, Comedy, Club, okay and I believe I got everybody else. As for their vote, and you tell me, we do okay, great thanks, Jessica one question: I'm sorry: if I can Brandon sure Jessica would the abstention? Would her abstention be registered simply for eastville and not for all the others? No, it would apply to all of them, but yeah correct. Okay, I'm noting that that's why I'm abstaining, yeah I, think that makes sense all right, I, think that takes care of the renewals. So we can move along on our agenda to approval of the minutes from November 4th 2020. has any everybody had an opportunity to review those minutes, and let me just kick things off: does anybody want to make a motion to approve those minutes move to approve Mr, Harrison, Second, Mr, Newmark? Okay, any discussion, thoughts, concerns edits whatever, on the on those minutes, not seeing anything or hearing anything. Could we get a vote on the who's in favor of approving these minutes? I know, I am looks like everybody. I can see, is wait. Miss Thurston: are you in favor, okay, shoot, that's good, Mr Andrews! Are you in favor? Yes, okay and Tanya? Are you in favor, okay, I? Think, that's everybody on the minutes. Next, on the agenda for this evening is the chairperson's report. I, don't have a whole lot to report for the evening, but I do just want to check in on this barber that we were gonna have at the meeting tonight to see if what the plan will be for going forward so Miss church do you know what the status was or what we did to reach out to the barber for this evening and how sure we were that they were actually going to come and whether it would be good to have a follow-up. Maybe I spoke with him on Monday and I emailed him twice so I, don't know whether something came up. Okay, I got you Mr Richardson. Would you know anything about this or I spoke with him yesterday and he asked me a few questions and I told him. Basically, he had to you know, register to come in on to the meeting and basically just express the concerns of people in the community about the health and how he did a project before what would he you want to be assistive of I will help with some type of partnership or whatever, with the community board, because he said that it is effective. I didn't speak to him today, however, so I don't know, but I thought I seen that he was on here earlier. I thought I seen his phone number up here. Maybe we kept going on so long, you know. Well, there was we did have a. We did have a point where we sought out Mr Anthony earlier in the meeting and I did not get a response at that time, but if he joined later we're, of course, you know sorry that we missed him. Do you think Tanya, I'm really just asking to get your real sense about this? Do you think it's worth touching base with him about coming back to one of our future meetings or yeah? Do you feel like? Was there any indication I'm going to reach out to him after the meeting? Okay, great I, just not like him not to respond, because we spoke yesterday for some time right that makes sense. I mean look I think we all know things happen, so you know we're completely understanding of that and let's try to pick this up and see where we can get them in the in one of our future meetings here. Okay, the other thing I wanted to mention is just with the use of this Webex technology. I've heard from Mr Andrews that he would greatly prefer us to move to zoom and I. Think that there's a lot of other folks who are feeling that way throughout the community board. I wanted to ask if there's anybody on the committee who feels a different platform other than Webex might be preferable or if you've had experiences or challenges. Logging in, because I want to make sure that we that, if anybody, has feelings that or concerns about this, that I know them and can vocalize them if I need to on behalf of our committees: Mr Harris, okay! Well, thank you. Tanya I get your opinion. Nice. I've had to ask the board office to indulge me in registering me because I attend the meeting from a tablet, and we all know that, besides being kind of an idiot, that I am like a dinosaur with technology, but I have followed the instructions given by this church and staff of the have followed. What comes up on email and it just registration, thus far doesn't work from a tablet. For me during this meeting, I was kicked out once for no reason and I. Don't know if the office was controlling the sound. But at one point you said it looks like you're voting your favorite John but you're on mute. So the agency that I work for department Social services had used this as the I guess. It's the platform to hold on virtual meetings and by and large they have diversified, but there's a big push to move to zoom. It seems to work much better, as does teams which no one's mentioning, but that also works. So I know it's not about me and I. It's my understanding that there's been an issue. I think one of the issues for having it be Webex is of a financial nature, if I'm not mistaken, but if one's asking zoom works better much better. So thank you. No appreciate your opinion on that John. Any other members of the committee who have not spoken have a feeling about this I just wanted to capture anybody else's view. Okay. Well, thank you all very much for that. I. Think. Finally, for my chairpersons report, I just wanted to let it be known that we're going to be having a meeting on homelessness in the next month's meeting. It's going to be pretty fantastic and I really am looking forward to it. I. Our committee is pretty dependent upon our ideas of who's, going to be good speakers and meetings for the future, and we've been trying to do that and I think. We've really had a dynamic group of meetings that we've put forward so far this committee here, if you, if anyone has any ideas about future meetings, feel free to shoot me an email and follow up or through the board office an email too, but you know I want I like to try to keep capture everybody's views in that regard, particularly in regards to the environment which I I'm hoping to bring more into the meetings for the spring of this year, because we've really focused on health and I think this is 2020. We kind of have to focus on health and we're definitely gonna add some elements of social service in the next month, and so but environment and sustainability. I think climate change, I think, are things that we should be thinking about too and with the liquor licenses and the great health presentations. We have these robust discussions, but I. You know it'd be great to get to some of some other issues too, because we have the extreme luxury and credit of having such a wide net as a committee with so many different things that we can handle so to degree that anybody has any ideas, I'm open to them. Otherwise, I, you know we'll find a way to put something on the calendar that reflects that in the spring and I think there are going to be some other good things coming up too. I think it'll be also good to have some time to sit back and reflect on some of our past meetings and try to think about strategically what kind of budget priorities and district needs we can come up with. You know, rather than like rushing to do it in all one session in the meetings right coming up to the district needs. If we can really identify some things that we want to take forward from these past few meetings in this meeting, the one we had with Fort Greene Conservancy and even going as far back as that great presentation, we had on maternal mortality that happened right before the pandemic head and we all had to go virtual I mean I, think we've had a great year worth of presentations and I want to make sure we use it to build into something. So that's it for my cherished report for the evening. Let's move forward to the next session, which is other business, do we have any other business that anyone wishes to raise? I saw Mrs Church's finger before I saw Mr Newmark's hand, so I'm going to give Miss church the floor first. Thank you for your indulgence. Mr chair I just wanted to mention that the transportation and public Safety Committee has requested a joint meeting they'd like to participate in our meeting with, and the Department of Homeland services, they're interested in learning about the support services that are afforded to homeless people in the city, and since I mentioned that, if you, if I may, please, if you have any questions for either canva or DHS, please send them in while the meeting is not until December 6th, it is the holiday season is approaching and even though most people will be celebrating virtually I think it's a down time. So we need to give them extra time in preparing the questions. So, if we can, please have those questions say by the 18th of the month. Whatever day the 18th is, but a week before, the 24th would be really useful. Thank you Brandon. Oh thank you. Carol Anne, yeah, absolutely I I'll share around the draft and of some questions and I really encourage everybody to blow me away with your fantastic questions. I think we'll. We have a great opportunity here to tackle a really interesting topic and something that's been one of the foremost concerns not just in our community but in New, York City, with homelessness and I. Think it's going to be a very ripe discussion in January, so I look forward to it and we'll talk on the emails a bit about it. Okay, any other business, Mr, Newmark you're you patiently waited I'd, be happy to give you the floor. Thanks I'd like to know why one finger took precedence over an entire hand, but that that's very good I think it was faster. Just it's probably too late for the January meeting. Carol Anne, but breaking ground is going to be, is working on and will be opening a huge facility around the corner from where I live for homeless people, and they have a tremendous amount of experience in working with the homeless population. So I don't know if it doesn't make sense to reach out to them. At this point for a meeting, that's already scheduled with participants who you've already set up, but perhaps some point down the road it might be useful to reach out to them. They've got a big presence here in Brooklyn and in Manhattan as well, but what I was going to really raise my hand about was a concern. I feel deeply about, and I think that the community board should be focusing on it very intensively right now, which is what will happen for communities that we already know have been hit very hard by the coronavirus. What will happen in terms of testing availability and then availability and education with regard to vaccinations and I? Think that, if that's not focused on really almost to the extent that we forget about everything else right now and focus on that, our health and our economy will suffer continually and dramatically and I don't want to go beyond my two minutes, but I just want to make that point. That I think that's what we should be spending our energy and our time on. Right now and by we I mean the entire community board, not just our committee. Thank you, I think, that's a very that's a valid concern and you know the degree to which we have testing and vaccinations when they come out. I think it's still a lot of an unknown, because we don't know exactly how the plan is going to go and we had a great presentation from the Department of Health next week. But maybe there are some things we can do in some future meetings to bring in some additional stakeholders that will can help explain that I mean we have to keep an eye on things and appreciate you bringing it up for that regard because, as we keep going through the next month and we start seeing a plan for how the vaccinations are going to be administered, we need to make sure that we get information out to folks in the community locally and we need to make sure that we're doing our part as leaders within the community board, to bring this to the attention of everybody else. But I think you know. If there's one thing that we can do right now, I think maybe go out and try to find as much information as we can from internet research and so forth as to what plans are coming out as they come out. It'll make it very ripe for us to have a discussion about potential people we can bring in and potential topics. We can add to our agenda in the future. Did anybody else have any other thoughts about that? If I could just follow up for a minute, and thank you for your indulgence, Brandon, you know. I just did a quick search of testing sites in our area and Covid-19 testing sites, because that's something that could be taking place right now. We don't need to know more about it other than the fact that it's available and I would wager a bet that a lot of the sites that are in areas not too far from the housing projects that comprise our parts of our district I, don't know what outreach they're conducting and what education they're conducting in order to encourage people to come in and be tested, and if there's any way that we could as a community board. I, don't know, statement of concern and cooperation reach out to all the testing facilities to encourage them to engage in outreach and education in communities that are traditionally very underrepresented in availing themselves of these tests. I think that's really critical and that could be the groundwork for when vaccines are spread beyond what the initial groups are that have been identified thus far right now. The CDC study group recommended, of course, health professionals and congregate care residents as being the first two groups that should receive vaccinations, but hopefully more vaccines will be coming out in the next month or two, so that they'll need to start expanding those populations and if groundwork can be conducted. Now, with regard to people not being afraid of taking the vaccine, if, in fact it's a realistic vaccine and safe to take that will help a lot so I don't want to belabor the point, but I don't think the point could be belabored we're wasting time. If we're not doing anything right now, I mean I can understand that I think the Department of Health class last month made some statements about outreach that they were conducting in regards to the public housing communities and to communities that were in the most need. I can't say it's all sitting on the top of my head right now, but I would agree that this is something that we should look at going forward, and unless did you have a motion you were planning to make about this Barry. I'm not sure what motion would be appropriate in terms of action. That motion would lead to I'm really I, don't want to jump ahead and say something that really wouldn't be helpful without giving it a thought and perhaps are talking about it a bit further, and maybe some ideas will surface as a result of you know. This brief conversation that we've had now I mean Tanya, Richardson I, think lives in a housing project and be curious to see whether or not she's seen any outreach by the Department of Health or anybody else. With regard to testing I, don't know if she's still on the line or not I understand that I think you know I. We have to kind of do this by availability we have in the evening and what and who wants to be able to speak, I'll, ask and see if anybody else on the committee wants to comment on this and otherwise I mean I, think what we could do it I'll. Take this away, too, is try to think about specific plan or a specific project or motion that we can make in a future meeting to try to talk about, to try to focus this into something that we can work on. I would encourage you to do the same Barry so that we can try to have something productive come out of it. Was there any other member of the committee that wanted to voice an opinion about Barry's thoughts here? Okay, I'm not seeing anybody else, but I will take it away Barry and we can definitely follow up on that and I'll make sure that it doesn't fall off of our future meeting agendas. This goes forward into the next item tonight, which is community forum and I understand. We have some folks from the community who wanted to be able to speak. I got them in a list and I understand some other people chatted. The first person on my list is Abel Dominguez. Do we have Abel Dominguez, and did you want to take two minutes to address us here this evening? Yes, hi, how are you wait? Let me put my camera on. Can you see me guys? Okay, hello?

Believe next on my list here tonight is Stephen Beasley Mr Beasley did you want to speak tonight absolutely and I'm I apologize. You might hear a child in the background, but it's eight o'clock at night. So I'm sure a lot of folks have their families around. So I'm stepping with New York Presbyterian Brooklyn. We just have two key updates. The first is that we've expanded our financial aid program across our hospital system. There's a little bitly link inside of the chat we are now servicing families and individuals earning up to 600 of the federal poverty level. There's a number for additional assistance. Those folks are working very hard to expand those efforts and I'm not just saying that, because I work for New York, Presbyterian I also have some folks who have experience working with them personally. So the other thing is that even for our medical group, which is our dozens of sites around the world, okay, you really have to be quiet. I'm sorry, the dozens of sites that we have around the borough are our medical group right, and so we on nyp.org medical groups and that's in the chat as well. They have a whole other financial aid policy. So that's when you've maybe gone to a primary care, physician or a specialist. You can also explore some financial aid there and, lastly, you can our center for community health, which is a 400,000 square foot facility across from our hospital, is opening February 2021. and that offers cardiology orthopedics Gastroenterology some cancer comprehensive cancer services, as well as ambulatory services and women's health. So you can find out more information about that and for all virtual support groups and events. You can there's a link in the chat as well, which is our events page and so you'll see me if you, whenever I'm invited back I'll come back and give updates and or you know, I'll always send out emails about programming and thank you for being receptive. Thank you very much and we'd love to have you back at a different meeting in the future. A question Brandon. If you don't mind just where is that center, that's really the same yeah, so the center for community health is going. The entrance is going to be on 6th street in park slope in the middle of the block between seventh and eighth Avenue. So it's right across from my hospital at 506 sixth street, and when you go on yeah and when you go on Nyp.Org Brooklyn. Not only can you find out about the center for community health, but also about? Oh thanks also about all of the other medical group sites that are, from literally from the downtown Brooklyn area, all the way out to what I like to call coastal Brooklyn in Coney Island. So we've got you around the borough as much as we can, and so that's the information about the location. Thank you so much you're welcome. Thank you. Next, up on the evening, we've got Magdalena Popkowski Magdalena. Do we have you on the line? Yes, I. Am that student? Excuse me Mr Kowsky, so sorry, I, your microphone connection is bad I recommend turning your video camera off to improve your microphone. Sorry about that? Okay! Let's try again! Is it better now, that's it yeah. It sounds a bit better now! Yeah! Thank you. Okay, sorry suggestion. So I'm a student at public health and health policy, and I'm here to advocate for the bill 1650-2019. This is a bill that requires the health administration to provide information about the hackbox program and farmers markets in the city to all individuals who receive or apply to receive supplemental and nutrition assistance program benefits. So the problem that I'm I actually found out with this bill is the health. The human resource administration is still having problems with they're, not reaching the low income community as they should, but there is a lot of media that helps and all these advocation and advocacy groups that help this but they're still not doing the best job and I think the bill should be revisited to help people living in poverty to get fresh fruits and vegetables. Thank you for explaining that that's good to know about I think if everybody can see this, the board staff has been so on point that they found the bill. They posted it in the chat and I think we have the opportunity to take a look at this and did any member of the community or the committee have any questions or thoughts on the bill. I know we're just getting the opportunity to look at it and Magdalena we'll take a look at this bill and see if there's anything that we might want to do with it in the future. It's great that you've come here and brought this to our attention. We really appreciate it. Thank you. I'd like to go to our next speaker for the evening. Next on the list I've got is Melanie Zuniga. We have Melanie here, hi everyone. Yes, I'm here. Can you hear me? Okay, yeah. We can hear you just fine awesome, I'm another student, that's advocating for a bill, so I'm Melanie Zuniga, I'm a registered dietitian and master student at Hunter College. Thank you guys for letting me speak. I'm here to advocate for bill 578 that supports the expansion and maintenance of school gardens in New York City in New York City. There are over 1.2 million residents that are food insecure, including 399,000 children, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and currently less than half of the 1866 NYC schools have gardens. The Department of Health, recently reported childhood. Obesity has tripled within the state, and studies have shown positive associations between obesity, overweight and food insecurity, disproportionately affecting underserved communities of color that lack access to real produce and healthy foods, as well as green faces. I'm talking with you today because as someone who has been in the New York City public school system since Kindergarten, the resources and opportunities and learning about nutrition and gardening were nearly non-existent with minimal exposure and access to fresh produce. Personally I didn't know, there were other salad greens, besides romaine lettuce, until I was 18 working at a cafe on 14th street, especially on the age of Covid-19. The need for gardening and nutrition literacy are forms of survival when residents are running out of food and income is unstable or uncertain. Organizations behind school gardens are facing severe budget cuts and some do not provide nutrition education due to a lack of resources and funding. This is why an interagency school community garden team within the mayor's office of sustainability is needed, as it will provide the resources and develop initiatives that promote the use and expansion of these gardens, I volunteered at school gardens and have seen the positive results firsthand take this fifth grader from ps216, for example, who said before I came to the school I didn't eat anything no fruits or vegetables, and now that I've come to the garden I'll. Try anything the benefits of school gardens are profound, ranging from academic achievement. Physical and emotional health, increased food security to school and community benefits. So I came here today to ask for your support to amend section 20 of the New York City Charter. Thank you. Okay, that's great I mean it's one thing to take a look at it. How closely are you following this bill? Mr Negra I've been following it for the past few months, I guess since September, oh just a few months, okay and I can put the letter, am I correct in saying that the bill has been referred to committee. It looks like it from the website. It looked like the bill had been in committee since 2018, but I. Don't know if that's correct and did you have any updates on that or anything yeah I think it has been as well, but I haven't heard any updates from after that. Okay did anyone on the committee have any thoughts or comments they wanted to make in regards to the bill or Mrs Amiga's remarks here: hey thanks everyone and thank you. Mr Suniga we'll take a look at this bill and we'll maybe we'll talk about it in a future meeting here. Okay, thank you for bringing it to our attention. Thank you guys. Next, and this is the last person I've got is and so by all means comment. If you, if you're, not after we're done with this next person, this is Stephanie Correa. We have Stephanie Correa, yes hi. This is Stephanie. I am a professional. Well, I'm under my professional capacity, I work, I oversee I also attend the CUNY School of Public Health, and I've just been interested in looking into things to advocate for one of the items that I wanted to discuss today was a resolution that was passed. That was no a 2019 resolution, it's number 1043 and it condemns the Trump administration's plan to cut spoofs food stamps. For about three million people, it was sponsored by Council member Fernando Cabrera. Primarily the reason I wanted to bring this up at this community board meeting was just to just get some support in kind of revisiting it and possibly amending it. So far, it was not approved by the council, and I would really like to have it advanced. The only thing that I had a problem with in this resolution. It was very vague in that it referred to condemning the Trump administration into Cup food stamps for three million people, but it didn't specify which food stamp proposed rules they were referring to, and there have been many advancements over the past year, which applies to participants, utilizing food stamps or any public services. There was also I'm sorry. I have some notes here: the able-bodied adult with dependence, the work requirement and time limit rule, which limits the amount of time that someone can receive snap benefits for to a three-month period and I think that's just really relevant right now, because you know unemployment rates have been high because of the pandemic, people jobs so I, just it's just not fair. So a lot of these proposed rules have kind of been suspended in after the family's first coronavirus response act, but that's only temporary, so I do think that we need to think about moving forward on. What's going to be done, and so I just wanted to call and support from the community to just have this resolution revisited possibly ended and then advanced I really would I think it'd be helpful for it to be modified to clearly identify. You know what rules is condemning. It should be all-encompassing and kind of condemn all attacks on snap funding and I think this revised stamp. Revised stance could build support on the federal level and just support the overall fight against food security in New, York City, which I know we've brought up several times which has been brought up during this community board meeting food insecurity as an issue in New, York City, so yep, that's, basically what I wanted to bring up tonight. Okay, great! Thank you very much for bringing it up. Did you have a link to this bill or is there something? Was there a link that somebody could share? Maybe the board office or you miss Korea. If you wanted to share we with the board office, okay, great cool, so it looks like the board offers. No, the board office has pulled this up. This is good. Does anybody on the committee have any comments or thoughts with regards to this topic that Mrs Berea has brought up right? I, don't see any but like with the other bills, Miss Korea we'll definitely take a look at them and consider taking them up in a future meeting. Thank you all right. Thank you very much for coming. Was there anyone else for community forum who wanted to speak going once going twice, okie, dokie, I haven't heard anything so I will entertain a motion to adjourn. Does anybody want to make a motion to adjourn Mr, Harrison, Second, Mr, Andrews I said I was gonna switch to roll call voting, I'm gonna, guess Mr Harrison you're in favor of adjourning, yes, Sir Mr Andrews, yes, Sir Thurston, yes, Miss, Mcknight, Yes, Mr, Newmark, Ms, Richardson, they're, already adjourned. Okay, well, I think we've we are sufficiently adjourned. Thank you all for coming this evening and I hope. You guys have a wonderful holiday and the rest of your holidays, whatever that might be.
