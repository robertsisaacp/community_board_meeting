Thank you rob. So we have six voting members. A couple of things. I want to mention again one to reiterate the meeting is being recorded. Number two: if you're, not speaking, go on new number three, if you are someone who has the ability to login to the computer and you're logging in to your phone pick, one can't do both it'll come back with a echo. So from a technology perspective pick one don't log into both and again I can't repeat enough! Please try not to have your phone on you. So I think now that we've addressed agenda item number one, a roll call by way of roll call. We then we have the introduction of the committee officers I'm not going to have every person may I have an approval of tonight's agenda, so moved so moved by mr. Smith and I get a second Juliet. Second, one is Julia, : Chang are there any? Is there any edits or any discussion on the motion? I, don't think I need any, but we're doing this to Ted the phone. So I want to make sure we're clear.

It's been a long time have been accepted. Item number five on the agenda: Construction fence artwork pushed I'm street seats activation at Temple Square. We have some representatives here, I think Rob correct me: do we do we have a sense that all these individuals who were listed under number five, all on the call I saw Emily on the call I you know Maron on McHale, okay, give David McCarty on the call and Jessica Christine from MDOT okay. So there's a lot of individuals listed here on the call Who am I going to look to the zoo. Is there a committee report? Is there one of the chairs of coaches they're gonna, leave this or should I have one of the individuals here? Yes, spokesperson. Mr. Singletary, the an earlier version of the presentation was emailed to the Transportation Committee when we did not know that we are going to be meeting of by teleconference tonight right, but I believe that Emily and their designer to design proposal. I'm. Sorry before you do that Juliet is there. Is there anything that you want to say before we turn it over to the team? No I have comments and I'm happy to ask the questions after the presentation. Okay, great! So sorry about that interruption. The floor is yours, we'll listen to your presentation, okay, I'm gonna! Try to share my screen. Tell me what you can see the rainbow color. Do you see the rainbow colored 3b PDF, that's really cool! Thank you great. So my name is David. Mccarty I am the vice president and alloy developments. There are several people on the agenda for the presentation today, because this is really a collective proposal between alloy development, the OT, the downtown Brooklyn partnership and in collaboration with Tyler Ken, who is the designer I think most of you know where temple square is, but for those who don't it is a small public space to eat. If you can see my cursor technically this area of land, it's at the corner of Flatbush Avenue, the third Avenue and skimmer Orange Street, and it's been identified for a long time as a underutilized public space. It's also adjacent to a Flatbush development which we are the developers on and we've been working with. The dense I'm live in partnership and D-O-T over the last several months to try to achieve really two goals. One is the activation, temporary activation and movement of that public space and two as we get into construction of eighty Flatbush public art piece along the construction fence, which is typically the hunter green speck from DOB. Before we get to much deeper into the presentation, I'll turn it over to VOT to talk through their street seats program and public art program hi. This is Jessica Krantz Dean. Can you all hear me great? So you guys are all pretty familiar with this treaty program. It's an application based program where we turn underutilized roadway into public space. We have five give or take street seats in your district. It's important to note that right now we're looking at transitioning our street seat program from the platform model which are more familiar with, so that would be like the ones that burn Street and F field Street to an on platform, Street seat, so that's closer to the brick Street seat. That is also in your district, so that combines so that is it's all of our standard materials. It's not a platform and it combines public seating with like, and so you know, as with all the rest of our streets, that you are anyway. The maintenance partner here would be done time for the partnership and they would take on the daily maintenance, but it would be just like all the others public space. It is open to the public at all times the furniture gets put away at night, it's and yeah. We provide technical support and design review and I'll hand it over to Nina now to talk through our program. Well, can you guys hear me yep great so I mean Ameri a program manager for the deity's temporary art program and through the program we partner with community-based organizations and artists to realize temporary artwork on our property, which includes sidewalks, plazas, median bridges, etc. We're working often with our internal operating units at do T, in this case public space, to realize the project and some of our goals when we're activating our property with temporary artwork, is to create a more attractive corridor increase access to our in the public realm and through this process we work with a variety of artists and all of our projects that we present on our property is temporary. You may be familiar, may have seen some throughout the city we're in all five boroughs. This particular project is presented through our dimensions, tract we're an organization and artists team applies directly to our program, with a specific location in mind. Our Advisory Committee then reviews that application and D-O-T arch works with the project team throughout implementation leading up to during, and we work on coordinating all logistical elements as well as permitting with all appropriate team members. So that's it for me for now great the other city program that is instrumental in making this proposal happen is through the Department of Cultural Affairs, and it's a program done in partnership with art, bridge called City canvass, and it is essentially taking scaffolding and other typical D-O-T construction, fencing that would normally be the hunter green spec, that's required by DOB and creating public artwork for it. So our proposal, in addition to applying or approval through the Department of Transportation, both the street seats and the art program, is also an application. Through the Department of Cultural Affairs City canvass program, we've talked about the specific location of the site. Temple Square is this triangular public space? It's technically do teal and it has a if you are familiar with it today. It has a few trees, no seating. It has been underutilized and not well maintained for a long period of time, and so it's a something that's been on our radar on deity's radar announcement radar as a potential. You know vibrant public space with some additional resources. In addition, the first phase of eighty Flatbush project is essentially everything to the east of the current khalil gibran Academy, and you can see that section would be wrapped in the standard construction fence and along Flatbush Avenue would have overhead protection. We typically at alloy. We like engaging and public art work and community engagement type activities. You may remember, we had a we still had building on the eighty Flatbush site. We commissioned a local Brooklyn artist, Katie Mertz, to do a big, black-and-white mural on two of the buildings that we owned. We also worked with do T for a one-day, plaza closure that happened back in 2016. We came to the community board prior to that one-day closure, and that was done in collaboration with several the cultural institutions in downtown Brooklyn. We did a fall cultural kickoff where we had I think it was. You know a dozen or so cultural organizations do performances and advertise their fall calendar right at this Temple Square location. So as we moved into construction, we were interested in continuing to invest in this place, help the public start seeing this as a public space that be used for gathering and performance and to also do something above and beyond and better than your typical VOT deal be construction fence. So we issued an RFP to a bunch of small design and architecture firms, with a focus primarily on MWBE and local architecture, design and artists, and through that RFP, which we did in collaboration with downtown Brooklyn partnership, tyler ken, which is a design firm that is based in Brooklyn and in Latin America was the winning respondent and I. Believe Greg is on the line I'm an assistant in a second, and he can talk you through his proposals, but maybe before we do I know Ryan and Brennan grew where he one from downtown partnership might not be, but I think Ryan has presented to your can is certainly present at the Transportation Committee off tonight's and you've met em. He manages all of the plazas in downtown Brooklyn for the downtown Brooklyn partnership and they are a very essential partner in this, both from the selection process of the RFP. But all seams are you doing maintenance and operation I blend up hi, David, sorry, Ryan, I'm, texting Ryan's he's having some sort of technical issues so I'll, just back you up on everything. You just said: we're really excited! Yes, so listen! This is learning similar. We don't need wine. Tell them, relax, tell them enjoy his evening. Whatever we need to get back up, we will and blend I'm sure you can be a capable representative. So with that, could please continue that I will pass it over to Greg. One of the founding partners of Tyler can to walk. Give you a little background on what they do and hi everyone. Do you hear me? Okay, yes, great! Thank you. So my name is Gregory matanov and, as David mentioned, I run a small architecture and design practice. That's based both in New York City and in Central, America and working down south. We really are always in kind of the context of a developing economy and because of the sort of different social tiers that we run into our works also kind of over time developed. An engagement with creating large-scale public works that really aim to bring in a broader community than is usually typical and working with local craftsmen and a lot of community members are has sort of created a feedback loop with our work, where we've sort of developed a kind of style with our firms work both in the large scale, like interventions that we've done that are more temporary and more, let's say our art works, and if David you go to. The next slide also has kind of an touches sort of every aspect of the projects. We do kind of making sure that we infuse the work that we do with a lot of color texture and sort of an overall playfulness that really helps us to create a bigger, tent and appeal to a lot of people beyond kind of the usual consumer of design. So when we were approached for the RFP process, we sort of saw the design problem as addressing sort of the two sides of the project. As David mentioned, one is the large amount of Street shed that would kind of like the ubiquitous New York scaffolding. That was going to be almost you know a full city block length along Flatbush Avenue and then also the Temple Square open, plaza on Lafayette, and we really wanted to find a language that worked for both of these things and actually connected them as kind of one larger piece, while still maintaining that kind of lightness and playfulness and accessibility sort of creating a big piece of public art that can be enjoyed by everyone. Next. So the approach to designing the streets ed was really to work within the confines of typical New York scaffolding and just kind of elevated, nothing too, fancy, but adding just a very limited palette of colors, which would kind of create a large-scale art installation that could be appreciated from different speeds of experience, because you have a lot of traffic along Flatbush and a lot of pedestrian traffic as well. So we wanted something that could kind of be appreciated on the intimate scale of a person walking through the scaffolding of somebody walking across from the scaffolding or of a automobile passing in either direction of the traffic. So essentially it's your typical New York staffing, just given a kind of a color blocking treatment with an addition of a row of colored lighting, which at night would create enhance the visibility and an increase, the safety of the of the scaffolding corridor as well. And then, on the plaza side. We wanted to take a similar approach. But really you treat the street almost like a backdrop and connected with the plaza in order to create a real sense of space, because as David mentioned right now, the plaza itself is quite small and doesn't really lend itself to any impromptu activity that one usually finds in a public park. But the idea to kind of knit the background of the street shed with the with a with a design that kind of turns down onto the plaza paving, creates a real sense of space, even though the plaza is still completely open and then just going forward. We also in line with the street seat conversation. We look for ways to kind of enlarge. The body is now sidewalk, paving and kind of grow the pedestrian area into the traffic space, to really enhance the visual presence and also the usability of the space and layered in VOT, approved planters and loose seating. That's very already familiar to the kind of average New York pedestrian. So they again there's no barrier for access. This is designed sort of for everybody and that, just by seeing those kind of typical public tables and chairs, people will know that it's okay to sit there, it's okay to kind of enjoy this space, and hopefully that starts to develop kind of a user base. Let's say which could be the space could kind of host impromptu events or planned events with the large amount of cultural institutions in the area which, and also we were after the RFP process. We were asked to kind of extend the treatment of the design onto State Street, and this seemed like a really good opportunity to tie the design to the other side of the block. So it didn't feel like a back side as much, but also kind of just work with the existing streets tread that was there to kind of make it quiet. A quieter intervention and yeah I can take this in terms of community outreach. We at alloy, along with dr. Bookman partnership and Greg, have made a very concerted effort to develop this proposal in collaboration with a bunch of stakeholders for our 80 flapless projects. We have a community advisory group that meets every two months on that advisory group. Cheryl from the community board is on it. In addition, there's representatives from a local block, Association one Hinson place condo board 300 a Shannon rental building, downtown Brooklyn partnership, downtown Brooklyn, Arts Alliance, the Rockville bears garden a bunch of folks and they've been kept in the loop. As of the proposals been developed, Greg came and presented the proposal to them back and laid some arrow and say, and in addition to that, because there are aspirations that, from time to time, the Temple Square Plaza could be activated with cultural programming. I'm greg has done a bunch of additional outreach to warn off cultural organizations in the districts. You know, aside from the Denton Living Arts Alliance, who sits on the advisory group, he's met with Mark Morris folks at brick, Oaks recess in terms of timeline. This slide that you see on your screen was the timeline before the coded crisis really began, and that timeline was for us to officially apply for the street seats application process present to you, the community board and then really start implementation this spring, so that it could be open for the nice weather. As you are well aware, there is a construction moratorium in the city and prices continue, so this timeline is no longer accurate. I wish I could give you an accurate timeline, but I can't I think the intention is as soon as it is safe and feasible to do the installation work. We would like to do it so that we can hopefully hit at least some of the nice weather this spring and summer, and that's it I'm happy to take any questions if you like all right so we'll do we'll do this somewhat. You know I'm gonna, say somewhat I'm talking in my college. You're gonna do this in an orderly fashion, because but I have question, is only one committee board members, my committee board member in that community board members, but committee board members. So let me start with Julia calling Chung, who is the chair of the transportation Public Safety Committee, so Julia I'll turn it to you. If you have any questions. Thank you. Yes, you did address one of my questions in the presentation about the maintenance of the plaza and the furniture. It was mentioned that the furniture would be taken in at night and I was I'm. Just gonna give up all of my questions at once, so everybody can respond. I would like to know what time at night the furniture is going to be taken in and if it's very late, if there's going to be any security, maybe as part of the construction project that might also walk by the plaza at nighttime and then also just thinking about coronavirus, whether there's going to be any waking down of the seats on a daily basis before the furniture is put away. So one of my questions was about the furniture. The other one maintenance, wise I, was wondering how long the plaza is expected to last how many years and if there's any idea of refreshing the paint at any point, if need be during that during that period and I have noted notice. I'm like there was another Plaza in Williamsburg, for example, where the paint became worn after a year. The paint on the pavement. The other note was that I noticed there were three trees in the plan, but Google Street View shows for trees. Currently so I'm wondering if there's a street tree being eliminated from the plaza and then overall I think it's great that you guys are bringing this vibrancy and the color to the neighborhood, with the with the painting and with the with the lights, I think it'll be I. Think it'll be a really nice addition. Well, I can try to answer the questions. Ryan is probably going to be most helpful as it relates to this tree furniture, but the street furniture will be purchased by Ali. It will be standard, D-O-T, bistro, chairs and tables that you see at other public spaces in downtown Brooklyn. The downtown Brooklyn partnership will manage putting up and taking down the furniture every night in the same way that they do over at the 300, a slim plazza and several of the other plazas in downtown Brooklyn, and not aware of the timing. Belinda, do you know when second down yeah it'll, just it'll be in line with the other clauses, which is according to the DOE fund schedule, which is generally around 7 p.m. and as to the Sanitation questions? They will be following a really strict protocol of sanitizing all the furniture, and that wouldn't be at the end of the day. Merely it would be throughout the day given in terms of the length of duration, construction of the phase 1 of 80 flatbush is roughly a three year construction process, and this is being permitted through D-O-T on a one year basis. The intention is that we have part of why we liked Greg's design approach is that it is very easy to maintain versus a more elaborate mural, and so the intention is that whatever and I think it's six or seven discrete colors, that, instead of as you, would typically have the jobsite, you have a big bucket of hunter green paint that you would use to cover up graffiti. We will just have six or seven of them that are the different colors, and you know instruction fences get marked up often in the city and needs to be touched up on a regular basis and depending on how much graffiti there is. So the intention is that it is an ongoing refresh and that the at the end of the calendar year whenever this is the proof just for the year. It would be the potential for us to reevaluate the current design, and you could imagine a lot of different ways that reg and his team could elaborate on it and make it a different and better thing over time. We also think that you know it's helpful, but you can see actually here in this rendering the Katy Mertz mural that we had on the two buildings for several years and it was very well received in the community. But after us you know I. If it was 12 or 18 months started getting feedback that was like okay, we've seen that like. Wouldn't it be nice if we could, you know, modify it so I think that's another thing that we like about the proposal in terms of street trees. There are four street trees. One of them is dead. You can actually see it in this rendering it's the one that covers up most of the brick building of 360 to skin oil industry, and we have put in a request to Department of Parks to let them know that it is dead and there is a long waiting list. My understanding is, there is one waiting list from I: don't know what the status of that weed it replaced. Yeah thanks. It's a it's a question for parts that can we love street trees so happy to replace it. There's really dead, get around to actually removing it. Thank you. So let me now go to Cheryl kelps, as our representative on the Advisory Committee for any Flatbush. Do you have any questions? I know this design, but there's one thing: I just heard that he might change it every year so that it is not right after why people get sick of seeing the same thing, no baby. Every year refresh, it would be nice, but it's a beautiful concept. You like it great, thank you for the statement. So now I'm gonna open it up to other committee members. Are there any questions hi? This is Lenny major it'd, be just one question about the furniture now we're different. We would defer to be stored with there be a another little building like erected to put the furniture in or how does that work? Hello, yes, generally speaking and I'm, not sure if we have access to any inner interior storage size, but generally we paying them off at the end of the night. Okay, so it would be on the site just chained up most likely yeah thanks, Belinda no worries at all. Thank you, I thought, I. Think it's a very good idea. Thank you very much. Anyone else would any questions. I just have one question: I'm sorry introduce ya. This is Brandon. Smith I was just wondering and first of all, I also like the design. I have no concerns about that. I was just wondering about snow removal in the wintertime on, particularly like the plaza area and that walkway. That seems to be in between the scaffolding and the and the plaza who would be responsible for that and yeah. That's really my only concern this is within the boundaries of town, Brooklyn partnerships bailiwick. So for supplemental excuse me snow removal. We would be responsible. Okay, great thanks, any other questions from committee members. No, that's why I said anybody so gay bar where you can ask the question there: you go Barbara waited way to go. Eda I, think this project is lovely and when you got up close the colors much more inviting if the underlying do that there has been outreach to us saying gave this proposal to the Community Advisory Group. It didn't include State Street and there was a member of the 500 block of State Street, who felt left out and requested that the design be brought down their block. So there has been conflicting feedback and Greg has tried to accommodate it. Asbestos on the question of the current Kovach crisis, in its relationship to construction in general and at 80 Flatbush. More specifically, the construction moratorium is in place. We as such or not, planning on the intention was to start construction on the first phase of 80 Flatbush sometime this spring that was prior to the Covid-19 crisis happening construction moratorium is in place currently, so the exact start of construction is still TBD, but the by all means we are moving ahead with the project and alone. Will the art, installation and streets eight. The street seats application is a one year application that can be renewed, but the original approval is for just the first year and the construction fence. You know. Construction of the first phase is roughly a three year duration, and so we would expect the construction fence to be up for those three years and, as I mentioned earlier, we imagine there would be a refresh of the design. You know in an annual basis and mr. Singletary I just received one additional question. They comment via email of Zack Martin, who is the pastor of youth and outreach at the church? That's in the Baptist Temple. He states that no outreach has been done to improve the congregation at the recovery house of worship. Any space I was curious at the other side of Street and sidewalk will be addressed. There are too many planters in this area in general, making it very difficult humor and we address issue of hundreds of new pedestrians being introduced to the area and planters and an art, installation and city bikes already being there that's job, if you wouldn't mind giving him my contact information, we've tried to reach out to the church in the past and haven't been able to connect, so I'd be happy to reach out to them and give this same presentation. We would also love to have them on our Advisory Committee and I've tried to do that in the classroom. Haven't been successful. So if you wouldn't mind the introduction, that would be really helpful. I'd be happy to do both of those things. Thank you any other questions from committee members great. Thank you for the presentation. Good luck with the rest of the project and please make sure you reach out to the church and I. Thank you for offering up your contact information. I, really appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you all Thank You, mr. Singletary I. Just wanted to suggest since I see some people on the participant panel. He did not I see committee members who are on the participant panel, who did not answer the roll call when you do get ready for a vote. I'd like to do a roll, that's possible yeah! That's fine! Are we there now for this rob? Does this require children yeah? It also requires a motion before a real pervert. No I got you I was asked if I was trying to. You know tickle some of your fantastic. So with that and hearing no more questions, because I've asked several times, you're gonna move in I'll entertain a motion to accept to accept the committee's who actually because scepter right accept the recommendation or the Temple Square design so moved mr. Singletary Jordan Thank You mr. Jordan can I get a second from Juliet. Thank you, Thank You, Juliet. Second, by Juliet is there any discussion on the motion? Can I ask? Can I ask Cheryl what she thought of the State Street side being part of that community advisory committee? After meeting the State Street as David was saying you get, you get conflicting issues, some people would say they love everything next meeting, so they will come back and say they don't like you and it seems like they have to get together and have one voice you like it or you don't. You know it depends on who were speaking to cool and State Street. You get conflicting responses, but I think when I saw this, when I saw this presentation, I thought that was the best thing, because I hate to see that ugly green spread through that interest, such a big piece of you know, I saw a wall green and by time they finished sticking up all these different posters. You know what happens in the construction site, it'll be ugly, so what they propose is beautiful if they can maintain it and State Street. It's a yes for some, it's a no for some, but you have to look at the entire Brooklyn community. Would you know we want something that would appeal to everybody Thanks? So, thank you sure, Julia, anything else. No any other discussion on the motion. Okay, let me just add that this is being recorded and green or colors was beautiful and that is a Nadder beholder. So Cheryl was able to express her sincere feelings that may not reflect the opinions of all the community. Well, the community as a whole, but we respect your position and thank her for her work on the Advisory Committee. So hearing no further discussion, all in favor or not sorry Rob, you can do your vocal found. Mr. Singletary. Yes, mr. Gordon, yes, Zeller, Greiner Barbara, yes, Jessica Thurston, yes, Juliet dawn! Chun! Yes, are you with us, you Thank You Quran, so the next item on the agenda item six man walks and Preservation Commission certificate of appropriateness, application, I really need Carlton or Irene to you know if you this is this is where I need you to step up this chair. So is it possible? You can click the button that takes you up new there. You go good job Carlton! Okay, can you hear? Yes, you can hear me now we can okay, good all right! Thank you! Okay, so I guess we'll start with the Brooklyn Bridge one Brooklyn Bridge, Park I, don't have the agenda in front of me, but I know it's a redo of someone to work around the tower and some of the work of some brickwork along and opening up some area and a grassy area. So Carlton. Let me help you out. I'm re was on the agenda. Brooklyn Bridge, Park, normally 11, Water Street, holds a very historic district. Application is to construct a public plaza beneath the Brooklyn Bridge and beyond, using a play, otech, precast, paver and asked for asphalt and to enlarge the existing Empire stores. Folks are fairly long and create a new lawn area and fenced pain on planting beds, with security, ballots benches and other seating, and mr. chairman I see that Eric Landau, the president of a Brooklyn Bridge Park, is on the on the call and he is joined by Lindsay Roth's from his staff and I believe they are prepared to make a presentation. So I ragazzi amazing thank you for braving Thank You. Mr. chairman. Do it? Okay, great so, if you're ready to make a presentation, we're ready to listen, fantastic. Thank you very much and before I actually start my present on the plaza project. I actually want to thank the community board or helping get some of our messaging out over the last six seven weeks. You know. Obviously we are living in very interesting times and there are changes to the park in terms of what is currently open and what protocols we are asking people to comply with in terms of social distancing from areas of the park that are closed or social, distancing, practical and the community board has been really fantastic and helping to push out some of that messaging. So I really appreciate. I really appreciate that. Oh thank you. Mr. chairman teach your leadership and Rob Harris for your diligence. Well, having said that, the Brooklyn Bridge Plaza project is being presented to the executive committee tonight, it's actually being put into the community board now really for the first time in this design, we were scheduled and present before the Land Use Committee on March 18th, but obviously because of a that meeting did not happen, and we are very appreciative today board for hosting us evening. I will note that this project has been presented to the parks, community, Advisory Committee on multiple occasions, its design committee and its full committee, of which it was very well received and Rob Harris actually joined us for that last meeting. The plaza project and Lindsay is going to run through the drive. The slides as I speak from the beginning that I'm actually going to turn it over to her for the specific design elements, but the plaza project was actually the first section of Brooklyn Bridge Park to be constructed. You can see it's sitting there in red. It takes up about it's about two acres and it has lots of purposes. Not only does it connect the Dumbo section of the park through the southern piers, but is to serve as a public plaza and more open space of the park, and it was supposed to be the first part of the park to be developed. In fact, in 2008 we, after going through community board and LPC review, we removed the purchase building to not only build out this section apart, but to really open up the view plane to both bridges and to the Manhattan skyline and right after we took down the first building in 2008, we were ready to go with construction as the first part of the park to be built, at which point New, York City D-O-T received significant resources through the federal economic stimulus package to do repair work on the bridge itself. They asked us if we would halt the construction of this two acres. As there was lots of park still to build I mean. Could we stand out on this part? Come back to it later after they I? Did the repair work on the bridge I'm, proud to say that work has been completed and what was to be the first section of a clean bridge park built out is actually now going to be the final section of with the completion of the pr2 uplands later this summer. The only remaining piece of the original park plan is this two acres directly. So this is what it looks like today. It's a big large, open sort of a slab of property. We do currently use the site it's fenced off, but we do use it for the occasional programming, for example, photo ville, which is a signature program that has been taking place in the park. The last ten years is here for about two weeks in late August early September, we've done a couple other activations in this space, but it largely sits, as you see it, in this image as unused space directly underneath the bridge another sight line of it. Looking directly at st. Ann's warehouse trend, you can see the Manhattan Bridge. In the backdrop, as I said, D-O-T had some work that they needed to do on the bridge itself. Part of their work also included directly around the bridge abutments, where they did start cobblestones and security bollards, as well as that wrought iron. Hence, when our project is complete, public will be able to walk on those cobblestones past the bollard line, but all the way around the bridge abutment, including on the waterside they public, will never be allowed to go into the wrought iron fence. That's the OT controlled property that is fenced off for security reason, but this photo I would which was in 2018 shows the portion of this project. That was do T's work, which has been the last design that we showed this group was this design in 2016, which showed the Empire Fulton ferry lawn expanded a little bit an additional lawn, closer up to the water's edge and planting berms. That would help us both from a static perspective, as well as some significant design constraints that the space has and specifically those design constraints are that we need to ensure that New York City D-O-T has the ability for vehicular access to the bridge itself and to the abutment and to be able to drive in on to the site, buy a new dock streets and enter the plaza itself. But there also needs to be protection along water streets to provide security for the bridge apartment so that no vehicle driving down Water Street would make a right turn off of Water Street pick up significant speed and head straight towards the bridge abutment, that's a US homeland security requirement, and so originally in the 2016 design. Those large terms, those planting area berms, were designed to prevent vehicles from driving in, but to also ensure that DoD could get around. And after we had this design in 2016 working closely with the CAC, the community board, we engaged rat in 2018 for a community engagement and vision planning session that actually lasted the better part of nine months or so. Lots of stakeholder organizations participated. Lots of individual interviews and breakout sessions and the results of that community planning process gave us a bunch of significant feedback. The community felt fairly strongly through this process that there should be some passive use of the space, some landscape, and it should be a public plaza, which obviously has always been our intention that there should be intimate and restive spaces throughout it places to sit as well as places for just sort of quiet pass through. There was a recommendation that we should continue to use the historic Belgian block throughout the plaza, though I will note that start Belgian block is not a DA compliant and therefore we actually in the park controlled property. We don't use historic Belgian block because it's not a DA compliant and we absolutely do things that are. There was a request for connectivity to the rest of the park, obviously connecting the demo section through this other peers not listed here, but no I'm. Sorry, it is listed here. Excuse me that was requested that there is a significant honoring of the bridge to really identify to people that they were under the Brooklyn Bridge and that the history and the Stork nature of that and that we should honor Emily, Roebling and they're, not a design element of this. We have been having conversations not only with the parks Community Advisory Committee, but also with the folks at City Hall about naming the space or Emily roving that problem. That was something that we are very supportive of and we feel like. It is not only the right thing to do, but will actually significantly have significant meeting not just to the park but to the community at large. What's not included in this and has been long talked about for years, is that in the wintertime we have long talked about this space being used as a seasonal ice skating, rink, temporary installation and not a brick and mortar rink, like they have in Prospect Park, for example. But more of a of a seasonal installation that comes in every year then leaves like the way Brian Park does it and we still feel very strongly. That is good use for this space. However, being that this space has not yet been built out and we have not yet operated the park with this space completed, we felt before we went down the road of any new significant programming, either in the winter or in the summer. We should build out the space, see how it operates first and then pick up that question again, both in terms of ice skating, which again, we think is right as well as any additional season singer gramming. We want to see how the space operates first before we do that, and therefore this design is typically silent on it, though it does still allow for the way it's been designed would allow for this AC lens. If you wanna go to the next wide, and so this is the design itself. The new design that has been significantly updated, based on the feedback that we've gotten through that planning process, both again with tilted by Pratt but with the CAC and it's gonna, be board representatives and I'm gonna turn it over to Lindsay and she's. Gonna walk you through this Pacific each other. Thank you, Eric mention this is our updated 2020 design and we've incorporated a lot of good feedback. We heard from the community planning process we've created more opportunities for intimate and restive moments. There's more seating along the water, the smaller lawn that faces the bridge is surrounded planting, framing the views and the of the bridge in the Manhattan skyline, and we've created some more robust planting, a long Water Street, while still meeting those D-O-T requirements to have protection along Water Street of the abutment, and the new design opens up more desire lines for pedestrians to walk through the space. This new path that cuts through the lawn and there's more porosity here at the Water Street curb line for people to move really through the space. I. Think everyone knows this area. Dumbo can get at what a pinch point. It is on Water Street at the sidewalk round that the plaza is completely closed, so we're really envisioning. This spaces are released out and finally, we've worked really closely with our architects, Michael Van, Valkenburg and Associates in response to the request for more Belgian block model. So, as Eric mentioned, it is not a d8 accessible. So we've worked with MBTA to identify a new paper that is special and unique, but will be fully APA accessible and allow people everyone to experience the entire space and walk along the water's edge here and the paper that we selected is really inspired by the bridge itself. This is an overhead shot of the underside of the bridge that shows kind of the intricate cabling that supports the deck of the bridge, as our intent is to use this new concrete paver to mirror that image on the ground. As you walk through this space, and here are some design, precedents and inspiration. So our antennas, so some really striking and dramatic, geometric paving that will be the ground covering as you as you walk through the plaza and the effect will be very striking, where the we'll be able to kind of replicate this. The engineering of the bridge with the three pigments of concrete pavers that create kind of a weave pattern on the ground here, and this is a rough rendering that gives you a feeling, as you walk off Water Street and into the plaza and again you're really confronted with the bridge itself. And it's engineering through this unique, paving pattern. These next couple slides just go through some design details, so these are typical Park standards. These are wooden benches that will be used as well as salvaged granite along the water's edge for seating. It's important to note that we were able we were able to salvage some of the granite became off the department during the 2018 repairs that Eric mentioned at the beginning of the presentation and they'll be used throughout the space. Proceeding the purchase building filled procurement office that once occupied the positive space that was demoed in 2008, had an old lintel that said, purchase building, New, York, City and we'd actually salvaged that and held on to it over the years and we're going to reinstate it here on Water Street like it once was lighting for the plaza again we're going to be using park standards we're pulling some of our larger light. Poles we're pulling these kind of taller light poles in order to minimize the amount of light bulbs required and maintain as much open space as possible, and the strategy here is really to anchor those lights along the planting, so we're not congesting the open space and then, finally, we are installing vehicular rated bollards as part of this project, and this is really in response to the 2017 attack at Hudson River Park at their Greenway there and it's part of a larger citywide initiative to protect public spaces, and this is Brooklyn Bridge park's response to that initiative. So we intend to run vehicular rated bollards from st. Ann's warehouse all the way along the curve line to the Pier one entrance at old, Alton and permit Street here, and these bollards aesthetically are going to mirror what do T already installed along the bridge abutment. So there will be continuity there and these class two images are just renderings of the site. So this is again on Water Street, looking out onto the water, the smokestack building, and this rendering really gives you kind of a feeling of how robust that alone, Water Street- and this last slide is a bird's-eye view. This was rendered from an image taken at the top of a told faltered. Looking down. I, don't hand it back over to Eric to talk your timeline of better construction thanks Lindsay. So the timeline is that we are currently on schedule to have this project completed by the end of December 2021, and so we are hoping to go to LPC next month. They've got a meeting scheduled for May 19th, we're hoping to be on that agenda. If not that agenda, then, two weeks later, they have a meeting in early June who would be on that agenda. If not the mid-may agenda after LPC, you know we continue to work with our partners and government, there's some interagency stuff that we are still doing in tandem. But the plan would be this summer to really go through the procurement process and get a contractor on board with a goal of breaking ground on the project in the late coming fall. So late fall of 2020 it's about a year long project and that's how we would hit completion dates, that's targeted for December of 21, so it's an aggressive schedule, but the construction itself should only take a year or so, and we're certainly ready to go with all of the required funds. That's I think that's it, but we're happy to take any questions that you have and again. Thank you for the opportunity to present before the executive committee. Thank you for the presentation, Carlton or Irene. Do you have any questions causes me to come? Walking you mr. Singletary I, wanted to. Let you know that this dinner is on the call by phone, but okay, not unmute at her end and all the people that have called in they are merely a hall end-users number one: food, hauler and user number 12 I can't tell which one is: okay, I just see calls and cable or car. To my back on you away from the come off me it again: okay, great cause, there's some comments. Yes, I can now? Okay, oh I, see if I hit this all right there you go home right, just I've heard from Karen Johnson who lives in the area. She's part of the dumbo committee aren't as well dumbu group and she's. Also the Secretary of the Landmarks Land Use Committee, which is our committee I chatted with her, and she felt very positive about it. I did see on the emails that, during gala from the Dumbo group did send something to rob about the you know what they felt about. The construction personally I feel very favorable Bob about it and if you're ready I will then make a motion to approve. Thank you, okay, call its and hold all that thought. You need just go back to the district manager because we all gonna take a roll call vote. The lab, were you ready, look two things. Mr. secretary, as Carlton mentioned, I did receive an email from Doreen gallo based on the letterhead. It seems like, on behalf of the design and concessions committee or the Community Advisory Council, as mr. Landau mentioned, I was at the last presentation by Van Valkenburg associates, and the presentation was very well received with a lot of gratitude, but how much work the landscape architect here to address earlier concern so I'm not quite sure what to do with a nine-point letter that I received at 5:39 and the last time I was with the same group of people. Everything seemed to be well received. Okay, we'll take that letter offline, all right, I, don't know that has an immediate bearing on the vote, but we definitely will take that offline because it might be difficult to share with everyone. But thank you for pointing that out. Thank You Carlton for pointing that as well. But this is fully here. We don't need to do a roll call vote. The voice will suffice. Are we going to have any questions we so hold on Robert us we're trying to get your Nana's hold on? Actually, why about I would prefer to do the roll call vote, because it's easier to track who's voting, given that we're going through technology, happy -, yeah cuz, it's hard to track my voice who's suing, as some people are I mean some people offer you, so it just makes life easier for me. Let me again repeat that the entire meeting is being recorded, not that anybody had said anything that, hopefully they wouldn't say again, but just wanted to periodic people mind everyone that the entire meeting is being recorded. I don't want anyone to lose sight of that. So with that, I will entertain a motion to accept the presentation that was given this just now by Eric Landau and the organization's representing the changes to the full temporary historic district I'll move to approve the application, great Thank, You, Carlton and I get a second I. Second, mr. Singletary, thank you Miss Joyce, a second. You say that is there any discussion on the motion: hey mr. secretary I, had a couple of questions find that, because of the hiatus or the you know, in construction, the December 21st date was that is that realistic? Or could they go after that? And the second question was with any public restrooms in the area or plan for the area. Thank you. If you don't, if you don't mind, I'll take the second part. First, there are public bathrooms in Empire stores, which is very close by and then the next closest public bathroom going in the other direction is there's a public bathroom in pure house building at Pier one every summer, except for this current summer that we're about to hit we've had nicer or two trailers in the pr1 turn around immediately adjacent to the hotel. That would be in between the pier one bathroom at Pier house and the Empire stores this summer. We have not yet activated that, because it's yet clear what the summer will hold from the park under the current pandemic, but bathrooms that sort of the pure one turn around or something that we certainly talked about. Long term, but right now the two year-round closest bathrooms or empire stores, and if your house you're your first question about construction and the schedule, you know, look I would say a couple of things number one. The expectation is that we would break ground in the late fall. This coming fall, that's several months away, and obviously we are hoping that there is some return to normalcy by then. But, additionally, you know, construction in the park is actually continuing on current projects, including the uplands of pier 2, we're actually, in the final days of finishing out the new Squibb bridge that preventative maintenance work is continuing, and all of this is under the express direction of both mayor's office and the governor's office that you know the government Empire State Development under the covers office, which is overseeing all those executive orders that have faulted corruption, I've indicated that parks are essential and that ongoing construction within parks can continue under that guidance. So, at this time, based on both the fact that constructions expect as essential, we feel we feel fairly confident. Okay, thank you very much. Tom. What's the question we can hear you now and as I had I hate tend to vote, but I need you to get closer to the microphone. Oh sorry, yeah you go. Thank you and clearly. This presentation tonight reflects a continued, very high standard of excellence in this proposal. I think it's beautiful. You did raise the issue that I was concerned about, and that is the possibility and that's what I've been hoping to see under the bridge. My concern is by waiting. I would like to know that you have looked into what you hired to put an ice-skating rink here, so that you don't once you all the money and effort in here say Oh to put in an ice skating. Rink we'd have to rip up this beautiful new round. So that's my only concern and thank you for that. It's first of all, thank you for your comments about not only the design but your current experience in the park, but for your question, and so the short answer is yes, we absolutely have we've been. You know for several years, as we've been going through. This is this design. Ice skating has been a significant component to it for the winter activity, because what enriched Park is really missing in many respects is winter recreation and activation and ice skating. Rink is certainly a way to do that. As I said, it was never our intention to build a brick and mortar rink rather to engage with an ice skating, rink operator who would bring in and set up and installation like what they do in Bryant Park and then take it away at the end of the season. In order to do that, we've done a lot of analysis meeting with ice rink operators around the city and touring ice rinks around the city, including a Bryant Park, to determine what size space you need available to have different sizes of rings. What's back-of-house space you need to have available both for state change, locations and ice melt machines and ice chillers, and what part of this design includes that you can't see is that in order to do an ice skating, rink there's a significant amount of electrical power that is required. Otherwise, you'd have to have large external generators. You don't want large external generators, so this project actually includes the necessary electrical capabilities underground. That would allow us to operate a seasonal ice skating, rink installation. So the short answer to your question is absolutely thank. You I also have questions on this issue. Julie:Thanks, on a programmatic basis on the picnic tables by Jane's carousel are usually very crowded in the summertime, with families usually sort of camping out there to reserve it for birthday, parties, informal or actually formal, with the Jane's carousel. Given that you've added seating, there isn't a lot of seating for eating, though hopefully the concessions will come back or there will be new concessions if those don't last- and hopefully the timeout market opens again, but it would be nice if they were picnic tables for extra picnic tables in that location. Yeah. You want answer that one first or do you want to ask the UM go ahead, so what I would say is yes, the picnic tables that we have certainly are heavily used there having new picnic tables that have been added outside of West Elm on the on the park side, there are picnic tables that have been added a long time out, market on old doc streets and one of the things that I think that we would look at after this. Space is built out and we've operated a little bit as sort of a programmatic element is: are there additional pieces of furniture tables and chairs that we could add in this location that could accommodate exactly what you're talking about, but I think before? We would immediately commit to that. We would want to see how this piece is utilized, how people, through it's just that it becomes and so forth, but certainly, as you see throughout other areas of the park, will we've three the uplands of pr3, where we added picnic tables in the back corner, adding furniture or something that we could. Certainly relative, hey. Thank you. My other comment is a design comment and I may be the lone voice here. I think you've developed a very respectful design and it's an acknowledgement of the history of Dumbo I think it is conservative I think that there are. There are much there's, also the artistic side of Dumbo. That's a little bit less conservative frankly and I hope that we, you would consider the opportunities to incorporate our public art in the future. Maybe even rethink your lighting program to be a little bit just a little bit more edgy. You know not as traditional as the rest of the part, because it is a plaza, and so it is an opportunity to be a little bit more expressive than other parts of the park. I'm glad to hear that you're adding electrical conduits under the paver, so you don't have to rip them up in the future, but you know, maybe even some extra conduits for potential lighting program in the future, that maybe art installation or a permanent installation. Thank you for that yeah. You know we feel very strongly about public art in the park and there being a transition to the different types of art that we have in the park, not just what types of art but where it goes last year. Obviously, we had syoma Johnny's bridge over tree on the Empire, Fulton ferry law and immediately adjacent to this area. Just this past winter we had Anthony Gormley's, New, York, City clearing and obviously, we've had lots of art in the past. So certainly this could be a location that could continue that trend, but we take sort of art as a place by case basis of what we put and where we put it, based on a variety of factors, but continuing our public art program is certainly something that we feel very strongly about. Doing. Okay, I have a concern: I love to design everything at the planning. Everything has gone into it. My concern is the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. Occasionally they do Irishman of the bridge and sometimes debris, maybe falling from the bridge onto the plaza. What have you done to address? Dishware dis concern is curious. Thank you. So we actually have an MoU with New York City do T that anytime. They need to come into the space and access it for any type of construction work. They actually have to coordinate it with us and so that we could make whatever Arrangements we needed to make to practice space below the most recent example of this is actually not with do T, but with MTA and that prior to us putting up the scaffolding over the section of the park underneath the Manhattan Bridge that when the MTA would come in and do work over, we work on the Manhattan Bridge over that section of parkland. They would notify us in advance and we would actually working with them close that section of parkland for the period of time that they were doing work because they told us that debris falling was a possibility, while they were do it. So again we have an MoU with New York City do T that if they need to come in and do something they need to coordinated with us, we proper a doctor. Thank you. Are there any additional board members or any additional questions on board members aye hearing none Rob. Are you ready to do the roll call vote? I am ready and we will start with you. Mr. singleton. Yes, mr. Jordan, yes, this hologram, yes, mr. sir, yes, miss cohen-chang, yes, mr. Gordon, yes, mr. Flournoy, yes and mr. Brandon Smith, yes, the motion carries unanimously 8 0. Thank you. Everyone preaching your support. Mr. Landau have a great evening. Thank you to you and your colleague for the presentation. Thank you very much. We hope everyone stay safe during this same to you. Thank you. Thank you. Alright Carlton. You have one other item right from the agenda. I'll summarize it then I have agenda friendly, but it's watch well the hold on hold on in fairness, everyone, let me read it so we have two supervisors hold on. So the second item under landmarks and preservation, certificate of appropriateness application is for one two Clinton Avenue Clinton Hill historic district application is to replace all windows and in all facades, with new aluminum's, clad historic profile windows that replicate original Korean mutants, install new slate roof tiles and construct a new all with three-story Riyadh extension 19, Carlton. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, I guess: you'll begin your presentation, I guess. The areas that I'm most concerned about is the extension in the backyard and one of the things you can bring up in your presentation is: how far will it go into what we call the donut and also have you notified the neighbors on either side as to the work you're going to be doing in the backyard in the backyard extension so Rob, do we have a representative for this application? We do mr. Singletary Todd Philippi. He is. The architect is online as his Paul Burke aster Paul Burke, who is the executive director of Teen Challenge, which has owned this building for many years and is now expanding. Okay, great gentlemen. The floor is realist. I'll, let you decide who's going to speak first. Well. First of all, my name is pastor Paul Burke, executive director of Brooklyn Teen Challenge I, just want to thank you, Executive Committee, for meeting with us, especially during the trying times that were in right now. So I do appreciate your time and your effort to make this happen for the project for 412 Clinton Avenue. Just a little bit of history, Teen Challenge has been located after 12 Clinton Avenue. Now, since 1958, we are a residential program that helps young men and adults that struggle with addiction and life controlling issues in much need of a renovation. For many years it started in 1958 by David Wilkes, and we had not had a major renovation since them. We are looking to improve the house, but all in accordance to landmark and the aesthetics of the of the community that the building is in. We did own some property up the street for four for Vanderbilt, which was recently sold. We sold the property to be able to do a renovation on this house because for 12 Clinton is not only in a historic district, but the building has quite a bit of history too, because this is the landmark program, the flagship program which has now been established in over 120 countries around the world. We have over 240 centers, just in the United States, and this is the house. This is the building where the program started out. We have approximately a seventy five to eighty six percent success rate in helping men and women, teenagers and adults find recovery from drugs and alcohol, I myself actually am a product of the program itself and now I'm the executive director, like I, touched back on a few minutes ago. We had sold building up the street to be able to be able to fund this expansion, and one of the reasons why we're doing the expansion I we have to make the building a little bit larger is because we lost some square footage by selling the property of the street. But in order to keep this building on hoppin and to make sure work well point to fit in time and was going to look attractive, we had to do a major renovation well in selling those buildings had to make up some square space which, with we are doing I, have todd philip. I with me he is going to go through some slides and show you that the renovation itself, the expansion itself in the back. It is not really able to be seen not at all from the front and not really from the rear, unless you're actually on the property and the drawings were drawn up with all that nine, so that it would not be an eyesore in the community. One of the things to be noted with what's going on in our community right now, is we've been able to give away a hundred and twenty eight thousand pounds of food from this from this program. This trying time for our city, especially we've, been a light in this community, and we want to continue to be able to do that for many more years. I'll be the only way that we would be able to do it on this property or in this community is by doing a renovation and, of course, a small expansion. How did you can in move out a little bit the next slide Todd? Can you show where the where you can see it from the front the view from the front? Well, that's the front of the building. That's not going to change! It's just going to be all updated with the same style windows and in construction. If you could just look at the back real quick, because I just want to answer the response to that question earlier now, this is from the back from the rear. If you look straight from Vanderbilt side, you will not be able to see the expansion from the street. Now, if you go into the alleyway, which would be on our property, of course, then you'd be able to see the back of the building. So we really feel confident that it's not going to be an eyesore from either view facade I've just listed, so your back is really looks like it. You know it doesn't affect any of your neighbors directly. It's not going to constructions not going to interfere with your neighbors. That's right! Yeah! This is time, philippi the architect at all, I'll kind of walk you through the details of the proposal once Paul wraps up, so the building was drawn up with all the things in mind and, like I said, we've been in this community since 1958 we're a historic building. We have people come from all over the actual world to visit this spot because, like I said, there's over 1,400 centers around the world in 120 countries where this program is helping people that are struggling with addiction, and it started right here on this house. So that's why it's very important to us that we update it and we make it something that we can be proud of in this community and something that could be updated and for people that come in for recovery. We want them to come to a nice place. We want them to feel like they're, getting an upgrade in life. If you know what I mean something that they could feel nice and feel comfortable and be able to be able to have the things that we need to facilitate the program commercial kitchen, you know room for recreation and in TV, and also for classrooms and meeting rooms and counseling rooms and, of course, sleeping quarters. So we believe that the expansion is very modest, it's basically the least that we could have done to be able to continue to run the program. The way that we feel that we need to Todd if you could want to take over yeah okay. So if you notice front of this tax photo, the property is right at the it's right at the edge of the Clinton Hill historic district, the building that is to the left. There is not in the historic district. That's the line right that this property stops and you can see the style of Windows that they had was nine over one throughout the building, where there were nine muttons in the top window and there of the double hung windows and no muttons in the bottom. So our plan is to replace the windows with historically appropriate mutten windows. That would have the nine over zero pattern, so we would be restoring the front of the building and then giving you an aerial view of the existing site plan we're looking down right now. There is a little over 82 feet between the back of the existing manor house building and the carriage house garage. The proposed addition would extend that by about 20 feet now I'm going to take you where we're standing in back of the property, and we are looking to the south at the six-story apartment building that is next to it. You see the big blank brick wall in the upper left photo. Yes, there that basketball court, the basketball hoop is about as far out as the addition that we're proposing would come from the existing back of building so to the south, where it's not. The historic district is the six-story apartment building and then in the next frame, we're looking at a little light way, that is, between the two buildings, the one on the right grunting on Vanderbilt, and then you start to see the carriage house garage on the right side there and there's a big oak tree. Then we're planning to preserve right at the entrance into the driveway slide through picture three in the bottom left corner is standing at the back of the house and looking to the carriage house and then along. The right is a solid fence with a property that fronts on Vanderbilt and then looking over to the right. There's a open community space for the house, that is to the north and that's multiple apartments that are in that house as well. So that's their shared outdoor space. So this is the existing back of the house, that is, who is brick, fire escape window, air conditioning units windows in need of replacement and what you'll see in our proposal is that we're? We would be recreating that facade with the proposal without the fire escape without the air conditioners in the window. We would be really replicating and upgrading the existing construction with that proposed extension again, which comes out to about where that basketball hoop is. This is the property immediately to the north and it has a one-story rear addition to it. That extends out about the length that we would be pushing out the addition from the existing back of house and again that's a multiple apartments in that house and that's just some shared outdoor space there for the residents. So if we look on the top at the existing site plan, you can see where the building comes out to now, there's an exterior stair to the basement, and then there is a an entranceway with a little portico over it and then in the slide immediately below you see the shaded area, and that would be our 20 foot extension behind the house and we would be wrapping that around the corner and providing handicapped ramps so that we can. We want to make the building totally accessible right now it is not accessible. Anybody in a wheelchair, with ambulatory problems, really can't be part of the program in the house by the time. We're done it would be a hundred percent accessible, including an elevator that would connect the basement first. Second and third floors of the building and I understand. You also gain some roof work and put again new tiling in that area. Yes, that's right. What we're proposing is a composite material that looks like slate looks like the original slate. It has a lifetime warranty and it is a lot lighter than slate and it's easier to make the roof water tighten so we're proposing to both re-roof the existing, where we have damaged slate and to extend that same material onto the addition that would be constructed in the back of the building. So I'll take you through the floor plans now of the existing, which is on the left side and the proposed on the right side. On the left side, we have the current cellar plan, which has a lounge a small exercise room. All the showers are down there. The laundry is down there on the first floor, which is the bottom left existing right now is an office area, a memorial library area there meeting dining kitchen. Everything is very tight and compact in there the proposed plans to the right. We have the elevator that would be going added on the bottom side. That would be going down to the cellar level and there would be a large pantry down there. The recreation room which the current lounge would be expanded, we'd have a larger exercise room and then we would move some office space down there as well. We would also be providing a new, interconnected, stair, that's in the bottom left corner here. That would be a fire escape stair that goes to all the levels of the building and adding an additional fire escape stair from the bottom level as well. On the main level, we would have an open, dining Chapel area and that's both where the residents would eat and would come together for meetings and then we would have a commercial kitchen and on the very bottom you can see where the ramp is. That would be coming up from the back to provide handicapped access to the building, and we've also shown the ramp extending out to the front of the building. It's not necessary in order to have access, and we received a little bit of pushback on that from land Marx. They said they're, typically not in favor of changing the appearance of the front of buildings with a handicap ramp, even though our proposal was to use wrought iron for the railing. That would look similar to the existing wrought iron on the front portico. So that's something that we don't have to have in order to have access, and we would certainly be interested in what your opinion is regarding that ramp to the front. Well, yeah, we've always favored handy in a lot access footing disabled, but you will have to work that out with landmarks. It's a very difficult point I'd like to work. Essentially it looks like he's keeping. You know, there's a lot of work, that's being done, but you're keeping the essence of the building going, and this is something that I think that my I would say. My committee would most likely approve very good so on the second and third floors. What we've basically done is: we've just improved and upgraded the sleeping and bathing facilities we're providing on each level showers bathrooms that are accessible, handicapped, accessible along with a laundry room for each level, so that the residents don't have to go down to the basement. To take a shower to do their laundry can all be in the level where they're living sleeping quarters are, and then the and so on. The left is the existing and on the right is the proposed for the second and third floor now. The other thing that you'll see up here is we're proposing on the third floor, a roof deck that roof deck would be on top of the bathrooms and the commercial kitchen that would be added on the side of the building. The reason that we have kept that as a roof deck is in order to preserve the architectural profile of the back of the building which you'll see in just a moment. These are sections that are cut through the building. The top is going from Clinton Avenue on the right and then backwards to the addition on the left side, and you can see the shaded areas of floor and the dashed line shows what's proposed to be extended from the existing building, and that section that's marked a is the bottom left that goes through the building, and you can see here the roof terrace, that's at the level of the third floor, and then, if we look at the other section BB, that's where the elevator is that provides access to all four levels of the building and a lobby space behind it that enables it to be accessible for the entranceway. Now we have literally I'm going to pop up to the floor plans. Above just for a moment. We have literally designed this to this to the inch for it to be accessible. The bathrooms that we have fit me enough room behind that elevator for a five-foot turning radius for a wheelchair at the entranceway. So we really have designed the expansion on the side down to the inch that's needed to accommodate the accessibility requirements. Now, looking at the an overhead X on a metric view showing the existing property on the left side- and you can see the house that is to the north- it's part of the historic district and you can see their one-story addition with the deck that pops out the back there and then on the right side. You can see our proposed expansion of the existing building. That would come out from that red dashed line and you begin to see how we melded that roof deck into the architectural style of the existing building. The little fence that we show down here is where we're proposing to have a trashing closure, so that will be out of sight or the residence next door. We would also be putting a solid fence along the property line, extending it down from the existing one at Vanderbilt, so that the parking is screened from the adjacent outdoor space for the apartments to the north. If you look at the back elevation, the top view is how it exists right now, and the bottom view includes our proposal where there would be no back court, portico entrance or fire escape, and then you can see on the right side there, the proposed roof deck and wrought iron railings that would extend within the brickwork and in the bottom. You can see bottom right. You can see the handicap ramp that would be leading up to the entrance from the parking so projected views from the model of the existing house. This is what it looks like from the front on Clinton Avenue on the bottom. We have the same building with the addition in the back, which will be virtually unseen, I've outlined on the right side. Our proposed materials to restore the front, and the only thing that really would be different would be that the windows would be you and finish up. That will help us just say right now, yes, I'm not looking for that hold on. Let me finish and I'll come back to you for the normal protocol, so Todd, it's back to you in less. Let's get to the next week, two pages quickly: okay, thank you, mr. Singletary. So these are our views from the front on the top, the south and then the bottom is with the addition that is proposed, which really can't be seen and then on the right side. If you took out all the trees and the vegetative growth, that's already between the two properties, and you can look up, then this is what you'd see, but only the back twenty feet of that is an addition. Most of that is just part of the existing building, then from the back of the property. Again, these are the two views that were shown previously from Vanderbilt Avenue and if you look up the gate, the mechanical gate there and you can see the existing building on the top right slide and then the bottom right shows it with the back coming 20 feet out and with the rooftop deck being added. This is a 3d overhead view if there were no properties around it of what the expansion would look like when the construction would be complete and you can see we're looking at replicating the existing back of the building for most part, and then we have the roof deck, which again we kept that one lower in order to preserve the original outline of the rear architecture and yet, at the same time meet the needs of the Teen Challenge program that goes on, and you can see the handicap ramp coming up to the side entrance way and again we showed it going around to the front, but that's something that we do not have to have in order to provide accessibility and when it's all said and done. If there's enough money left over, we want to also restore that carriage house to its original condition as well on the exterior and with that I'm finish, the presentation. Thank you for the presentation and to pastor Paul Berg. Thank you just in general for the work that you're doing and the work that is being done. Being team challenging and all the programs that you have for the community, so thank you for being a part. It's a blessing I just sir! Thank you. Thank you!

Actually mr. chairman of the applicant has asked to be laid over the applicant wish is granted. Thank you so now we're up to chair persons report. So let me let me start with a couple of thank yous, so I want to thank the board office and thank you at the beginning. I want to thank you again as part of our report and in particular to the to everyone. I mean it's not easy to be confined to your respective locations, to not have the movement that you once had I'm sure this must be particularly challenging to our new colleagues. You figure on watch 11th watch 11th. We introduced you. We were excited that you were part of the team and I know. I haven't seen you since that I'm seeing you tonight tiny food technology- that's here, but to be able to continue to work as hard as you have I'm Rob I want to thank you in particular not to single you out versus the team, but I know you've been making that conscious effort to go into the office. You've been you know, leading the team, and so with that I want to give a special. Thank you to you as well, and you know just the entire team. Carolyn has always been someone who pays attention to detail and she's done that remotely and in the office. So thank you all for the work that you've done to keep the office flowing. We keep the work of the community at the forefront and for the great lengths to which you undertook to give us to this meeting tonight. I'm sure all of us have seen the original invitation, the cancellations, some of you may have seen multiple emails confirming the meeting and not so. There were some technical challenges, some difficulties, but all of that we're here tonight conducting the business of the community. So for that, I want to say thank you. I'm making history is not easy. People can evaluate history, but, as you make history, it's not easy and we're doing that tonight. Second thing I want a second group I want to. Thank is all the members all the members of community board, both the executive committee and the general body, because you two have consistent and consistent and sending me emails. It's an office email making sure that we are aware of things that are happening within the community and in addition, making sure that those of us are those of you, I should say who are chairs of mitties I'm, making sure that you're thinking and pushing the envelope for how we can keep committees engage an update on things that are happening within the district. So I want to. Thank you all as well, and then I want to thank all of the members of community board too, who have sent me well wishes. Some of you, I've spoken to the nail on the phone, others haven't had a chance to get back to, but I have read all of the emails I want to. Thank you, or you know those who are aware that I work in the hospital and appreciate the wishes that were sent to me while I'm, not a frontline employee per se, I was going to work seven days a week and so now I'm working five days a week, decided to take April off so to speak. I can't thank you enough for the well wishes and it means a lot. You know, and you know I'll never forget that the next thing I want to mention is meetings going forward. I know that several committee chairs have asked and inquired how do we just kind of touch base or keep the committee's aware of what's taking place? So let me let me list a couple of facts back one is the community board robbed the entire office Lenny is chair. Lenny is vice-chair Barbara's. Second vice-chair Jessica. As secretary, we do not have a say in the technology the saying that technology is dictated by the city and the city said you can only use WebEx under these strict guidelines, so that adds another level of complexity for those who may be using other applications like zoom or other products that are out there, as some of you may have made out of heard. There are some key concerns with the zoom, so I would presume that this is a factor in to why the city has mandated that we use Cisco WebEx meetings under time protocol, which we are adherent to. Having said all that, you remember, in the last time we met in my eleventh, we entertain a motion. It was approved unanimously that the Executive Committee will act on behalf of the general body, while I understand that things are unprecedented times. If we were in the month of July August, where we would be taking a recess, we wouldn't be engaging with committee just to keep them up to speed to keep them up to date. So, while I haven't made a final determination yet because I know even tonight, some members were having challenges getting into the meetings. Some of the individuals who confirmed to get into the meeting have sent me notice the saying they couldn't get any had challenges. I want to get to a point where we can work through these challenges and get to a point where there's more ease and consistency with using the technology before I give a definitive answer on yes or no about future meetings. All I would ask is that we be a little patient. Let's work through some of these issues and see how we can get to a point where we adhere to the guidelines of the city and continue to address the concerns. Some of you have raised about being in communication with your respective committees and then my final comment is that, on the heels of what I just mentioned, we do have budget items that have to be addressed. It cannot go without being addressed, in which case there may be an invitation for some of you who are members of the Finance and Personnel Committee, because we have to address the personnel and finance issues of community board children, and some of that we may try this again using this technology with finance and Personnel Committee, and if we have better outcome, a better luck on the next meeting that may show us a favorable way of moving into expanding into other committees, but at this time I'm gonna hold off on giving a definitive answer. First, let me pause. I've said a couple of thank yous I've spoken about meetings going forward mentioned about finance and personnel. Let me pause and see if there's any questions that any members may have in my comments, you're breaking up. So what membership is still following this the same process is always has we need to circle back with some directions from Borough Hall. This is another example of where you know the pandemic has restricted the normal form of communications and Robin. Bob has kept up date with those members as they have been accepted and need to be placed, as has our representative from Borough Hall named blacks here, so, while I haven't had a chance to communicate with Rob and then on this topic, I will do so and get back to the executive committee on what the next steps are there any other questions. Okay, hearing, none I'll come I'll transition, shot number nine district managers report, mr. Paris mr. Singletary I had hoped to be able to say that I had you know that out earlier today, however, that didn't come to pass. I do want to thank the staff for all of their work, which is made much more difficult when we can't just walk around the office and say so directly to each other's faces. We have also faced really unprecedented challenges with procurement and with technology, and the support from the city has been a struggle. I won't put it more harshly than that, but it's been tough tonight and I respectful of everything that they are trying to do all over the city. At the same time, that said my highest priorities are getting the staff fully set up to be able to work. The current situation is probably going to extend for several weeks and so I do not have a written report but hope to have one out as Rob. Can you hit me? This is cross okay, since I have you here at the corner of Flatbush Avenue and DeKalb Avenue right by the Applebee's there's a growing homeless population. That coin, because apparently Applebee's has closed and decided not to, even though the rest of the stores and that block along Flatbush are operating, I was hoping. Perhaps if you can't act, the I guess whatever homeless, against mayor's office and to let them know- and maybe they can go out there and see what help they can provide, because every time you walk past there at DeKalb in Flatbush, there are more and more people at that and more and more stuff. At that location. I appreciate your bringing that to my attention and I will notify the city. Okay, thanks any other questions from board members. Okay, great I, don't know pretend other business. Do we have any other business, so Jessica cause 807 I am asking for a motion to adjourn so listen. Thank you. Everyone please be safe practice, social, distancing and I can't. Thank you enough for all of your support, your professionalism. We are family. We will get through this. We will see each other in person soon. Thank you and be safe, amen, hey Rob! You could send my sandwich to my house.
