Five on the agenda: : Construction fence artwork pushed I'm street seats activation at Temple, Square.
Mr. Singletary, the an earlier version of the presentation, was emailed to the Transportation Committee when we did not know that we are going to be meeting of by teleconference tonight, right, but I believe that Emily and their designer to design proposal.
There are several people on the agenda for the presentation today, because this is really a collective proposal between alloy development, the OT, the downtown Brooklyn partnership and in collaboration with Tyler Ken. Think most of you know where temple square is, but for those who don't it is a small public space to eat.
So I mean Ameri a program manager for the deity's temporary art program and through the program we partner with community-based organizations and artists to realize temporary artwork on our property, which includes sidewalks, plazas, median bridges, etc.
Is through the Department of Cultural Affairs, and it's a program done in partnership with art, bridge called City canvass, and it is essentially taking scaffolding and other typical D-O-T construction, fencing.
So, our proposal, in addition to applying or approval through the Department of Transportation, both the street seats and the art program, is also an application.
That was going to be almost you know a full city block length along Flatbush Avenue and then also the Temple Square open, plaza on Lafayette, and we really wanted to find a language that worked for both of these things and actually connected them as kind of one larger piece, while still maintaining that kind of lightness and playfulness and accessibility, sort of creating a big piece of public art that can be enjoyed by everyone.
The approach to designing the streets ed was really to work within the confines of typical New York scaffolding and just kind of elevated, nothing too, fancy, but adding just a very limited palette of colors, which would kind of create a large-scale art installation that could be appreciated from different speeds of experience, because you have a lot of traffic along Flatbush and a lot of pedestrian traffic as well.
Really, you treat the street almost like a backdrop and connected with the plaza in order to create a real sense of space, because, as David mentioned right, now, the plaza itself is quite small and doesn't really lend itself to any impromptu activity that one usually finds in a public.
The idea to kind of knit the background of the street shed with the with a with a design that kind of turns down onto the plaza paving, creates a real sense of space, even though the plaza is still completely open and then just going forward.
Just by seeing those kind of typical public tables and chairs, people will know that it's okay to sit there , it's okay to kind of enjoy this space, and hopefully that starts to develop kind of a user.
This slide that you see on your screen was the timeline before the coded crisis really began, and that timeline was for us to officially apply for the street seats application process present to you, the community board and then really start implementation, this spring, so that it could be open for the nice weather.
The other one maintenance, wise I, was wondering how long the plaza is expected to last how many years and if there's any idea of refreshing the paint at any point, if need be during that during that period, Currently so I'm wondering if there's a street tree being eliminated from the plaza and then overall I think it's great that you guys are bringing this vibrancy and the color to the neighborhood.
Ryan is probably going to be most helpful as it relates to this tree furniture, but the street furniture will be purchased by Ali. It will be standard, D-O-T, bistro, chairs and tables that you see at other public spaces in downtown Brooklyn.
That's why I said anybody so gay bar, where you can ask the question there: Eda I, think this project is lovely and when you got up close the colors much more inviting if the underlying do that, there has been outreach to us saying gave this proposal to the Community Advisory Group.
Some people would say they love everything next meeting, so they will come back and say they don't like you and Because I hate to see that ugly green spread through that interest, such a big piece of you, know, I, saw a wall green and by time they finished sticking up all these different posters.
Well, the community as a whole, but we respect your position and thank her for her work on the Advisory Committee.
Application is to construct a public plaza beneath the Brooklyn Bridge and beyond, using a play, otech, precast, paver and asked for asphalt and to enlarge the existing Empire stores.
I actually want to thank the community board or helping get some of our messaging out over the last six seven weeks.
Having said that, the Brooklyn Bridge Plaza project is being presented to the executive committee tonight, it's actually being put into the community board.
Now really for the first time in this design, we were scheduled and present before the Land Use Committee on March 18th, but obviously because of a that meeting did not happen, and we are very appreciative today, board for hosting us evening.
I will note that this project has been presented to the parks, community, Advisory Committee, on multiple occasions, its design committee and its full committee, of which it was very well received and Rob Harris actually joined us for that last meeting.
But the plaza project was actually the first section of Brooklyn Bridge Park to be constructed.
After going through community board and LPC review, we removed the purchase building to not only build out this section apart, but to really open up the view plane to both bridges and to the Manhattan skyline and right after we took down the first building in 2008, we were ready to go with construction as the first part of the park to be built, at which point New, York City D-O-T received significant resources through the federal economic stimulus package to do repair work on the bridge itself.
That would help us both from a static perspective, as well as some significant design constraints that the space has and specifically those design constraints are that we need to ensure that New York City D-O-T has the ability for vehicular access to the bridge itself and to the abutment and to be able to drive in on to the site, buy a new dock streets and enter the plaza itself.
We have been having conversations not only with the parks Community Advisory Committee, but also with the folks at City Hall about naming the space or Emily roving.
It is not only the right thing to do, but will actually significantly have significant meeting not just to the park but to the community at large.
What's not included in this and has been long talked about for years, is that in the wintertime we have long talked about this space being used as a seasonal ice, skating, rink, temporary installation and not a brick and mortar rink, like they have in Prospect Park, for example.
We should build out the space, see how it operates first and then pick up that question again, both in terms of ice skating, which again, we think is right, as well as any additional season singer.
There's more seating along the water, the smaller lawn that faces the bridge is surrounded, planting, framing the views and the of the bridge in the Manhattan skyline, and we've created some more robust planting, a long Water Street, while still meeting those D-O-T requirements to have protection along Water Street of the abutment, and the new design opens up more desire lines for pedestrians to walk through the space.
So we've worked with MBTA to identify a new paper that is special and unique, but will be fully APA accessible and allow people everyone to experience the entire space and walk along the water's edge here and The paper.
So late fall of 2020 it's About a year long project Thank you for the opportunity to present before the executive, committee.
It seems like, on behalf of the design and concessions committee or the Community Advisory Council, as mr.
Landau mentioned, I was at the last presentation by Van Valkenburg associates, and the presentation was very well received with a lot of gratitude, but how much work the landscape architect here to address earlier concern So I'm, not quite sure what to do with a nine-point letter that I received at 5:39 and the last time I was with the same group of people.
So with that, I will entertain a motion to accept the presentation that was given this just now by Eric Landau and the organization's representing the changes to the full temporary historic district I'll move to approve the application, great Thank, You, Carlton and I Get, a second I.
My name is pastor Paul Burke, executive director of Brooklyn Teen Challenge I, just want to thank you, Executive Committee, for meeting with us, especially during the trying times that were in right, now.
In order to keep this building on hoppin and to make sure work well point to fit in time and was going to look attractive, we had to do a major renovation well in selling those buildings had to make up some square space.
This is time, philippi, the architect at all, I'll kind of walk you through the details of the proposal once Paul wraps up, so the building was drawn up with all the things in mind: And, Like, I, said, we've been in this community since 1958 Have people come from all over the actual world to visit this spot because, like I said, there's over 1,400 centers around the world in 120 countries where this program is helping people that are struggling with addiction, and it started right here on this house.
You know, there's a lot of work, that's being done, but you're keeping the essence of the building going, and this is something that I think that my I would say.
