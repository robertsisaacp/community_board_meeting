Yes, Spokesperson, Mr. Singletary, the an earlier version of the presentation, was emailed to the Transportation Committee when we did not know that we are going to be meeting of by teleconference tonight, right, but I believe that Emily and their designer to design proposal.
There are several people on the agenda for the presentation today, because this is really a collective proposal between alloy development, the OT, the downtown Brooklyn partnership and in collaboration with Tyler Ken. Think most of you know where Temple Square is, but for those who do not, it is a small public space to eat.
So I mean Ameri a program manager for the deity's temporary art program and through the program we partner with community- based organizations and artists to realize temporary artwork on our property, which includes sidewalks, plazas, median bridges, etc.
That's it for me for now great the other city program that is instrumental in making this proposal happen, Is through the Department of Cultural Affairs, and it's a program done in partnership with art, Bridge called City canvass It is essentially taking scaffolding and other typical D- O- T construction, fencing.
So, our proposal, in addition to applying or approval through the Department of Transportation, both the street seats and the art program, is also an application.
We like engaging and public art work and community engagement, type activities.
Lot of community members are, has sort of created a feedback loop with our work, where we've sort of developed a kind of style with our firms work both in the large scale, like interventions that we've done that are more temporary and more.
That was going to be almost you know, a full city block length along Flatbush Avenue and then also the Temple Square open, plaza on Lafayette, and we really wanted to find a language that worked for both of these things and actually connected them as kind of one larger piece, while still maintaining that kind of lightness and playfulness and accessibility, sort of creating a big piece of public art that can be enjoyed by everyone.
Ed was really to work within the confines of typical New York scaffolding and just kind of elevated, nothing too, fancy, but adding just a very limited palette of colors, which would kind of create a large- scale, art installation that could be appreciated from different speeds of experience.
Really, you treat the street almost like a backdrop and connected with the plaza in order to create a real sense of space, because, as David mentioned right, now, the plaza itself is quite small and does not really lend itself to any impromptu activity that one usually finds in a public.
The idea to kind of knit the background of the street shed with the with a with a design that kind of turns down onto the plaza paving, creates a real sense of space, even though the plaza is still completely open and then just going forward.
Just by seeing those kind of typical public tables and chairs, people will know that it's okay to sit there , it's okay to kind of enjoy this space, and hopefully that starts to develop kind of a user.
This slide that you see on your screen was the timeline before the coded crisis really began, and that timeline was for us to officially apply for the street seats application process present to you, the community board and then really start implementation, this spring, so that it could be open for the nice weather.
If there's going to be any security, maybe as part of the construction project, that might also walk by the plaza at nighttime and then also just thinking about coronavirus, whether there's going to be any waking down of the seats on a daily basis before the furniture is put away.
Ryan is probably going to be most helpful as it relates to this tree furniture, but the street furniture will be purchased by Ali. It will be standard, D, O, T, bistro, chairs and tables that you see at other public spaces in downtown Brooklyn.
That's why I said anybody so gay bar where you can ask the question there: Eda I, think this project is lovely and when you got up close the colors much more inviting if the underlying do that, there has been outreach to us saying gave this proposal to the Community Advisory Group.
I'll, entertain a motion to accept to accept the committee's who actually because Scepter right accept the recommendation or the Temple Square design, so moved Mr., Singletary, Jordan, Thank, You, Mr. Jordan Can I get a second from Juliet.
Some people would say they love everything next meeting, so they will come back and say they do not like you and Because I hate to see that ugly green spread through that interest, such a big piece of you, know, I, saw a wall green and by time they finished sticking up all these different posters.
Well, the community as a whole, but we respect your position and thank her for her work on the Advisory Committee.
Application is to construct a public plaza beneath the Brooklyn Bridge and beyond, using a play, otech, precast, paver and asked for asphalt and to enlarge the existing Empire stores.
Folks are fairly long and create a new lawn area and fenced pain on planting beds, with security, ballots benches and other seating and Mr. Chairman I see that Eric Landau, the president of a Brooklyn Bridge Park, is on the on the call Thank you very much and before I actually start my present on the plaza project.
Having said that, the Brooklyn Bridge Plaza project is being presented to the executive committee tonight, it's actually being put into the community board now really for the first time in this design, we were scheduled and present before the Land Use Committee on March 18th, but obviously because of a that meeting did not happen, and we are very appreciative today, board for hosting us evening.
I will note that this project has been presented to the parks, community, Advisory Committee, on multiple occasions, its design committee and its full committee, of which it was very well received and Rob Harris actually joined us for that.
But the Plaza project was actually the first section of Brooklyn Bridge Park to be constructed.
After going through community Board and LPC review, we removed the purchase building to not only build out this section apart, but to really open up the view plane to both bridges and to the Manhattan skyline and right after we took down the first building in 2008, we were ready to go with construction as the first part of the park to be built at which point New, York City, D, O- T received significant resources through the federal economic stimulus package to do repair work on the bridge.
That would help us both from a static perspective, as well as some significant design constraints that the space has and specifically those design constraints are that we need to ensure that New York, City D- O- T has the ability for vehicular access to the bridge itself and to the abutment and to be able to drive in on to the site, buy a new dock streets and enter the plaza itself.
We have been having conversations not only with the parks Community Advisory Committee, but also with the folks at City Hall about naming the space or Emily roving.
It is not only the right thing to do, but will actually significantly have significant meeting not just to the park but to the community at large.
What's not included in this and has been long talked about for years, is that in the wintertime we have long talked about this space being used as a seasonal ice, skating, rink, temporary installation and not a brick and mortar rink, like they have in Prospect Park, for example.
We should build out the space, see how it operates first and then pick up that question again, both in terms of ice skating, which again, we think is right, as well as any additional season singer.
Thank you, Eric mention this is our updated 2020 design, We heard from the community planning process.
We've created more opportunities for intimate and restive moments, there's more seating along the water, the smaller lawn that faces the bridge is surrounded, planting, framing the views and the of the bridge in the Manhattan skyline, and we've created some more robust planting, a long Water Street, while still meeting those D- O- T requirements to have protection along Water Street of the abutment, and the new design opens up more desire lines for pedestrians to walk through the space.
So we've worked with MBTA to identify a new paper that is special and unique, but will be fully APA accessible and allow people everyone to experience the entire space and walk along the water's edge here and The paper.
It seems like, on behalf of the design and concessions Committee or the Community Advisory Council, as Mr. Landau mentioned, I was at the last presentation by Van Valkenburg associates, and the presentation was very well received with a lot of gratitude, but how much work the landscape architect here to address earlier concern So I'm, not quite sure what to do with a nine- point letter that I received at 5:39 and the last time I was with the same group of people.
We have not yet activated that because it's yet clear what the summer will hold from the park under the current pandemic, but bathrooms that sort of the pure one turn around or something that we certainly talked about long term, but right, now, the two year- round closest bathrooms or empire stores.
And if your house you're your first question about construction and the schedule, you know, look I would say a couple of things.
Thank you for your comments about not only the design, but your current experience in the park, but for your question, and so the short answer is This.
It was never our intention to build a brick and mortar rink rather to engage with an ice skating, rink operator who would bring in and set up and installation like what they do in Bryant Park and then take it away at the end of the season.
We actually have an MoU with New York City They need to come into the space and access it for any type of construction.
I'll summarize it then I have agenda friendly, but it's watch Let me read it So. The second item under landmarks and preservation, certificate of appropriateness, application is for one two Clinton Avenue, Clinton Hill historic district application is to replace all windows and in all facades, with new aluminum's, clad historic profile windows that replicate original Korean, mutants, install new slate roof tiles and construct a new all with three- story: The areas that I'm most concerned about is the extension in the backyard and one of the things you can bring up in your presentation is: How far will it go into what we call the donut and also have you notified the neighbors on either side as to the work you're going to be doing in the backyard in the backyard extension so Rob?
My name is pastor Paul Burke, executive director of Brooklyn Teen Challenge I, just want to thank you, Executive Committee, for meeting with us, especially during the trying times that were in right, now.
We, sold the property to be able to do a renovation on this house because for 12 Clinton is not only in a historic district, but the building has quite a bit of history too, because this is the landmark program.
In order to keep this building on Hoppin and to make sure work well point to fit in time and was going to look attractive, we had to do a major renovation well in selling those buildings had to make up some square space which, with we are doing I I with me.
This trying time for our city, especially we've, been a light in this community, and we want to continue to be able to do that for many more years.
This is time, philippi, the architect at all, I'll kind of walk you through the details of the proposal once Paul wraps up, so the building was drawn up with all the things in mind: And, Like, I, said, we've been in this community since 1958 We're a historic building.
If there were no properties around it of what the expansion would look like when the construction would be complete and you can see we're looking at replicating the existing back of the building for most part That goes on, and you can see the handicap ramp coming up to the side entrance way and again we showed it going around to the front, but that's something that we do not have to have in order to provide accessibility and when it's all said and done.
