There are several people on the agenda for the presentation today, because this is really a collective proposal between alloy development, the OT, the downtown Brooklyn partnership and in collaboration with Tyler Ken. Think most of you know where temple square is, but for those who don't it is a small public space to eat.
It's and We provide technical support and design review, so I mean Ameri a program manager for the deity's temporary art program and through the program we partner with community-based organizations and artists to realize temporary artwork on our property, which includes sidewalks, plazas, median bridges, etc.
Our Advisory Committee then reviews that application and D-O-T arch works with the project team throughout implementation leading up to during, and we work on, coordinating all logistical elements as well as permitting with all appropriate team members, is through the Department of Cultural Affairs, and it's a program done in partnership with art, bridge called City canvass, and it is essentially taking scaffolding and other typical D-O-T construction, fencing that would normally be the hunter green spec, that's required by DOB and creating public artwork for it So our proposal, in addition to applying or approval through the Department of Transportation, both the street seats and the art program is also an application.
In addition, the first phase of eighty Flatbush project, is essentially everything to the east of the current khalil gibran Academy, and you can see that section would be wrapped in the standard construction fence and along Flatbush Avenue would have overhead protection We like engaging and public art work and community engagement type activities.
Be construction fence So we issued an RFP to a bunch of small design and architecture firms, with a focus primarily on MWBE and local architecture, design and artists, and through that RFP, which we did in collaboration with downtown Brooklyn partnership, tyler ken, which is a design firm that is based in Brooklyn and in Latin America, was the winning respondent and I'm an assistant in a second, and he can talk you through his proposals, but maybe before we do I know Ryan and Brennan grew where he one from downtown partnership might not be, but I think Ryan has presented to your can is certainly present at the Transportation Committee off tonight's He manages all of the plazas in downtown Brooklyn for the downtown Brooklyn partnership, and they are a very essential partner in this, both from the selection process of the RFP My name is Gregory matanov and, as David mentioned, I run a small architecture and design practice.
That was going to be almost you know, a full city block length along Flatbush Avenue and then also the Temple Square open, plaza on Lafayette, and we really wanted to find a language that worked for both of these things and actually connected them as kind of one larger piece, while still maintaining that kind of lightness and playfulness and accessibility, sort of creating a big piece of public art that can be enjoyed by everyone.
The approach to designing the streets ed was really to work within the confines of typical New York scaffolding and just kind of elevated, nothing too, fancy, but adding just a very limited palette of colors, which would kind of create a large-scale art installation that could be appreciated from different speeds of experience, because you have a lot of traffic along Flatbush and a lot of pedestrian traffic as well We wanted something that could kind of be appreciated on the intimate scale of a person walking through the scaffolding of somebody walking across from the scaffolding or of a automobile passing in either direction of the traffic Just given a kind of a color blocking treatment with an addition of a row of colored lighting, which at night would create enhance the visibility and an increase, the safety of the of the scaffolding corridor as well.
The body is now sidewalk, paving and kind of grow the pedestrian area into the traffic space, to really enhance the visual presence and also the usability of the space and layered in VOT, approved planters and loose seating, That's very already familiar to the kind of average New York pedestrian They again, there's no barrier for access, This is designed sort of for everybody and that, just by seeing those kind of typical public tables and chairs, people will know that it's okay to sit there.
We would like to do it so that we can hopefully hit at least some of the nice weather this spring and summer, and that's it because but I have question, is only one committee board members, my committee board member in that community board members, but committee board members Let me start with Julia calling Chung, who is the chair of the transportation Public Safety Committee, so Julia I'll turn it to you if it's very late, if there's going to be any security, maybe as part of the construction project that might also walk by the plaza at nighttime and then also just thinking about coronavirus, whether there's going to be any waking down of the seats on a daily basis before the furniture is put away.
The intention is that we have part of why we liked Greg's design approach is that it is very easy to maintain versus a more elaborate mural, and so the intention is that whatever and I think it's six or seven discrete colors that, instead of as you, would typically have the jobsite, you have a big bucket of hunter green paint that you would use to cover up graffiti It would be the potential for us to reevaluate the current design, and you could imagine a lot of different ways that reg and his team could elaborate on it and make it a different and better thing over time, and it was very well received in the community.
I was just wondering about snow removal in the wintertime on, particularly like the plaza area and that walkway That's really my only concern this is within the boundaries of town, Brooklyn partnerships, bailiwick Excuse me, snow removal, great thanks, any other questions from committee members That's why I said anybody so gay bar, where you can ask the question there : Eda I think this project is lovely and when you got up close the colors much more inviting if the underlying do that, there has been outreach to us saying gave this proposal to the Community Advisory Group It didn't include State Street, and there was a member of the 500 block of State Street, who felt left out and requested that the design be brought down their block Asbestos.
So Cheryl was able to express her sincere feelings that may not reflect the opinions of all the community Well, the community as a whole, but we respect your position and thank her for her work on the Advisory Committee Are you with us, you Thank You Quran, so the next item on the agenda item six man walks and Preservation Commission certificate of appropriateness, application, I really need Carlton or Irene to you know: You go good job, Carlton!, Okay, so I guess we'll start with the Brooklyn Bridge one Brooklyn Bridge, Park I.
Folks are fairly long and create a new lawn area and fenced pain on planting beds, with security, ballots benches and other seating, and mr chairman I see that Eric Landau, the president of a Brooklyn Bridge Park, is on the on the call My present on the plaza project.
We are living in very interesting times and there are changes to the park in terms of what is currently open and what protocols we are asking people to comply with in terms of social distancing from areas of the park that are closed or social, distancing, practical and the community board has been really fantastic and helping to push out some of that messaging Having said that, the Brooklyn Bridge Plaza project is being presented to the executive committee tonight, it's actually being put into the community board now really for the first time in this design, we were scheduled and present before the Land Use Committee on March 18th, but obviously because of a that meeting did not happen, and we are very appreciative today board for hosting us evening.
I will note that this project has been presented to the parks, community, Advisory Committee on multiple occasions, its design committee and its full committee, of which it was very well received and Rob Harris actually joined us for that last meeting, The plaza project and Lindsay is going to run through the drive , The slides as I speak from the beginning that I'm actually going to turn it over to her for the specific design elements, but the plaza project was actually the first section of Brooklyn Bridge Park to be constructed.
In 2008, we, after going through community board and LPC review, we removed the purchase building to not only build out this section apart, but to really open up the view plane to both bridges and to the Manhattan skyline and right after we took down the first building in 2008, we were ready to go with construction as the first part of the park to be built at which point New, York City D-O-T received significant resources through the federal economic stimulus package to do repair work on the bridge itself.
We do currently use the site it's fenced off, but we do use it for the occasional programming, for example, photo ville, which is a signature program that has been taking place in the park The last ten years is here for about two weeks in late August early September, we've done a couple other activations in this space, but it largely sits, as you see it, in this image as unused space directly underneath the bridge another sight line of it Ann's warehouse trend, you can see the Manhattan Bridge In the backdrop as I said: D-O-T had some work that they needed to do on the bridge itself.
We have not yet activated that because it's yet clear what the summer will hold from the park under the current pandemic, but bathrooms that sort of the pure one turn around or something that we certainly talked about Long term, but right now the two year-round closest bathrooms or empire stores, and if your house you're your first question about construction and the schedule you know, The expectation is that we would break ground in the late fall.
This coming fall, that's several months away, and obviously we are hoping that there is some return to normalcy by then Additionally, you know construction in the park is actually continuing on current projects, including the uplands of pier 2, we're actually, in the final days of finishing out the new Squibb bridge that preventative maintenance work is continuing, and all of this is under the express direction of both mayor's office and the governor's office that you know the government Empire State Development under the covers office, which is overseeing all those executive orders that have faulted corruption.
Executive Committee for meeting with us, especially during the trying times that were in right now, So I, do appreciate your time and your effort to make this happen for the project for 412 Clinton, Avenue Now. We are a residential program that helps young men and adults that struggle with addiction and life controlling issues in much need of a renovation all in accordance to landmark and the aesthetics of the of the community that the building is in We did own some property up the street for four for Vanderbilt, which was recently sold.
This is a 3d overhead view if there were no properties around it of what the expansion would look like when the construction would be complete and you can see we're looking at replicating the existing back of the building for most part, and then we have the roof deck which again we kept that one lower in order to preserve the original outline of the rear architecture and yet, at the same time meet the needs of the Teen Challenge program that goes on, and you can see the handicap ramp coming up to the side entrance way and again we showed it going around to the front, but that's something that we do not have to have in order to provide accessibility and when it's all said and done, If there's enough money left over.
