The community was said to be excited about this, according the applicants, and they were going to have events like a jazz band or an irish trio as part of their live music that they would have at this location is in sort of a brunch.

The two individuals represented the hotel indicated that there were that the beer garden did not face any neighbors and there was not going to be any community impact and there were no community members at the at the meeting.
There were a number of complaints filed with 3- 1- 1 and City councilman Levin got involved, and there was a meeting we held in November 2017, with a completely different group of people representing the Tillery hotel, who indicated that they were new, that they were quite overwhelmed by their work and The. The neighbors expressed concerns about noise from the beer garden and the hotel and us, and the neighbors.
We agreed that they would that the hotel would no longer play amplified music out from their their beer garden, because there was a concern about these sort of special events that they were holding where this amplified music would be very loud, go on late at night, and the neighbors would go to the hotel and attempt to complain about it and there would not be a manager around or they would not have anybody to work with, and the person who came to that.
And there have been fresh new complaints and it seems it seemed the complaints were that the hotel effectively abandoned their agreement from October 2019 and has just started playing music, creating lots of noise for the for the surrounding residences, and we invited them to come to our last community meeting our last committee meeting, just in order to get sort of a better understanding of what was going on, but hopefully to reach a resolution between the community members and the hotel, and we had a representative from the hotel, attend.
Fourth, different group has come to represent the hotel and they, the sort of, throughout the course of about an hour of discussing this issue between the community members.
Events in October, with third parties coming in to do bar mitzvahs and weddings, and that they'd expressed a lot of difficulties with Covid-19 and with the challenges that had existed associated with that and at the end of it, you know, despite really trying to reach a consensus with them, which I think is probably the main goal.
When I asked for an approval of the agenda, I took a second from Oscar Only a member of the youth education and Culture Affairs Committee.
Okay, I, entertain a motion to accept the committee's recommendation for Brooklyn bridge forks five.
I'm glad to hear that, hopefully, we'll have a stronger relationship and that to imply that we did not with the previous commanding officer, but we hope that we can continue the relationships that we have with the 84th president in a good way , That's good to hear I'm glad you shared that next on the agenda item number five committees to report: Let's start with economic development and employment, bill, Fletanoy We had a presentation by cinch market They're, a company local company that actually has taken taking the initiative because of Covid-19 to actually organize an Amazon type of platform with local businesses throughout the area where you can actually order products from various small businesses throughout the area, whether they are brick and mortar or online, and actually order goods to be delivered to your house.
I, was, I feel, very comfortable in recommending this company to anyone to check out the website and see what they're all about the the link is also in the chat room, along with a link to Dumbo stores that are using the platform and Tia Mueller, and I are working with other bids, other community boards and the borough president's office to make connections between and other parts of, Brooklyn.
They believe that children should have as much ability to play as possible without having restrictions, and they did a pop- up right before Covid-19 at city point Excuse me in doing some other program in our district, and our committee was very receptive to them.
We've started a conversation now and It's a little too late now to do something outdoors for, for the last part of the fall, so we're looking forward to hearing from them again and to see what they could bring to our district And they're, particularly interested in setting up a program that would be very much accessible to children who live in NYCHA, projects, So Thank, you, Barbara Next committee to report on youth, education and cultural affairs.
We did not meet since the last time that the executive committee met, but I did want to share that.
We're going to discuss the fiscal year, 2022 statement of Community district needs and register of budget priorities at this time.
You know those of you who have been on the board for a long time and many of the executive committee members fall into that category.
The Office of Management and budget would like community boards to limit their expense budget priorities to 25 and with the new additions this year, we're somewheres up around 60.
If we, if I put that in a separate lane for a minute, is there anyone else that has any comments on the proposed suggestion to move forward with reducing the expense budget items based on the ranking up before you take Mr com, Worksheet is in the chat panel, and if anybody needs that email to them, we can do that that will be accessible to anyone that has not been granted access to that drive, but all board members should be able to access that, and then.
My only child Thank you for those who've, always asked how his progress, progression, was, And I'm sure his family appreciates some of the thoughts that you may have but wanted to be open and let you all know that he put up a good fight he's in a better place.
I wanted to just share that with everyone and then we'll move on to the district management item number eight on the agenda.
I will send the board members a district office report as part of the package for the November general meeting, but I did want to share with the board members.

As I said at the outset, I will send a written report to to the board members when we do get ready for the November meeting, but I did want to bring them up to date.
I'm, a part of the bridge, Plaza Group, and I just want to thank you guys for all of your help, the Hess committee and the executive committee for supporting us with our continued battles with the tillery, and I, just how much I'm enjoying being able to attend these meetings.
I'm sure we would want some type of resolution I do take a lot of pride in recognizing Mr, Smith, Miss, Thurston and all the other members who make up that committee to take the comments and the concerns that you and your neighbors have shared, but to take them seriously and to make the recommendation Particularly, through, I, guess my signature and the correlation of a letter with the office.
We appreciate it and all the hard work I think he seems to be asking Mr Gordon, to report out on the letter that that Ernest augustus sent to all board members.
Will, you know, Jessican't only is a member of the committee But she's, also the secretary of the of the board, And so I have no doubt that we have enough of your feedback captured in our minutes to make sure we put the right letter together to get the right message.
