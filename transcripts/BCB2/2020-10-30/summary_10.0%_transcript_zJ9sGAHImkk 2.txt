I have a number of my colleagues here as well, including a number of the branch librarians kat, savage from our John Street Annex and Janet cotton from Walt Whitman and Tracy Mantrone from the Clinton hill branch, and there are a few other folks as well, including Sonia Covington, who runs our capital planning and maybe weighing in later on, when we get into describing some of the capital projects going on in the district.
We've been able to do a lot of other things, ranging from tutoring services through a service called brain fuse, resume and job search, assistance and cultural programs, including through our new center for Brooklyn history, which I'll talk a little bit more about in a bit and some new, exciting projects, one of which is on the screen, is the David 28 So first of all, I want to show off our branch, our branch, librarians, cat, Janet and tracy, and turn to the map.
Think where I was before the point where we could see the slides was mentioning the 28th amendment project, which is a project we've been conducting largely via community zoom meetings About three dozen of them over the course of the past nine months, where we've been getting feedback from folks all over the borough and what they'd like to see in a 28th amendment to the constitution which we've compiled and have made it available to folks for to consid, to continue to wait and weigh in on another project that we've been able to do not virtual, but just one I wanted to mention, because it relates to Community Board 2.
This project involved the city selling the site of our old Brooklyn heights library on cabin Plaza West, which netted us 52 million dollars and the core and shell of a new library at the base of the Condo tower.
You were interested in this one connection between the old Brooklyn heights library and the new I'm, going to jump back for a second Are going to be placed in two small conference, rooms, one that is off of the main hall over here with a view of Clinton street and That is a second conference room on the mezzanine, and so each of those conference rooms are going to have one set of the bar reliefs that are going to be visible from the street and the other mile reliefs are going to be placed at Walt, Whitman, and I will come to that in in a few minutes.
So I'm, now going to jump to another project that relates to Brooklyn heights, the Adam Street library.
It's not was not quite a full library but allowed us to get our feet wet and has given cat and her team a chance to start to build up relationships with stakeholders in the neighborhood and to begin to provide some library, some library services, just a quick overview of what that space is going to look like the core of it.
There's some teen space here And, then a raised platform with the children's area, which includes stroller parking, Underneath, there's the adult reading room on sort of the waterfront side of the space and then also our great architects, here, work, ac, managed to squeeze in a multi- purpose, room and another small conference room So like the Brooklyn heights.
It's going to be open to the public, there's going to be space for people to come in and use there'll be Wi, fi,, there's a small collection, but it's really going to be a special space geared towards its location, with a focus on the arts and the cultural happenings in the neighborhood and around the borough.
Will we expect to revolve and, to some extent, tie into what's going on in in the cultural, in the cultural district So we're excited to bring a new library to the neighborhood and also I'm excited to provide a space.
We, recently merged with the Brooklyn historical society and pulled together the historical society with our own Brooklyn collection, that combined entity at the center for Brooklyn history is going to continue to be housed at 128 pierpont, and It's a One is to continue the great work that this historical society had been doing, both in terms of Ex exhibitions and the education work that they do in the programming work that they do and the great work that our Brooklyn collection has been has been doing, and also to begin to have the center leverage, the library system, so to create a better connection between the neighborhoods around the borough.
The school construction, Authority, really early in the process about four years ago, had come up with a design, so I'm not sure of the latest schedule from them, and if the stem space is going to be ready before the library is or after, but I will say that we we've raised with DOE the the the issue that when they do open, up, there's an enormous opportunity for us to collaborate with them.
You know we have begun a a terrific program around robotics around the borough that we love to be able to work with them on I think it will have to be a question for them in terms of what their, what their schedule is, but I, think when they, when they do open, it's going to be an exciting opportunity for collaboration.
Think the a fundamental goal is to develop programs that are going to be geared towards neighborhoods all over the borough, and We've received funding from the council member there to include in that new space, a heritage center that will focus on the african burial ground.
So just one example that comes to mind of us sort of integrating the expertise of the center for Brooklyn history, with the what's going on in the library around the borough.
Okay, I'd like to say that I'm a little disappointed at what I am going to refer to as the library by the Brooklyn academy of music, which you're calling the south side or whatever I thought.
And I do think this gets to the question of when we open these great new libraries And we're going to have a bunch of them we're going to be opening Adam street , we're going to be opening Brooklyn heights and then later on a revitalized Walt whitman we're going to have the new south side space You know it does get at when we open a new space casting a wide net to let people know about it, and you know particularly folks who need us.
Nina's need us most, and you know with it's been particularly interesting with Adam Street, where again, we're sort of creating the library community, starting at the beginning and cat, and her team have been talking to lots of stakeholders in the neighborhood.
We've been very focused on Farragut houses in particular, so I think that's sort of a real, a really important part for us when we open new spaces, it's not just building them, but making sure that we're doing what we can to communicate with people who can really use them and need them.
What I'd like to know from the the members of our committee is whether or not you think this is something that we should undertake If so, then we would have a vote on whether or not we would be meeting with the Parks committee in December I work at the kings, County clerk's office, which is in the building, that is, that houses Brooklyn Supreme Court the park surrounding the court.
They would like to address CB2 about the Columbus statue created by Ms devins, located in Columbus park in front of the NY New York City Supreme Court, building in downtown Brooklyn.
