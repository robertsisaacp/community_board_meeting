Okay, good evening, everybody I, don't normally do this preamble, but tonight is a joint meeting of the parks and Recreation Committee and the youth Education and Cultural Affairs committee of Brooklyn community board.
Today, I would like to do a land acknowledgement, so the land that I'm going to be speaking to you about today originally was the Lenape Jokingland, the Lenape Homeland and the Lenape were the first people to live in New, York and Brooklyn before it was settled by europeans, And I say this as a reminder to the continued displacement of native peoples on this land and our ongoing commitment to dismantling the colonial legacy.
The narrative of Columbus often goes that he, you know in 1492, He, sailed the ocean blue that he was a lost child, a curious wanderer, taking on the noble and courageous task of discovering the new world.
The statue at its current location, with support from the italian historical society of America and Columbus, is often touted as a symbol of italian-american pride and heritage.
This photo was taken at a teach-in at Columbus circle on indigenous people's day, and this is a sign from one of our supporters called Control Colombo.
Their group of italian-American New Yorkers, who advocate for the dismantling of Columbus statues throughout New, York City, and this is their website and a quote from their website is that Control Colombo believes Italian.
His legacy in both name and illness is in likeness, is an affront to the dignity of all oppressed people and besides the fact that Columbus couldn't have been italian because Italy was informed as a nation during his lifetime that he did not discover a new nation.
I was able to attend the transportation and Public Safety committee meeting and we got to hear from the 84th Precinct captain Edelrana, and he was speaking to us about how the department was handling changes in budget and increased demand for officers in the face of protests, and he said when we only have limited resources.
We understand that a new monument is a very intensive and costly process that must be carefully curated and we would not want to take on that endeavor without input from our community members, the Lenape Center of New, York and other cultural and artistic groups who have been impacted most by the legacy of Columbus and with that.
Next is a letter of introduction to the parks, Department and a letter of support from your committee to present a larger proposal to the city council, and that is our.
Where, If removed the statue would be based, I, think you know, adding historical context from this.
Any other figures that you guys are looking at to have in place of the statue in place of Columbus, so that process of replacing the statue we would want to make a bigger community question like we wouldn't want it to be all up to our group who we'd want to pick.
Do definitely want to have that conversation with the Lenape Center of New York, and you know other descendants of african and indigenous people who they want to symbolize if they want us to be in the likeness of an individual or something more representative of the community.
I believe two years, ago, where they reviewed Columbus statue and other figures throughout the city to determine whether they represent hate and should be taken down, and their conclusion was that more context should be added to the Columbus statue in the form of things like plaques and as far as I can tell it hasn't been added.
We have a solid, perfect plan to remove the Columbus statue before we have a perfectly created new statute.
You see that last part trying to understand what specifically your group would be asking of the committees in terms of support for what the concept of changing the concept of removing and replacing the statute along with renaming of the park.
We would wish for a letter of introduction to the Parks Department, considering it's their statue and if this were to get to a larger city council vote about the removal of the statue, If we would have your support in that vote, but in the so those are two different things in the first instance, You want to talk to the folks at the Parks, Department, correct.
So I appreciate you guys doing the work for Christopher Columbus as well, and removing that statue.
Our only goal is first primary goal, removing the statues that is our goal and then initiating a process to rename the park and have a new statue put up our main way of getting the community engaged right now is through a lot of social media.
There are four statues of Columbus that you would like to see removed and that's the only goal of your committee.
There was a lot of push in New York City at that time, to review our own symbolism and images that I believe only a handful of images were picked just because there would probably be hundreds of monuments on that list, and so committee was formed and they would have open discussions with the community, and.
One okay, but this specific statue does have you know going back at least five years.
You know a very long history of it in the city, so I just wanted to follow up on Suzanne's question.
I want to thank Miss Vasquez for whatever our presentation and the time and energy, especially in involving young people in this issue.
We got together after a year in a group meeting of 15 or 20 people in a room, and this is our proposal to take down the statue.
I think this needs a lot of serious discussion, whether you know whether that statue deserves to stand there or not.
If we want to be on board with requesting an exploration into the statue, I, don't think any of us is prepared to say it.
You know be there, but should there be a similar exploration that took place several years ago and co-op for the Columbus circle that should take place for this statue, where the different groups are consulted, I'm, not completely clear on whose domain the statue is it.
One other thing is that I just really would like to get a little bit more of a clarification, because I don't think that we, you know, maybe this particular half a year or whatever.
I just wanted to say that Miss Vasquez did come over to our committee meeting and discuss the police presence at the statues and I.
I can't represent the whole committee, because we didn't vote on it, but I would say that from a social justice, perspective, I would support what Miss Quint had suggested, which would be the exploration and the further discussion of the possibility of removing the statue.
As, we were performing and teaching at the statue, It appeared to us that they were there to get between us and the statue and based on the you know, I, don't want to put words in anyone's mouth, but certainly if we watch the video from the community board meeting the Public Transportation one.
I. I'm, not disagreeing with whatever else was said, I missed a lot of the meeting, but I know the history of Christopher Columbus.
That is one of the reasons, not maybe the main reason, but one of the reasons that this was brought to our you know for us to make a decision not only about the what was going on with Christopher Columbus and the atrocities, but also because of the dollars that were wasted because of police guarding this the statues.
Anyone now who's, not a community board member but is attending the meeting and would like to ask a question we'll open the floor.
I. Think the one thing that should be remembered if a statue does come down is how do we record some pieces of history that might be important to understand, and the mania for Columbus came out of the post-civil war desire to create healing bombs for the country, and rightly or wrongly, They went back to the colonial era.
There are pieces of history that we still want to figure out how to memorialize and that's not glorifying Columbus, but it's looking at historical moments and italian Americans are still 10 of the greater New York Metro area, population.
In some way you still want to understand how to represent that piece of it, even if not all Italians take Columbus as their symbol.
First just want to say, I, think that this idea about opening things up for more exploration and to hear from italian Americans is guided.
I. Think that this meeting right now is a public meeting where italian Americans can show up and talk about the importance of that statute to them if they want.
I. Think that you know we're hearing from people on this meeting that they didn't know about the atrocities that Columbus committed and part of the reason for that is because he's been normalized as the hero because of statues like the woman, a few blocks from where I live.
Thinking about the you know not just oppression that Columbus committed, but the genocide that he enacted.
I think you know we're in a moment of national truth and reconciliation and questioning Columbus.
So I think you know the presence of this statue.
I support all Columbus statues coming down.
I have a very strong feeling that in 10 years, all Columbus statues will be gone just the way that things are developing in our country, and so our question now is what role do we want to play in that history.
If, that's okay, to ask a question, but basically I just want to know.
I understand that we may want the italian-american community and that's fine, but are we also going to have a conversation with the Lenape Community with the other tribes from New York, like my tribe, with black and brown folks, who view that man in the same life, Hitler.
If you know, if we're interested in a conversation, I, think nothing will start a conversation quicker than the removal of the statue.
I understand where a lot of people, my including by the way, will like this to be taken down, but is anything that we can do to prevent it from happening again from going up again or anything else that can prevent either statues or any type of resemblance to go up.
We think it is important that before we ask people to do something, you know say no, why and I.
And I think you know whether or not what happens to the statue.
Yes, the introduction to the parts of department of parks and recreation, as well as a letter of support for the city.
If your motion is as I hear, it is to write a letter to the Parks department in support of removing this statute.
You want to ask people if there's any other business for our committee.
