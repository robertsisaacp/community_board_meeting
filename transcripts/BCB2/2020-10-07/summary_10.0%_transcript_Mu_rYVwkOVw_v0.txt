What I'm going to talk today is that as really a Brooklyn resident when the pandemic, arrived, I think one of the most thing interesting thing that I experienced and, with my conversation with different businesses, what we understood is that we all go back.
You, know to amazon and all those big guys to shop, especially under the condition of Covid-19, because we want the experience of one store like we want to go to one place, order, whatever we need, and we want to get it to directly to our door.
Nobody can build the next amazon, but I think if we allow everybody to team up together, you know what I learned and that's very interesting, is that we have everything in Brooklyn.
We want to know that you're not going to the businesses and not the delivery, people, okay record.
I also want to show you how great impact it does for the businesses, because I think what you can see that If you can see in that image, like the green spot, is a store on court street and you can see how those guys increase the catchment area that they get, that they get with that platform.
We work with ribny, with rebny to bring more real estate people in into that game and what everybody can choose, how they want to support that movement and it could be by presenting poster and stuff like that.
Okay, wonderful, because I've been shopping at a local grocery store and basically ordering my items and going to pick it.
Or I, don't know it's also from local businesses- The point with the essential that sometimes it's not a specific location like we take from a few different stores?
Right, look at a store, You should think about it like how we put Brooklyn or the neighborhood online.
And I will edit this something to our tech team to check it's a very good point, but we didn't have a chance to handle that until now we are live since we started the project in April when We launched it in June We kind of try to put to make sure that everything is working Then we will definitely add more and more layers to make sure that we support the different audiences in the community.
We, do a lot of social activities, people sharing that with their friends and stuff like that, and the businesses that work with are sharing that the way that you can help.
So yes, so we have actually, the company has, I will say, like headquarter people that they are more like building their own platform, Then we have the Brooklyn store team that operate whatever is going on in Brooklyn.
Some of them are not, but everybody does is working for the store for the fulfillment for the orders for the delivery working with the businesses in Brooklyn, everybody is from Brooklyn, so we take people from the community to work to operate the store.
Who is the person that I can continue the conversation with I'm happy that you gave me the opportunity to share it with you, I'm happy to continue to work with whoever and which is part of the community board, to allow us to scale and have a great holiday for our businesses?
Okay, as far as deliveries, so we open it to all Brooklyn all of Brooklyn , This is the time, but I'm happy to schedule time with the with the board office, because I think we can talk more about how we can help some neighborhoods that we have less access.
I, know that I'm happy to understand more about your activities and we can see what specifically we can do together to really help the community to know about exactly the area that you cover so We can share with you about our work with the business improvement district in that area.
Okay for the chairperson's report First, take a look at taking care of the one piece of business that we need to take care of, and that's the basic, the district needs.
The agency says, like this, isn't actually a budget request, so The working group has basically decided because of either because they've been already funded, completed or they're, not actually items that are appropriate for this particular request.
So I think we all liked this one, because it feels like a really well-rounded ask that it's not just supporting the individuals who have been affected by Covid-19, but also our local nonprofit community who's, having issues gaining funding in grant programs due to the economic restrictions that are facing a lot of non-profits right now and then line 24.
But I would argue that every assessment that we've done in the last five years is no longer helpful, and so I think it's time to take a look at what our community is experiencing due to coca-19, to really understand the impact that it's having on businesses so that we can address them.
Currently right, now, that's occurring throughout all the business improvement districts and some stores are actually attempting to maintain stay viable, but this is becoming very difficult, which is why I feel that our ask for requests for the budget is something that I'm going to push very strongly for, because these small businesses need to be made It's a company that is representative of quite a few employees in the area that now are going to be unemployed I think this is something that's important that we actually focus on that.
And also, they still have access to all the talent that they would need currently right now, they're looking to hire 185 people, okay.
Is there, any other business from the committee members that they like to bring up right, now?
Okay, I, just wanted to make sure that they were working on that, because you know that's another way.
I think this is maybe the right time to share this, but just wanted to shout out that there's going to be a Brooklyn art walk starting October, 17th and 18th along atlantic ave, and it's going to be basically a replacement of what was the atlantic antic for the year in a Covid-19, safe, way.
We're going to be needing reports from you as far as the downtown Brooklyn partnership when they meet yes If there's no one for the community forum.
