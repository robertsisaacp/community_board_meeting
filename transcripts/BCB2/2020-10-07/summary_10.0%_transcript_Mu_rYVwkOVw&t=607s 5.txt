What I'm going to talk today is that as really a Brooklyn resident when the pandemic, arrived, I think one of the most thing interesting thing that I experienced and, with my conversation with different businesses, what we understood is that we all go.
You, know to Amazon and all those big guys to shop, especially under the condition of Covid-19, because we want the experience of one store like we want to go to one place, order, whatever we need, and we want to get it to directly to our door.
Nobody can build the next Amazon, but I think if we allow everybody to team up together, you know what I learned and that's very interesting, is that we have everything in Brooklyn.
We want to know that you're not going to the businesses and not the delivery, people, okay record.
I also want to show you how great impact it does for the businesses, because I think what you can see that the businesses increasing month over the month, the sales and, if you can see in that image, like the green spot, is a store on Court Street, and you can see how those guys increase the catchment area that they get, that they get with that platform.
We need to think, like Amazon, take warehouse, says in the center of cities in order to be very close to the customers and fulfill their orders.
If you think about so, we are close to the customer compared to Amazon Those people that own those retailers know that the community better than Amazon.
We work with REBNY, with REBNY to bring more real estate people in into that game and what everybody can choose, how they want to support that movement and it could be by presenting poster and stuff like that.
Instead of Amazon gift card around Brooklyn, Whatever support we can get, we are happy to discuss and see what we can do together to help our city questions.
Okay, wonderful, because I've been shopping at a local grocery store and basically ordering my items and going to pick it.
Or I, do not know it's also from local businesses- The point with the essential that sometimes it's not a specific location like we take from a few different stores.
We do a lot of social activities, people sharing that with their friends and stuff like that, and the businesses that work with are sharing that the way that you can help.
So yes, so we have actually, the company, has, I will say, like headquarter people that they are more like building their own platform, Then we have the Brooklyn store team that operate whatever is going on in Brooklyn.
Some of them are not, but everybody does is working for the store for the fulfillment for the orders for the delivery working with the businesses in Brooklyn, everybody is from Brooklyn, so we take people from the community to work to operate the store.
So, okay, one more time, I'm taking my time any more questions from committee members or board members Not yet we do not have an app, but people can shop.
Who is the person that I can continue the conversation with I'm happy that you gave me the opportunity to share it with you, I'm happy to continue to work with whoever and which is part of the Community Board, to allow us to scale and have a great holiday for our businesses?
Okay as far as deliveries, so we open it to all Brooklyn all of Brooklyn, This is the time, but I'm happy to schedule time with the with the board office, because I think we can talk more about how we can help some neighborhoods that we have less access.
I, know that I'm happy to understand more about your activities and we can see what specifically we can do together to really help the community to know about exactly the area that you cover so We can share with you about our work with the business improvement district in that area.
The agency says like this is not actually a budget request, so you know it's not in line The working group has basically decided because of either because they've been already funded, completed or they're, not actually items that are appropriate for this particular request.
Ask that it's not just supporting the individuals who have been affected by Covid-19, but also our local nonprofit community who's, having issues gaining funding in grant programs due to the economic restrictions that are facing a lot of non- profits right now and then line 24.
But I would argue that every assessment that we've done in the last five years is no longer helpful, and so I think it's time to take a look at what our community is experiencing due to Covid-19, to really understand the impact that it's having on businesses so that we can address them.
And I think I mean the last meeting has to be a direct link to the to the people that are impacted and have been not just because Covid-19 they've been impacted for a long time for many years in terms of various opportunities in whatever areas that they may be, And I keep bringing back the training and apprenticeship, and we are the economic development and employment committee, and if we really define what that means.
I, unfortunately missed it, and I was wondering if there were any items that came up there, that we are missing or that should be adding that came directly from the community, because I think, as a working group.
Currently right, now, that's occurring throughout all the business improvement districts and some stores are actually attempting to maintain stay viable, but this is becoming very difficult, which is why I feel that our ask for requests for the budget is something that I'm going to push very strongly for, because these small businesses need to be made It's a company that is representative of quite a few employees in the area that now are going to be unemployed I think this is something that's important that we actually focus on that.
Is there, any other business from the committee members that they like to bring up right, now?
Okay, I, just wanted to make sure that they were working on that, because you know that's another way.
I think this is maybe the right time to share this, but just wanted to shout out that there's going to be a Brooklyn art walk starting October, 17th and 18th along Atlantic Ave, and it's going to be basically a replacement of what was the Atlantic antic for the year in a Covid-19, safe, way.
We're going to be needing reports from you as far as the downtown Brooklyn partnership when they meet yes If there's no one for the community forum.
