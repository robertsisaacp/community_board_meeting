Actually, I'm not sure can I share a presentation here, because I could n't find the option to do that: hey Maya! This is taya, no problem. Okay, you should be seeing a little blue beach ball heading. Your way then go ahead and click in the upper left hand corner select yeah. Now I see, can you see my screen? Yes, we can actually see your entire desktop. Is that that's perfect, you see the shop Brooklyn movement, yes, go ahead cool, so thanks everybody for letting me to present. As I said, I started the cinch more than two years ago with a very clear mission of how can we rebuild the neighborhood to be a great platform for Commerce? I think now, with the pandemic, we see even more. How is that so important topic? My background is technology and operation, and I want to talk about the history of the company and the product that we started with. But what I'm going to talk today is that as really a Brooklyn resident when the pandemic arrived, I think one of the most thing interesting thing that I experienced and with my conversation with different businesses, what we understood is that we all go back. You know to Amazon and all those big guys to shop, especially under the condition of Covid-19, because we want the experience of one store like we want to go to one place, order, whatever we need, and we want to get it to directly to our door and if you think about we all see about the challenge of all the businesses around us. In my opinion, they're going to continue to create to experience that challenge. If we're not going to make a change, and the reason is because they will never be able to create the everything store. Experience like Amazon, like a wine store, can sell wine and the pet store can sell pet supply. So what we decided to do is we decided to build a platform to allow them to collaborate and team up together to become the everything store Brooklyn, so everything fulfilled by Brooklyn stores. So what we did? We opened an online store and we build. We invest in a lot of integration to allow every store in Brooklyn that, even if they have Ecom to integrate into one big store to be able to create the same Amazon experience. But to fulfill it from a neighborhood from Brooklyn stores and what we do. Actually we take every order that we get on the site, so we get customers now that order from three different stores. They can buy wine and toy for the kids and whatever, and when we get the order, we have a fulfillment technology that we built to allow us to send that order to three different stores. They prepared the orders and they we pick it up to centralize the location and we deliver that from there. So this is what we that's the platform that we build, and you know we all understand that. Probably nobody can build the next Amazon, but I think if we allow everybody to team up together, you know what I learned and that's very interesting, is that we have everything in Brooklyn. The problem of what we have is that the inventory is not available and there is no access from people to get a good. You know experience of searching and buying from that. So that's exactly what we built with this everything store Brooklyn. So one of the most important thing when we started that so we built the platform and we launched, we launched a campaign under the this login. As you can see here, shop Brooklyn, not bezos, and what we saw is that people really like it. So a lot of people start to share, but they told us guys. We want to know two important thing but and sorry for my language, but they were told us guys. We want to know that you're not going to the businesses and not the delivery, people, okay record. It so watch the language, please! So sorry, so they want to make sure that we really care about what's going on and what we decided is to put the whole values and the way that we build that platform up front and put it visible for the community, and you can see the values that we lead. The platform based on based on that. So the I'm happy to share the Brooklyn movement is really growing and we see that the sales of the platform is growing more than 50 percent month over month. For sure all that money goes to the to the to Brooklyn to Brooklyn stores, the community is really involved and proud to take action even if to put signs or go with t- shirts, or we also. We also manage a slack channel with the community that we get their ideas and we get the products that they want us to add and what stores they are missing because they want to continue to shop in our store. I also want to show you how great impact it does for the businesses, because I think what you can see that the businesses increasing month over the month, the sales and, if you can see in that image, like the green spot, is a store on Court Street, and you can see how those guys increase the catchment area that they get, that they get with that platform. So the big learning for me and the big insight like when we think about our assets and the real estate in the community. It's we can not think about it anymore, like the place for people to come in and have it as a showroom. We need to think, like Amazon, take warehouse, says in the center of cities in order to be very close to the customers and fulfill their orders fast guys. All those stores are already there, they close to the customers. They just do. N't have the access and with the platform that we provide them, they have now the access and they can leverage the asset that they rent and now we need to think about that asset as a fulfillment center and as a and this store. So that's a big shift that I'm working also with some real estate partners that to help to think with them how we can build new models that can help all those retail assets. But if you think about so, we are close to the customer compared to Amazon those people that own those retailers know that the community better than Amazon. We just need to create much more channels and opportunities, and you can see how we think, how together we are going to eat this one company, and we are not that's how we believe that we can bring back that power. So this project got a lot of exposure you can see. I can share with you also that presentation by the way, all of that by Brooklyn reporters that saw our activities and decided to write about that. It's not like any pr proactively that we did. It's show how the community really wanted and how they are supporting. So we actually build a marketing kit for the movement and we let every partner we work with real estate partners. They promoted to their tenants, so everybody we work with business improvement district that can help us to bring businesses to the site. We work with REBNY with REBNY to bring more real estate people in into that game and what everybody can choose, how they want to support that movement and it could be by presenting poster and stuff like that. It could be by sending like invitation to different residents letter to retailers that we have we provide here and every organization that care about the community is invited to join, to join that movement. The last thing that we want to drive- and I will be happy to get your support guys- is that we build a Brooklyn gift card, so we know that the holidays is going to be a big thing for our retailers. We know that 50 of what people buy is Amazon gift card, so we have a Brooklyn gift card and we want more and more people to buy that instead of Amazon gift card around Brooklyn, so whatever support we can get, we are happy to discuss and see what we can do together to help our city questions yeah. Thank you very much. That is awesome. I really enjoy this two questions, one. If I am a consumer- and I want to get involved in this, how do I do it? Sorry, you're, a consumer and yes, I'm a consumer, and I want to basically get involved with you and start using your actual platform, your products. How do I do it to buy like just shop? You go to cinch market. I will leave the the link on the here, so you can go. How does it work so I go to that site and what do I do? Can I get again the ability to share my screen? Oh perfect, let me just a second, so this is the site, so if so, you go and you can shop whatever you want, you can shop by category. Okay, those are the different categories that you can get and shop with you can go and shop by stores like you can see all the different stores like if we go, for example, to Sahadi, I'm sure that most of you know who is sahadi, so you can go and just add to your cart. Whatever you want from sahadi and then you can go and let's say we will go to the bookstore and you can go and add whatever you want here. Okay, like you can add this to the cart and whatever, and I can go now and go to the hardware store and let's say this is what I need and when I finish, I go to checkout exactly like Amazon and I buy that's all, and it's going to come from three different stores: you're going to get one box with everything inside okay, so you actually mail it or do you actually have delivery? We deliver that. So, if you order until 10 A.M, you are going to get it same day until 8 00 pm. If you order after 10 A.M, you will get it the next day, beautiful next question. If I am a store owner or yeah, I get involved on your platform, so I can also participate. So we have here a page that every business can sign up, get involved, okay, how people can get involved so at your business. Just send us here a form: okay and they get involved. People can add businesses. People can recommend us product or businesses that they want us to add. So we approach them. But if someone added their business, we have a guy and we have someone in our team that will approach them and we do at least once a week or twice a week, a webinar people come on some businesses. We talk the biggest the bigger businesses we talk directly and some of them. We just bring them into a webinar, they come, they listen, they ask questions and if they want they sign papers and based on their platform, we add them to a queue. We have a queue for of more than 40 businesses. Now that are waiting to join the market just for to let you know we have more than 30 000. I products around Brooklyn, 30, 000. yeah, and it's growing, I think, in few in few weeks we will double it: okay, wonderful because I've been shopping at a local grocery store and basically ordering my items and going to pick it up, and I am hooked so this is this is this is even more tempting. So thank you. Okay, questions from other committee members, ice questions, okay, yeah, yeah, hi, so great presentation. Thank you. When I was looking at your website earlier- and I saw that it said something- so I noticed there's something under the category: cinch essentials are those products. So I have two questions. Are those products not from local small businesses? Is that your own web store- or I do n't know it's also from local businesses? The point with the essential that sometimes it's not a specific location like we take from a few different stores we put it on, we do n't have anywhere. We have just the sorting spot right, do n't have any inventory, and then the next question is so. You have let's say three businesses that sell our businesses allowed to sell the same products on your site so which gives the shopper an opportunity to see like who's selling it cheaper. You know to save a bucket, because we still do that in our local community right, look at a store, that's having a sale or sells it at a cheaper price point. So that's the question: were they allowed to sell the same product yeah? So definitely so you know it's a market. You should think about it like how we put Brooklyn or the neighborhood online. Okay, the same as you can go from one store to another. You can search and you get yeah, okay, yeah! Thank you any other questions for committee members hi. This is latrell. I have a question my question. My question: is the website accessible for people with disability for like screen readers and for large print visually impairments? That's a good point, but actually not for now. I think we will need to consider that definitely moving forward, and I will edit this something to our tech team to check it's a very good point, but we did n't have a chance to handle that until now we are live since we started the project in April when they co when carved arrived, we launched it in June and we kind of try to put to make sure that everything is working and then we will definitely add more and more layers to make sure that we support the different audiences in the community. Thank you. Okay. Any other committee members, okay, catherine. Oh just one, just one question. Sorry Kate. I feel like we're in the forever catherine bucket just one question: with materials and sustainability. What's your approach to your packaging, I know you said you try to condense it to one box and that's probably an alternative to the to the Amazon model. Can you just speak to that part of the business sure? So what we do is that when, when we attend, when we kind of close the orders, we have people from the community, we make sure that the people that serve that Brooklyn store are from Brooklyn like this. Is our you know if you, if you just to give you an idea like if Walmart opened an everything store and they have their own team, our team is because we do n't have a physical, it's more like operational store, a team. So we make sure that all this team is from the city that we operate in means like Brooklyn and what we do. We have a team that go to pick up all the bags like the businesses do the fulfillment. They prepare bags with the orders and now sorry got it. I was just saying I was. I was mistaking your order fulfillment center, for a place that you also do some assembly, so that's helpful to know no yeah, so just to so we collect all those bags into one centralized location and there we do sorting like we take three bags from three different stores. Put it in one box. That is the order for the customer, and we deliver that from there. So after the sorting that we aggregate them together, because customer can order from three different store, we send it in one box to the customer we deliver. We do n't, do shipping and stuff like that right. I think the just to follow up on the question, just in terms of aggregating supplies from multiple stores that there would be an emphasis on not collecting more material in the process, but I think that's on your sorting side that you'd, probably just reuse the materials that you receive from you to the store internally, exactly okay. Before I let you go with it, we have a request of from the chat whether or not the cards your gift cards are available. Sorry, I can not hear. Are your gift cards available yet, yes, sure I will send you a link to the gift cards. It's now in a digital, it's digitally now, but we are working also to get it physically. So we want our store to start to sell them. We can give them also to other organizations to sell them. If you have ideas, one of the most important thing for us- and maybe it's a place- you can help. We want to approach corporates and companies that also buying gift cards for the holidays and ask them to give this year that those gift cards- okay, perfect! Thank you. Okay, if any yeah, I will put, I will put the gift card. Thank you. If any community members want to ask questions, please put it in the chat. Kate ca, n't hurt hello. Okay, we ca n't, hear you still ca. N't hear you do n't hear me! No, not true it! Your would. Could you speak? Please: okay, you're unmuted, but we ca, n't, hear you. So it's probably a connection issue feel free to type in the chat we ca. N't hear you I'm sorry, okay, a question from the chat, a person is saying. Basically, this is a terrific. Thank you for your present presentation. We have a very vibrant movement of organizations here, addressing Amazon related working issues. Are you engaging with them at all? Have you reviewed your model? Have they reviewed your model? Sorry, no! I do n't know them, but I'm happy to learn more if someone wants to connect us. Okay also have a question: are all your stores only brick and mortar stores, or do you also work with stores that are online, so we work with everybody that has inventory in Brooklyn? Okay. So if you have yeah, if you have you sell online and you have you the inventory in your house or in a warehouse, because that's also fine, because we need to pick the items so as long as we can pick the items around Brooklyn, it works okay from Miss Yearwood, okay. She says this is great. How are you doing outreach to consumers in the community to raise awareness, and how can we help that's great question what we do today? We do a lot of social activities, people sharing that with their friends and stuff like that, and the businesses that work with are sharing that the way that you can help. So every help is amazing and whatever you can use from the kit and I'm happy to do a separate conversation with whoever want, like whatever you can promote, share it on social help, us to sell like happy to know what channels you have to the community. I'm sure that you have great channels. We can put a plan together how you can help us to do that, the same as we work with the business improvement district as long as all of us will push it out, I'm sure that we will make a much better impact faster, okay, yeah, and we accept all the credit cards yeah, perfect. Okay, now being that this is an employment committee. Okay, let's look at the employment aspect of it. Okay, are you going to be looking to hire locally, and I understand you have a very good wage. If that's the case, is that true yeah? So yes, so we have actually, the company has, I will say, like headquarter people that they are more like building their own platform, and then we have the Brooklyn store team that operate whatever is going on in Brooklyn. Okay, you need to understand that we as a company, see Brooklyn as the first city that we operate. This model we're going to launch in Manhattan and we got a lot of cities that are interested in that model. So we as Brooklyn can be really proud of the innovation that we can bring to the country and what I'm so, every I'm explaining that because I have developers and product people, some of them are from Brooklyn. Some of them are not, but everybody does is working for the store for the fulfillment for the orders for the delivery working with the businesses in Brooklyn, everybody is from Brooklyn, so we take people from the community to work to operate the store. Okay, that's related to that related to the delivery people. We really care to pay them fairly and we promote also what we do. We want to be very transparent. It's a decision that we have decided it's not usual, but we've decided to be very open and honest and we pay delivery people 25 an hour and by the way I want to explain why we can do that. Okay, when you build the company, you need to make some decision. As long. I have decided that we will let the community to work together as long as you guys are promoting the real estate players, like I'm talking with developers like two three that want to promote it now to their tenants in Manhattan we have the Rudin family and Silverstein the big developers that working behind that and want to promote it. So as long as the community working together, two great things are happening. One we do n't need to pay tons of marketing and take crazy fees from the businesses, because everybody you know that we have much lower costs and also by the way, the building as long as the building promoting that and we get more density of packages, that's reduce our cost of delivery and allow us to pay more to the delivery people. Okay. So there are a lot of thoughts about how we built and that's also the opportunity that we see like bring everybody together to push that to drive the commerce in New York through that platform will allow us to make to create a really great platform for commerce. So those are the reason why and we make money on every transaction. We make sure we are backed by investors to help us to build that platform at the beginning, but we make sure that we try to be profitable on every transaction and the decision to go through those channels and to harness the community to work together. Allow us to really create that model and be fair and open and transparent. That's exactly what I like to hear. Okay, any other questions for committee. Members has the camera on so, okay, one more time, I'm taking my time any more questions from committee members or board members Mr Flannoy there is a meisha submitted, a question in chat. The question is: do you or will you eventually have an app? No, not yet we do. N't have an app, but people can shop. Our store is responsive on mobile means, like you can shop on mobile web. Okay. Excellent! Thank you very much. Okay. This has been very exciting and I like to see this expand beyond Brooklyn, but for right now, Brooklyn's very happy yeah. Let's stay in Brooklyn, let's bring. Let's do together, Brooklyn as an excellent model for cities around the country and beyond. I think every city needs something like that. I'm happy to know who is the person that I can continue the conversation with I'm happy that you gave me the opportunity to share it with you, I'm happy to continue to work with whoever and which is part of the Community Board, to allow us to scale and have a great holiday for our businesses? Yes, what I would suggest you do is this continue sending in information to the board office, I'm going to invite you back again in a couple months to see where you are as far as your progress as far as the business is concerned- and I know you should put a link in the chat in regards to is that about how to be hired or is that a story about your pay scale? Sorry, I hey there's a link in chat, yeah, that's linked to our story, but I put the link in the chat to the store. I put the link and chat to the gift card. If I want to work for you, how do I go about doing that? If you want to work fast, you need to write this to support the email on the website. Okay, fair enough, just wo n't! Let people know that because that's a decent living wage, yeah, okay and one last question and I'll. Let you go because we have other things on the agenda. What's your catchment? Okay as far as deliveries, so we open it to all Brooklyn all of Brooklyn, yeah, okay, fair enough! We started we started and actually again, I'm not sure this is. This is the time, but I'm happy to schedule time with the with the board office, because I think we can talk more about how we can help some neighborhoods that we have less access. Maybe you have access. I know that I'm happy to understand more about your activities and we can see what specifically we can do together to really help the community to know about exactly the area that you cover so and we can share with you about our work with the business improvement district in that area. So maybe there's a great things that we can do together. We can definitely do that offline, okay, perfect and guys. If you decide ty, you can share my email with everybody. So if you decide to share to try the platform, you are welcome to give me feedback. We are really want to hear more and more because that's how we make it better. Okay, thank you, Mia. Okay, thank you, you're, free to stay for the rest of the meeting. If you wish, I'm actually need to go to take care of my kids. Now, that's my that's my second job. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much guys bye-, bye, okay. This now leads us into the chairperson's report. Okay, excuse me: Mr Flinnoy, hello. Yes, I hear you okay. I text you to you're breaking up Miss Peterson you're breaking up yeah, so you Peterson, I said I am. I do n't know why am I clear, you're clear now? Yes, okay, good evening, everyone pardon my tardiness. It's nice to see all of you and I'm just letting you know that I'm in the meeting, okay welcome Ms Peterson, I you did mention you were running a little late and I'm glad you made it managed to attend. Thank you thanks. Okay for the chairperson's report, okay, we're looking at right now is I'm gon na first take a look at taking care of the one piece of business that we need to take care of, and that's the basic the district needs. Okay, so we need to review the district needs that we have, that our work group has put together and we have to itemize them as far as priority. Okay, we have 19 items on the agenda. I doubt very much we're going to get all 19 items. Okay approved for the district as a whole, so what we need to do is provide have a pri prioritize them, okay, as far as which ones we want to have as far as the top six and then the bottom six okay, so we can do that, six, seven, okay, so hey! If you can put on the list itself, so we can take a look at it. Okay, here are the items that we're currently reviewing. Okay for the agenda we've sent this out to you. Hopefully you had a chance to take a look at it now, each one of the items on here. Okay, we have this is from previously okay, and this is where they are there any items on here that people may feel need to be removed from the current sheet. So can you guys hear me now? Yes, all right great headphone issues. Sorry so the ones in column h if these are prior priorities that could either be rolled forward or removed or adjusted. I've noted you know what I think we were thinking or the and reflecting the feedback that we've gotten from the agencies in the past. So any of the ones that have removed in this column should definitely be taken off. I do n't know if you're 19 counted those no 19 did not count those. This is what was already been from the previous year yeah. So those so the removes should be taken off and then the other ones. You know we should decide whether we want to cont those to continue as priorities and where they should be ranked exactly okay, so we're looking at right now, if we're looking to remove, provide and expand business, education and business entrepreneurs, why do you wish to have that removed? Okay? So the yeah, the agency response is in column g, so either the ones that are removed either. They've said you know: it's been completed like the provider expand business, education, that's been completed, or you know, OMB already has you know, supported the agency. Oh, the agency has already tried to accommodate it. Omb supports it. So again, it's sort of it's already been addressed. Others you know that are that we should remove it's. Sometimes the agency says like this is n't, actually a budget request, so you know it's not in line the working group has basically decided because of either because they've been already funded, completed or they're, not actually items that are appropriate for this particular request. Okay have been removed, okay, so we still have one here, two items from previously expand tax incentive and provide expand, assistance to obtain licenses permits and registers for mwbes. Okay, those are still on the list. Correct, yeah, the or they can be yeah. We can. We can either just decide to roll them forward or decide they're, not priorities. I believe you also added one too yeah everything below. So, if you scroll down taya everything's starting at, I guess it's line, maybe back up at line seven wherever in column h, it says, discuss adding to budget priorities. These are so many of these items we did discuss last year when we went through this process, but they just for whatever reason did n't make it into the actual budget. Priority spread sheet from the for the ranking at the community board level, so we've re some of them, we've adjusted, but we've they're, mostly just things that we discussed as a committee last year for those of us who were involved and then there are several that we added through our discussions in the working group this okay year. Okay, is up, for you know, debate and discussion, okay, excellent, okay, so we can do this two ways: okay, one way, we can actually discuss this now, okay, as a committee, and go through each item. Okay or what we can do is we can actually do this separately, where each person can rank okay each one of the different requests themselves as far as priority one through 19., okay, and basically decide from that, and then you can send that in to both myself and the secretary and the our co- chair and the board office, and we can then basically sort them out and basically tabulate, which ones have become priorities based on your actual indications. So first, let's go over to the actual request. Okay, so that everyone understands what they're about hey bill, I do n't think we've added anything since we reviewed them at the last meeting. There was only one that's been added since the last meeting. Do we maybe just in for expediency? Do we want to just review that one item? Yes, you know what let's review that one item and if, in fact, there's anything else as far as questions about the items that have been listed, we'll go over at that I mean so. I also did actually now that I think so. I added the two items. If we go to the bottom tia, I'm sorry Taya did, I just say your name right. You did. I was with hey yeah, just making sure I have n't talked to you in a month, so you know for second meeting just making sure before it gets too rude. You know to ask so denise the item that we had discussed about training. I made sure to add that so that's line 23 so fund a grant program for non- profits, providing career transition service, retaining or re- skilling programs and or internship and apprentice programs for low- income residents and residents laid off or furloughed due to Covid-19., and so I think we all liked this one, because it feels like a really well- rounded ask that it's not just supporting the individuals who have been affected by Covid-19, but also our local nonprofit community who's, having issues gaining funding in grant programs due to the economic restrictions that are facing a lot of non- profits right now and then line 24. I recently just read an article or a study that basically said that by 2020, eighty percent of black and brown individuals will be wo. N't be eligible for most white collar jobs due to lack of technology training. I found the study really compelling and I thought that this was something that we might consider adding and again. I liked the idea of funding it through nonprofits, who are already doing this type of training, but also can probably use the additional funding to support that work, and I think those are the only two that have been added since we last spoke. Okay, thank you. Lizzy yeah, no problem. Okay, so committee are members any questions about what's currently on the sheet. As far as the reasons these expense requests are currently listed, I ca n't hear you bill. You ca, n't, hear me: okay, currently, committee members are there any items that are currently requests? Expense requests are currently on the the sheet. Okay, that you have any questions about. I just have a question about the potential items that were added. I think this might have been even last year, but the the 360, the neighborhood 360 program. I guess maybe someone that's more familiar with that through the New York City Small business services can provide a little more context to what exactly we're asking for as part of these sure, Jessica. So Sbs came and gave us a presentation last year on this program and it was n't a program that was fully funded. They piloted it in three neighborhoods and they found that it was immensely successful. Based on the feedback that we got on items that were like not online budget items, I broke it up into the different pieces, but basically the program does a commercial district needs assessment, identifies ways to fund improvements within the neighborhood through merchant, organizing, through local development, and also through the funding of nonprofits, and then funded fellows, to support different programs within the neighborhood to enact the changes that they find within the needs assessment, and so I thought it was a really well- rounded program due to the budget cuts this year. I did n't see that it was funded this year, and I you know I just. I thought it was a really good, well-, rounded program. It is something that we voted to include last year and I wanted to make sure that it was provided as an opportunity this year. I know that assessments do n't really seem like as important as some of the other thing. More immediate needs that we're seeing due to the hardship that our community is facing from Covid-19, but I would argue that every assessment that we've done in the last five years is no longer helpful, and so I think it's time to take a look at what our community is experiencing due to Coca-19, to really understand the impact that it's having on businesses so that we can address them. You know, I think that generally we know, but at the same time you know what type of businesses have moved here from Manhattan like I I'd like to get a better sense of that. I'd like to get a better sense of the of what sectors have suffered the most, because I think what we find is that, like we know the larger trends across the five boroughs, but we also know that certain boroughs can skew. Those results in terms of like some neighborhoods are going to be affected differently than others, and I think it could be helpful just to at least discuss if this is a one of our top priorities, or maybe it's somewhere in the middle or the bottom, but it might be worth that discussion. No, I definitely the programs that the small Business services branch of government deaf offers through this. It makes sense to me just again. I did n't realize I guess that they were underfunded and that this was going to be to get full funding such that it could be implemented in the neighborhood. So thank you that helps yeah no trouble. I mean just so everyone's aware, so the New York City's cutting nine billion dollars from the budget. This year, they've already cut seven billion. One billion was from police funding and the remainder has been from social services and programs. There's a two billion dollar gap right now that they're still trying to fill, and they say that one billion of that is going to come from labor and the other billion is going to come from resources and other programs. So we know that there are more cuts coming and we know that there are going to be layoffs in the city. We just do n't know the full economic impact of that. Yet any other questions. Currently I just have a comment: Mr Clinoid, that is when we talk about priorities. There are a number of you know. We have the small businesses out there that need help. We have people who will need help in terms of you know: employment and or re- employment and or future employment, and whatever Sec open or available. And then you have the training component. So I think I was just sitting here thinking that whatever the priorities are for me, there has to be a direct link, and I think I mean the last meeting has to be a direct link to the to the people that are impacted and have been not just because Covid-19 they've been impacted for a long time for many years in terms of various opportunities in whatever areas that they may be, and I keep bringing back the training and apprenticeship and we are the economic development and employment committee, and if we really define what that means for us that can be, can always help in a direction trying to establish some priority. As to you know what we think the needs are. There are clearly parts of the community that are have different issues. You know from public housing to other areas of community board too, so we try to balance it, and we also want to try to make sure other people do have the opportunity, but the greater me and immediate impact whatever that means in this place, where we are right now or that whatever it is that they can get to attach to that is something that's useful, that'll be tangible, that'll put them in a position to fit in terms of whatever opportunities. You know that there will be. You know this and I, when I'm moving around the community, I see construction is still going on and they're building and doing more buildings and that sort of has opened up. Certainly I'm not aware of you know who is advocating for people to be able to know what those opportunities so that they can go wherever they need to go to try to benefit from what's happening at a over there by Barclay Center, what's happening over there on atlantic and vanderbilt and Clinton what's happening in other locations throughout Cb2. So I just wanna, you know, make sure and hope that we are connecting the dots in a way that that's meaningful and impactful to people who have for so long to been on the side of not being extended or not being able to attach on to. You know some of the things that that's out there that have resumed. So that's you know I'm I may have you know kind of been redundant, but I think I I've made the point. Hey denise. I think that's a really good point and I actually was wondering: did anyone on the call get a chance to participate in the public hearing? I unfortunately missed it, and I was wondering if there were any items that came up there, that we are missing or that should be adding that came directly from the community, because I think, as a working group, we really did our best to research these items and come up with things that were thoughtful and supportive of all the different groups that this committee represents. But it's not the same as hearing directly from the community things that are going to help them directly hi lindsay. This is tia from the office. There were no items elevated by the public at the public hearing. You are welcome to review the youtube video of that very brief experience. I have a suggestion and an offer Mr Flanagan, if you'd, like probably end of day tomorrow, if you'd like, we could send these out as a ranked choice, Google Poll so folks could just click and drag and put them in the order that they like, and then we can compile that data that might make voting a bit easier. Yes, I was going to suggest that, but I did n't want to give you too much work to do. That's the offer that's offered it. I will accept. There are, however, individuals who do not have access to computers. To do that. I think we'll be able to make a Google form. That's successful on cell phone. Okay, if you can do that, how does the committee feel about that? I think that's a great idea. Is there anyone opposed to it hey tia, while you're going through? I let's finish this yeah okay? Is there anyone opposed to it? Okay, there's! No one! That's opposed to it. Can you give us a deadline on when this has to be completed by well? That would be a question for district manager Paris. So I think if we got it done by the end of the week, I'm sure it would be fine how about we get it in by by Thursday the latest yeah I'll. Send you guys a test tomorrow? Okay, excellent, okay and just cc me, so I can look at the results. Also, okay, so that's what we're going to be doing people we're going to do a google. What this exact word to use too it'll just be a really slick, little form where you can review each of the requests and explanations and then you'll be able to click and drag and put them in your ranked order. Okay, excellent! Thank you. I appreciate that. So I think that the ones that we're discussing whether to add or remove, would almost be like a different category where the voting option should just be you retain or remove the item, if that, if that works, and then I had some concerns that were missing agencies, so basically we're allowed to direct these priorities to multiple agencies, and if you see glaringly that we could add another agency because they do n't send it to those agencies, unless we specifically cite them- and I kind of felt like we should cast a wider net with some of them and see like maybe different agencies have different budgets that they can find a way to support them. Okay, well, Lizzy. What will happen basically is this at the exec committee meeting. What we're going to be doing is we're going to be going through every company's ask, and not all of our ass will be listed so after they're all listed. I think at that point we can then do the work. Okay and as far as the items that we are saying to remove will be removed because for various reasons, everything else needs to be rent hey bill. I think that once it goes to executive and they boot on it, I do n't think we're allowed to edit it after that was my concern as far as agencies. We can actually add agencies, okay, as long as you're here, Mr Flonay. This is tea again. I wonder if maybe one of the layers of transparency, that's missing from this conversation is that the other committees have also gone through this, a similar deliberation process. So, for example, for some reason, ed, E and Yucca are the only two committees that have added to this folder. But, for example, these are the priorities reviewed by the Yucca Committee. So I wonder if it would be helpful at some point in this process, and forgive me this is my first year doing this with you all. I wonder if it would be helpful at some point for there to be sort of a master spreadsheet where all of the committee's priorities are collected for review. I think that will be done just before the exec committee. Okay, because we'll be going the chairs and co- chairs well, the chairs will be actually sitting down at the exec committee, making the final decision, okay for the full board, because as we're not having board meetings as of yet, I believe, okay with that, okay, I will end the discussion unless anyone else has any questions. Okay, I'll now continue. Okay, with my chairpersons report, okay, two things of two items: okay, I've been asked by the board chair that any request to the board office only goes through myself or the co- chair. Okay, nothing is to be made directly to the board office. It has to go through myself and the co- chair. Okay. Second, okay. I've been asked by the chairperson, okay, the board chair; basically, anyone who's doing any type of outreach, such as myself. I am a representative on the board of the Cls bid. Okay, whenever the Cls bid meets, I'm now asked to give a report to the borough office, so it can be now become a part of the district manager's report. So if anyone is participating in any organizations- okay, that's in our district, okay and representing the board. Okay, I would ask you to please submit okay, a report to the board office so that the entire board can be made aware of it. Okay, any questions, okay ron: this is directed towards you also because you're on also on one of the bids, business improvement, districts. Okay, I also have met with some of the bids in the area talk to them and what we're looking at right now across the board is a number of individuals and stores are closing and they will probably not reopen. Okay, there's quite a few vacancies. Currently right now, that's occurring throughout all the business improvement districts and some stores are actually attempting to maintain stay viable, but this is becoming very difficult, which is why I feel that our ask for requests for the budget is something that I'm going to push very strongly for, because these small businesses need to be made continue to be viable. As you all know, century 21 just is in the process of closing okay and that's a substantial it's a company that is representative of quite a few employees in the area that now are going to be unemployed and a lot of the smaller companies are all small businesses are also struggling. So I think this is something that's important that we actually focus on that. In regards to that, I actually attended the downtown Brooklyn partnership that had a resilience webinar and basically, we had several companies basically discuss the reasons why they are what they're trying to do to maintain their business and grow and also what things they, what ass they are having for the district to help them actually continue to stay viable, believe it or not. What they were asking for was more bike lanes, because a lot of people are no longer using the subway to get around because of Covid-19, so they're asking for more bike lanes and also for more parking for bicycles and also parking for cars. In addition, they're asking for some additional information as far as helping people with the actual viability as far as doing telecommuting. Okay, that's something a lot of people are doing right now and they're asking for that. We actually have companies moving into the area. One of the companies that are moving into the area is curve Uk curve. Uk is a fintech company and they're, currently moving into downtown Brooklyn and not Manhattan, and the reason they're moving into downtown Brooklyn is because were cost-, effective, okay and also they still have access to all the talent that they would need currently right now, they're looking to hire 185 people, okay, so that gives you an idea that people still find New, York City a place of commerce to come to actually establish themselves. So we still see Brooklyn as a major hub for individuals coming to do business, and that's something that's substantial and I think everyone should be made aware of that because, as was just presented at the meeting, there are companies that are actually thriving in this environment. If you know how to do it, okay- and that is my chairperson's report- Ms Peterson- do you have any any updates as far as the resource Fair Miss Peterson? Are you still there miss Peterson? We ca n't, hear you, we still ca, n't hear you miss Peterson, go ahead and speak. You are unmuted. Okay, we ca n't, hear her right now: okay, Miss Pierce! If you can join us later on I'll, be fine. Okay right now we ca n't, hear you, okay. That brings us to other business. Is there any other business from the committee members that they like to bring up right now? So I know you mentioned the downtown Brooklyn and again I do n't. I do n't know, what's the latest with them, I have n't really been. I had more of a relationship with talking read, but once upon a time, some of downtown Brooklyn's biggest landlords sat on the board of the downtown Brooklyn partnership, not sure if that's still the same, but I was wondering what is as I've seen, stores showing down and thinking about. Small businesses has to brought downtown Brooklyn partnership and they, if they have n't spoken with these landlords, some of them being their own board members about working with tenants right now to keep them in Brooklyn. Do you know? Can you talk on that? Do you know anything about it? Can we find out if you do n't sure my issue? Basically all of the bids are currently in conversations with the tenants and also the actual owners of the actual buildings themselves. So that's an ongoing process. Okay, I just wanted to make sure that they were working on that, because you know that's another way. We can help the community help the small businesses and not have downtown Brooklyn turn into a ghost town. Again, yes, that's an ongoing process. Okay! Thank you. Mrs Gilman. I think this is maybe the right time to share this, but just wanted to shout out that there's going to be a Brooklyn art walk starting October, 17th and 18th along Atlantic Ave, and it's going to be basically a replacement of what was the Atlantic antic for the year in a Covid-19 safe way. So it's going to go from basically 4th ave all the way to the water and it's going to feature local Artisan makers in the windows of vacant storefronts and I've been working with just on the side with arts, Gowanus and some groups of local artist collectives and we're putting you know, muralists to work on some rule gates and some really interesting stuff. So hopefully it really comes through, but it'll basically be October 17th to November, 2nd and 3 of the big real estate developers. Who've been sitting vacant for the last three to five years on Atlantic have committed to putting community artists in the window and we hope it's the start of a longer term effort to do that and all these artists are going to be able to sell their work directly through a website. So if people are walking down the street and they see the work, they can kind of follow a link to it as well as there's been community design flyers going around to collect community artwork, that's going to go on things like the tree pits and on poster campaigns. So we'll see how it goes, but keep your eyes peeled for Atlantic Avenue between the 17th of October and November 2nd, and it's coordinated by art scholars by the Atlantic bid by the Ldc and by some kind of residents in the area trying to put stuff together to add vibrancy to the street. So it could be a good example of speaking to vacancy with local talent and local voice and trying to get some money for local makers to sell their stuff in a pandemic. Safeway. Okay, thank you. Okay. I see that is now currently in the chat, as well as the Myrtle Avenue bid annual reports, also in the chat. Okay. Thank you. Okay, any other business hey bill. It's lindsay. I just wanted to remind everyone that the census deadline got pushed. So if you have n't filled out your census, you have till October 31st. Also the city and both political parties are still looking for poll workers, as you can imagine it's hard to get people who are young and healthy and able to meet. This really important need to keep our polls open on election day. So, if anyone's interested, you can take a look at the board of election site, it is a paid position if you take the four hour, training and work one day, you're paid for the training as well as for the day, and so that's a really great opportunity for anyone who's in between jobs. Right now also there's still jobs as contact chasers for the city. It does require a bachelor degree at the moment, but they're still hiring aggressively and they're really good- paying jobs so for anyone who's. Looking for that yeah, you should look into it. Okay, thank you. Lindsay you're, always a wealth of information. I appreciate that okay Community forum, okay, this is where the community has an opportunity to speak for two minutes. Is there anyone interested in speaking, Mr, Flonai, Ron Cohen has his hand raised. Oh ron, you can hear me, I do not have my hand raised. I did not raise it. Maybe somebody raised it for me. Okay, well ron good to hear you yeah. Okay, thank you on Ron. You heard me talk about that. We're going to be needing reports from you as far as the downtown Brooklyn partnership when they meet yes, okay, thank you, Ron! Okay, let's see now, if there's no one for the community forum that now brings us to approval of the minutes. Okay, the minutes were distributed to us all. Thank you very much, catherine. I appreciate the work that you've done. Okay, are there? Is there any corrections to the minutes that need to be done? Okay, are there is anyone who has any disapproves of the minute? Okay hearing, none, okay, we'll just we'll just buy the minutes of it, approved okay, that we have to vote on it, but just basically make sure there's no mistakes. Okay, with that, if there's no more business and no more discussion I'll entertain a motion to Adjourn so moved. Thank you. Ron Second is Miss Yearwood, actually, we'll give it to Jessica. Okay, all in favor all right. Thank you very much. I truly enjoy seeing you all. Okay be safe and please make sure you get the reports in by Thursday, so we can actually have this itemized and actually ranked so that we have. I can actually sit down with the executive committee and actually fight for the ones that we definitely want to have. I need to know this. Okay. Thank you. Okay, with that meetings adjourned at 7, 25 of anyone with some conversation discuss anything with me. You know where to reach me. Thank you. I guess.
