I. Do note that the and Miss church and made it clear at our meeting that the that the district office was no longer requesting requiring that signatures be gathered for applications during the Covid-19 time because of the social distancing components that come up in that regard.
The owner indicated that he would that he would completely adhere to social, distancing and mass wearing guidance that and the original time for closing the outdoor space, which was originally proposed at 12 midnight, was shortened to 10 P.M, seven days, a week, which was more in keeping generally with the standards that we would like to see from outdoor service in really any community, and particularly this block, which seems to be a very residential block by nature.
It's really a virtue of what you believe in that regard, I think you know the applicant did express a desire to be to be cooperative and engaging with the with the community, and that should be noted as well, so that was the that was the first application that we heard that was approved.
They were supportive of local hiring and they provided some signatures of support They agreed that if there were any concerns from the community that they would work with the with the community and but there were no concerns expressed by any members of the community for this application and it was approved by a vote of six zero.
We were not apprised of any complaints that have been filed in regards to liquor store in terms of you, know, with the authorities or with with the board office Mr Perez.
I entertain a motion to accept the recommendation from the health environment and Yes, we're good next committee to report We have two items that both were approved by the committee.
We like the work that was presented and we approved it : If there's nothing else, I'll move on to the item, it is 135 Plymouth Street in Dumba, in the Dumbo neighborhood historic district.
Any objection with taking both items, as presented in one vote, I'll, entertain a motion to accept the committee's presentation by Mr Gordon Motion to accept second, ms.
What, downtown Brooklyn partnership was doing, is working with the developer to take the very narrow street sidewalks on Hoyt and Elm, which are currently only eight feet wide and increasing them to allow for more pedestrian space, as well as streetscape furniture and they're.
There was no discussion, but that's a good point Rob, and maybe we can bring that up to downtown Brooklyn partnership too As far as the street itself on Hoyt.
There are clearly some things that we need to enhance, particularly for those who may from time to time not get the full personal response that you would get in the past when four people were sitting in the office, but I would honestly say from my purview: there's been no real degradation in how we respond to community issues as they come up.
That is the office, and so I want to thank Rob for continually coming in, And I appreciate him for his leadership and for the entire staff and the way they've been able to perform during this pandemic.
This meeting will now have a formal agenda because we are going to continue to perform, has been governed by the motion and the vote that was put forth, that we act on behalf of the entire board, but I I want to inform the entire body what we've done so far, and we may have one agenda item, but if nothing else, I anticipate this to be a relatively short meeting, but definitely a meeting that is needed to take place so that we can possibly hear of items that we may not be aware.
That may require our action and our focus as the exact committee, but, like I said, more importantly, just to have a wellness and a checkup with the members that make up community board 2.
I do not want to be mayor now, ever, but particularly, not now, This is a decision that requires a vote, and so what I'd like to do is entertain a motion that would support community board 2, making a decision to not voluntarily lay off staff.
Physician support is what I've learned from the staff meetings is that Rob has managed the team in a way that each of the four members who make up the district office have a focus on a different assignment, and I think, as a to wanted to try something different, a way to kind of communicate to everyone.
As far as you know, all board members committee.
You happen to be a non- member of the executive committee and if you have questions or if you have a particular item that you want to bring to our attention, this is the opportunity to do.
