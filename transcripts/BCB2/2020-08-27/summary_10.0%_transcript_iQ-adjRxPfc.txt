You figure out who's, who thank you and has everyone had a chance to review the minutes from june 22nd from the last exec committee, meeting?
But, there definitely seemed to be some concern and, over the course of the meeting, several residents expressed their concerns about the liquor store and about the this operator Opening in an establishment in response, the owner indicated that he would that he would completely adhere to social, distancing and mass wearing guidance that and the original time for closing the outdoor space, which was originally proposed at 12 midnight, was shortened to 10 pm Seven days a week, which was more in keeping generally with the standards that we would like to see from outdoor service in really any community, and particularly this block, which seems to be a very residential block by nature.
The ultimate vote on this was believe four in favor two opposed and no abstentions, The opposition of which I was a member, was largely based in concern for whether from kent performance with the liquor store I think you know the applicant did express a desire to be to be cooperative and engaging with the with the community, and that should be noted as well.
It's been open for about two years, they're trying to establish it as a venue for cocktails with kind of a speakeasy like vibe They were supportive of local hiring and they provided some signatures of support and they agreed that if there were any concerns from the community that they would work with the with the community and but there were no concerns expressed by any members of the community for this application, and it was approved by a vote of six zero The third application that we heard is 154 carlton avenue back to the same block as that first application, but on the other side of the block down near the corner of myrtle, this is a location known as taqueria fort greene, It they're, going to be open from the 11 am to 10 pm during the week and 11 am to 2, am on weekends.
As all three were presented hearing, none I entertain a motion to accept the recommendation from the health environment and social service committee singletary I 'll Second obama is five bush all in favor Yes we're good next committee to report We have two items that both were approved by the committee First one is 295 cumberland street in for the fourth green historic district, and the application was to remove a existing rear deck and construct a full width Is it rear yard extension at the garden level and at the rooftop, and also with a rooftop deck and then stairs to the rear yard and modify the side lights at the at the at the front level at the sidelight, and also at the where we have it?
You know the people doing the construct or propose people going to construction and, if there's any further work that may affect the neighbors that they will inform the neighbors of that as well : If there's nothing else, I'll move on to the item, it is 135 plymouth street in dumba in the dumbo neighborhood historic district This is an application to put up a sign for the Brooklyn public library.
I think I heard you say it was approved six one, three: six, yes, seven, eight, nine yeah, six, one three by the committee, so that means four people weren't like that happy about it Can you state what their concerns were again notified the notification of the the neighbors that the work you know would be affect the work that may have some effect that with the neighbors I, think thank you Are there any additional questions from committee members hearing none?
It was mostly placard parking anyway, and this was approved by the committee unanimously Any questions for julia on the presentation for 11th white The timeline for this I believe that the development is already open, so they've already got some of the first tcos I just had a question, miss colin chung, so there's traffic on elm and hoyt street.
Put you on hdtv, but I didn't want people to know that, regardless of your taste that you were definitely on that home Our last meeting in march, emotion was made second unanimously approved that the executive committee for as long as community boards were remote, would act on behalf of the entire community board and so what we, what we essentially did was take on taken our summer policy and extended it and What I've asked the office to do is send out an invitation and on september 9th.
So I just wanted to give an update on the rest of our committee meeting for transportation and public safety The discussion on chair singletary that you had started and we continued it in the framework of our statement of district needs with an eye to social justice and criminal justice.
I just wanted to ask, as far as you know, all board members committee members at this time are in good health.
