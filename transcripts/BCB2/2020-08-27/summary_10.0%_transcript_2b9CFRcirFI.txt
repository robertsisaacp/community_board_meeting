So people can see the agenda So after the 11 point presentation and then, after our discussion with policy advocate brandon holmes, I've invited brandon smith from the the health and human services committee to speak to us about community courts.
In light of our discussion of the statement of district needs and budget priorities So, if I could get an approval of that amended agenda, I agree: I'm, the senior landscape architect at brk, inglesburg I know that you all are really familiar with downtown Brooklyn, so we're gonna.
It gives a little bit of identity and we spent a lot of time really working on the planting to sort of it's a nice situation where hoyt is full shade and livingston is part, sun and heart, shade So, there's really an articulation we can have with the planting and elm street can be really colorful, since it's part, sun part shade, whereas white would be a little bit more green and then this is just a view to summarize The downtown Brooklyn partnership told us a couple months ago that you guys were going to bring more open space, more greenery, more greenery and more color to downtown Brooklyn you're, finding opportunities to really bring that plant to life, and it wasn't just pretty pictures We really appreciate that those opportunities that you're finding and dlt that you're open to this non-standard Brooklyn, the builder's pavement plan also really great to see this expedited approval and such a cool design too When.
You have more time to talk about the district as a whole, so we could really work together frankly to look at ways to fund and implement over the long term, because we all know that downtown Brooklyn needs.
I need to look at this more because a few different things I would respond to one there's not that many cars on fulton, if not any, because it's a bus way and I think most cars, though just to speak to your question, about 11 hoyt, actually will not be using fulton, because the access to the garage for 11 hoyt is actually mid block if I want to learn more about john, the conflict that john is talking about because the function of fulton street is important to all of us.
The from the picture from eleven point is that all the cars and the developments are actually gonna, be using livingston street and going up to elm to access that garage Let us get back to the committee on this item, because I certainly want to learn more from john about what he's talking about with the nevin street subway, because you know the nearest subway here is hoyt street.
If there's any more comments on eleven white, maybe from community board members opening it up to people who are not on the committee, you can type in the chat if you'd like to speak-- and you don't see anybody typing in how about members of the public, you can use the raised hand feature Do. We know if the developer is at allowing for a bike parking in their building or just bicycles, not city bike, Would you like to advocate for that on the sidewalk?
Seeing the new york city jail population go from 11 000 to below 4 000 Today, we've heard below 4 000 for the past several months, due to a lot of 19 release, efforts to rapidly just incarcerate our jails and protect people from contracting kovid, and also due to a lot of pre-trial legislative reforms that were passed up in albany, He and I have crossed paths and collaborated in different community spaces.
Before and along with some of you on What I wanted to share with you all is for the past two years, with the close Rikers campaign, we've developed the build communities platform which our team published in 2019 and 2020, and this was done in collaboration with hundreds of directly impacted community members and service providers and experts across all five boroughs to identify key areas where the city could divest from the criminal legal system and begin to invest in local, community-based programs and resources that improve the quality of life Brandon smith is going to talk about his experience with the red hood community, justice or the red hook, community justice, court- and that's you know one of the things that we definitely want to amplify and prioritize and making sure that every community gets access to conflict resolution and alternative to alternatives to incarceration or alternatives to detention.
Those types of resources I currently live in bed, stuy represented by community board three but I'm going to share in the link a link to in the chat to the 2020 report that our team did definitely identifies areas of workforce development, public health consulate resolution and alternative forms of accountability, and also family planning and family support.
The benefit of what would be my dream and about this issue is there would be effectively community courts in every local community in Brooklyn to handle non-violent and misdemeanor crimes that are are of a substantially different nature than the serious crimes that you see, get that go into felony court systems like attempted murders and armed robbery, and such the community court is based around a theory of having one courtroom, one judge and in many areas, particularly in the red hook, community justice center, which is really the best model of a community court that exists.
There is a clinic with licensed social workers who are able to place individuals who are charged with crimes in into different programs that can ultimately be used in the same place of the really just traditional sanctions that exist in criminal law, jail, community service, The value of it, though, is it instead of having the jail a more meaningful experience is exists for the person who's charged, and it goes along with the overall theory of the court, which is more on the problem-solving side than the penalty punishment side of criminal law and when defendants take a plea that exists to and requires them to complete one of these programs, whether it be for mental health services, substance abuse services, maybe anger management or their specialized services for domestic violence, which are which I've seen been be extremely effective and people embrace and really turn their lives around in a remarkable experience.
The crime might be stealing a loaf of bread, but the problem might be a substance, abuse addiction or some other kind of personal issue You know these are the things that kind of make the community court set, setting better down in red hook, They cover three precincts: the 78th precinct, the the 76 precinct and the 72nd precinct sunset park, slope and red hook, and the effect has been documented in several studies as reducing recidivism and and being a cheaper approach, even in the in the sense that you don't that it results in less incarceration.
You have to have a judge, who's willing to give a lot of second chances and to be pretty tolerant, but when you have that kind of a setting and when it's in a community-based atmosphere like I, think one of the big things that drove me to this feeling is that when we were sitting there with the close Rikers hearings last year and having people who come up and talk about their experience at Rikers, one of the real things that hit me was the discussion of how dehumanizing the experience was of being there And when I think about 120 skimmer horn in the traditional court system.
Think from that, you know , the thought would be if we, if we would want to have a community court for the part of our neighborhood and community district 2 to handle the these kind of non-violent or in some cases you have some very like minor, violent cases where you have an assault and somebody doesn't have to go to the hospital or get hurt very bad Sometimes.
They recently had a contract to also provide services and connect with people on Rikers, island and in new york, city jails and I believe this year that may have expired, and also with Covid-19 Gmac is definitely an organization, though, that when you're talking about these alternative conflict resolution models that don't require millions of dollars to be funneled into the NYPD or into jails, This is the kind of group that is a local group that has like trained You, know credible messengers and can do a lot more with that money than the NYPD is able to do.
This committee doesn't necessarily have a mechanism for getting the word out that describes all of the work that you are doing and we need to get much more buy-in from the community My request is for some kind of description or website or some way of knowing what exactly it is that you described that we can share with a larger community, sounds great john and in the chat box, brandon holmes did send a link to a couple links that may be helpful Maybe.
You know have start to focus on that and have our councilman who's still here for a year to who supported pushing through the you know the mega jail plan to start to, let the people in the community have a voice and decide how the funding should be spent sandy is a really good context for us, starting the conversation about the public safety initiatives in our statement of district needs.
Knows the local community making the decisions and being a part of the of those cases, and then it handles the cases all the way through trial, Now you're not going to have jury trials in a in a community court that I think is probably better for a for a downtown court, because it's difficult with getting all the people into a into a jury.
You know you have to give the district attorney's office The court administration You have to get department of corrections on board to get, and it takes a lot of coordination and effort to get the to get a number of people on board with the with the idea and then there's also a non-profit that manages these community courts called the center for court innovation, which they're a really wonderful organization.
But you know they have to be part of the conversation too It is a big process to get a lot of these people speaking to each other, but at the end, if it can work out- and it really has in other parts of the world- there have been these community courts created in places as far away as australia, europe and such that it just it takes a good, a lot of coordination.
So I'm going to now share my screen so that we can get into our district needs, which carol ann, has put into excel form that I just formatted a little bit and added a couple of line items for us to talk about and think about So. The way this is organized is is from our original budget priorities, but it's capital requests for public safety and emergency services.
We could follow up with that transportation and expense request, capital and expense requests and then in the major needs one of the top three issues, of course, being the triple cantilever of the bqe The whole thing by hand so completed, and then noting in terms of public safety and emergency services, In the review of the comstat report during a charge report-- the triple cantilever- and I- think this is more of a statement of transportation and traffic infrastructure that maybe we can look into rewarding a little bit to speak more towards needs in that regard.
I think it would give it much more impact, because I think it's quite important, especially now I suspect, even if we support this it's going to be years in the making similar to we had creation of an elementary school in downtown Brooklyn into the 2004 rezoning We had that as a top priority for many years before, DOE decided to fund a new school in downtown Brooklyn, and that is not going to open until 20 years after the 2004 rezoning If, you know of how the red hook community court center got approved, but the way you explained it seemed like there's so many levels of sort of bureaucracy really to get that we'd have to get through, and really this is just the tip of the iceberg.
I would recommend not linking it to 120 skimmer horn in any way, because I think the whole idea of the community court is to be is to be distinct from the whole criminal court system and no matter how much how they change 120, even if they build a building twice as big You know, parkinson's law is going to apply and the space is going to expand to fill whatever There is so, and because the brandon smith noted that the community court and rental covers three precincts If they're gonna do three precincts in a downtown Brooklyn community court, it's gonna You know towards the towards the 88th and not within the 84th, because the whole idea is to make the community court not a criminal court is to make it a place where you know the criminal aspect of it is not the most important thing.
So this is kind of like when we talk about red hook, community justice center or initiative they them operating that community court This would be like the justice fund that would be established in Brooklyn would be the mechanism that an organization like gmac or like cci or another group would be able to submit an RFP to say we know what type of community-based restorative justice programs would be most successful in this community Therefore like we've applied to this fund in the city of new york, you give it give the resources to us So, that's what cci does and other groups do now around restorative justice programs.
We have not seen a reduction in the workforce of the department of corrections or in the operating budget of the department of corrections, so we're still spending the same amount per year as if we incarcerated eleven thousand new yorkers Even above four thousand this year was the first year we saw a significant decrease in the doc budget, and that was like 200 or 300 million dollars, So right now, there's what I can give you as like a strong number to support your language Is. So our we are actually paying more to staff our jails than we actually have people who are actually detained and incarcerated in our jail When we're talking about where this money can come from, there's very clear sources of where this money can come from, such as you know, the NYPD dominance that were made, the doc demand and the district attorneys are also given money for these specific things.
One thing could be removing police officers from public schools and investing that money and those resources instead in fully staffing guidance counselors- and you know- mental health, supportive services for students in schools , What we saw this year was a popular demand and a lot of movement towards taking 100 out of the NYPD budget and moving it to other community resources.
That city council did to work their way around that, but I think popular demand from many folks, especially parents has been to remove police officers from schools and put the accountability on DOE to hire and staff guidance.
I think there needs to be some sort of school security, but I, don't think it should be on the forum under the police department Now they got reallocated right and that they should also train those people not to just be monitoring the door, but also being there to assist in the social work and stuff like that, so they're really integrated into the school process.
Potentially I would like to say that when we think about new york city for the next 30 years, we're looking at like pockets of organized abandonment and like austere violence across budgets, and so when we think about spending money on police or school security guards instead of services that is doing harm, especially to people who are black and brown I'm, very much in favor of removing all police from schools and removing the security officers in exchange for more counselors, who are also typically women of color.
I still want to see a world without prisons, despite the fact that my family directly profits and makes their income off or it's black or white I do agree with brandon holmes just said, but basically I think you know we shouldn't be looking at taking people's jobs away, but we should be looking at the bigger picture and trying to allocate their job in another way and train them properly, so that they could feel a sense of pride that they are they're doing something that would be a meaningful, but they wouldn't be out of a job.
I'll read it in the meantime, so I have so share Okay, so I have this language, reallocate funding from NYPD support youth programs, increasing economic opportunities, education, internships, job training, health and mental health, social services, initiatives and I You know expanding the opportunities also for first responders for mental health emergencies, prevention of violent crimes you sent something over the Brooklyn da is working on, You, know, I, don't know, I didn't read it yet, but there are more details that I think other people can come up with After packing up the use.
Think oh right, reduce militarization of police I , don't know that it needs to be a different one, but like if they're going to be these other programs and different kinds of police officers, there could be.
They actually issue more in Manhattan They have what's called self enforcement right, but it used to be the trap and what happened with the traffic enforcement people used to get in the fight for the police department As. You know the police department's armed I think you also told me about like a new technology that they're working on where once they scan the placard or the license plate, it is automatic that is on.
Removing that item actually but totally open to I mean this connects into the pro the possible additions to discuss because, like I, think that traffic and placard people we're thinking about who aren't necessarily police are the ones who would care about pedestrian bike safety So those are different they're, not traffic enforcement officers, so they're crossing guards, and they only put them by schools.
Think it's a more tangible local thing about the project, and actually there are lots of park spaces that can benefit from bqa You know all the way up to sand street incorporate A little bit incorporate public art and park and green space in the redesign of the bqe entrances and exits Something like that.
