The meeting of the transportation and public safety committee of Brooklyn community ward, 2 called to order and is being recorded on the Cv2 youtube archive in accordance with the NYC open meetings.
So after the 11 point presentation, and then, after our discussion with policy advocate Brandon Holmes, I've invited Brandon Smith from the the health and Human Services Committee to speak to us about community courts.
You know we had the pleasure of introducing the idea that downtown Brooklyn partnership was working on a new vision for the core of downtown Brooklyn over the winter, and we spent a lot of time talking to you about our goals.
In light of the health crisis, the idea of adding more sidewalk space and improving our sidewalk space has become more of an imperative for everyone in New York City, as we realize how important it is to social distance and to walk places and bicycle places in lieu of taking transit at this time.
The goals of the study I'll go through very quickly, and this effort you'll remember this from the winter time, where two are to improve the streetscape, establish a stronger sense of place and strength and identity, and we were especially focusing on those areas of downtown Brooklyn that have not seen any improvement literally in over 50 years.
Hoyt presents a very unique opportunity in downtown Brooklyn, because there are no subways underneath the block, so we're able to really focus on expanding sidewalks and providing in- ground planting, which, as Regina said due to the sidewalk with elm in particular.
What we're really here to sort of present to you and to ask of you is we're really looking at widening sidewalks to increase greening and those two things: together: we're kind of creating a distinctive sidewalk which I'll go into more detail about, so something that, as Regina meant, was strengthening the identity and really trying to establish a sense of place in downtown Brooklyn.
You have more time to talk about the district as a whole, so we could really work together frankly to look at ways to fund and implement over the long term, because we all know that downtown Brooklyn, needs.
I, mean, I would say all sidewalks and we probably could not like saying that, but obviously every street would need to be studied and we have to work with Youtube and Regina.
Let us get back to the committee on this item, because I certainly want to learn more from John about what he's talking about with the Nevin Street subway, because you know the nearest subway here is Hoyt.
So, the one on the southern one on Elm is used for the Interior Motor court, as well as the one on points, the other one on Elm. This is their loading dock entrance and the activity, because I maybe I, missed that the activity of the building once it's open and the loading docks and the garages and the you know, traffic, going into the building.
He's worked with numerous organizations in criminal justice and police accountability, and he can tell you more of the specifics about his background and what he's going to do is just give us a little bit of color on what other organizations acrosss the city are doing in the realm of rethinking criminal justice and accountability and civil liberties, and then, after he's done, he will be participating in our discussion of the budget, priorities and statement of district needs and also Brandon Smith is here on to discuss and teach us about the community court system as well all right Everyone.
Then I worked at the New York Civil Liberties Union, where I developed an expertise around police accountability and transparency, advocacy efforts and some on the state level, some work around decarceration and decriminalization, and also advocating to repeal article 58, which until this week effectively hid all law enforcement disciplinary records from the public and now.
What I wanted to share with you all is for the past two years with the close Rikers campaign, we've developed the build communities platform which our team published in 2019 and 2020, and this was done in collaboration with hundreds of directly impacted community members and service providers and experts, acrosss, all five boroughs to identify key areas where the city could divest from the criminal legal system and begin to invest in local community, based programs and resources that improve the quality of life.
And I know, Brandon Smith is going to talk about his experience with the Red Hood Community Justice, or the Red Hook Community Justice Court, and that's you know one of the things that we definitely want to amplify and prioritize and making sure that every community gets access to conflict resolution and alternative to alternatives to incarceration or alternatives to detention.
Some of the top issues you want to address- are, but I'm going to share in the link a link to in the chat to the 2020 report, that our team did definitely identifies areas of Workforce, Development, Public, Health, consulate, resolution and alternative forms of accountability, and also family planning and family support.
So speaking of public safety as public health and rehabilitation, Brandon Smith is the chairperson of the health Environment Human Services Committee, and he is going to speak with us about his professional experience in the community corps, system.
But I want to talk a little bit about community courts and about how they're different than regular courts so that we can think about.
Possibly the benefit of what would be my dream and about this issue is there would be effectively community courts in every local community in Brooklyn to handle non- violent and misdemeanor crimes that are are of a substantially different nature than the serious crimes that you see, get that go into felony court systems like attempted murders and armed robbery, and such the community court is based around a theory of having one courtroom, one judge and in many areas, particularly in the red Hook Community Justice center, which is really the best model of a community court that exists.
There is a clinic with licensed social workers who are able to place individuals who are charged with crimes in into different programs that can ultimately be used in the same place of the really just traditional sanctions that exist in criminal law, jail, community service.
Is it instead of having the jail a more meaningful experience is exists for the person who's charged, and it goes along with the overall theory of the court, which is more on the problem- solving side than the penalty punishment side of criminal law and when defendants take a plea that exists to and requires them to complete one of these programs, whether it be for mental health, services, substance, abuse, services, maybe anger management or their specialized services for domestic violence, which are which I've seen been be extremely effective and people embrace and really turn their lives around in a remarkable experience.
You know these are the things that kind of make the community court set, setting better down in red hook.
They cover three precincts, the 78th precinct, the the 76 precinct and the 72nd precinct sunset, park, slope and red hook, and the effect has been documented in several studies as reducing recidivism and and being a cheaper approach, even in the in the sense that you do not that it results in less incarceration, there's substantial, substantially less people being incarcerated in the time that I spent in the community court.
You have to have a judge, who's willing to give a lot of second chances and to be pretty tolerant, but when you have that kind of a setting and when it's in a community- based atmosphere, Like, I think one of the big things that drove me to this feeling is that when we were sitting there with the close Rikers hearings last year and having people who come up and talk about their experience at Rikers, one of the real things that hit me was the discussion of how dehumanizing the experience was of being there.
Think from that you know , the thought would be if we, if we would want to have a community court for the part of our neighborhood and community district 2 to handle the these kind of non- violent or in some cases you have some very like minor, violent cases where you have an assault, and somebody does not have to go to the hospital or get hurt very bad.
They recently had a contract to also provide services and connect with people on Rikers island and in New, York, City, Jails, and I believe this year.
My request is for some kind of description or website or some way of knowing what exactly it is that you described that we can share with a larger community, sounds great John and in the Chat Box Brandon Holmes did send a link to a couple links that may be helpful.
That, I think, is probably better for a for a downtown court, because it's difficult with getting all the people into a into a jury.
No, I'm sure why it is not everywhere, but, as I understand you know, in some comm in some communities there is a NIMBY- ism about having a court in your in your neighborhood and in other in other areas.
So I'm, going to now share my screen so that we can get into our district needs, which Carol Ann has put into Excel form that I just formatted a little bit and added a couple of line items for us to talk about and think about.
It is, I think, caroline literally, like re- typed, the whole thing by hand so completed, and then noting in terms of public safety and emergency services.
We had that as a top priority for many years before, DOE decided to fund a new school in downtown Brooklyn, and that is not going to open until 20 years after the 2004 rezoning.
You know, I think, it's great to add as I as a priority, so that people start thinking about it, but not expect it to be funded in any.
If we so Brandon, given your level of expertise in this area, I certainly am very interested in understanding more about what goes on there in red hook And I'm always going to ask for this, because I think we have to have a written document that puts people as close to being on the same page as how we are looking and understanding what we want to happen.
If they're going to do three precincts in a downtown Brooklyn community court, it's going to , I think it's going to have to be more east.
The idea is that the community court would deal with the issues that would never put people in the House of Detention.
You know they can accept the plea or they can go to trial, and the system in the community courts allows it to work a lot faster.
He did not envision one big, facility, and so I think the you know the idea of bringing the services to the communities like the red Hook court.
To pick that up again does anybody else have an objection, because you know we have both perspectives in the discussion have an objection to removing the link to 120, scrimmage and really focusing on community courts as an expense item and a little bit more conceptually, rather than concretely in that building.
You know it's, the city has a lot of resources in downtown Brooklyn and they can find another place.
One core area is his right because of the repeal of 50A And, then there's a lingering court battle to actually release the disciplinary records of officers that the New York Civil, Liberties Union, actually just yesterday was able to release over 300,000 records of police misconduct.
One thing could be removing police officers from public schools and investing that money and those resources.
The end result was about 400 million dollars that got taken out of the NYPD budget and put into the department of Education, and that 400 million dollars is still being used to hire police officers to be in public schools.
Think popular demand from many folks, especially parents, has been to remove police officers from schools and put the accountability on DOE to hire and staff guidance.
So is there consensus about adding this one as a priority, removing or support the removal of police officers who are now working for the Department of education from public schools and increasing DOE funding for guidance, counselors and staff?
Are they in every school or how is the personnel allocated that 400 million dollars they're spread out acrosss, most public schools when you look at non- public schools, know they're, typically not police officers in there, but there is an MOU with the department of Education and the NYPD that says that they have to keep those jobs in schools right now.
There are some police officers in schools that are high risk, make decisions right, now, their school safety officer in every public school in New, York, City and.
They got reallocated right and that they should also train those people not to just be monitoring the door, but also being there to assist in the social work and stuff like that, so they're really integrated into the school process.
We would have to put in conjunction with the school principles, because we can't make decisions for every school and make a uniform decision, and there are some schools that may have a different relationship with their community, where they think they need to have a police officer.
So I think we got ta, but I also think that frankly, I knew the police officer at the high school I was not treated like people of color.
One thing I do have to say is many of the school safety officers in that 400 million dollars of funding are people of color?
Potentially I would like to say that when we think about New York City for the next 30 years, we're looking at like pockets of organized abandonment and like austere, violence, acrosss, budgets, and So, when we think about spending money on police or school security guards instead of services that is doing harm, especially to people who are black and brown, and I I'm, very much in favor of removing all police from schools and removing the security officers in exchange for more counselors, who are also typically women of color.
This is going to take a while to be able to talk to the unions about how it's going to happen, people's you, know, pensions and all that, but to say we're going to reallocate this money to training you to prepare you to take on these social service jobs that we need Despite.
I do agree with Brandon Holmes, just said, but basically I think you know we should not be looking at taking people's jobs away, but we should be looking at the bigger picture and trying to allocate their job in another way and train them properly, so that they could feel a sense of pride that they are they're doing something that would be a meaningful, but they would not be out of a job , So I.
You know, like folks, have said earlier about the school's issues.
Think many people would not agree with that statement, but they would like to see something done with the funding.
That's going to the police, as I think Brandon, Holmes mentioned, about social work and social services using the word.
The where that funding comes from, because I think some of the funding may come from the federal government, and but you know you know at some points during this process, there's been like five helicopter police helicopters flying over my house, I live next to the Brooklyn bridge people pass by who are protesting and, as a result.
I think we all agree and if we're going to come to a consensus, that the money should be reallocated with a significant fortune removed from the police, department.
I hear you and a lot of people are saying what you're saying you know in the in the world, in New, York, City.
The health committee, you know, comes up with mental health opportunities like this, so I'm going to sort of say these funds should be reallocated in generally.
So I have this language reallocate funding from NYPD, support, youth, programs, increasing economic opportunities, education, internships, job training, Health and mental health, social services initiatives and Then you know what we discussed about the training of officers.
If they're going to be these other programs and different kinds of police officers, there could be you know, traffic officers who did not have reduced militarization.
Then, since it's you know, it's not yet funded so I'll, read the whole thing: Reform traffic enforcement and parking violations to reduce placard parking abuse such as by expanding the use of technology to scan packards and license plates and automatically issue.
And, so I would support removing that item actually, but totally open to Because, like I think that traffic and placard people we're thinking about who are not necessarily police are the ones who would care about Pedestrian Bike, Safety.
Do not He's not convinced he's going right, but at some point, I feel like it's, whether it's in the wrong conversation Thank you assign additional uniformed officers in the 88th and the 84th, and then the response is that NYPD has implemented the NCO program to address community concerns, which they certainly have, and A good job with that.
I. Think it's a more tangible local thing about the project, and actually there are lots of park spaces that can benefit from Bqa. You know all the way up to sand street incorporate.
If you want to copy that and say Brooklyn bridge, that sounds great I'm just going to put it in one, because you know people are voting.
