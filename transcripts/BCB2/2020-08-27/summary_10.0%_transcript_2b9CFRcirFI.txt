The meeting of the transportation and public safety committee of Brooklyn community ward, 2 called to order and is being recorded on the cv2 youtube archive in accordance with the NYC open meetings.
So after the 11 point presentation, and then, after our discussion with policy advocate brandon holmes, I've invited brandon smith from the the health and human services committee to speak to us about community courts.
The good news from that is that we had the opportunity to continue our work with the consultants over the past, I'd, say winter and spring and now into summer, and we focused on some key areas of the core of downtown, where we knew that there were changes afoot and felt that we could really study them and understand them and perhaps recommend changes to really improve the pedestrian experience.
The goals of the study I'll go through very quickly, and this effort you'll remember this from the winter time, where two are to improve the streetscape, establish a stronger sense of place and strength and identity, and we were especially focusing on those areas of downtown Brooklyn that haven't seen any improvement literally in over 50 years.
And I'm very grateful to DOT to let us work through these details, Hoyt presents a very unique opportunity in downtown Brooklyn, because there are no subways underneath the block, so we're able to really focus on expanding sidewalks and providing in-ground planting, which, as regina said due to the sidewalk with elm in particular.
The sidewalks, so elm street in particular, would go from eight foot wide 16 feet wide Then we could really add a substantial rain garden as well as potentially seven new trees, which we think would be a very big deal in downtown Brooklyn and white street Overall.
You have more time to talk about the district as a whole, so we could really work together frankly to look at ways to fund and implement over the long term, because we all know that downtown Brooklyn, needs.
I, mean, I, would say all sidewalks and we probably couldn't like saying that, but obviously every street would need to be studied and we have to work with youtube and regina Is that on your website, the plan, the presentation, rather the one from the winter The committee.
Let us get back to the committee on this item, because I certainly want to learn more from john about what he's talking about with the nevin street subway, because you know the nearest subway here is hoyt street Your, oh Brooklyn, bridge park, place, regina, And I mean it's very much in line with the presentation we saw in the winter from downtown Brooklyn partnership.
If there's any more comments on eleven white, maybe from community board members opening it up to people who are not on the committee, you can type in the chat.
We know if the developer is at allowing for a bike parking in their building or just bicycles, not city bike, Would you like to advocate for that on the sidewalk?
Priorities and statement of district needs and also brandon smith, is here on to discuss and teach us about the community court system as well.
Then I worked at the new york civil liberties union, where I developed an expertise around police accountability and transparency, advocacy efforts, and some on the state level, some work around decarceration and decriminalization, and also advocating to repeal article 58, which until this week effectively hid all law enforcement disciplinary records from the public and now, in my current role and where I will be taking a leave of absence from in a couple of weeks, I've, been at just leadership, USA, managing and directing the campaign to close Rikers island, which is effectively in the past four years.
What I wanted to share with you all is for the past two years with the close Rikers campaign, we've developed the build communities platform which our team published in 2019 and 2020, and this was done in collaboration with hundreds of directly impacted community members and service providers and experts across all five boroughs to identify key areas where the city could divest from the criminal legal system and begin to invest in local, community-based programs and resources that improve the quality of life.
That's you know one of the things that we definitely want to amplify and prioritize and making sure that every community gets access to conflict resolution and alternative to alternatives to incarceration or alternatives to detention.
Some of the top issues you want to address are, but I'm going to share in the link a link to in the chat to the 2020 report that our team did definitely identifies areas of workforce, development, public health consulate resolution and alternative forms of accountability, and also family planning and family support.
Think that's true across all neighborhoods in new york city mine in bed, stuy and euros downtown, Brooklyn , so I'm excited to participate in this conversation with you all and provide any support.
So speaking of public safety as public health and rehabilitation, brandon smith is the chairperson of the health environment, human services committee, and he is going to speak with us about his professional experience in the community corps, system.
But I want to talk a little bit about community courts and about how they're different than regular courts so that we can think about.
There is a clinic with licensed social workers who are able to place individuals who are charged with crimes in into different programs that can ultimately be used in the same place of the really just traditional sanctions that exist in criminal law, jail, community service.
Is it instead of having the jail a more meaningful experience is exists for the person who's charged, and it goes along with the overall theory of the court, which is more on the problem-solving side than the penalty punishment side of criminal law and when defendants take a plea that exists to and requires them to complete one of these programs, whether it be for mental health, services, substance, abuse, services, maybe anger management or their specialized services for domestic violence, which are which I've seen been be extremely effective and people embrace and really turn their lives around in a remarkable experience.
You know these are the things that kind of make the community court set, setting better down in red hook.
You have to have a judge who's willing to give a lot of second chances and to be pretty tolerant, but when you have that kind of a setting and when it's in a community-based atmosphere, Like, I think one of the big things that drove me to this feeling is that when we were sitting there with the close Rikers hearings last year and having people who come up and talk about their experience at Rikers, one of the real things that hit me was the discussion of how dehumanizing the experience was of being there.
Think from that you know , the thought would be if we, if we would want to have a community court for the part of our neighborhood and community district 2 to handle the these kind of non-violent or in some cases you have some very like minor, violent cases where you have an assault and somebody doesn't have to go to the hospital or get hurt very bad.
They recently had a contract to also provide services and connect with people on Rikers, island and in new york, city, jails, and I believe this year.
That, I think, is probably better for a for a downtown court, because it's difficult with getting all the people into a into a jury.
Everywhere, but, as I understand you know, in some comm in some communities there is a NIMBY-ism about having a court in your in your neighborhood and in other in other areas.
I suspect, even if we support this, it's going to be years in the making similar to We, had creation of an elementary school in downtown Brooklyn into the 2004 rezoning.
We had that as a top priority for many years before, DOE decided to fund a new school in downtown Brooklyn, and that is not going to open until 20 years after the 2004 rezoning.
If, you know of how the red hook community court center got approved, but the way you explained it seemed Like, there's so many levels of sort of bureaucracy really to get that we'd have to get through, and really this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know, I think, it's great to add as I as a priority, so that people start thinking about it, but not expect it to be funded in any.
Given your level of expertise in this area, I certainly am very interested in understanding more about what goes on there in red hook And I'm always going to ask for this, because I think we have to have a written document that puts people as close to being on the same page as how we are looking and understanding what we want to happen.
I think that the contact folk who the key contact folk are the people who this reports website is on the center for court innovation, okay, they're, probably the key contact folk, because they're the non-profit that operates these in the in the city.
The idea is that the community court would deal with the issues that would never put people in the house of detention.
If you were to demand that 3.5 million it kind of just reinforces that, like 3.5 million dollars, it's not a lot of money to keep thousands of people out of jail when today, it's costing us about 330 000 a year to keep one person in new york, city, jails.
I shared here, the one for expanding pre-arraignment diversion, is in collaboration with the district attorneys and the office of court administration, so that would be expanding services and funding that, like d.a gonzalez, has already been invested in most of the investments he's made, youth diversion, but that's slowly.
There are two buckets, though, that are specific to one community-based restorative justice, which would be similar to you know what GMAC does as like a community-based service provider doing that violence, interruption and conflict resolution model, and then the other one is a justice innovation fund which I'm not super familiar about.
So this is kind of like when we talk about red hook, community justice center or initiative they them operating that community court.
You know they can accept the plea or they can go to trial, and the system in the community courts allows it to work a lot faster.
A lot of folks who are homeless, also have come into contact with law enforcement or the justice system and kind of addressing that it would be transitional or supportive housing models, such as what we've seen operated by fortune society or osborne association folks in Brooklyn may be familiar.
To pick that up again, does anybody else have an objection, because you know we have both perspectives in the discussion have an objection to removing the link to 120, scrimmage and really focusing on community courts as an expense item and a little bit more conceptually, rather than concretely in that building.
One thing could be removing police officers from public schools and investing that money and those resources.
The end result was about 400 million dollars that got taken out of the NYPD budget and put into the department of education and that 400 million dollars is still being used to hire police officers to be in public schools.
Think popular demand from many folks, especially parents, has been to remove police officers from schools and put the accountability on DOE to hire and staff guidance.
We have them, so is there consensus about adding this one as a priority, removing or support the removal of police officers who are now working for the department of education from public schools and increasing DOE funding for guidance, counselors and staff?
Schools know they're, typically not police officers in there, but there is an MOU with the department of education and the NYPD that says that they have to keep those jobs in schools right now.
Now they got reallocated right and that they should also train those people not to just be monitoring the door, but also being there to assist in the social work and stuff like that, so they're really integrated into the school process.
We would have to put in conjunction with the school principles, because we can't make decisions for every school and make a uniform decision, and there are some schools that may have a different relationship with their community, where they think they need to have a police officer.
One thing, I do have to say is many of the school safety officers in that 400 million dollars of funding are people of color?
Potentially I would like to say that when we think about new york city for the next 30 years, we're looking at like pockets of organized abandonment and like austere violence across budgets, and so when we think about spending money on police or school security guards instead of services that is doing harm, especially to people who are black and brown, and I I'm, very much in favor of removing all police from schools and removing the security officers in exchange for more counselors, who are also typically women of color.
This is going to take a while to be able to talk to the unions about how it's going to happen, people's you, know, pensions and all that, but to say we're going to reallocate this money to training you to prepare you to take on these social service jobs that we need.
I do agree with brandon holmes, just said, but basically I think you know we shouldn't be looking at taking people's jobs away, but we should be looking at the bigger picture and trying to allocate their job in another way and train them properly, so that they could feel a sense of pride that they are they're doing something that would be a meaningful, but they wouldn't be out of a job.
You know they help keep our community safe, and these are a lot of the officers who are of color and in our district.
That's going to the police, as I think brandon holmes mentioned, about social work and social services using the word.
The where that funding comes from, because I think some of the funding may come from the federal government, and but you know you know at some points during this process, there's been like five helicopter police helicopters flying over my house, I live next to the Brooklyn bridge people pass by who are protesting and, as a result.
If we're going to come to a consensus that the money should be reallocated with a significant fortune removed from the police, department , I think, if you take a vote, here, I, know I would not support the funding.
I hear you and a lot of people are saying what you're saying you know in the in the world in new york city today, I would suggest.
The health committee, you know, comes up with mental health opportunities like this, so I'm, gonna sort of say these funds should be reallocated in generally.
Okay, so I have this language reallocate funding from NYPD, support, youth, programs, increasing economic opportunities, education, internships, job training, health and mental health, social services, initiatives and I You know expanding the opportunities, also for first responders for mental health.
So those people don't have guns like I, think Oh right, reduce militarization of police.
I. Don't know that it needs to be a different one, but like, if they're going to be these other programs and different kinds of police officers, there could be you know, traffic officers who didn't have reduced militarization, works.
Removing that item actually, but totally open to Because, like I think that traffic and placard people we're thinking about who aren't necessarily police are the ones who would care about pedestrian bike.
If you want to copy that and say Brooklyn bridge, that sounds great I'm, just gonna put it in one, because you know people are voting.
