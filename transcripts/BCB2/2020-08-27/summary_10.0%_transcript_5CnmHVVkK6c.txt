I'll Let people know if topics are open for comment by committee, members board members or the and or the general public, and if you have questions outside of the public comment time, you can type your questions into the chat and we will try to address them, We're committed to providing access for our neighbors regardless of disabilities, physical abilities or limitations.
As you may know, the there are seven schools within district 15 that are up for a potential rezone and it includes 261 and 38 and then also ps32, It's, and this process came up a year ago or a year and a half ago now, almost and the office of district planning of the department of education started to put forward a couple of potential proposals last summer, and there was a reaction from across a lot of community members gave feedback that it was going too fast, and there was also concerns that the process wasn't so inclusionary of bipark community members and NYCHA residents who are connected to all of these schools.
So last march, to cut a long story short Last march, we launched a participatory action research project I'm, which is I'm a parent in district 15 My child is at ps15, but I'm, also on faculty at Brooklyn college and so I in collaboration with a community, a community leader from red hook and matt gonzalez from the nyu metro center We and in collaboration with many community members across reddick and gowanus, especially we present We proposed and launched this project So. In march, we gathered together a diverse group of parents from across the impacted school zones to form a research team, a community-based research team and we started meeting, and we have been working and meeting ever since through the pandemic through thick and thin We transitioned from meeting within a school to meeting We use zoom, but, and we have been working on building our own knowledge, around histories and contexts of rezoning.
If people want to share that out in different ways via you know, whatever distribution, list- and so we've been getting a robust response so far, but we are and we're really looking forward to hearing from and as many community members as possible, who might be impacted by this potential.
And this is the survey that is showing you now, but we're going to generate a list of recommendations to so to give to the department of education and the department of education will use those recommendations to develop proposals for the rezoning I mean people can go back and I didn't say before, but just to clarify this project is a collaboration between the community, the you know, Brooklyn college and the nyu metro center and the department of education, so that you know part of the idea is that the department of education and the office of district planning are in some way accountable to the recommendations that we will present at the end of this process.
You know we're meeting and in conversation with the office of district planning many times a week, and you can imagine that question comes up a lot in our meetings with them from the par team and then in all kinds of ways and the this Apparently.
It's a tricky situation to be conducting this project in the midst of the pandemic, because we all hope right that in the in a year, we won't have to be facing some of these pandemic related issues, and we want to be thinking about that future in this project and there's also concerns around budget We. Will we anticipate after the survey that we'll need to have a kind of some special focused conversations with community members around some of those issues, and that will take those into account when we make our recommendations but kind of beyond the scope of this project to think about how we are both accountable to equity and reconciling that accountability in the context of the pandemic or post-pandemic or whatever we're in Don't think it has a direct impact, except for that people's psychological experience.
will also put in my Brooklyn college email here So next we have a representative from the new york city of civilian complaint review board that I understand we'll be talking about youth advisory and I'm, able to show everyone like the slides and people are able to access the information afterwards.
You don't necessarily need an adult to fall on your behalf, so that individuals feel like they can say something if police misconduct occurs and from so We looked at specific complaint data that we received between January 1st of 2018 and june 30th of 2019, and what we found was that there was a disproportionate number of youth that were stopped and one based on their race and ethnicity.
Brooklyn One complaint can have multiple allegations, so in an encounter with an officer there may be excessive or necessary force It also breaks down how those allegations are coming up and it might be helpful for people to see Are you able to talk specifically about the youth in this youth advisory board and how they're recruited and their role in this, because I think that was the focus of what the committee is interested in yeah, of course.
So the applications for the youth advisory council is actually going to go, live in the fall The youth advisory council has regular regularly scheduled meetings where they'll come together and over the course of the year, like one of the things that they did was specifically work on the public service announcement that had to do with informing you about the ccrv and last year hosting the symposium on youth police community relations So every month the erb hosts monthly board meetings open to the public.
So in june, the ccrb released our youth report and we actually made recommendations in our report like things that had to change in terms of police practices, even things that have to be updated in the patrol guide or in terms of their training when they are interacting with you There is a difference in the way an officer would police an adult or do policing with a young person, especially when it comes to you know them young people that interaction with an officer and it's a vulnerable situation during presentations with young people, we'll explain what the investigation process is.
Think now, especially you know, as we are in a new coveted world thinking about kind of how that plays into here and what people, what members of the community and what school members think kind of Thank you elizabeth one of the so some of the conversations that members of cb2 have had this summer We have to look at equity and when we cite this type of facility in Brooklyn heights, many are concerned This be mostly students from Brooklyn heights who use this as opposed to students in other schools that might be further away, that don't have access to that type of enriched learning, environment.
There is a lot of work to do around racial justice in our school system, and you know I'm heart I, interrupted that but I think that's an important point like will that entity that lab or a facility will that belong in a sense to district 13, so the district 13 community of school leaders, parents etc can help shape?
But again, it's not going to be the typical committee reports, We're, not even sure that everyone does the webex or again has access, and then I wanted to share talking about food and free lunch just to let people know in your communities that even people who are not low income, so in other words everyone who had a child in a pub in the public school in this last year will be getting what's called a p pandemic ebt card and some people feel at the 420 I mean even for a working family 420 for each kid come up to a thousand very easily.
Wellness center, that is they're reaching young people living in temporary housing group, homes, shelters and detent centers, and their goal is to try to help them develop self-confidence, learn how to be entrepreneurs and other things that you know can maybe help them get into a better situation as things improve in their life or as they you know, depart from high school I opened it up, and it said family of four following god, and it said it was unsecured website the other last one is teens for food justice, and this is the workshops basis independent, the new school, coming up any thoughts, ideas, suggestions, recommendations or what my thinking originally when the board office asked me but I know when they started their upper school in red hook.
I. Do think that I would like to hear from some of the youth, not necessarily from him to see some of the work that they have done around Covid-19 and also they've partnered, with a lot of other partners in neighborhoods and most of the young people come from NYCHA I say that with a little bit of reservation because of the mr martin's, you know his presentation of doing other things around social justice, but I would love to hear from the youth if we can get one of them to speak on some of the work that they've been doing and the purpose of what they're doing when they go back to school things.
