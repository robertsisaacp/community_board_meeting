I'll Let people know if topics are open for comment by committee, members board members or the and or the general public, and if you have questions outside of the public comment time, you can type your questions into the chat and we will try to address them, We're committed to providing access for our neighbors regardless of disabilities, physical abilities or limitations.
As you may know, the there are seven schools within district 15 that are up for a potential rezone and it includes 261 and 38 and then also ps32, It's, and this process came up a year ago or a year and a half ago now, almost and the office of district planning of the department of education started to put forward a couple of potential proposals last summer, and there was a reaction from across a lot of community members gave feedback that it was going too fast, and there was also concerns that the process wasn't so inclusionary of bipark community members and NYCHA residents who are connected to all of these schools.
So last march, to cut a long story short Last march, we launched a participatory action research project I'm, which is I'm a parent in district 15 My child is at ps15, but I'm, also on faculty at Brooklyn college and so I in collaboration with a community, a community leader from red hook and matt gonzalez from the nyu metro center We and in collaboration with many community members across reddick and gowanus, especially we present We proposed and launched this project So. In march, we gathered together a diverse group of parents from across the impacted school zones to form a research team, a community-based research team and we started meeting, and we have been working and meeting ever since through the pandemic through thick and thin We transitioned from meeting within a school to meeting We use zoom, but, and we have been working on building our own knowledge, around histories and contexts of rezoning.
If people want to share that out in different ways via you know, whatever distribution, list- and so we've been getting a robust response so far, but we are and we're really looking forward to hearing from and as many community members as possible, who might be impacted by this potential.
We're really spending a lot of time out in community and talking with people who are very connected to local community organizers and community groups and community based organizations in building a knowledge and vision for what could be across these across these schools The goal is that by the end of september into october, with that, we are going to generate a a list of recommendations.
and this is the survey that is showing you now, but we're going to generate a list of recommendations to so to give to the department of education and the department of education will use those recommendations to develop proposals for the rezoning I mean people can go back and I didn't say before, but just to clarify this project is a collaboration between the community, the you know, Brooklyn college and the nyu metro center and the department of education, so that you know part of the idea is that the department of education and the office of district planning are in some way accountable to the recommendations that we will present at the end of this process.
It's a tricky situation to be conducting this project in the midst of the pandemic, because we all hope right that in the in a year, we won't have to be facing some of these pandemic related issues, and we want to be thinking about that future in this project and there's also concerns around budget We. Will we anticipate after the survey that we'll need to have a kind of some special focused conversations with community members around some of those issues, and that will take those into account when we make our recommendations but kind of beyond the scope of this project to think about how we are both accountable to equity and reconciling that accountability in the context of the pandemic or post-pandemic or whatever we're in Don't think it has a direct impact, except for that people's psychological experience.
will also put in my Brooklyn college email here So next we have a representative from the new york city of civilian complaint review board that I understand we'll be talking about youth advisory and I'm, able to show everyone like the slides and people are able to access the information afterwards.
Brooklyn One complaint can have multiple allegations, so in an encounter with an officer there may be excessive or necessary force It also breaks down how those allegations are coming up and it might be helpful for people to see Are you able to talk specifically about the youth in this youth advisory board and how they're recruited and their role in this, because I think that was the focus of what the committee is interested in yeah, of course.
So the applications for the youth advisory council is actually going to go, live in the fall The youth advisory council has regular regularly scheduled meetings where they'll come together and over the course of the year, like one of the things that they did was specifically work on the public service announcement that had to do with informing you about the ccrv and last year hosting the symposium on youth police community relations So every month the erb hosts monthly board meetings open to the public.
Covid-19 I know that there has been a lot of obviously interactions with police and young people during protests and demonstrations from whatever information that you can provide Can, you state any particular outcomes of what has been resolved of any type of disciplinary action for individual officers or any type of new practices that they're considering, while engaging with the public hi?
So in June, the ccrb released our youth report and we actually made recommendations in our report like things that had to change in terms of police practices, even things that have to be updated in the patrol guide or in terms of their training when they are interacting with you There is a difference in the way an officer would police an adult or do policing with a young person, especially when it comes to you know them young people that interaction with an officer and it's a vulnerable situation.
There is a lot of work to do around racial justice in our school system, and you know I'm heart but I think that's an important point like will that entity that lab or a facility will that belong in a sense to district 13, so the district 13 community of school leaders, parents etc can help shape?
Manning did a very good job on that I couldn't print mine out so I'm, trying to read it on my phone, which is not working so well , let's office board and just take it out because it was unclear- It's, a job that a lot of people this town- you know it's a job Okay, so we have the statement of district needs and we and then, with Covid-19 and with the severe budget strains When they're.
We're not even sure that everyone does the webex or again has access, and then I wanted to share talking about food and free lunch just to let people know in your communities that even people who are not low income, so in other words everyone who had a child in a pub in the public school in this last year will be getting what's called a p pandemic ebt card and some people feel at the 420 I mean even for a working family 420 for each kid come up to a thousand very easily, so some people feel you know If you talk to people about this, some people are forming mutual aid societies or going to costco or going to places with like grocery lists for other families.
One is very interesting, called Brooklyn boat work, something I had not heard about and what it is I'm, not sure if it takes place through the student year or graham, the other one is the Brooklyn public library which you know we hear about all the time, but there's something in the Brooklyn public library called center for fiction and what it is It may be a little bit more involved than that, but I did not go into it that thoroughly The other is divine ange's angels wellness center, that is they're reaching young people living in temporary housing group, homes, shelters and detent centers, and their goal is to try to help them.
I do think that I would like to hear from some of the youth, not necessarily from him to see some of the work that they have done around Covid-19 and also they've partnered, with a lot of other partners in neighborhoods and most of the young people come from NYCHA I say that with a little bit of reservation because of the mr martin's, you know his presentation of doing other things around social justice, but I would love to hear from the youth if we can get one of them to speak on some of the work that they've been doing and the purpose of what they're doing when they go back to school things.
