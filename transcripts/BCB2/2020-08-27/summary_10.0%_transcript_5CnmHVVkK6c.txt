As you may know, the there are seven schools within district 15 that are up for a potential rezone and it includes 261 and 38 and then also ps32, ps29, It's, and this process came up a year ago or a year and a half ago, now, almost and the office of district planning of the department of education started to put forward a couple of potential proposals.
Processes, we've been having we've been conducting community conversations with community members, which kind of like interviews, we've been conducting, and we've been spending time at food distribution lines and at open streets events and building our knowledge around a community member's experience of schools, elementary schools and getting kind of the access to schools, perspectives on that process and that experience and then also getting community members, dreams and ideas and vision for what could be or what equity.
If people want to share that out in different ways via you know, whatever distribution, list- Or, you know social, media or whatever, And, so we've been getting a robust response, so far, but we are and we're really looking forward to hearing from and as many community members as possible, who might be impacted by this potential rezone Information and the site.
This online survey alone, we're really spending a lot of time out in community and talking with people who are very connected to local community organizers and community groups and community based organizations in building a knowledge and vision for what could be across these across these schools.
I mean people can go back, And, I, didn't say before, but just to clarify this project is a collaboration between the community, the you know, Brooklyn college and the nyu metro center and the department of education, so that you know part of the idea is that the department of education and the office of district planning are in some way accountable to the recommendations that we will present at the end of this process.
You know we're meeting and in conversation with the office of district planning many times a week, and you can imagine that question comes up a lot in our meetings with them from the par team and then in all kinds of ways and the this.
So the youth advisory council members they serve as ambassadors in their own communities for sharing information about the agency and how they're able to file a complaint, and these are individuals who are passionate about criminal justice issues and also improving police community relations in 2019.
So the applications for the youth advisory council is actually going to go, live in the fall The youth advisory council has regular regularly scheduled meetings where they'll come together and over the course of the year, like one of the things that they did was specifically work on the public service announcement that had to do with informing you about the ccrv and last year hosting the symposium on youth police community relations.
Youth, so, and I hate that there has to be something called the top, which is literally almost everything against what you guys are trying to do, because it is about telling black and brown young men in particular like careful, because you know when your rights upsets them and just causes bad things to happen.
I know that there has been a lot of obviously interactions with police and young people during protests and demonstrations from whatever information that you can provide.
We I had a specific question, as we remember when the building that was the Brooklyn heights, public library was sold, and there was the library controversy one of the things the outcomes of that was the council number 11 brokered and an agreement to have a stem lab with some type of educational entity in the new building and as the building is coming closer to completion.
We were trying to kind of move forward in these conversations with the sca with the school construction authority, and now we're you know And until then is have conversations with DOE with the sca with community leaders and really think through the programming.
Think now, especially you know, as we are in a new Covid-19 world thinking about kind of how that plays into here and what people, what members of the community and what school members think kind.
Think that's an important point like will that entity that lab or a facility will that belong in a sense to district 13, so The district 13 community of school, leaders, parents etc can help shape?
Don't want to be presumptive, but the way the conversation that we've had so far was you know, with sca and with the superintendent when with cec 13, and So we like I'm curious more specifically, what the use of this space will be just a little bit.
I, couldn't print mine, out, so I'm trying to read it on my phone, which is not working so Well, let's office board and just take it out because it was unclear- It's, a job that a lot of people this town.
Remember, we heard a presentation about high school cafeterias and some of them needed redesigning not just for salad bars and things of that nature, but so that students could eat in more quote civilized way, rather than in these long tables, with those long benches that it's not like a family type of environment.
We want to recommend that, in our document, the presentation that we saw, I, think that was at the Brooklyn hospital I , don't know who's going to be able to do what and what really is going to be much more important than some of the other things that we need to think about.
But I, don't think it will hurt to at least make the recommendation, because you want the kids to eat healthier and to eat foods they like and to feel a little bit more of a semi home setting, as opposed to you, know, There's anything else, that's more important, then I would not recommend that makes sense.
Schools could put in something called water jets so that young people could access water for free from like a healthy type of thing, not a fountain where maybe kid's bed is on it.
But I I'm wondering if the schools almost need people in the role of making sure families have access to the internet and connecting them to it and like making it happen because handing somebody a device isn't enough, you know, and initially the dua handed people devices thinking they had internet and then had to give them ones with hotspots, because they don't.
Then I wanted to share talking about food and free lunch just to let people know in your communities that even people who are not low income, so in other words, everyone who had a child in a pub in the public school in this last year will be getting what's called a p pandemic ebt card and some people feel at the 420 I mean even for a working family 420 for each kid come up to a thousand very easily, so some people feel you know.
We need to do that, so it's the students that put together the gardens so that they can provide food for different schools, and I guess maybe take some home Basis, independent, the new school, coming up any thoughts, ideas, suggestions, recommendations, or what my thinking originally when the board office asked me.
I. Do think that I would like to hear from some of the youth, not necessarily from him to see some of the work that they have done around Covid-19 and also they've partnered, with a lot of other partners in neighborhoods, and most of the young people come from NYCHA.
I say that with a little bit of reservation because of the mr martin's, you know his presentation of doing other things around social justice, but I would love to hear from the youth if we can get one of them to speak on some of the work that they've been doing and the purpose of what they're doing when they go back to school.
Maybe we want to reach out to the divine angels wellness center as one of the first of people we'd like to reach out to just because of what's going on now, and it would be, I think, appropriate to do that, and also the Brooklyn boat works regardless, because also we're talking about kids, teens, and so I think those two would be, maybe the first ones that we would like to reach out to And I think that may be round two of who we look out for and the last group I'm just putting him in groups, because that's just what I'm doing We would like to do, and we probably should discuss that and the teens for food justice.
Is there any other comments from non-committee, members?, Don't know who some of these people are.
