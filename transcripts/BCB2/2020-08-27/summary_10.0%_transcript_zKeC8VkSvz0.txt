Commission applications, the first one is two now do yourself: First, hmm, you have to introduce yourself, not the community members, necessarily okay, First one is 295 cumberland street in fort greene historic district The application is to remove the existing okay hold on a second roof deck and construct the full width.
Full scope, that's being reviewed, is the, as mentioned a one-story garden level, extension on the rear of the building and the review as we'll go through as a 12 foot extension Here we are in the fort green historic district image on the left shows the front facade of the building is a wood frame building the view on the right shows the site plan The grade box is basically the extension again, a 12 foot extension from the current rear facade and that's a roof deck On top of the extension.
Am I correct those long steps at the top you'll see this better and from the following ones, but those are steps coming up from the level of the garden to the rear yard and the shorter steps on the right are stairs coming down from the roof deck to the yard, Side is going to be the street So, just to give a little bit of a scope of the entire street, we're going between green avenue and lafayette avenue between cumberland and carleton All of the different colors that you can see are the extensions already on the block.
So there's quite a few extensions We were asked by the landmarks commission to find an average of those and those average out to 14 feet partially Some historic photos, probably a little less relevant, but just to give you a sense of where it was no longer doing any work on the front facade that needs feedback from the committee.
We we've ended up taking off side lights from the door, it's all existing within the current opening for that door, Yes, the landmarks preservation committee is comfortable handling that at staff level and therefore the work you're asking us to improve is basically the rear extension.
This is the existing condition of the rear and then the new, so large windows on the back, but just under the garden level, the roof deck extends out to the exact same point as the facade of the building.
Cosmeri are here as well, so we have a lot of people I see adam street library, so we wanted to give a little bit of context to the signage project and also just we are really excited about this project, and you know I think it'll be a really great addition to your community The adams.
What's great about the site is that on john street, the newer developments are a little bit pushed to the side so that our library, which is occupies just a part of the ground floor, has amazing views out over the waterfront, and we also have no real neighbors on the adam street side We have spent a lot of time in community outreach on this project and working with groups at both in dumbo, and we made a presentation.
Recently it does kind of stick out to the water, so it's visible from many areas even from Manhattan, but when up close- and you know, we really want to make sure that the library stands out and that it's clear where this new public institution is and where people can go.
The thompson meter company in the neighborhood also still retains some of this large super graphics, sweeney manufacturing, company, the brillo, the preview paints and, of course, the eagle warehouse, probably the best known building in the in the community, as well as the empire stores, and we also note that more recently, peop retail tenants have been picking up on this as well Our proposal is to utilize a word that everyone recognizes that is as clear as gay and just a proper noun, It's completely transparent and it's a black material and on the outside, it's white, so it reflects against the windows and you'll really read this big bold sign, I forgot to mention you know.
There were a couple of things that looked like it was listed in the health area, but I thought for things that I don't know One was the 39 auburn street auburn place homeless, shelter which was supposed to have a upgrade now I guess our health committee?
We've been asking the city to do that, re-evaluate the land use based on what we approved in the early 2000s, when we did the upzoning for downtown Brooklyn, where we thought we were going to get a lot of commercial and we got basically residential That is the budget priority While you were chairperson, you co-signed a letter with then council member leticia james, asking the department of city planning to take a fresh look at the downtown rezoning and the response that you got from the chair of the city.
Don't think that the sentiment at at the department of city planning has changed in the years since I would also like to remind the committee that that they that there was a capstone project by four wagner, nyu wagner students that looked at the downtown rezoning That was something that was pushed by former committee member Oh, how quickly names evaporate once these people leave the previous , the previous secretary of the committee's name is You, know I and just one personal comment: Are, you saying we're wasting our time with regard to that one particular budget priority?
It's a lot of concern of that particular intersection and want to make sure that it's something that we know we get the heads up on one way or Just, focusing on land use right, we're focusing mainly on land use because there's economic issues, okay, so for land use, we're saying, affordable, housing and some way of dealing with the downtown football, perhaps and then homeless, shelters.
But it doesn't seem to you know we can We can comment upon it, but it doesn't seem to be an area that we would be involved with at landmark, land use, Just read it verbatim, In light of all the blm issues we saw in our district is police community relations, something we should consider- do whether he foresees this being an issue discussed at tomorrow, night's transportation and public safety committee.
You know we have to take a larger look at all of the impacts and address them as much as we can through every committee I think here at this meeting I guess the board office can convey that to the bsa to say well just what john said, for example, that there is a concern about losing You, know the public parking, especially for use by people and by hospital employees But if I.
