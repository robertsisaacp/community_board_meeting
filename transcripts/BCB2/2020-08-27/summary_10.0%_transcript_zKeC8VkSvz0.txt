But those are steps coming up from the level of the garden to the rear yard and the shorter steps on the right are stairs coming down from the roof deck to the yard, and obviously, I guess I was just saying on the left.
Some, historic, photos, probably a little less relevant, but just to give you a sense of where it was no longer doing any work on the front facade that needs feedback from the committee.
Coming down to the rear, yard, some site plans just to show you how that's changing the eight feet on the left versus the 12 feet on the right, front, facade, again, no work that the group needs to weigh in on, but just a point of clarification for close readers of the agenda.
So, yes, the Landmarks Preservation committee, is comfortable handling That at staff level and therefore the work you're asking us to improve is basically the rear extension correct.
This is the existing condition of the rear and then the new, so large windows on the back, but just under the garden level, the roof deck extends out to the exact same point as the facade of the building.
There's, no work on the front, facade And, we will have a little bit more height change since we're lowering the level of the floor on the garden level and that rear extension.
You know why I completely agree, and we've done some other ones in this particular neighborhood, where it was required because of the number of stories they're saying because of the existing adjacent neighbors are at eight feet.
You know I can't say definitively I'm just going on what I was told and speaking of public comment.
So we wanted to give a little bit of context to the signage project and also just we are really excited about this project, and you know, I think, it'll be a really great addition to your community.
We have spent a lot of time in community outreach on this project and working with groups at both in Dumbo, and we made a presentation.
So it's visible from many areas, even from Manhattan, but when up close And you know we really want to make sure that the library stands out and that it's clear where this new public institution is and where people can go.
You know, with using kind of bold, simple words and simple letters to orient people through the space The idea is that there are exterior beacons that really announce these important institutions in the city, and we have been inspired really by the neighborhood itself and its history of kind of large super graphic signs directly painted or applied to buildings.
And then around the corner on John Street, a little bit more subtle just raised signs that read: Brooklyn public library.
Given, the change in our current environment, which is pretty substantial, and what we're hearing about whatever exodus is happening in the city as we speak and whether that's going to be permanent, we need to understand long, range.
If there's no other further comments, on, I do see that the big one, of course, is going to be to study, which is the land use for this, for the zoning for the downtown Brooklyn, which is the big thing.
You know fitness, which is being done at this time in downtown Brooklyn, current or future neighborhood trends.
When we did the upzoning for downtown Brooklyn, where we thought we were going to get a lot of commercial And, we got basically residential.
Do not think that the sentiment at at the Department of City planning has changed in the years since I would also like to remind the committee that that they that there was a capstone project by four wagner, nyu wagner.
You know you should be realistic about how the city views the development of downtown Brooklyn and whether they would you know, spend city planning staff resources on some sort of new rezoning.
A lot of concern of that particular intersection and want to make sure that it's something that we know we get the heads up on one way or Just, focusing on land use, right, we're focusing mainly on land use, because there's economic issues, okay, so for land, use, we're saying, affordable, housing and some way of dealing with the downtown football, perhaps and then homeless, shelters, I mean I only brought up a homeless shelter, because I thought that it might over that it might fall into our lap or part of it.
This year, because we do not know what the budget's going to look like tax revenues are down.
Okay, I was going to bring that up in my chair report, but I'll well I think we have a very strange situation: that, yes.
We do on one hand this committee going to be receiving a lot of pr of proposals, a lot of projects to do major work in this in our in our board.
You know a profit from these things at the same time, The headline shows that there is a lot that there is a as we, the New York City.
That was my thing that I wanted to lead off for my chairs report discussion, because that's something that seems to be coming more and more, I think, of a problem.
The city and others have invested a great deal of money into the Bam harvey and they are probably correct when they make the argument that that's not going to occur and therefore there is no harm in building in the right of way.
Think one of the things they were hoping to do with the new construction would be to open it up a little bit so that these So this is not the parking lot.
You, know the public parking, especially for use by people and by hospital employees.
Right, there's a new building being built on the like western side of fleet, and then there was a proposal and which has still been going for an office building on fleet, as well.
