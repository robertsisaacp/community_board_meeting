Just this one outstanding invoice for the the software that allows the staff to access the server and the office from their homes, And so far in the first quarter, so In the first quarter, so I was Does any other committee members have any questions for Mr Paris about the budget?
Well, just you know, just while we're on that topic conceptually, the committee might want to think about how it might reallocate funds because.
As it looks now, we are going to have unspent money later in the year, because we're not spending money, on, say the meals for the executive committee or where we have bought no office.
So, you should, you know, in sort of broad terms, start to think about how else you might want to spend money, because it is quite foreseeable that there will be unspent funds in the first half of 2021.
I do so sometimes in these budget cycles, their recommendations to purchase more stamps, or you know, postage things or paper, or things of that nature that you can just keep and use when you need to, because it is likely with the city's budget situation, that money will be taken.
You know on appropriate things, based on a plan that would be approved by the executive committee or the officers or something that would enhance the work of outreach of the Community Board.
I wanted to make sure that, given the presentation that the office made about the enhancements for technology and the presentation that taya gave when she walked through the use of social media, that, while it was laid out as Mr Paris, has shared on the screen, what those expected expenses would be That, given that we are in a fiscal management period.
Are we having a conversation about whether we want to spend 180 a year for zoom?
And I'm going to use my words, perhaps a more user- friendly tool to communicate from a committee and Community Board 2 perspective, But the preferred tool from the city of New York is webex and say, or Rob. Mr, Singletary and I had a conversation.
Let's say communications between staff workers or committee chairs, or something like that.
What I was thinking of also is that we may have some other things that we want to do with the budget, so that studying the budget, formulating our questions, we can make decisions, probably by the next meeting, we'll have all that information that we need in order to make decisions as to how much we're going to spend or reallocate from what was what was on the budget.
And, when it's not appropriate to use zoom, because I, from what I understand Webex, is still the application of choice by the city of New. York, The webex is the preferred platform for public meetings, but if the staff wanted to use zoom to zoom with each other or for other meetings that were non- Well, all right, but this is the first I'm going to tell you.
You, know, I think, from my conversation with, do it they may be coming around to the idea that Zoom can be used more broadly The hope is that we can purchase the application now use it in whatever ways we feel comfortable, and if do it does become more open to using zoom.
That's you, know, sort of a policy call for the Community board in my conversations would do.
I. Think that what you know what the staff would like to do is work with the board to put that in into motion- You know I.
It's, an expenditure that should come out of the finance and personnel committee right, the approval of the expenditures for the budget?
Think Barbara is asking if the executive committee should discuss broadening the use of social media tools for communication with the public.
That's what I was thinking of, because we need to present to the general meeting a budget for the next fiscal year, which probably would be in April well, usually March or April, but some it went to may last time and so February, two three four April and let's put a tentative date for May. Does that not interfere with any committee.
