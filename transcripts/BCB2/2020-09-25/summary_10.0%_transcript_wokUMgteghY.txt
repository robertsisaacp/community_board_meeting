What we do is we have a school year, long program that involves that focuses on wood and boat building, but within the build we're emphasizing social and emotional development and stem skills, Development Interpersonal, skills, Communication, perseverance on the long- term project and all of those all the things that go into any project that begins in October and ends in June, which is a really long project, especially for a young person, and we infuse our what we do with leadership, development and peer learning.
So in 2018 around the fall, when I was a seventh grader, my ELA teacher recruited me to join the Brooklyn Boatworks club, And I thought it sounded interesting like why not build a boat in school So what we did in the beginning of the class or the program was we basically got used to materials and tools and try to get used to getting comfortable with them, especially when we're going to actually build a real wooden boat, and so what we did is one of the activities we did.
Is there anyone on the committee who wants to ask jasmine about her experience with the Brooklyn boat, works, Do, you attend what high school?
I'm sure, because it sounds like you're, a student leader and Jasmine, for presenting first , I was asked if Brooklyn boatworks is exclusively a middle school program.
I am so thrilled to be with you all today to share a little bit about our work at generation vote and how we are advancing youth voting rights both in New York, City and throughout the state, I'm also joined by my colleague and partner in crime, who can introduce herself hey y'.
Voter suppression, crisis, advance youth, voting rights in New, York and beyond, and transform the way young people engage in local politics.
We, launched it in the fall of 2017 at Binghamton University to basically spread what we call the Gen Vote model of engagement, which is our training curriculum that supports young people involved in local, progressive and advocacy campaigns And We first piloted the program for one year at SUNY, Binghamton and SUNY Albany, which is right in our state capital and since then have actually expanded to eight campuses.
A student in specific skill sets to both advance local campaigns, and, in this case, for us, especially around youth voting rights and romney, will touch a little bit on later, a new model that we're developing to expand our gender program to not only college students, but also to high school students and folks who are not affiliated with universities.
For example, that looked like trying to arrange rides to inaccessible off- campus poll sites and my friends at CUNY at the time trying to navigate the opaque vote, registration resources and requirements for our city- based students, and so a lot of Gen voters were expressing confusion and frustration when just trying to exercise their fundamental right to vote.
New York vote is the largest statewide coalition fighting for voting rights and there are a lot of organizations that are based right here in Brooklyn, like the Brooklyn voters, alliance, who are active members of this coalition, and we have been involved coalition, basically since its founding, as the lead young organizers, constantly fighting for not only new Yorkers right to vote, but making sure young people's voices are being heard in this conversation.
But I also want to take some time to highlight that voter suppression, whether it be intentional or not, goes beyond New York, , New, York State did a huge overhaul of our election system in 2019 passing laws like early voting, which we just got in the past year, pre- registration of 16 and 17 year, olds, electronic poll books, but we have a long way to go, but even beyond New York from new Hampshire to Florida and Wisconsin we've seen young people, especially young voters of color, be forced to jump over immeasurable hurdles to exercise our right to vote and Covid-19 has only amplified the impact of these attacks, and some of the headlines here show that, and so this is.
We saw that New York state has a lot of work to do, to get out the youth vote and to pass reforms that advance youth voting rights and tear down the barriers that make it hard for young people to exercise their right and so generation vote is the co- chair of the Let New York vote, Youth working group with citizens Union, and we are paving the way for our youth voting rights movement right here in New York in November of 2019, we developed the first New York Youth Voting rights platform at the first youth voting rights and engagement summit in Albany, New York, and we had students from both high schools and colleges.
Here, you can see things like extending time off to vote to schools, mandating on- campus poll sites lower the voting age 16 for state and local elections, and I think, I think, is really important in 2020 Showed us this passing a student voter empowerment act for SUNY and CUNY colleges to make sure that our public universities are giving our students the not only the information to register to vote, but how to vote and also investing in civic engagement activities on their college.
Issue, and I also share information about the Let New York vote, coalition, because if any of you are interested in joining our youth working group, we have calls monthly and you can contact us directly after this call to be added to our listservs and those calls are open to the public and would love to plug you all in to the coalition.
I want to particularly note what we learned about getting out the youth vote in the New York primary, since this may interest folks in the community.
Current public health crisis disrupted, schools, acrosss, New York right before the primary, bringing a lot of our own civic engagement initiatives for a standstill and leaving a lot of young people with limited opportunities to register, to vote and to understand their rights and how to exercise them.
That, is one of the reasons why we worked so hard to do a bunch of online and virtual educational events to provide as many resources to college campuses and high schools, acrosss New, York, City and New York state to help educators, understand the ever- changing laws during this pandemic of how to vote and make sure that their students are getting the correct information, and we will continue to do so in the lead up to the general election so happy to talk more about what we learned during the primary and if any of these things on this screen, interest.
It's been a busy year busy few months, and so I guess we'll end it with just talking about upcoming Gen vote campaigns, Kick it off to ramya to share some of our initiatives that we've been working on since the start of the school year and the end of September end of August and early September and the lead up to the general election.
So, something that we find really important for the New York City hubs to focus on especially leading up to the election is just providing information and in an accessible form to people who are going to be voters or potential voters, and just community members, I'd like to develop a long- standing relationship with the Parks Department, specifically because being the sanctity of parks being sort of just this public space that people go to without the intention of really like spending money and us giving people something that is not a product that we're selling and sort of merging this.
This has not been checked off, and so us being, hopefully knowledgeable sources of that information can provide that for people, and they know that somebody is going to be at this Geneva table on every saturday at this at the various parks, acrosss Brooklyn New York city, wherever we can have And, so that's, I think, a very important starting point for the hubs, because this is a very new campaign that we're doing, and so.
And, so you know, Brownie, basically outlined our upcoming Gen vote hub program, which again we I would love to have folks involved in this community to help us engage community members outside of our college.
If you are able, we not only need folks to get out the vote, but to also protect the vote, and that looks like monitoring poll sites throughout New York City, to make sure that guidelines are being followed with PPE, for example, as well as opening on time.
In just this year, alone, our Gen vote, CUNY Queen's college students worked on their first primary election in New York, five, which.
In a congressional primary campaign, which was exciting, we have students also working on a congressional primary congressional campaign, this November in upstate New York, but we also have students working on the state Senate races, so we We've kind of done it all, and it's really cool to see how our Gen Vote model of engagement is flexible enough to support young people and all different levels of races so happy to show you.
I do not see it being an issue asking if, when things get a little bit, maybe more settled We know school has started if the teachers choose to ask, tell their students about the Community board, and that would have to be all community boards, not just community board too, and that there's an opportunity for them to get involved in civic engagement by going online.
The last thing I wanted to share is that I believe that next month the Brooklyn public library will be presenting I'm, not totally clear whether it's to our committee or the whole community board 2 about the new branch Maybe they're going to be moving into one Clinton street soon the Brooklyn heights branch.
People are also working with teachers to see about getting cards to classes so that the kids can actually have regular library cards so that they can check out print items if needed, but in terms of us going to lobby service.
