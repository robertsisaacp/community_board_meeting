What we do is we have a school year, long program that involves that focuses on wood and boat building, but within the build we're emphasizing social and emotional development and stem skills, development, interpersonal skills, communication, perseverance on the long-term project and all of those all the things that go into any project that begins in October and ends in June, which is a really long project, especially for a young person, and we infuse our what we do with leadership, development and peer learning, as well as part of our programming.
My ela teacher recruited me to join the Brooklyn boatworks club, And I thought it sounded interesting like why not build a boat in school So what we did in the beginning of the class or the program was we basically got used to materials and tools and try to get used to getting comfortable with them, especially when we're going to actually build a real wooden boat, and so what we did is one of the activities we did.
Is there anyone on the committee who wants to ask jasmine about her experience with the Brooklyn boat works, Do, you attend what high school.
I'm sure, because it sounds like you're, a student leader and Jasmine for presenting first , I was asked if Brooklyn boatworks is exclusively a middle school program.
Do students pay for the the process or students never pay, but the schools do pay for under half of the program cost and during the summer we work with the girl, scouts and other and community organizations that we either get give a scholarship to And. They pay a small fee or they pay sort.
I am so thrilled to be with you all today to share a little bit about our work at generation vote and how we are advancing youth voting rights both in new york city and throughout the state, I'm also joined by my colleague and partner in crime, who can introduce herself I've, been with a generation vote for a little while in college and recently earlier this year, I became the organizing director.
Voter suppression, crisis, advance youth, voting rights in new york and beyond and transform the way young people engage in local politics.
We, launched it in the fall of 2017 at binghamton university to basically spread what we call the gen vote model of engagement, which is our training curriculum that supports young people involved in local.
So, for example, that looked like trying to arrange rides to inaccessible off-campus poll sites and my friends at cuny at the time trying to navigate the opaque vote, registration resources and requirements for our city-based students, and so a lot of gen.
I. Remember when I was a student at binghamton waking up at 5am to vote in my very first election, because at the time new york did not have early voting and I had to wake up early and go to the po As a result of all of these challenges that young people were telling us about at generation vote, we decided to roll up our sleeves in our network and get involved in a coalition called.
Some of you may be familiar with new york vote is the largest statewide coalition fighting for voting rights, and there are a lot of organizations that are based right here in Brooklyn, like the Brooklyn voters, alliance, who are active members of this coalition, and we have been involved.
New york state, did a huge overhaul of our election system in 2019 passing laws like early voting, which we just got in the past year, pre-registration of 16 and 17 year, olds, electronic poll books, but we have a long way to go, but even beyond new york, from new hampshire to Florida and wisconsin we've seen young people, especially young voters of color, be forced to jump over immeasurable hurdles to exercise our right to vote and Covid-19 19 has only amplified the impact of these attacks, and some of the headlines here show that, and so this is.
We saw that new york state has a lot of work to do, to get out the youth vote and to pass reforms that advance youth voting rights and tear down the barriers that make it hard for young people to exercise their right and so generation vote is the co-chair of the let new york vote, youth working group with citizens union We are paving the way for our youth voting rights movement right here in new york in November of 2019, we developed the first new york youth voting rights platform at the first youth voting rights and engagement summit in albany new york, and we had students from both high schools and colleges across new york, city and new york state come together to vote on this platform.
So you can actually learn more about these reforms and why they are so important for young new yorkers Here, you can see things like extending time off to vote to schools, mandating on-campus poll sites, lower the voting age 16 for state and local elections, and I think, I think, is really important in 2020 Showed us this passing a student voter empowerment act for suny and cuny colleges to make sure that our public universities are giving our students the not only the information to register to vote, but how to vote and also investing in civic engagement activities on their college.
Issue, and I also share information about the let new york vote coalition, because if any of you are interested in joining our youth working group, we have calls monthly and you can contact us directly after this call to be added to our listservs and those calls are open to the public and would love to plug you all in to the coalition just shared this slide about what we've been up to in the terms of the past three months, to show that our network has been busier than ever, especially during this time of mass confusion amongst young people, about how to register, to vote, how to vote safely and how to organize our peers to vote in this upcoming school year.
Folks in the community, I think we learned a lot this past June about barriers that young people were facing to actually vote in their first presidential primary.
Current public health crisis disrupted schools across new york right before the primary, bringing a lot of our own civic engagement initiatives for a standstill and leaving a lot of young people with limited opportunities to register, to vote and to understand their rights and how to exercise them during a pandemic.
That is one of the reasons why we worked so hard to do a bunch of online and virtual educational events to provide as many resources to college campuses and high schools across new york city and new york state to help educators, understand the ever-changing laws during this pandemic of how to vote and make sure that their students are getting the correct information, and we will continue to do so in the lead up to the general election.
Y'all It's been a busy year busy, few months, and so I guess we'll end it with just talking about upcoming gen vote campaigns, Kick it off to ramya to share some of our initiatives that we've been working on since the start of the school year and the end of September end of august and early September, and the lead up to the general election.
Hubs to focus on especially leading up to the election is just providing information and in an accessible form to people who are going to be voters or potential voters, and just community members.
So I want to launch a campaign with the hubs where we every weekend have young people sort of tabling where we have just free information for people And, so us being hopefully knowledgeable sources of that information can provide that for people, and they know that somebody is going to be at this geneva table on every saturday at this at the various parks across Brooklyn new york city, wherever we can have And, so that's, I think, a very important starting point for the hubs, because this is a very new campaign that we're doing, and so.
And, so you know, brownie, basically outlined our upcoming gen vote hub program, which again we I would love to have folks involved in this community to help us engage community members outside of our college.
If you are able, we not only need folks to get out the vote, but to also protect the vote, and that looks like monitoring poll sites throughout new york city to make sure that guidelines are being followed with PPE, for example, as well as opening on time.
We don't want to put too much on principal's plates right, now, it's a very stressful time, but I think like especially considering that we're less than 40 days away from the election, and there are a lot of high schoolers who maybe aren't registered to vote.
Don't think that's something that we as a committee should even suggest, but if we want to- And, maybe I'm not sure how this would work, Because things are really a little crazy, I, don't see it being an issue asking if, when things get a little bit, maybe more settled We know school has started if the teachers choose to ask, tell their students about the community board and that would have to be all community boards, not just community board too, and that there's an opportunity for them to get involved in civic engagement by going online.
Then the last thing I wanted to share is that I believe that next month the Brooklyn public library will be presenting I'm, not totally clear whether it's to our committee or the whole community board 2 about the new branch Maybe they're going to be moving into one clinton street soon the Brooklyn heights branch.
