Okay, well, rob rob paris, district manager, hey meredith, secretary of the committee, barbara saller gringer; second, vice chair of the community board: okay, Betty hi, I'm betty feybus, chair of youth, education, cultural affairs, okay, All these people are shy.
Just this one outstanding invoice for the the software that allows the staff to access the server and the office from their homes, And so far in the first quarter, so In the first quarter, so I was Does any other committee members have any questions for mr paris about the budget?
Well, just you know, just while we're on that topic conceptually, the committee might want to think about how it might reallocate funds because.
As it looks now, we are going to have unspent money later in the year because we're not spending money, on, say the meals for the executive committee or where we have bought no office.
So, you should, you know, in sort of broad terms, start to think about how else you might want to spend money, because it is quite foreseeable that there will be unspent funds in the first half of 2021.
I do so sometimes in these budget cycles, their recommendations to purchase more stamps, or you know, postage things or paper, or things of that nature that you can just keep and use when you need to, because it is likely with the city's budget situation, that money will be taken.
You know on appropriate things, based on a plan that would be approved by the executive committee or the officers or something that would enhance the work of outreach of the community.
You know the committee left a fair amount of money in reserve last year.
And I'm, going to use my words, perhaps a more user-friendly tool to communicate from a committee and community board 2, perspective, and You are correct, mr singletary, and I had a conversation.
So, let's say communications between staff workers or committee chairs, or something like that: Okay, all right, good and mr jordan, if you, if you would like, I, have brought up the budget.
I mean this way, I'd like people to be able to prepare their questions, beforehand, and Think I I'd like to see the budget I think the budget is what the board approved in last year.
In this way we could save time, but when we have the discussion, okay, I'm, not understanding they'll be asking you how much money did we spend on this?
What I was thinking of also is that we may have some other things that we want to do with the budget so that studying the budget, formulating our questions, we can make decisions, probably by the next meeting, we'll have all that information that we need in order to make decisions as to how much we're going to spend or reallocate from what was what was on the budget.
You, know, I think, from my conversation with, do it they may be coming around to the idea that zoom can be used.
That's you know, sort of a policy call for the community board in my conversations would do it.
I. Think that what you know what the staff would like to do is work with the board to put that in into motion- You know I think we'd almost be willing to table discussion on zoom and focus instead on our ability to broaden the tools that we have for communicating with the public.
Think barbara is asking if the executive committee should discuss broadening the use of social media tools for communication with the public.
No, I think I would like to make a motion that we approve this expenditure today and that we purchase this and so that the office can start using it as soon as possible.
That's what I was thinking of, because we need to present to the general meeting a budget for the next fiscal year, which probably would be in April well, usually March or April, but some it went to may last time and so february.
