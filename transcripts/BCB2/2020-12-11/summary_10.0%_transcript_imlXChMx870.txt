Yes, There is one I had made a comment about the community board's involvement in the closing of Fort Greene Park I.
And we'll make the noted corrections and if you know once we move on, If anybody has any additional comments by what means, please send them to the board office.
I would also add that I've had the opportunity to communicate with for a hall on several occasions, and the governor has extended the order for the public meeting law so that we can continue to work in a virtual environment.
You, know counseling advice from the president's office as well, So you should expect to hear more on that we I was going to have a portion of the meeting tonight to discuss the results of the survey that each of you participated, in, but there's still some information that we had to refine for that.
I found it very insightful to know the makeup of the community boards members, their interests and some of their backgrounds.
Other thing I wanted to mention is that you know moving along to the next item.
I have been very focused, working with the board office and the district manager and everyone to make sure that we change up the way the information is coming out with the district manager's report, as I mentioned at other occasions, and I, don't want to be repetitive.
But I felt like it could have a refresher and a more meaningful way of information, As opposed to just a series of bullet points and paragraphs of the activity, That's happened in the office, and so there is no district manager's report today, because I've asked Rob to make some additional changes.
Next item on the agenda are committees for action and at this time, I'd like to turn it over to Mr John Quinn, who is our parliamentarian to discuss and address the first item for the nomination.
I, cast the vote of the entire board for the election of Barbara Zayler Gringa, as second vice chair and there being only one nominee for Secretary Jessica Thurston.
I, cast the vote of the entire board for the election of Jessica Thurston as secretary, and that completes the work of the nominating committee for this year.
You know what I would say is like many of the train stations that are adjacent to new development, those stations weren't, designed with the density that is now existing in downtown Brooklyn in close proximity to those stations.
So, I think there's a plan, there's a clearly an expression of wanting to have a more adequate, appropriately designed platform for the train stations that support that.
Application here is to sell city-owned development rights from underneath the Manhattan bridge to the adjacent property owner, Who would then use them to build a larger building, I'm sorry, there's a question.
The congestion issue is outside of the scope, maybe of dealer, for they think the addition of the commercial space will continue to add to the congestion as well right, now, I, think we, The general feeling, was that this, the whole project was going to be a problem for the community and especially with congestion.
It's been covered at this point, but I just wanted to be clear that it was an EDC initiative to give all the development rights from the D.O.T lot under the bridge to this building that results that would result in the addition of about six floors or just under 100,000 additional square feet strictly of commercial space at a building that, as Carlton pointed out, is already going to be built strictly as residential.
You know this was very much a negotiated sale despite the fact that an RFP was issued, The city is looking to monetize development rights that they can not use underneath the bridge and they are getting an eight-figure sum of money for those development.
The application is going to proceed and potentially either the borough president or the council member will ask for certain conditions for their support, but the chance of the application being withdrawn and the city just foregoing that income are highly unlikely.
I do not know the outcome or what the testimony entailed at that meeting in the second point, I wanted to make it Rob is right.
Is this something you wanted to ask I wanted to add that we at this point have to take a stand on what the city has promised us in terms of the community benefits and the upgrading of a train, station.
Let me just backtrack a little bit because I know we have a lot of discussion on this motion, but maybe it's me who second, the motion.
Just also pause here, especially for our community board, which affects heavily in gumbo, which was flooded in the last hurricane and also parts of the Brooklyn Navy yard.
The set of zoning recommendations would provide for homeowners, businesses, business owners and practitioners living or working in the city's floodplain, the opt to design or otherwise retrofit buildings to a reduce damage from future flood events be resilient in the long term and c, potentially save long-term flood insurance.
These recommendations build upon the New, York City Department of city planning work with communities throughout the floodplain since Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which identified zoning and land use strategies to help reduce flood risk and support the city's vitality and terminals and improve upon existing zoning rules that were adopted on a temporary emergency basis following Sandy, which is set to expire in the next couple of years.
It's, not so much a change of zoning, but these are optional rules, so that, as buildings are being worked on or being built, especially in Dumbo, and probably at the Navy yard, as well to allow for resiliency in case of you know, When the waters do come up a little too high in our community.
Basically, For our purposes we're trying you know we looking or actually what city planning is looking at.
After discussion with the Department of City Planning representatives, We voted in favor, ten zero with two abstentions, and we asked for the board to support these efforts.
Again, It's not mandatory efforts, but these efforts by the Department of City planning to protect our for our coastal community in our board.
As a follow-up I just want to ask so in the future, developer was going to do some development and they came to us as a community board.
Clips, that's a encapsulation or regurgitation that appear in a whole lot of media that came out in the last year and the army corps of engineers that has a peace with this on a federal level in its it has some impact on flood insurance, but it also has to do with reliable recovery and relief efforts changed the way it's a kind of a sudden inequality, their requirements for things, and they have approached various cities, they're rolling it out on a city-by-city basis and a state-by-state basis, where they're effectively telling the municipality that in time frame have a certain amount of the property, whether it's publicly owned or privately.
Thank you, chair, Singletary I did want to provide the update in Ms, Peterson and Mr Pinoy's absence, because we had a great presentation last week from the Brooklyn navy yard and they provided a lot of helpful information about how they've been responding.
Covid-19, how their businesses have been responding and what they've been doing for the community and overall, It's been a challenging time, but there's some good news, so at the Navy yard.
Then they're also running an internship to a long-term employment program with about 40 recent CUNY graduates, Who will have the opportunity to start working for yard-based businesses and potential on an internship basis and potentially be employed long term, So I, don't know if there are any questions, but otherwise that was pretty much it for the last meeting and happy holidays to everyone.
Thank, you, Mr, Singletary, Good, evening, everyone, The committee met on November 30th, and one of the things that we had on our agenda was on a budget.
Staff is pretty much working at home, except for Mr Paris, and our executive committee is meeting online, so the money that we used to spend for meals or for let's say, sandwiches.
So, while I think many people would wouldn't mind having a community board meeting that only lasts an hour.
Department of Health would note that back in 2018, it was noted as one of the leading health issues for our area, the childhood asthma, and we want to make sure that we stay informed and aware about the issues that are going on.
January 6th, so stay tuned, Any questions for Mr Smith hearing, none next committee to report Parks Recreation, Barbara, Zoller, Grinder, Everyone, first of all, Thank you for the vote.
We had a lot of people who were not on either committee talk about their concerns and we really did not have anyone from outside the community board talk about not taking down the statute.
There's a lot of discussion among members of the committee and other people who are on the meeting about what they do.
I've asked the rest of the committee of the Community board to be patient.
A lot of folks turned out despite the weather, and you know, Hopefully, in a short while there's no delays, there will be a new extension to the Brooklyn bridge.
Community, Board action report about the borough hall having its hearing on November 30th, and somebody said they weren't able to see it just to let you know it is up for anybody to view.
If you got time, that's you know, You can spend four hours looking at the hearing so and then another thing was discussed, I.
There were some more questions that might have come up after that committee meeting and that presentation I just wanted to let everyone know that Candace is doing a workshop for non-profits and for schools on the capital budget process, and what I'd like to do is as soon as I can do.
Brooklyn-Usa. If you want to learn about all the things that our president is doing, you can find it there and if anybody needs to reach me, I will put my information in the chat.
The this report assigns letter degrees to 32 mayoral agencies, plus the comptroller's office, unlike other M/ WBE reporting produced by the city of New York, making the great measures the actual spending of each agency in a fiscal year.
And I want you to know that the D.A and his team, including my unit, the organs, the office of public engagement, really for the past.
Six weeks, have been out in the community at many food distribution efforts that the D.A has led and partnered with throughout Brooklyn, and these are you know, from crown heights to Coney Island to bed-stuy all over the borough, and so D.A wants to really be out in front with leading the effort to make sure that our residents are being accommodated properly with nutrition.
And I wanted to ask Tracy if I missed anything or if you needed to add anything Tracy reports via the chat panel that she's unable to mute, but she did include some links about programs at the Clinton hill branch and, Just speaking, personally, very excited that grab-and-go moves closer and closer to my office with each iteration.
So I mean if you have any questions, please let us know, and that is all thank you.
You appreciate the update and continue to work with the District office, Mr Paris and the team and we'll be sure to try to get on that.
I am coming to you from the community school of Public health I wanted to speak on the issue of food insecurity and this district alone 24 to 34 of households, experience, food insecurity, and these rates continue to rise as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, with which we had spoken a lot about this.
This resolution calls for the expansion of the number of retailers allowed into the snap online purchasing program to address the challenges facing vulnerable communities in New, York City, when accessing food.
The information that you provided could be useful to our community and the area that we serve for CB2 and the office will direct you to the appropriate committee for additional information and possibly a presentation.
Can we get our messages out to the entire community in a better way like a twitter or some other kind of account that allows us to share all of this good information about homelessness and food and the like, and what to do in the event of a homeless person on the street, of which there are way many offices.
As a reminder, maybe to some or as an announcement to others, the board office and particularly Taya, did an excellent presentation on communication.
There are suggestions, ideas and plans underway to be able to use different platforms as I've instructed the board to do continue to use the platforms that we use today to communicate, But we're going to take each one of the different platforms, one step at a time and Rob correct, me.
Thank you, Mr, chair, I, want to ask you Lenny is: Are our colleagues from the Brooklyn public library still on the call or on the meeting.
I think it would be very enlightening to know what is currently going on the ground and also what we're hearing from community members in regards to food.
And she's also been very active in providing that information to the board office so that we can have those presentations which have already which some have taken place before the health environment and Social Service Committee.
Have you communicated or shared that information with the board office.
And I want to thank you for being a voice that always gives us the information and make sure that you know we're inclusive of all the people that we represent in community board.
Thank you for the vote of confidence by reelecting, The executive officers of community Board, 2.
