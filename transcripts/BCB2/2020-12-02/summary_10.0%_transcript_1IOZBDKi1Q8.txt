Okay, this meeting of the sorry, this meeting of economic development and employment Committee of the Brooklyn Heights Board 2, is called to order and is being recorded for public access and archiving in accordance with the New York order.
We're gonna have a presentation today by the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation.
Everyone good evening, I, wanted to just share some of the updates happening on the yard regarding economic development and employment, particularly around the impact that Covid-19 has had on yard-based businesses and our efforts to help businesses weather the storm and our workforce.
We are currently have a rfei or RFP or operator to lease and build out and operate the space on the yard, and the goal of this is just to leave space and to support an operator run incubator to accelerate specifically nwbe entrepreneurs and businesses, and so the link for that is also in the chat.
You can take a look at that and due to just a tremendous amount of interest, we've actually extended the deadline to respond to the RFP from this Friday December 4th to January, 15th, and I'm, going to kind of move into the workforce development space.
So since Covid-19 began about March 15th, The yard spent much of its operations administrative operations remotely, including our workforce development efforts, so we've had about 471 hires and that included some of the early hires that we had in Wegmans and 88 of those were Brooklyn residents.
They are currently operating in a full hybrid model from October, November and now fully remote, but still offering work-based learning opportunities remotely with yard-based employers.
So, a lot of cnc work, which is made, which was part of the you know, inspiration for starting our own kind of training for this.
Okay, any other questions from any committee members I just wanted to say thank you to Regina and that the report was well stated and I'm glad to hear all the particulars and to know that you know there are some things that are still functioning well amidst the place where we are now with the pandemic and everything.
So I appreciate your being able to come on to share that information with the committee, because we love getting updates and we love good information that the community truly benefits.
Looking for someone to operate that on the yard, I wanted I appreciate, that.
We will support, but we do primarily try to focus on the Brooklyn navy, yard, so I would say about 99 of the businesses that we support, hiring efforts for our yard base and that's both just from our own internal capacity and also trying to make sure that the economic opportunity on the yard is what we're focused on connecting to.
We feel like a candidate's resume, is not really advertising their skills best or leveraging their skills, then we'll help them try to create a new one if they like to opt-in so that we can create a better marketing material, Even if you're not going to go for a job on the yard.
You know marketing tool for jobs outside yards, So we do what we can to make sure that every person that we put in front of a business is job ready and every person.
Okay, any other questions for committee members or board.
Okay, any other questions for committee members or board.
I have to drop by seven, but thank you guys both for adding I'm going to add a couple of the links I mentioned in the email address and the chat, and but if there's any other, questions feel free to send me a message.
Okay, Sorry with the current economic and employment situation.
You can start these start actually setting up these presentations beginning in January, okay, and with that also I'd like to offer an opportunity for Denise Peterson to actually give us an update.
We want to first start off with a small group within the committee, approximately one or two people, Maybe one person else in the board whoever's interested in it.
Think that we may want to go back to the presenter from last month and say: well, That's not exactly how it works so who can speak to us about it.
I was wondering if someone had more information on that, like what the timeline is as to when they want to start construction, and if there's you know, gonna be parking and just more public space added to it.
This was just added to show that, Like the Navy yard is still interested in doing it and that you know I, guess: they're.
