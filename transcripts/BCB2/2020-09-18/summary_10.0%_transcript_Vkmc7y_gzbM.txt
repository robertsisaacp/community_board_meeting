First one is Two one Washington Avenue, which is in the Clinton hill, historic district, and the application is to construct a rooftop terrace with planters thing and and a hot tub and inside screening around the existing condensers.
If you go to the Map Hall Street, is just the border of the neighborhood and it has a carrick carriage houses on an on a historic site and Pratt Institute is on the other side.
Everything is set back from the front, so in the section you will see that anything that you see on the roof is actually not visible from the street, because it's set back number of feet from the front and the back facade on the right, and we are also showing the material on the right that we would like to 's a pretty much a historic color, wood, composite wood for the railing and above it, it's actually a vegetable garden shot and the client is right.
A red line is a line of view from acrosss the street, so the planter is moved, back, Four foot, five from the line of the facade, but the cornice actually sticks out.
A, r for 405, vanderbilt, Avenue, a two- story, romanesque revival, Brick, Carriage House, located within the boundaries of the Clinton hill, historic district page two please proposed for 405 vanderbilt Avenue is a one- story.
This image is the 1980 New York City tax photo for 405 vanderbilt avenue and shows the building very much as it appears.
This italian revival building was completed in 1862 and altered in 1928 to accommodate commercial use at the sidewalk level to its right is 405 vanderbilt avenue, which is the larger subject of our discussion this evening and immediately to the right 407 vanderbilt Avenue an empty lot until the year continuing to the right, 409 vanderbilt Avenue, the carriage House and Coachman residence for the mansion at 410, Clinton avenue, designed by the celebrated parfit brothers, the Queen Eye, Queen, Anne, Style, Mansion and carriage House were completed in 1882, and the final carriage house on this block was in fact built as a car garage completed in 1919.
We have another photograph of 405, vanderbilt avenue taken from acrosss the street and at the right we have a credible recreation of the 1941 archive photo presented earlier at the end of the block, 401 Vanderbilt Avenue, then to the right, 405, vanderbilt, Avenue, the new building at 407, vanderbilt, 409, Vanderbilt, Avenue, and then at the right, 413, vanderbilt Avenue, and at this time, I'd like to turn things over to phillips.
Addition went through the zoning review at the DOB, which is at this point, concluded and approved, and initial conversations with two presentations towards LPC, where we actually just had today again a conversation with them to go forward with to CB2.
Looking forward to present on this project , to you guys, the proposed edition- Is, the existing rooftop, which is basically a regular membrane.
What we suggesting here, you see the rooftop with the by code, solar, panels, and I, will go towards a section where we see or that rendering here from existing to New. Basically, it's a carriage house and as Rick mentioned, there was no rooftop extension or anything like that in the past.
Furthermore, the roof shape and its orientation takes into consideration, building code regulation governing installation of solar photovoltaic systems while at the same time avoiding additional mounting structures for solar panels as seen throughout Brooklyn.
You probably saw that whenever you have a brownstone and may owner decides right now to put solar onto it, even when it's in a historical district, most likely they're becoming a aluminum mounting or steel structure, which then hover is hovering above the building.
The addition is set back by four feet from the front of the building and four foot: six from the rear of the existing second floor, with a 30 feet, rear yard, back from the property line, it will serve as an extension to the existing single home in an existing use group 2a, occupancy group and 6 r6b zoning.
So that looks like that, as seen from the street 405 Vanderbilt Avenue The existing here are a couple of details which are important to us.
I, want to say for the record that I support this application and the approach that they're taking to differentiating the addition from the existing building.
And I think that I think that that the palette and the shape of the edition is a nice counter, attack,, I, guess or counterbalance to the existing building, is that a motion to approve I did not want to.
I think it could somewhat work in our floor plan not preferable for sure, but it really came out of the discussion with LPC that they also preferred to mimic out of historical evidence.
I, think it should mimic second floor Would that be more a discussion with LPC as well?
We have discussed this with LPC and it has been a topic of of ours since the very beginning on this fenestration pattern in the rooftop edition mimics, those openings that we find on the first floor, and we want this to have its own identity.
You want to get a unique look and when it just delineates or take additions from other structures that you've seen along vanderbilt, but I do not think it's appropriate, especially with the color and my feeling My personal opinion.
I think it was the affordable housing and the other items that Rob just mentioned was more of a sense of the committee that any actual formal, proposal- Another building on Atlantic Avenue were two of the buildings that were made available for affordable housing as part of the deal with the library at cadman.
This may be a perfect fit, but yes, the income bans start in the mid 80s and they and this building does not conform to what most people think of when they discuss affordable, housing.
We should have some specific details to talk about what we think was approved as affordable, housing.
