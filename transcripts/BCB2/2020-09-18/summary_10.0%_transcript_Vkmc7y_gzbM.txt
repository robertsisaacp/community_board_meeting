First one is two one washington avenue which is in the clinton hill, historic district and the application Is to construct a rooftop terrace with planters thing and and a hot tub and inside screening around the existing condensers.
If you go to the map hall street, is just the border of the neighborhood and it has a carrick carriage houses on an on a historic site and pratt institute is on the other side.
Everything is set back from the front, so in the section you will see that anything that you see on the roof is actually not visible from the street, because it's set back number of feet from the front and the back facade on the right, and we are also showing the material on the right that we would like to.
A red line is a line of view from across the street, so the planter is moved, back, Four foot, five from the line of the facade, but the cornice actually sticks out.
The fencing privacy is fencing to the left and the right neighbors stepping back, because we don't want to see it from the strip since you've done a lot of work on the roof.
We all that that's a fourth house from the corner, so they all they were able to do three to the left and four to toward the cup ten across the street and also the carriage houses on the back and willoughby avenue.
Thank you, mr chair members of community board, two land use committee, good evening, rick, azar r-I-c-k-a-z-a-r for 405 vanderbilt avenue, a two-story, romanesque revival, brick carriage house, located within the boundaries of the clinton hill, historic district page two please proposed for 405 vanderbilt avenue is a one-story rooftop edition with us this evening are architects, phillip and kit von dalwick, and they will present their design for the rooftop edition in a moment, but first some brief remarks regarding the building and street history.
Please this image is the 1980 new york city tax photo for 405 vanderbilt avenue and shows the building very much as it appears today.
This italian revival building was completed in 1862 and altered in 1928 to accommodate commercial use at the sidewalk level to its right is 405 vanderbilt avenue, which is the larger subject of our discussion this evening and immediately to the right 407 vanderbilt avenue an empty lot until the year.
The photo on the right is, of course, 405 vanderbilt avenue, page 10, please, on the left.
We have another photograph of 405 vanderbilt avenue taken from across the street and at the right we have a credible recreation of the 1941 archive photo presented earlier at the end of the block, 401 vanderbilt avenue, then to the right, 405, vanderbilt avenue, the new building at 407, vanderbilt, 409, vanderbilt, avenue And, then at the right, 413, vanderbilt, avenue, and So. We are basically working and representing our client from 405.
The addition went through the zoning review at the DOB, which is at this point, concluded and approved, and initial conversations with two presentations towards lpc, where we actually just had today again a conversation with them to go forward with to cb2.
The addition is set back by four feet from the front of the building and four foot: six from the rear of the existing second floor, with a 30 feet, rear yard, back from the property line, it will serve as an extension to the existing single home in an existing use.
So that looks like that, as seen from the street 405 vanderbilt avenue.
I, want to say for the record that I support this application and the approach that they're taking to differentiating the addition from the existing building.
My number one concern as an architect was maintaining a parapet and the distinctions there, I, guess or counterbalance to the existing building, is that a motion to approve I didn't want to.
I, think it should mimic second floor, It would, We have discussed this with lpc and it has been a topic of of ours since the very beginning on this fenestration pattern in the rooftop edition mimics, those openings that we find on the first floor, and we want this to have its own identity.
I live across the street if well I think we need to vote on on the to approve okay investor anybody.
I think it was the affordable housing and the other items that rob just mentioned was more of a sense of the committee that any actual formal proposal- My daughter brought to my attention that I believe it's 810 fulton street is now ready to accept.
Applicants 810, fulton street and another building on atlantic avenue were two of the buildings that were made available for affordable housing as part of the deal with the library at cadman, plaza.
This may be a perfect fit, but yes, the income bans start in the mid 80s and they and this building does not conform to what most people think of when they discuss affordable, housing.
We should have some specific details to talk about what we think was approved as affordable, housing.
