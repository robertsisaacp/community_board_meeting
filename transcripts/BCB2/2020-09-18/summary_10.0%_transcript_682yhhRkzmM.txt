This meeting of the transportation and public safety committee of Brooklyn community board.
And now we'll begin roll call and introductions I'll start with myself, and then we can just go around the the webex boxes and the committee members can introduce myself themselves : I'm Juliette, Colin, Chang, Chair of the transportation and Public Safety committee, I'm Cheryl Gillis Vice, chair of the committee John Quint Secretary of the committee Sid, my member of the committee member of the board, Cyril Scala member of the committee and member of the board Patrick Sorry Dorian Gallo member of the committee member of the court Patrick Blackie member of the committee Caroline Todd member of the committee and Howard member and the Committee Sandy Unmute yourself, Okay, Sandy Balboa's, a committee member- As, I said, every member of the committee is here except Mr. Do.
We have the relaunch of the rebel scooter, rideshare program, the approval of the minutes, chairpersons, report, other business and community forum.
Let you guys know that we'll be reviewing the statement of district needs that caroline distributed, as well as the comstat reports.
I, think you guys had met with our previous community manager, John White a few months ago and lauren when we initially visited the board and since then, we've relaunched with some safety initiatives.
The same ones that our CEO has same ones , I have, and we work with local workforce partners like say: Nix Alliance, work on workforce innovations really to hire within the community, as well as the New York City Small Business services, who we've hired over 65 different folks from from the very beginning.
Not only what rebel rules are, but New, York, City and state law So, like you, can not ride on a bridge.
If you wanted to actually get back on a Revel, you had to go on the app and take a 20 minute safety training with the 28:42 questions.
The feedback that we've been getting at other community boards and just from people that write in is hey like this exam is pretty comprehensive.
You stop your ride, you're, actually going to get a notification saying hey like you've, been suspended, and this is the reason why so that's a practice step that we've taken We've also really increased our lessons capacity in all four bars where we operate.
We know that maybe at night there have been some issues in other communities, so we just have shut down the service overnight from midnight to 5.
If you're writing two blogs three city blogs like we can just use technology to know so, the next time they I think one just went by so the next time.
So like what we do not do is stop your ride Mid ride because it's fairly dangerous on the city streets, But once you conclude your ride and you end your ride, the next time you would try to log in you, Would actually just be suspended, so you would not be able to do so What do people have to do to get off suspension So if you're riding like through a park, there's nothing , you can do You know change your mind about the fact that you should be back on the platform, so there's some suspensions, for example, if you're not wearing a helmet, we'll suspend you for seven days, the first time, but if you do it again, then you're permanently off the platform, because we feel like a user that is caught.
We rely more on the community reporting, as well as our staff, so because we have a network of 3,000 bikes throughout the city, we're constantly doing batteries bikes around So. That's one of the ways that we make sure that we catch people who are on the bike lane and people tend to report that activity, often so, as a follow- up question.
I know your GPS catches, people going on one way streets and things like that, but if there's an over amount of rebel because it would be tempting human nature, that would be a tempting place for a rebel rider to actually to ride.
If any community complain about a rebel rider on a bike lane and you submit a photograph which is suspend that user right away?
You know it's having a driver's license and getting on a motor scooter, two different things to navigate on a city street, and what are you?
This is not like riding a bike or driving a car, so I'm just surprised: We had the motorcycle safety training school work with us on the curriculum which they loved they're available in all four boroughs.
You do anything in your new safety program to improve the safety of the vehicle like sometimes the tires may have been a little bit more bare than would have been optimal to say right in the rain or any other safety improvements to the actual scooters themselves.
That vehicle was just extra popular that day, but they're constantly being replaced, and we do bags of 20 or 30 liners so that we know like the next user is going to have them, even if it had 10 days, 10 racks a day, and there is two people per ride.
You know there are a lot of instances where people just do not have like a dead, the dedicated time to go in, but they have been riding a motorcycle.
We do sometimes have one or two that we have to recycle if it if it does not work, anymore Okay, I'm, going to open it up now to members of the Community board.
I was just going to say: I think you guys are doing a really great due diligence job and trying to put together a lot of facets of your business without the state or the city.
That I think could happen as far as bike lanes and things like that.
What about something that's more visible than black like for night riding, like maybe the light blue color or some other, more repeat, I, think we're kind of exploring what you know.
Just speaking of night time, I really, I think, that the closing between 12 and 5 is really smart, as people start going out, more, except for healthcare, workers.
Of course, you know people are more likely to be drunk after midnight, so I think you're.
So I would like to thank you for coming before a committee and presenting and answering our questions and good luck in the continued outreach to the community.
Think it's just You know the John may have made attract changes edit, but if there are no more edits, Next, I'd like to share the compstat report.
We get a written report or a written report anyway So it could be an NCO So, the Exo or the commanding officer, if possible, but if not then we'd like to get somebody who can speak and maybe the head of the NCO unit as opposed to a particular neighborhood which may not be seeing you know, If we get Brooklyn heights NCOS.
And I think that they should be made aware that the community, as we are the Community Board of representatives, we would like them to at least come to a meeting or show us and tell us why and what's going on with this?
That, like rerouting of traffic, will surely happen, but I do not know that it will necessarily increase pollution, congestion and stifling of neighborhood, businesses.
You know all the neighborhoods are going to be impacted by traffic, so I do not think we're.
I. Think I would stick with more general design goals of like, and you know, like Brian said these are vague things, but sustainability, okay, just to stay away from like the specific design, options.
Something trying to think of like solutions does not work, does not worsen climate change.
That second thing: you say, I think, is a good idea and I wonder if we could extend it to like holding apprenticeships and internships for youth with some of the alternative justice programs.
I, understand that now is that I think anything we can do to create programs that are not from the police related to the community are helpful.
I went to a one of the 84th precinct councils and there was like a youth training program with the fdny, and that was a really good way for Fdny to connect with the community.
You know in uniform, and I think that this is like something that is often seen as different from like what the police department will often tweet about, like our officers playing volleyball with some kids as they did the other day.
I think it works both ways for the kids to see the police in a different relationship.
They have you know, so I think the understanding that you know police are family people , They're people in the community.
Okay, yeah, they received city funding all right as long as it's getting city funding, let's keep it in And, then people can vote on it in the greater Community Board.
, there's an updated meeting scheduled for next week, where they're going to talk to some of the community people, and let us know when, where they are at this point.
You know one week in September, October, I, think November and then four months in the beginning of 2021, but it's the last of the sandy, the damage from Sandy's the 11th project, So A lot of the what they have found is that when they provide shuttle service that most people really would rather have train service.
