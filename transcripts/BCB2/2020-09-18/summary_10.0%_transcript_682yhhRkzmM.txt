This meeting of the transportation and public safety committee of Brooklyn community board.
During the chairpersons report I, wanted to let you guys know that we'll be reviewing the statement of district needs that caroline distributed, as well as the comstat reports, and if do we have a motion to approve the agenda?
I think you guys had met with our previous community manager, john white a few months ago and lauren when we initially visited the board and since then, we've relaunched with some safety initiatives.
I think, for the most part, most folks are familiar with revel in the area, so I'm just going to move through this fairly quickly, so that we can really have some time to do a q, I'm sure everyone will have several questions so a rebel or a street legal vehicle that parks on the street, no sidewalk, pretty space, efficient, quiet, 100, electric rather affordable.
That, our ceo has same ones, I have and we work with local workforce partners like say: nix alliance, work on workforce innovations really to hire within the community, as well as the new york city, small business services, who we've hired over 65 different folks from from the very beginning.
Not only what rebel rules are, but new, york, city and state law So, like you, cannot ride on a bridge.
The feedback that we've been getting at other community boards and just from people that write in is hey like this exam is pretty comprehensive.
So we're really the first micro mobility company to have mapped out all one-way streets in new york city , Actually, gonna, get a notification saying: hey like you've been suspended, and this is the reason why so that's a practice step that we've taken We've also really increased our lessons capacity in all four bars where we operate.
We know that maybe at night there have been some issues in other communities, so we just have shut down the service overnight from midnight to 5am.
They wouldn't be able to access it, Would actually just be suspended, so you wouldn't be able to do so, and what do people have to do to get off suspension So if you're riding like through a park, there's nothing, you can do that's gonna.
You know change your mind about the fact that you should be back on the platform, so there's some suspensions, for example, if you're not wearing a helmet, we'll suspend you for seven days, the first time, but if you do it again, then you're permanently off the platform, because we feel like a user that is caught.
I know your gps catches, people going on one way streets and things like that, but if there's an over amount of rebel because it would be tempting human nature, that would be a tempting place for a rebel rider to actually to ride.
This isn't like riding a bike or driving a car, so I'm just surprised: We had the motorcycle safety training school work with us on the curriculum which they loved they're available in all four boroughs.
Have you know your overall rights, the second that you get on a rebel you're, covered, so, although all of our rides come with insurance,?
You do anything in your new safety program to improve the safety of the vehicle like sometimes the tires may have been a little bit more bare than would have been optimal to say right in the rain or any other safety improvements to the actual scooters themselves.
Most of the consequences for bad behavior is just an explosion, so they you know you're gone How. Do we make sure that they are there for people who are renting the vehicle so kind of like lauren mentioned as part of like the battery,?
You know there are a lot of instances where people just don't have like a dead, the dedicated time to go in, but they have been riding a motorcycle.
Our batteries are intended to also last that long, we do sometimes have one or two that we have to recycle if it if it doesn't work, anymore, it's a dead battery Okay, I'm, going to open it up now to members of the community board.
I was just going to say: I think you guys are doing a really great due diligence job and trying to put together a lot of facets of your business without the state or the city.
Of course, you know people are more likely to be drunk after midnight, so I think you're.
So I would like to thank you for coming before a committee and presenting and answering our questions and good luck in the continued outreach to the community.
You have any comments you can give, you can give them to the district, office, and You know the john may have made attract changes edit, but if there are no more edits, Next, I'd like to share the compstat report.
That is our number one pressing issue that is in our statement of district needs for public safety is gun.
We get a written report or a written report anyway And Okay, so the exo or the commanding officer, if possible, but if not then we'd like to get somebody who can speak and maybe the head of the nco unit as opposed to a particular neighborhood which may not be seeing you know, If we get Brooklyn heights ncos.
And I think that they should be made aware that the community, as we are the community board of representatives, we would like them to at least come to a meeting or show us and tell us why and what's going on with this?
I wasn't actually thinking for our statement, but it could be that the community board wants to be.
That came out as a result of that, with our revised statement of district needs, The rerouting of traffic will send tens of thousands of vehicles into local communities, increasing the risk of crashes, environmental, pollution, congestion and stifling of neighborhood businesses.
That, like rerouting of traffic, will surely happen, but I don't know that it will necessarily increase pollution, congestion and stifling of neighborhood, businesses.
We know that if they're going to take parking, the small businesses are gonna are going to be impacted, so I, don't I do think.
I, just I hate to be a broken record, but we're talking about probably the largest highway project in new york city for maybe a decade Nothing in here that says, like it's important, that the city deal with it in a way that isn't, you know also destructive in ways that affect community board.
So, de-escalation techniques, bias training, as well as dealing with persons of with mental health, homelessness and other issues, and Do we have a statement that calls for first responders to be something other than police officers to be mental health professionals or other people who know how to deal with people having mental health or drug emergencies?
I just want more opportunities like we talked about the center for court, innovation and stuff, like that, Rather us think about allocating money to things that weren't in the department of corrections and the police department than that were in the police department like community-based programs.
You know they do have preschool and after school programs and caroline is right: After school programs, not just sports after school program, cheryl, like other sorts of after school programs, They can have internships, as everybody was saying, internships, even technical training, classes, things that are useful for communicators, things that pick a job.
I, understand that now is that I think anything we can do to create programs that are not from the police related to the community are helpful as we move toward a world where.
You know in uniform, and I think that this is like something that is often seen as different from like what the police department will often tweet about, like our officers playing volleyball with some kids, As they did the other day, Did I.
Think the understanding that you know police are family people , They're people in the community.
Okay, yeah, they received city funding all right as long as it's getting city funding, let's keep it in And, then people can vote on it in the greater community.
, there's an updated meeting scheduled for next week, where they're gonna talk to some of the community people, and let us know when, where they are at this point.
