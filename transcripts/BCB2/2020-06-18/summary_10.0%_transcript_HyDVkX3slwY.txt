Cities transfer of development rights to the private, real estate, firm, rap, Ski group who's joining us today, just to check is Ray Lebanon, as he will be preside, he's presenting that the developers portion of the presentation- I'll just continue, so the transaction will produce job generating commercial office in Brooklyn and outer borough business district.
So EDC began this project by issuing a request for proposals in 2017, where the sale of development rights from two city- owned Lots under the Manhattan Bridge, which the New York City Department of Transportation, currently uses.
The city saw an opportunity to create commercial office space to create jobs in accordance with our New York Works plan, using that development potential that otherwise would not have been able to be used on remarks.
As Christina said into 2017, there was an RFP issued which was designated to the Raske group for the transfer of about 98 thousand square feet of development rights for office, use.
It's a twenty six story: building with retail on the cellar floor lobby space on the first floor, 90 spaces of for parking on the second floor, but there ninth floors would be for the commercial office use which again, which is what the development rights would be used.
This were by comparison and as the right development, we would have the same amount of residential floor area and the building would essentially be the same height as we're proposing right, now.
Not talking about me all right, I mean just answer the question that the residential floor area is unaffected by it by the land- use actions we're seeking here the disposition, the residential floor.
The office is what would be coming in through the city approval, so the height of the building may be a little bit skinnier in the as of right scenario, but it would have the same amount of residential floor area and the same height But you're, putting in how many floors that you're putting in six floors of commercial office.
Here's what the building's going to look like as you can see, the sort of tan lower floors are the office floors and then the sort of inset space between the office and the residential is an amenity space and some mechanical equipment in that area.
Space created from the development rights, which is what EDC in the city, are mandating, that it only be used for commercial offices.
There was no Street, frontages, no transparency, no commercial, so that will change with the new building skree trees, which will be provided, and there are you, know, local, of W MWBE commitments for hiring fairly straight forward in terms of what we're , what we're seeking what the city is seeking to do in terms of just taking floor area that exists, underneath the bridge which can't really be utilized by the city and allowing it to be utilized for office space within our building within the current zoning envelope Just I see a lot of questions coming up, given the limitations that we have only one limited to our committee and board members.
You believe that the office is not a benefit, so I understand that, because we have so much commercial right now and all I see are people leaving commercial spaces.
We have to accept more density and more people down here without any help of how to bring them in how to keep them happy how to work with the neighborhood there's going to be At least 700 residential units dumped on us And we're getting no help whatsoever with things that actually add to quality of life.
You know further than Bob, so the ideas that the developer would create retail space to help further active skate, and if there is no transfer of development rights, the developer would really just build a fully residential, So And in they would not be obligated to abide by any of the local hiring probes, including fire NYC in the minority.
That's, why you're coming to Europe and that's the only part that we're going to be discussing star, correct You want the office space incorporated into this building or whether it'll just be a straight residential building and obviously the city gets.
We buy those development right from the city, so the city gets a benefit, a cash benefit We end up building a little a little more square footage with office, space.
You, said our application is for work at the first floor of the South facade off of Ridge Street, and work includes modifications to the entrances replacement of two existing stairs, replacing them with new stairs and an accessibility platform lifts installing new canopies over the redesigned entrances and installing a safety railing for an exterior stair to the Sun. This is the tax block.
All of this surrounding area is public space, and this is a subway station here and the Brooklyn- Queens expressway, going over the lock like I, said.
Our proposal is to convert this to an elevator lobby for the school and residential use, and then this is the area where the Exterior stair is that's going to have that safety railing, and then this is a proposed.
Here's just an overview of the facade Like I said this: is the existing loading dock area, That's, going to have a fence, here, I'm.
All of the metal work for the fence for the steel for the canopy and the new entrances are going to match the existing window.
You vote yeah 69 Green Street, which is a petition for replicable consent, which means basically that if you know the property owner wishes to do something on what we call the public highway or in this case the walkway or a sidewalk And you're doing a stupe work, basically coming from their building.
They have the same treatment of the revocable sidewalk, so new construction, B1 desiccation towards the building built, 71 Green, had gotten vocal consent within the last three years and the new ones, and then 69, green or 67 green and back in 2012 So what we're looking at is LPC's already approved the work that has been proposed.
Nuts to the Williamsburg, Savings Bank, building right near the Atlantic terminal, and this is a proposal by both Brooklyn music school and Gotham developers to construct a new 24 storey.
The property opposition is going to be coming from people who live in the or next to the Williamsburg, Savings Bank, building and I.
The other building The 21st storey height ever all of coming from the Brooklyn music school Carlton, I, do not know if you're aware, or about Saint Felix back in the 90s that whole street collapsed.
Think A legitimate concern is to, if we're going, to build another large structure at that site that you know we should be.
Will this you know be of any use if people start going elsewhere, who would have taken, let's say occupancy, either buying or renting high- Housing high- end retail, that The people who are doing developments in arm area, especially along Flatbush, Avenue?
Let's say to their second home: Some people have just left all together because of the uncertainty of things going on at this time.
The other piece to build on that is that the city is working on some plan that would accommodate any Euler have to accommodate more than affordable, housing, the homeless, population.
When we up zoned, downtown Brooklyn thinking, we were going to get jumped We wound up getting all housing and market rate.
The number of people have left because of the combination of the two, so I think it's You know this may be academic exercise, but all these housing construction are actually tied to the market as I understand we're heading into a recession.
Building that work is resumed there they're constructing, like crazy and I, do not know how many people are aware that these are huge building right behind Long Island University took part of the athletic field and it's gone up.
What will happen once these buildings are completed and they open for business and open to try to get people to come and use them to live in them or work in them or whatever?
