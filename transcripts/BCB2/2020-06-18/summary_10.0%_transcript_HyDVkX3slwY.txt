Cities transfer of development rights to the private real estate, firm, rap ski group, who's joining us today, just to check is ray lebanon, as he will be, preside, he's presenting that the developers portion of the presentation- I'll just continue, so the transaction will produce job generating commercial office in Brooklyn and outer borough business district As we look forward to recovery from the current public health crisis, it's really important to plan for jobs that are close to where people live.
So EDC began this project by issuing a request for proposals in 2017 where the sale of development rights from two city-owned Lots under the Manhattan Bridge, which the New York City Department of Transportation, currently uses So. The city saw an opportunity to create commercial office space to create jobs in accordance with our New York Works plan, using that development potential that otherwise would not have been able to be used on remarks, and we reached an agreement with the Raps key group in 2019 for the transfer of approximately a hundred thousand square feet of development rights to rap skis, adjacent parcel, which would be used exclusively for commercial office development because of the transfer of development rights from the city to a private entity.
We have the property here at 69, Adams Street, which is under the Brooklyn Bridge and is generally bound by Adams Street Front Street Pearl, Street and York Street We have been working with EDC and again, as Christina said into 2017, there was an RFP issued, which was designated to the raske group for the transfer of about 98 thousand square feet of development rights for office use is approval of the disposition of that floor area, the building itself, which I'd love to show you, but if I can't I will describe to you it's a twenty six story: building with retail on the cellar floor lobby space on the first floor, 90 spaces of for parking on the second floor, but there ninth floors would be for the commercial office use which again, which is what the development rights would be used for.
so you said, as of right, it would have the same height and the same residential I whenever I mean just answer the question that the residential floor area is unaffected by it by the land-use actions we're seeking here the disposition, the residential floor areas, the residential floor area The office, is what would be coming in through the city approval.
I think we're obligated to contribute to a street fund Next here's what the building's going to look like as you can see, the sort of tan lower floors are the office floors and then the sort of inset space between the office and the residential is an amenity space and some mechanical equipment in that area.
There was no Street, frontages, no transparency, no commercial, so that will change with the new building skree trees, which will be provided, and there are, you know, local of W MWBE commitments for hiring fairly straight forward in terms of what we're , what we're seeking what the city is seeking to do in terms of just taking floor area that exists, underneath the bridge which can't really be utilized by the city and allowing it to be utilized for office space within our building within the current zoning envelope just I see a lot of questions coming up, given the limitations that we have only one limited to our committee and board members.
You believe that the office is not a benefit, so I understand that, because we have so much commercial right now and all I see are people leaving commercial spaces We have to accept more density and more people down here without any help of how to bring them in how to keep them happy how to work with the neighborhood There's gonna be at least 700 residential units dumped on us and we're getting no help whatsoever with things that actually add to quality of life.
This out are people still seeing the presentation So in terms of the office space I mean I would just say that you know the city planning for long-term job growth and making investments for the city's future I think there.
This was just an information presentation for the committee for our committee and anybody else who you know is listening At some point there will be a Euler application for the disposition of city-owned property, All Euler applications are currently being held in to the coronavirus and the D planning's, not being sure how to handle applications in a virtual environment, and neither am I So. The only reason why we may even see this in front of your lip is because of the city property other than the city property You want the office space incorporated into this building or whether it'll just be a straight residential building and obviously the city gets.
You know, I, know we're just talking about additional commercial density but kind of transit and other infrastructure issues, and don't know You agenda that we have I Thank the presentation Applications for people who are not speaking if you could just put yourselves on mute That was one of the things that we're gonna state at the beginning , I Think everybody's, seeing the agenda I need a couple of people just to give us a motion to approve the agenda motion to approve Bilson or anybody else.
Railing This is an existing entrance for the first learn manufacturing So. Here's just an overview of the facade like I said this is the existing loading dock area, the existing manufacturing entrance and this exterior stair down to the cellar That's going to have a fence here: , here's that proposed fence facade All of the metal work for the fence for the steel for the canopy and the new entrances are gonna match the existing window.
I have a motion to disapprove the application Do. Second I Second, starting at the top again You vote, 69 Green Street, which is a petition for replicable consent, which means basically that if you know the property owner wishes to do something on what we call the public highway or in this case the walkway or a sidewalk The petition is to construct and the public right-of-way a stoop for before the bill.
The first is on 265 Front Street, which we previously did at a Just to let you know that the bar o president will be now doing their part of the Euler for 265 Front Street in vinegar, Hill , the bar President does have did send out a newsletter with links so for people or anyone who's interested in participating in that part of the ulid process or I guess contact somehow contact the bar president's office, but there was a newsletter that was sent out by the borough president with the links to the meeting My second thing is yes, 1:30, st Now that the Executive Committee has made the decision to approve the presentation, for the change of eyes has changed, but its certificate and landmark preservation, certificate of appropriateness for 130, st Felix Street Some of you may be aware of it or not, but well it is a vacant lot, nuts to the Williamsburg, Savings Bank, building right near the Atlantic terminal, and this is a proposal by both Brooklyn music school and gotham developers to construct a new 24 storey building at that site, which would benefit the Brooklyn music school and also have rentals and generate income.
You know there's no opposition to the Brooklyn music schools word or the desire to have this The property opposition is going to be coming from people who live in the or next to the Williamsburg, Savings Bank building and I Think, the other building, the 21st storey height ever all of coming from the Brooklyn music school Carlton I , don't know if you're aware, or about Saint Felix back in the 90s that whole street collapsed Yes. How do they say because it's nothing but subway tunnels and separate lines, but that's a fact: I, don't know if people on the board is a report and we start drilling and doing foundation work One that block the history of you know collapsed There's the subway tunnels You may want to know that a1 Flatbush Avenue, which is a new building right by Flatbush in Fulton, has been sold to goldman sachs for fifty seven million dollars and just wanted to throw that out there all right.
The community benefit is super unclear, so you have to You know a large stock differences just obviously seen their interest, but it's going to be the same with them without the space there's some sort of renderings or floor class of like what the building looks like before and whatever look like, and it's not only more difficult when you're climbing out when there's almost seems like to be a thousand people coming down the ramp at the same time, Are there any other open, stash people who wish to speak for a couple minutes at the open, session?
Don't know how many people are aware that these are huge building right behind What will happen once these buildings are completed and they open for business and open to try to get people to come and use them to live in them or work in them or whatever?.
