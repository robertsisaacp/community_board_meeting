The minutes read that we approve it by consensus thanks a lot: Miss, Thurston, okay, so committees for action, the health environment and Social Services Committee. Thank you, Mr Jordan, I'm happy to thank Smith okay. So we had we had four liquor licenses at our November meeting. There was no community objections or oppositions presented for any of the four liquor licenses, but I'll go through each one of them here: okay, first location, 57, front street m Dumbo, Em Dumbo. This is a location for a vietnamese restaurant they're, going for a full on premise: liquor license background music. Only they're gonna be open until 9:00 pm Monday to Thursday 10 P.M Friday through Sunday. We encourage them to hire locally and we they and we confirm that they've spoken with their nearby residents and there were no concerns expressed. The motion was approved 7-0-0. Secondly, we had 673 Atlantic Avenue, which is the which is entitled the Simpson restaurant. This is going to be a caribbean and soul. Food, restaurant and it's going to be open, 11:00 a.m, to 12 midnight Monday through Thursday, 11, A.M to 1, A.M, Friday and Saturday, and 10 a.m to 10 p.m. On Sunday, this is gonna, have background music and occasional live music and private parties. At this location, we asked about exposure to nearby residential housing and they've spoken with the nearby residents above and across the street, and no concerns were expressed. We had some discussion because this was apparently going to be a pretty big restaurant about the level of security that they were going to have. The the representative indicated that he had previously worked as a executive chef at Bb kings, where he was familiar with having security and just to put it in scale. They were gonna have like one or two security officers, where the total capacity was around 200 people, but I think with his level of experience and the fact that he indicated it wasn't expected to be full most of the time they indicated they were gonna employ 25 to 30 people. We made a motion and approved it 7-0-0. Thirdly, this is the one that got added onto the agenda. It's 121 bridge park drive Brooklyn Bridge Park, Cafe Inc. This is a full on premise. Application, for it appears to be a. It appears to be a cafe here in the park. It's going to be near pier 6 and we they're going to be open from 7 A.M to 10 p.m. There's an outdoor area with seating out in front and with view of the water they anticipate our opening end of January or early February, though they weren't sure. If it was going to be delayed, they indicated that they were making an effort to meet with local residents when once they get on site when they begin the project and with and they're open I think I mentioned at 7:00 a.m, to 10 p.m. Every day of the week. So it's we had a motion approved on that one: seven zero. Then. Finally, we've got Jennifer Bistro located at 229 Livingston street. This is a location they're going to have kind of finger foods and liquor. The hours are 12 p.m, to 10, P.M Monday to Thursday, 12 P.M to 11, P.M, Saturday and 2 p.m, to 10 p.m. On Sunday, the you know, I never struck my attention at the committee, but I figured it out afterwards that this is actually located in the current Jennifer Furniture store there on Livingston and Elm, and now it's going to be the I guess the Jennifer Bistro I don't know if they have a connection, but there we verified that they had ADA equipment to facilitate people getting in and out. They indicated there's going to be a special elevator there I think. If you know the location, you know it's kind of like downstairs and they're gonna hire about 50 they're, going to hire about 10 people. Their capacity is about 55 to 60. no outdoor space and the applicant had managed or five prior restaurants. He never had a prior issue with noise or any other concerns this one. We had a motion to approve by a margin of five zero, with two abstentions, so the that those are the four items that we had and again they were all either unanimous or with a couple abstentions, and there were no community concerns expressed. Okay, thank you very much. Mr Smith, I'm gonna call you Mr Brandon Smith. Okay, so are you there's a motion? Are you making a motion to approve these sure I? Make a motion to approve all of these items? Is there a second okay, Mr Gordon is second and now this is open for discussion and questions. Any questions from the committee. Yes, Ms Clint. Thank you for recognizing me just with the one that's in Brooklyn bridge park, because I noted it wasn't on the agenda that went out to the community for this meeting. Was it on the public agenda for the committee meeting so that community members would have known to come forward? It was on that great. Thank you. It's on the agenda yeah. We got it yeah and let me I guess correct myself. So thank you very much. Miss Quinn, but I should have asked for the questions from the committee first and then there's any other questions. So that's all right, miss Quinn, I, didn't see any other committee members, any other members of the committee that have a question or concern. Okay, no questions or concerns, there's any other questions from those that are in attendance. Okay, if not hearing none motion has been made and do and duly seconded all those in favor. Just the committee members, the chairs and the co-chairs. If the if the chair is not here, okay, one two Miss Darson, are you saying the hands I am but I did want to ask Mr Singletary how he votes? Oh Mr, Singletary's, here, okay, he is, but he is on mute and my there is in favor. Okay. Thank you good to go. I got everyone, okay, very good, so the next committee would be land use, but since Mr Singletary is here, sorry Mr, Singletary I didn't see you. I'm gonna turn the meeting over to you. Thank you. Mr Jordan, I appreciate you taking the meeting off in my absence and even though I wasn't here. I know you did a fantastic job, so thank you next committee to report on is land use. Mr Gordon. Are you ready? I am ready. Thank you. What I like to do since the first and third items are for board approval I like to do those briefly, so that we can just make a quick discussion and then do the landmark preservation application, which will then be voted by the executive committee. So first. Well, let's take a keep. Yes, okay, we had a apple. We did briefly have a application for 69 a Europe application for 69 Adams Street, which is it's the own property under the Manhattan bridge in you know, which is considered in Dumbo. The application was to build a large building about 26 28 stories, with both commercial and residential units via big property there, and, generally speaking, while there was some approval by some of the bigger main peoples, there was generally no support from community members. People who testified- and our committee voted unanimously to reject the application. Our biggest concern there was that, once this property is built, this was much greater pressures on the Walk Street F train station people who are familiar and I've I have climbed out of the York Street F train station, which has only one exit entrance and I've climbed out of there, especially during daytime business hours, and it's really difficult, and that was one of the biggest concerns and just the general concern of people in the community in Dumbo were very concerned that this property would put so much pressure on the community. So the our committee rejected it unanimously and that one's gonna go to the board. The other item- that's going to be going to full board is the zoning for coastal flood resiliency, which was proposed by the Department of City planning. We approved this one, ten, zero, two abstentions. Basically, what it's that's about is it was the concern is the coastal areas, especially in Dumbo, have been vulnerable to flooding. Fact. Dumbo did flood during the last big hurricane that we had, and there was also some damage flooding damage over at the Navy yard, and what the Department of City planning was came up with was we're trying to come up with. Let's see, propose additional ways that people who are building and have buildings along these coastal areas, especially here on the East, River and all about bay, but mainly, is that they would be able to build. Let's say instead of just putting all the mechanicals on the ground floor, the basement, as you normally would they'll be able to go upstairs. You know up further. There would be more ways for people to ground these things so that you don't have flooding the next big hurricane or big storm that may come up. So that's we listen to them. They have you know, sounds to sound proposal. It's not a full requirement, but it is a way for future buildings to filter your future construction to avoid the flooding, especially in Dumbo. But this is a full. It's a full city-wide projects, not just for our own district and that was approved by Us102. I'm going to hop back to our landmark preservation, Commission and that's for your approval. This one is 18 Willoughby Avenue in the fourth green historic district. The application was to replace the existing one over one windows at the front and at the front facade with two over two windows, the existing openings- and we have here yes yeah and that the free the front for the rear facade to install new windows and doors in the existing and modified openings, removing some existing brick and installing new brick relocating doors at the second floors and installing new doors. At the third floor at the yeah the doors at the third floor, the applicant was anticipating LPC staff approval for iron work, firing work that was going to be replacing the rear at the rear facade this one we approved unanimously eleven zero. It was a nicely done application, basically to redo the brickwork, which was starting to get a little old and deteriorating and then moving their windows around. It was done in an orderly fashion. It was very nicely done, they're doing some work in the back as well, but they're not extending it. In any extensions, however, we were concerned that they would know that they should notify their neighbors and they said that they would notify neighbors we'd like to work. We approved it eleven zero and we asked for your approval. Thank you, Mr Gordon. Let me ask: are there any objections to approving the entire presentation or the items that people would prefer to have called out and do a separate vote all right? So we'll do this all together. I'll entertain a motion. Yes, Martin I was unmuting myself. I do have a question up until this meeting, the executive board has been acting on behalf full board. The way Carlton presented this tonight was that these two issues would be going to the full board. So I just wanted to. You seem to now be putting the three of them together for a vote tonight. So first I just wanted to clarify that, and my other question is I was at most of the public hearing the other night on this on the 69 Adams issue and I was wondering if so, I didn't hear the discussion at the committee level, but I was wondering if committee members would have been in favor of the building. Had there been no commercial, it would have been as of right without the commercial, so it wouldn't have even been before the committee. Yes yeah, okay, yeah, Barbara, no I. Think the general made this there was a general dislike for the proposal, commercial and residential, or just the residential, the as of right or the additional that they were asking for under the Euler application. There was a general generally, almost every like I, said almost every non-bin person who testified against it. The committee did not like it. It's very large and the biggest concern again is the pressure that this building would place and especially at the size of it, would place on the local transit and the community as a whole. So it was generally disliked the only thing that to get back to your first point, the only thing that I'm asking for- or the committee's asking for, of course is approval of the 18 Willoughby. The other items are going to go to the full board. I just brought them up as discussion to report to the executive committee, our decisions, but you don't you guys- are not going to make the decision at this point the board's going to make the decision on the zoning ad and the 69, so it would have to be individual voting that has to be done right. Yeah, it's going to be a little call. Yeah you'll use the roll call yeah we're gonna have to figure out hello. I'm sorry, let me jump in we're not going to hash that out now we know how to yeah. You have to bring us back to getting us on track because I don't want to get us off track. That's one number two thank you Barbara and Carlton for reminding me that we do have a full board meeting in December, because I forgot that so now that I'm back we're all on track, I'll entertain a motion to accept the community's recommendation for 18 Willoughby Avenue Betty can I get a second Mr Jordan. Is there any discussion on the motion for 18 Willoughby Avenue hearing none all in favor. Anyone opposed any abstentions. Great. Thank you sure. Thank you. Number five commit committees to report economic development and employment. All right. Someone said that one more time: committees to report economic development and employment parks and recreation. Thank you. Mr Singletary. We met on November 16th and we were delighted to have from the borough president's office the capital, the budget, the capital budget director, Candace Julian. She gave us some an overview of the process of handling the funds that the borough president has from the city, and that would cover the parks and she suggested that we work with the Brooklyn parks. Commissioner Marty Marr on issues that we are specifically interested in and that he meets with the borough president to discuss priorities for the parks, and so it was very good to have her I had asked. We all had opportunity to ask questions. I in particular was interested in the frustration we frequently experience because of the length of time that parks, capital projects take to to be finished and at the present time, unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way to get around. That I did want to mention that we, the Photoville, exhibit that we have featured before is still up to the end of the month. If you haven't seen it council, member Levin is conducting his participatory budgeting for those in his district, and our next meeting will be a joint meeting on December 7th I. Believe it is that Monday with the Yucca committee and discussing the statute in Columbus park, I think any questions. If not I'd like to wish everyone a very happy thanksgiving and a safe, thanksgiving, I know it's going to be a little different this year for most of us- and just so you know, I, don't believe I've ever before and probably never will again introduce myself as Mrs Martingringer. Thank you. Okay, transportation and public safety, Juliette hi everybody we met on Thursday of last week, the presenter was Ann Marie Lewison from the center for alternative sentencing employment cases. They are, as in the title, an alternative to incarceration program that works with young offenders with mentally challenged and broader array of inmates. They have been working since 1960. They work as through a referral system from defense attorneys in Manhattan, although they serve Brooklyn clients and they are located in downtown Brooklyn. Caroline was kind enough to identify them and did the outreach to bring them our to our committee. So they talked to us about all of their interesting programs, and our committee had a good discussion with them. We talked to them about the differences between their program and the community court system that Brandon had educated us on in a previous committee meeting. She did express concern about such issues as the closing of Rikers. Now that the city budget is lower because of Covid-19, and also we talked about homelessness as a public safety concern. So I know that the House Committee is having a canba come to their a not-for-profit that does deal with issues of homelessness and housing come to their committee meeting in January, and we were thinking perhaps to see if we could do a joint committee with you guys on that day. So that's something to discuss. We also brought up in other business. Our many committee members are finding it difficult to log in via Webex, and we are aware that other community boards have been using zoom as a platform to host public meetings, and we would like the executive committee to consider- and our chair and district manager to consider possibly switching over to zoom, which is a little bit more user-friendly and people have been gaining more experience in that platform over these past several months. That's it. Thank you, Juliet. What I respond to is going reverse, but for zoom the current license we have doesn't accommodate, it has a limitation, and so the public license only gives you 40 minutes. So I'm sure why some people would appeal to a 40-minute meeting, particularly for transportation and public safety. That might be appealing. We don't have the luxury to do that right now. The board office and I have discussed this want to see if we can get the funds to purchase the license, that would be more commercialized. That will allow for greater participation and not have the limitation, and so that's already in motion once we have that license, we'll look to use that as an alternative to the committees that may have continued difficulties with Webex, but I'm glad you raised that point. It is something that we discussed last week, that is great Taya did mention that the borough president may have made monies available for zoom, although she can speak to that was mentioned in our meetings may have I think the Kias may have. But you know we have a process in place where we're going to try to pursue that, and so hopefully, in short order, we will have a solution that will allow us to use both platforms, web Webex and zone. So we'll take care of that any questions for the transportation, Public Safety Committee great, thank you, Mr Singletary, Education and culture. I got you Denise. This committee is youth Education and Cultural Affairs Betty, yeah, hi, everyone I, hope everyone has a delicious thanksgiving. We all enjoy our food from our families and our cultures. Okay, so we have not had a meeting since I reported out last, but I was on a call today with the Brooklyn public library and they really have an amazing array of programs that are virtual, which brings up the that's, a plus a digital divide, and then many people don't have access to the internet, but I think Taiyo will be able to send us more information about all the different programs that they have briefly they're, opening up some branches for like what they call grab-and-go people put holds on books that they want, but they're doing it online. So some people don't have the technology or the ability to do that. The branches that are open for that are not in every community. We have the central branch and Adams Street is open for that, I'm not sure which others, but I'm sure that Taya will give us that information and they're very open to serving the community, not just we think of libraries as well. You get books but from everything from story time, with toddlers to working with people on resumes working with young people on college gardens, they do have quite an array of programs, so something everyone should look into and happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, buddy, happy Thanksgiving to you as well any questions for you, education and Cultural, Affairs, Committee, okay, great going back to the top of the fifth item: economic development and employment, Denise Peterson Good evening, everyone on Tuesday, the committee will be meeting and we will have a presentation from the Brooklyn Navy Yard Miss Regina, and we will also be resuming our efforts to. Hopefully, if all things go well, we're targeting June to have a employment and community resource fair that we started a year ago. I had some preliminary conversation and that's a targeted month and we'll see as we go along, but we want to resume putting those pieces back together. Thank you, Denise. Any questions, all right, great. Thank you. The next item on the agenda is chairpersons report. I, don't have much of a report again tonight, but what I will ask is that you know, as we get to a point where the city is starting, to see an uptick in more Covid-19 cases, I remind us again, let's be diligent, but let's be diligent in a way that doesn't jeopardize one's health or one's life. You know, in certain cases you see where New, Yorkers and citizens all around have been encouraging people to wear masks, but let's be judicious in that encouragement. I wouldn't want to see anyone be attacked or aggressively responded to for asking someone to wear a mask. If you feel the situation, is it beneficial and there's an opportunity to remove yourself from that situation because someone's not wearing a mask? Let's err on the side of caution. I also ask that those who have no choice but to use public transportation be careful as you're on the platform we're starting to see an uptick in individuals who need help and aren't able to get it, and so therefore they're acting in situations that are threatening to one's life additionally, but related, at least within our district, we're starting to see a greater population and our homeless neighbors. And so, let's be mindful that you know winter is fast approaching it's going to be cold to the extent that we can do anything through 311 through any type of use of any city agency to aid the individuals that are less fortunate and actually are living on the street. Let's be helpful and be mindful supportive of them, and then last but not least, while this has been a year depending on the lens that you have, that one could be considered. I've heard people use things like terrible and can't wait for the year to be over. In all the case. You know for me, we're still here we're able to see each other, we're so active, we're still involved in the community. So, being a half the glass half full kind of guy that I am this year was wasn't the worst that we've ever seen. So I'm optimistic that we'll get through this, like we've, had for other issues, we'll continue to be a vigilant and a positive community and we'll really be thankful. This thanksgiving, if we haven't been in the past, so that's all I- have I'm I'll pause for a minute. If anybody has any questions of me hearing, none we'll move to item number, seven, the district manager report. Oh thank you! Mr Singletary, and you know the glass is always all full. It's full of water and it's full of air, but it's always full. The only new news that I have from since we last spoke is that the community board and the other 17 Brooklyn community boards have begun another audit by the comptroller's office. These happen every three years or so sometimes a little bit longer. In recent years, they have focused on inventory control, but this audit is going to be on the comp on our compliance with the New York City Charter and the New York City Administrative code requirements for public meetings and hearings and our website and we've just begun. What will probably be around a four-month process and I want to publicly thank the staff for all of their support in pulling together the information and material that was requested at the outset of the audit, and that's the only thing I have to report since we last met. Thank you. I have any questions for the district manager from board members? Yes I. This is John hold on for board members yeah. You get to ask your questions at the next board meeting when this gets reported again so hold on. Item number eight, any other business, Julia hi I just wanted to share briefly that I took a webinar that was offered by the Civic Engagement Commission for Community board members and employees about how to deal with conflict, and it was really helpful and I would recommend it for other members who would like to participate in that they're doing a second session on December 7th and then they're doing more workshops in January and about how to have peaceful debates within a public setting. So I would recommend those if you have availability. Thank you, Julia I echo, Julia's recommendation. We should all participate if we have the opportunity to do so. All right item number nine community forum. John do yes! Thank you, so much community board too I had a few items. I just want to go over them and then I'll mute myself. First is to follow up on the issue that Mr Gordon presented about the York Street station. If you recall, 15 or so years ago, we did this up zoning of all of downtown Brooklyn. That came along with certain benefits that we were expecting to happen. Along with the upgrades and ability to build most of what they agreed to do has not been satisfied, and we don't know that it's even on the drawing table. One of those items includes the York Street station. That station was supposed to be frankly upgraded. It is actually an old age station. It wasn't even built for pedestrians, it was more of a work kind of a station. The platform is extremely narrow and it's certainly going to have great challenges. Accommodating the additional traffic that's coming from the versioning of the Dumbo district. Knowing that that's an MTA related issue, they have to be called to task and made to address the York Street station, as well as the other stations in the district that are not ADA compliant. That was discussed to happen along with all of the up zoning, so that that's just something that's outstanding and we don't hear anything about it and it's becoming a problem, and it is largely why that particular Euler failed, because that issue is not addressed. I should also add that the recent failing of the industry city upzoning was blamed to a certain extent on what has not happened with the community benefits and community district 2. folks are aware of what was promised in community district 2. That did not happen and the train station ADA compliance is just one of them. Another item I wanted to bring up to the executive committee is the notice that went out about the closing of Fort Greene Park from the community board. That's a free speech item and I. Don't understand why the community board should be participating in the quelling of public discussion. These meetings are happening primarily in downtown Brooklyn in the Barclays Center and to a certain degree in Fort, Greene Park, where folks come together to talk and somehow a decision was made to close Fort Greene Park, and I'm not clear who made that decision. I just know that it got to the community board and the community board initially participated in it, and then the decision to close the park was reversed. I'm not quite sure who can call a community board and ask us to participate in restricting of free speech. That's it for tonight. Thank you, John. Let me just answer the last question, and so, as is the case for the community board, and particularly for the longest time that it has been under this format dating back to three, maybe four predecessors of mine, the community board did not you know intervene in free speech per se. Information was floated to the board, made the decision that it was important information to be shared to the public, so that people would be caught off guard, as is the duty of the community board, and it was done now. There have been several narratives about what went down largely false, but what was done was in line with what we've always done, and it was really about making the community aware of initial plans to close the park, which was the role of CB2, the subsequent decisions to not close the park with things that were beyond Cb2's control and at the end of the day, no one within the catchment of CB2 was adversely impacted by a decision that others can determine whether to be true or not. So that's the answer for that and as chair Community Board too, I'm fine with the way we handled it. Anybody else have any open any other business I see several people on the line. Who may not be members of community board too. So if you do have questions you can either reply to everyone in the chat or feel free to unmute yourself and ask a question fantastic, so in spirit that I love to do this is the part of the meeting and I get most excited. I, entertain, emotion to a giant. Thank you. Everyone be safe, happy thanksgiving and we'll see everyone in December. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody happy have a blessed thanksgiving. Everyone I would delicious.
