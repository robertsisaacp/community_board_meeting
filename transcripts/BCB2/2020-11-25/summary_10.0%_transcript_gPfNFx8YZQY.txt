This is Barbara Zoller Gringer, I'm, the second vice chair of the board, and also the co-chair of the parks and recreation community.
Okay, Thank you and your committee Mr Lasso Co-chair, with Barbara with Martin everybody else that I've missed.
On Sunday, the you know, I never struck my attention at the committee, but I figured it out afterwards that this is actually located in the current Jennifer Furniture store there on Livingston and Elm, and now it's going to be the.
Thank you for recognizing me just with the one that's in Brooklyn bridge park, because I noted it wasn't on the agenda that went out to the community for this meeting.
Was it on the public agenda for the committee meeting, so that community members would have known to come.
I got everyone, okay, very good, so the next committee would be land use, but since Mr Singletary is here, sorry Mr, Singletary I didn't see.
I like to do those briefly, so that we can just make a quick discussion and then do the landmark preservation, application, which will then be voted by the executive committee.
The application was to build a large building about 26 28 stories, with both commercial and residential units via big property, there, and, generally speaking, While there was some approval by some of the bigger main peoples, there was generally no support from community members.
Let me ask: Are there any objections to approving the entire presentation or the items that people would prefer to have called out and do a separate vote.
I. Just brought them up as discussion to report to the executive committee, our decisions, but you don't you guys-- are not going to make the decision at this point the board's going to make the decision on the zoning ad and the 69, so it would have to be individual voting that has to be done.
Commissioner Marty Marr, on issues that we are specifically interested in and that he meets with the borough president to discuss priorities for the parks, and so it was very good to have her I had asked.
It is that Monday with the Yucca committee and discussing the statute in Columbus, park, I think any questions.
Our many committee members are finding it difficult to log in via Webex, and we are aware that other community boards have been using zoom as a platform to host public meetings, and we would like the executive committee to consider.
So I'm sure why some people would appeal to a 40-minute meeting, particularly for transportation and public safety.
So we'll take care of that any questions for the transportation, Public Safety Committee great, thank you, Mr, Singletary, Education and culture.
Okay, So we have not had a meeting since I reported out last, but I was on a call today with the Brooklyn public library and they really have an amazing array of programs that are virtual, which brings up the that's, a plus a digital divide.
But I think Taiyo will be able to send us more information about all the different programs that they have briefly they're, opening up some branches for like what they call grab-and-go people put holds on books that they want, but they're doing it.
Any questions for you, education and Cultural, Affairs, Committee, okay, great, going back to the top of the fifth item: economic development and employment, Denise Peterson.
Good evening, everyone on Tuesday, the committee will be meeting and we will have a presentation from the Brooklyn Navy Yard Miss Regina, and we will also be resuming our efforts.
I wanted to bring up to the executive committee.
