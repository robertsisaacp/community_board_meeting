And I think the next place, where community boards potentially would have their budgets cut, will be during the January plan, which sometimes doesn't come out till February, but is always called the January plan.
And it is not unusual during times like these for community boards to be told that some money is just being withdrawn from their budgeted.
Is you know this time, I understood, yeah, okay, any other questions about the budget or the expenses.
We've been meeting online for you know for a while there, So are there any other expenditures that the office is anticipating, making Mr Paris we're pursuant to a finance and personnel committee vote earlier in the year, we are working towards acquiring zoom.
Okay, So we'll move forward, I'm going to work with Rob and Carol Ann. Just say it's just for me, so that I can understand.
The next thing that I had on the agenda or actually for the committee is the report on the zoom application, purchase and usage.
So, since you maybe I guess from what I, What my understanding and the committee can weigh in on this is that when we voted on this last time that we were going to actually go and purchase the zoom, you know application and get all the protocols and that it would be used.
I knew that there was some protocol issues and some delays with the city, giving us the access we needed to the card, and so you know not to place blame, but the process is what caused the delay, and so, If I understand you correctly, Mr Parish you're, now communicating to us that we have to incur the late fees and the penalties associated with the delay that the city caused us to have.
We were not able to pay the bill for a number of months and during that time, like any other credit, card, Us bank charged interest and charged late fees, Once we were able to break the log jam at a sister, agency.
Okay, so I guess getting back to the zoom account which says we can't use the purchase card right.
I think needs by the committees that they wanted to use it, and you know, for you, know, meetings and things like that.
If I, recall correctly Lenny, if I could, if I remember correctly, when we had the discussion, there were a lot of people, brainstorming about ways that we could use a multitude of platforms as opposed to just using Webex and in there, Where were suggestions quit setting up a quick zoom call if there was a question to be asked of, let's save the liaison for the committee, so.
We, probably at that meeting we're going to probably have extensive discussions on the budget for 20 fiscal year, And I expect to also have a draft sent out to people to the committee.
You know, ask yeah, develop your questions or whatever, so that we can have a an intelligent discussion on the budget.
You know suggest for fiscal year, 2022, so I, I'm going to work on that myself.
And then also that's why I wanted to send out monthly budget reports to everybody on the committee so that you have an idea of what's going on what goes into it and everything else.
Think a couple of things did come out of it as far as the budget is concerned, and also you know, an update on the zoom account and.
Okay, I do have a question given that we do have a substantial amount of money which doesn't seem to exactly be allocated for expenses or less than they might have expected to be, and this issue kind of came up last time as well.
