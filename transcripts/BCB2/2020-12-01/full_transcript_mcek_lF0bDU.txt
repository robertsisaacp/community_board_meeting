It's pm good evening: everyone, my name, is Linda Jordan, I'm the chair of the finance and Personnel Committee, and I'm also first vice chair of community board two. So this is our scheduled finance and personnel committee meeting and I'll just go around the room. Well, let's start with Miss five Bush, I'm Betty Bush hi, okay, Meredith, you're, muted hi, I'm Meredith, Secretary, Mr, Smith, well, I! Guess it's Mr, Brandon Smith I have to okay. I'm sorry! I had to go, get a glass of water, I'm Brandon, Smith and proud. Member of this committee, okay, this Kalazanga Zelik Zelda Barbara hi good evening, I'm Barbara Zoller Gringo, a member of the committee, the second vice chair of the board and the co-chair of the Parks Committee. Okay, welcome! Thank you and we have Mr Paris and we have well I guess this is Mr. Paris is our district manager and we have any other visitors here. Yes, I, I'm Brian Lang and I've recently moved into the community. I live right off: Myrtle, okay and I. Just I'm trying to get involved in community the community as much as I can so I'm happy to be here and I plan to just kind of try to see the inner workings of the community board too. Okay, thank you. Mr Lang, I think Mr Singletary has joined us, hey Lenny. How are you I'm is single Terry Mr Singletary is our. Is the chair of Community Board too? Okay, so we get started. Can I get approval of the agenda? Does everybody have a copy of the agenda? Okay, Miss fly Bush and Miscellaneous seconded all in favor unanimous all right. Does anybody have a chance to look at the minutes in our last meeting on September 24th? They were fine. Okay, they were excellent. We have two minutes. That's what I thought also Barbara do you have any no they're great. We have two sets of minutes: okay, excellent. Okay, so we have consensus that we accepted the minutes as the as they are written. I abstain as I. Wasn't there, okay, all right, Mr Smith, so that would be six and I'm sorry, five, zero one right! Okay! Next is the review of the budget and expenses I think I sent everybody a copy and I had some questions and I. Think Rob had some answers that he sent to me, but I didn't get a chance to look at them Rob, so did everybody get a copy of the budget and expenses all right? So we may have some questions. I had asked Miss church to attend, but she was enabled she had a previous commitment, so she was unable to attend. The Rob is going to be the focal point of any questions that we might have. So one of the things rob that I was questioning. Is the total amount left in the budget year to date, so in the email that I sent you I delineated? The budget amount that we received from OMB plus 2500. that we received from council member combo on the other side of the balance sheet. I listed all of our expenses. I listed all of the salaries for the full fiscal year, because that's an encumbrance that you have to plan for, but the expenses to date are very few. As you may remember, from the last meeting there were none at all, so we have spent a little over a thousand dollars on four items. Almost all of that was- or the great majority of that was an 840 dollar allocation for a service called log me in that allows the staff who are working remotely to access the server in the office. We finally got the hand sanitizer we ordered last year, so the bill is a fy21 bill. We had to pay the maintenance contract on the multi-function printer, but since that is done on a per page price, it's a very low number and we also have got caught up on our bill for the postage meter lease that's about 138 dollars. So all total, it's a thousand 32 bucks. 840 was a single purchase and the other three items make up the difference. If you subtract the salaries and the purchases to date, this fiscal year, we have a net unspent balance of 19 and sixteen dollars. Okay, all right I have to look at that statement that you sent me. Did you send that to all the other committee members, no I sent it to the people that were on the email that asked for the information? Okay, all right, I can forward it if you'd like all right. Okay, because I was looking at just the monies that we had. We started off with seven eight five six, that was the budget for this year and we got 2500 from council member combo's office. So what I would do I mean is just you know, just what I simplify and I just add one to the other and then subtract whatever the expenses are and that's what we would have left as far as expenses that we could. You know, use for office materials and things like that. Well, as I mentioned in a phone conversation that you and I had there's also a substantial sum that is essentially unallocated in the personal services side of the budget. Yes and so I added that to the total unspent balance- okay, all right, so all right, I just have to look over that just to make sure that may be the amount that you know we're differing here. Okay, so am I correct in assuming like besides the personal services that we are, we have about eight thousand six hundred and ninety one dollars about eighty seven hundred dollars. No, it's more than that all right! We're gonna get this together, because what I'm gonna ask at least I'm gonna, ask I, asked you to ask Ms church that from now on that we get a monthly statement on what the expenses are budgeted. You know budget what the expenses were and what's left so that at least the you know when we have a regular meetings at least we're up to date. As far as what the I have a question, yeah sure, good yeah we've heard that in terms of the city budget, they were asking agencies to consider cutting back and I know. We felt we needed, of course, all of our personnel in order to do the job to the community. But is there a risk of the city during this fiscal year like in this spring, cutting us or what we have is what we have well first I would say that our original budget for Fy21 was larger than the numbers that went out in the reconciliation and the numbers that I provided Mr Jordan today, so community boards already took a cut and I think the next place, where community boards potentially would have their budgets cut, will be during the January plan, which sometimes doesn't come out till February, but is always called the January plan. That's you know the mid-year financial plan. The city will have a better sense of what their tax revenues are and what their expenses are, and it is not unusual during times like these for community boards to be told that some money is just being withdrawn from their budgeted budgets. So would that be personnel or other than personnel service? Well, it's kind of up to each community board and some boards tend to max out their budgets with salaries and then, when these for those boards in this situation, they end up being in a real tough place, because they really don't have a lot of wiggle room in their budgets to accommodate anything that is withdrawn. Okay, but I, guess Betty I know: Mr Singletary made a statement before that we were not we're not doing anything with our staff. It's gonna remain, as is you know this time, I understood, yeah, okay, any other questions about the budget or the expenses. Did you want me to forward that email to the rest of the committee, Mr Jordan yeah? You could do that, okay, and at least by the time- well at least I'm anticipating that next, the next month that we'll be able to get a budget that we actually can. You know by the time we meet again anyway, that we'll have a running total of how much we've worked, how much we have and how much we spent and what what's left the other thing is too the reason. Another reason why we haven't spent a lot of as much as we normally would have spent as up to this point is because we have not had meals for the executive committee meetings at all. We've been meeting online for you know for a while there, so are there any other expenditures that the office is anticipating, making Mr Paris we're pursuant to a finance and personnel committee vote earlier in the year, we are working towards acquiring zoom and we'll keep you apprised as that moves forward. It's not as simple as going to best buy and just picking up a box. Okay, I guess: well, I'm not going to skip to the next topic just yet, but that is one of the things that sorry my bad yeah. Well, no, I'm glad you mentioned that because I was gonna, bring it up. Also anybody else have any other questions on the budget or on the expenditures. Okay, so we'll move forward, I'm going to work with Rob and Carol Ann. Also to get this so that we can have a you know, a picture that at least for me and maybe I- should just simplify it. Just say it's just for me so that I can understand it and I'm able to explain it to other people. You know- and you may want the same thing so you know as we move forward. So the next thing that I had on the agenda or actually for the committee is the report on the zoom application, purchase and usage. So since you maybe I guess from what I, what my understanding and the committee can weigh in on this is that when we voted on this last time that we were going to actually go and purchase the zoom, you know application and get all the protocols and that it would be used. You know at by the time we had our next meeting yeah, it's you know, to be honest: I can not keep track of all the various impediments to different types of purchases, but for some reason, Caroline has not been able to just put in a purchase order for the zoom account I. I'm sorry I can't elaborate further, but she actively works on it. We check in on a weekly basis on the purchase and she continues to move that along a little bit at a time. So let me just ask this question and hey anybody else that wants to ask questions about it. So it's not so much us getting the application it's paying for it. Is that what you meant? Yes, I mean one. You know we did not like our tax exempt form and asked for a different one that I their instructions were unclear to me. So I filled it out wrong the first time, so we lost a week or so there. You know we, as I said you know it's listed every week on the staff updates and we Caroline continues to work. We continue to monitor the purchase as well. Okay, and we can't use the purchase card for this well, actually the purchase card, because we were not able to pay the balance for log me in for so long. We've now incurred late charges and interest on the outstanding balance. The city of New York does not pay late charges or interest, and so until we have some other strategy for paying those costs potentially by the friends of Brooklyn community board, 2 not-for-profit the balance on the credit card is in arrears: hey I, I'm not kind of clear on that. But first of all does anybody else have any other any questions before I delve into this a little bit more yeah. So this is Lenny. This is perhaps it went over my head, but this is the first that is registering with me that we have we've been in the rarest for the purchase card. I knew that there was some protocol issues and some delays with the city, giving us the access we needed to the card, and so you know not to place blame, but the process is what caused the delay, and so, if I understand you correctly, Mr Parish you're, now communicating to us that we have to incur the late fees and the penalties associated with the delay that the city caused us to have am I. Saying that correctly, you know attributing blame is a tricky thing, yeah, that's what I said. I'm not attributing blame! I'm just trying to understand the process yeah we there was a good deal of email documentation on this. We were not able to pay the bill for a number of months and during that time, like any other credit card, Us bank charged interest and charged late fees, once we were able to break the log jam at a sister agency and I'm grateful to D-Cass for finally stepping in and making that happen, but once we were able to break that log jam, we paid off the cost of the software service, but we were not able to pay the late fees in interest all right. So let me ask my question a different way. If the community board did not have another entity like friends of CB2, what would be the normal process for addressing this issue? A U.S bank would cancel the credit card and proceed with collection and the city wouldn't get involved at all about that. I, don't know what the city's involvement would be. Okay, let's you and I kind of investigate that a little bit more, I'm not doing that to exclude the committee, but it appears as if these were some of the questions that I have and I want to be fair to you you're, not in a position to answer them right now. So if we could just have a conversation with Dcas or whoever's appropriate agency, I'd like to go down that path first, before we do anything that would bloop in friends of CB2 or anything else yeah, and when we juice at that time, when we do set that conversation up or whether it's the email, however, the best way to proceed. I was just asked that we loop in the chair to finance the personnel committee. Okay, so I guess getting back to the zoom account which says we can't use the purchase card right now. Mr Paris is, would they take a? Is it difficult to get in the purchase order? Carol Ann is working on getting a purchase order. Okay, could you give I'm sorry? Could you give us a sense of how much money is owed in back fees and interest? I? Don't know what the most recent months of addition to that is the last time I checked the number it was under 40 dollars, oh, and does it increase each month that we don't pay it because now there's interest on the interest and the late fees, even though we've paid the charge itself with just the fees we haven't paid? That is correct right. Okay, all right! Thank you. The purchase order for the zoom account. Oh we're gonna get the zoom account in less time than it took to get the approval to get the zoom account. Okay, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have gone there. Okay, so let me put it to you this way, so, first of all what the Zuma account is going to be used for a lot of other things. Besides the meetings with the staff and everything else right. Many of your fellow board members very much like that and I will report to you that a number of Brooklyn community boards have made that transition. They've said thank you do it for the Webex License, but we are moving on to a different platform right. Okay, all right! We're not saying we're going to do that, but I'm just saying we had some other I think needs by the committees that they wanted to use it, and you know, for you, know, meetings and things like that from what I understand from what I remember before so well. Are there gonna be committee meetings outside of the traditional monthly calendar? Well, I just thought that there was a need for other. You know for interim meetings or whatever I don't know exactly or committee members you this committee, we have Mr Smith and Miss five Bush and Mrs Elegranga I. Think the last time we had a meeting wasn't it expressed an interest in using zoom by your committees or am I generally, if I recall correctly Lenny, if I could, if I remember correctly, when we had the discussion, there were a lot of people, brainstorming about ways that we could use a multitude of platforms as opposed to just using Webex and in there, where were suggestions quit setting up a quick zoom call if there was a question to be asked of, let's save the liaison for the committee, so let's say like Carol Anne like Taylor Rob, but you know, standard protocol would be, and you know I think we would all adhere to. That- is that the meetings come from the board office and then now by getting zoomed as an option either to go with zoom, which appears to be the preferred method. Just through you know, anecdotal conversation or through Webex, which is the preferred platform for to it. And then, if the like, the team said when they were giving us the presentation, I think when Taya gave the presentation for technology there is teams which is also used within the office which allows the staff to communicate as well. So we have a multitude of platforms all which can be taken advantage of okay, yeah, thank you and that from when I remember anyway, I thought it was. You know that folks really wanted anyway. I just got a sense of the meaning that we thought that this was going to happen. You know relatively quickly, so that was the whole thing in there. So Mr Paris I just asked. Is there a possibility? Would it be by the next time we meet or maybe by next month or oh certainly, I'm you know, I'm I need to check with Carol Anne before I make any promises, but you know you meet roughly quarterly I. Certainly don't think it's beyond that horizon. Okay, I would just say, I. Think that there's a the main concern, at least from people on my committee, has been the process of logging onto Webex and for particularly for Mr Andrews. It would be an enormous benefit to have a different platform. Okay, thank you. Okay, so we'll have good news. I anticipate we'll have good news within the next month or so all right. Okay, so is there any I mean we have? We don't have too many things on the calendar here, but one of the things I really want to well next meeting is February 25th. We probably at that meeting we're going to probably have extensive discussions on the budget for 20 fiscal year. 2022 and I expect to also have a draft sent out to people to the committee much before, then all right for you to review, and actually you know, ask yeah, develop your questions or whatever, so that we can have a an intelligent discussion on the budget. What we will propose to the General Board is the budget that we're gonna. You know suggest for fiscal year 2022, so I, I'm going to work on that myself and then also that's why I wanted to send out monthly budget reports to everybody on the committee so that you have an idea of what's going on what goes into it and everything else. Do we have any old business from last time? Okay, hearing none is any new business, anything to come before this committee. Boy silence is gold in there huh next it was next meeting, is February 25th I didn't really have a lot of things for this agenda, but I think a couple of things did come out of it as far as the budget is concerned, and also you know, an update on the zoom account and also like well Mr, Singletary and Rob we're going to have a offline conversation on the purchase card and you you'll be a part of it as well. So it'll be yes, yeah there'll be three of us at a minimum. Okay, I do have a question given that we do have a substantial amount of money which doesn't seem to exactly be allocated for expenses or less than they might have expected to be, and this issue kind of came up last time as well. Are we going to continue to take a position? I think that we don't want to spend any unnecessary money right now, because our budget may get cut or do we want to talk about some ways? Maybe we could use these funds to buy stuff that we might need while we have some money well as far as I'm concerned, I would like to just solidify how much money we actually do have all right. That's clear in my mind and that's why I had asked I think I had asked Mr Paris before about. Is there anything else in the office that was, you know as far as equipment or anything else that was needed, I think we've we purchased just about everything, I think the last time the question came up about Ppe's and I. Think we've got all the PPE stuff in the office right. We did. You know the one last outstanding item was the hand sanitizer and that arrived recently. You know we ended the previous fiscal year with a fair amount of purchasing of office supplies, computer hardware and various supplies that responded to the pandemic and then, as you know, we've discussed there's nothing like working from home to keep your costs down. So you know the net is not much is needed and there's a fairly good balance on spent. Thank you. I have a question about that. In the past we talked about I think it was last year of the year before about digitalizing a lot of the papers and getting rid of papers. Do we need to have another office clean out in terms of getting rid of some of the file, cabinets or other furniture? Since apparently we got rid of a lot of old papers. Is this a good time to do that, since we seem to have some money? Well, the file cabinets don't actually belong to us, so we can't just get rid of them. There's been some discussion with the law department about where the file cabinets could go, how they might be able to reuse them. But you know one of the things that gets in the way of this particular topic is that there's so few people in the building, including operations and facility staff in general, though yes, we digitized almost all of the paper two fiscal years ago, and there are surplus file cabinets. So that's the answer to that part of the question. Well, that's good news and I hope we can continue the process of clearing out and making the office. You know more habitable for when people do return, hey any other questions or concerns or anything any new business that we have okay and then I'll entertain a motion to close okay, Miss De, La, Grenada and Miss five Bush. So thank you all for attending and as I said before, our next meeting is February 25th and certainly be aware. The fact that you're going to be getting copies of I mean I'm going to review the whatever items are sent out to you, but that so that you're up to date, as far as the budget and everything else, and how are we going to plan our budget for fiscal year, 22 2022? That is? Okay, that's it! Oh! Thank you so much for attending. Thank you. Everybody had a joyous holiday and stay safe, good night.
