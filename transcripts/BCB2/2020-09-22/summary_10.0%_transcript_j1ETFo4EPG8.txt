I am here to share we'll introduce Laura, really because she'll give you all the good details and photos of the exhibition, but as you're, probably all familiar with Photoville, which has traditionally taken place in Brooklyn bridge park every year over a couple weeks, this year, we're kind of taking it to all five boroughs.
We actually had a gallery in Dumbo, but right before the pandemic, who knew we decided that we were really doing so much public art that the gallery was kind of falling on the wayside and as a very tiny mom- and- pop, like small non- profit.
With a few other colleagues created this amazing celebration of community heroes, especially in Commodore Barry, Park and Fort Greene Park, and it's really special You know she's one person and asked us if it could come under our umbrella that we can help give her support and resources.
It does not stop right, there, and actually she wanted me to throw this out there, because we'll be announcing soon in connection with the Fort Green fling, with Fort Greene Park and the Fort Greene Park conservancy They're going to be celebrating community heroes, so we'll be sending out- If you have been down to Brooklyn in the last eight years, you've seen the shipping containers.
The you know how we see art, how we share stories and the way that we started with photovel was part of the Dumbo arts festival in 2011 and Look I'm, developing this park.
And we'll be working with Kennedy in the next year of showing this work all over the country, So I do not have those photos yet, but the wonderful thing about partnering with nat Geo, is that they're, instead of showing the usual stuff that people think about National Geographic , it's usually very challenging work, so Wayne Lawrence who's, a Brooklyn photographer.
We had some indigenous folks come by a few days ago and do a blessing which was really lovely, just kind of going and we're also in Times Square, so Elias Williams, a Bronx photographer biked all around New York City during the pandemic, photographing graduates, so from four- year- olds to high schoolers to college We're in Queens, Astoria park.
We worked with the queen's museum and this is a collective of migrant women, and these are the ladies who are in these photos who crochet This has been very popular in Queens You know just down in Brooklyn bridge park again some of the photographers or Brooklyn Then we also have a lot of online sessions.
So in the month of October, free virtual field trips, where teenagers so we're encouraging educators, but also parents, because we know there's a lot of young people being homeschooled right, now.
I, have a dog we're out in public spaces every day, And there's some really extraordinary things out: there, You know there is a lot of stuff connected to Covid-19, but we also thought you know with looking we're working with eight middle and high school doa teachers, schools and showing the importance of you.
You know we're doing everything we can to make this work, but it is so special, and I was I was telling about I biked out to the park and stalking people looking at the photos and going Like the next two months of sleepless nights , it's worth seeing how people are connecting, and even some of the conversations that parents are having with their young people about certain things that are going.
We you know, we've been in Dumbo, I'm, like I said: I've been working in dunbar for 15 years, And I used to live in Fort Greene, but you know we decided.
Do I'm, a member of the Community board, I'm, also on the Brooklyn bridge, park, Conservancy Board for 10 or 11 years.
Now, and I am also chair of the myrtle Avenue Business improvement district, which is comprised of the I, want to say the south side of the Fort green public housing project and Fort Greene Park, we're always looking for opportunities for the Fort Greene public housing residents to get more involved in things outside of the fort green public housing.
Yeah I've reached out to Brooklyn bridge park to come up with some programs that we could potentially introduce to the residents of Fort, Greene, and I'm.
You know I'm on this to talk about full green park at the very end of the meeting.
Brooklyn bridge park a little bit, it's a lot in Dumbo right, near St, Anne's and around the timeout building, and It I have to run because I can hear my kid, but I I, as you know, Suzanne and I visited Golconda Skate Park, which is not far from Commodore Barry and is right near the the Navy yard, boys and girls.
Statement, we put We added there, the goal to winterize the bathrooms in the park because it is used all year, round, And, so we had asked Ian, who is from the New York City Skateboard coalition, to come and talk to us about the park.
You know having our own cleaning equipment at the skate park is very helpful because the kids just take up a broom and clean the park as needed, and we're very grateful for New York City, Parks Department working with you, know, partnership parks and we've since established a a job box or a large mess up where we keep clear equipment.
And if you go to the skate parks in New York, there are people from ages 6 to 60.
We did a cleanup at the skate park that particular day a lot of people came out and This is Brooklyn, skate.
We did some work with the Brooklyn skate garden and, and that was there Maha's right, like four people to the right, with my booney on the black beanie on yeah, And, then the just a little thing about the skateboard community.
We've been doing this Voda registration at different skate parks in New York, mostly in Brooklyn and including gold Cumber, and it's really great, to find most of the skateboarders are already registered to vote.
Thank you, and you started talking a little bit about something that I was going to ask you about the skateboard community there, because I know you get a lot of people who come there on a regular basis.
You know we think skateboard parks are really a perfect fit underneath the bridge.
The weather and everything So the bridge and skate parks are actually a really great mix that are some a lot of cities in America.
We also have a lot of skateboarders Columbus, where Columbus park meets Borough Hall, and that area is very inviting for the reasons you were we're talking about it, but I liked.
I should try to find out more, but they would not find out, but I know that a bunch of local, a bunch of locals, including 14 association, I think, are friends of four queen park, trying to get all the documents they can from the city on this, like freedom of information and other public access to documents.
