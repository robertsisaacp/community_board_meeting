I have a second okay, all in favor, aye, okay, We're going to be discussing the statement of community district needs, and the committee board budget requests for fiscal year, 2022 First off we're going to make some suggestions of the things that we might want to remove from the statement of needs and budget When we first looked at, there were only four items that we wanted to remove:: okay, either because they were funded or because they were not funded, and we want to go from there if you want to be able to pull up the Okay.
These are the most important issues related to what we're looking at right now: youth education, but we want to look at ours, taking you to our section, okay, just to explain why this looks a little bit different The categories in the district statement of needs that the city produces are a little bit different from the titles of the committees in our district, so you'll see that land use housing and economic development are all clumped together for the purpose of this report and that's the city's choice.
A lot of people are currently working from home or basically facing a situation where they're not these are unemployment or your unemployment has now been cut off So. Based on that information, we're going to be focusing on things along the lines that we can actually do without a lot of working capital and basically something that we can do as far as doing outreach to those individuals who need it most right now, during these stressful times, So I think just to reinforce what what bill was discussing.
Is that we've been talking about short and long-term recovery from Covid-19, as well as the pre-existing needs that existed prior to Covid-19, but have only become exacerbated by this disaster, and so within that we'd really like to think about unemployment, support, small business support attracting new business to the district, and we also would like to talk about housing Although we share that with land use, it's come to our attention that land use might not be drafting as many budget priorities.
and I think we know from previous years that unless we really get that critical mass and get people on board with these ideas, some of them may not move forward So it's just really important to keep that in mind that we want to get as many forward as we can so that we put economic development as one of the as having like a large, the largest block of priorities and budget priorities, because it's such a huge issue right now as part of this Covid-19 19 recovery, did you receive by any chance the email with the with the items that we wanted to put up on the screen?
Revitalization, with recommendations for merchant, organizing public programming, district marketing and branding, and the grants specifically supported that, so the grant provided a consultancy for anyone who wanted to create online merchant, organizing and considering how important an online presence is in response to Covid-19 I think that this budget priority could be really beneficial to a lot of our local merchants.
It might be a voucher program to help maintain small business businesses, in particular in their existing commercial spaces, and another option we were looking at in our budget is funding a Brooklyn makers, design competition aimed at putting local artists and Brooklyn local makers to work within urban renewal and creative place, making on our streets This means a way that we can spotlight local neighborhood culture, local small businesses and community heroes with the work of local artists, and this kind of competition would allow funding for the artists supplies to create things like murals partnering, up with maybe vacant retail spaces as a way to lift the neighborhood, and that would be in partnership with existing organizations like the bids and new york city DOT programming, allowing for things like a public voting option so that the designs and the themes are chosen by the neighborhoods themselves.
We perhaps want to consider including something when you talk about grants, that there could be some grant provided for those tenants to have the opportunity to be sort of like OSHA trained, so the grant would come because we know that based on what happened in the city council, however many months or a year or more, it's a very costly undertaking, Now to be OSHA certified, so that if there was some grant money available to organizations that are in a position to certify and have these courses and certify these individuals I think that can be helpful to public housing.
In response to Covid-19 and identifying like what kind of programs are even needed right now to help people find these new jobs, Reskilling of the nysha population, slash low income population within our district and determining what skill sets are now needed in this changing environment I have a recommendation for how to include them in the budget priorities we're making So, maybe I, think it's two different budget, maybe I, think and a way to get more bang for our buck might be to provide the grants to local non-profits, who are already doing this work and to expand their current programming So maybe we do one for the OSHA, 10, 30 and 40 that prioritizes low-income and vulnerable communities and provide grants to non-profits who are willing to administer the training program, and then we can do another.
I do think, though, that I'm, assuming that, with the construction industry, there are some construction projects that have sort of been in the works already and they're sort of moving forward throughout the city throughout Brooklyn and as I see it as I move around people and I'm just saying: If there's a if a, if ten individuals from NYCHA development go to a work site and say well, can I work, and so of course the answer is, unless you have the OSHA certification that you can't so What were the responses based on your outreach and who was exactly sitting in these in these training sessions, because I think that's important to know, because we can, you know, support money going to certain organizations and institutions, but if the people who I'm specifically talking about, if there has not been any very effective and on the ground, outreach they once again don't know about it, then it gets So then we'll have the grants then would have been given to the benefit would have been gone to people who could maybe afford it depending on what that means in this.
I, don't know how we're going to work going forward from here whether it's still have a board meeting or not, but that's something we're looking at going forward community forum, okay, of course, other business Is there any other business that any of the committee members would like to bring up?
