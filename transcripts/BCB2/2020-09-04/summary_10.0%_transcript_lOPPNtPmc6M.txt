Members, okay, and I will ask committee members to now introduce themselves If you want to let them introduce themselves, okay, starting with my vice chair and going down the line from there denise peterson culture, economic development and employment.
I have a second okay, all in favor, aye, Okay, We're, going to be discussing the statement of community district needs and the committee board budget requests for fiscal year.
We're going to be focused on what we can do for the district based on that information, we're going to be focusing on things along the lines that we can actually do without a lot of working capital and basically something that we can do as far as doing outreach to those individuals who need it most right now.
Is that we've been talking about short and long-term recovery from Covid-19, as well as the pre-existing needs that existed prior to Covid-19, but have only become exacerbated by this disaster, and Within that we'd really like to think about unemployment, support, small business support attracting new business to the district, and we also would like to talk about housing.
So it's just really important to keep that in mind that we want to get as many forward as we can so that we put economic development as one of the as having like a large, the largest block of priorities and budget priorities, It's such a huge issue right now, as part of this Covid-19 19 recovery, did you receive by any chance the email with the with the items that we wanted to put up on the screen.
It was to also provide opportunities for local neighborhood, revitalization, with recommendations for merchant, organizing public programming, district marketing and branding, and the grants specifically supported that.
I know that this might not be the top of our list at the moment, considering the status of transportation, but it is worth mentioning and considering if we want to prioritize it again this year and finally, from my end, catherine, I'm, going to turn it over to you in a second We'd like to expand eligibility for local payroll grants to cover companies with five or more employees.
It might be a voucher program to help maintain small business businesses, in particular in their existing commercial spaces, and another option we were looking at in our budget is funding a Brooklyn makers, Design, competition aimed at putting local artists and Brooklyn local makers to work within urban renewal and creative place making on our streets.
This means a way that we can spotlight local neighborhood, culture, local, small businesses and community heroes with the work of local artists, and this kind of competition would allow funding for the artists supplies to create things like murals partnering, up with maybe vacant retail spaces as a way to lift the neighborhood, and that would be in partnership with existing organizations like the bids and new york city DOT programming, allowing for things like a public voting option so that the designs and the themes are chosen by the neighborhoods themselves.
The last item on our list is another voucher incentive for small landlords with empty retail spaces, who are going to allow flexible, short-term leases for local mwbes as a way to try to help attract entrepreneurship within our community, especially by those persons.
I support, small business initiatives, You know a priority, but I want to add on another priority, and that has to do with the tenets that are in these NYCHA developments within community board.
I. Think that all of the work that the committee did between katherine and kate and lindsay, and especially the focus on the small business and entrepreneur ship within the community.
Maybe, we could be more specific about delineating an item specifically that would focus on retraining or providing these OSHA trainings or, and even maybe, emphasizing a re-skilling so to say of the general workforce population in response to Covid-19 and identifying, like what kind of programs are even needed right now to help people find these new jobs.
I have a recommendation for how to include them in the budget priorities we're making In the working group.- So- maybe I think it's two different budget, Maybe I, think, and a way to get more bang for our buck, might be to provide the grants to local non-profits, who are already doing this work and to expand their current programming.
I would like to bring back to the transportation and public safety committee, particularly as it relates to those specific issues, class and avenue, we've.
Are you talking about those businesses also, or is this just the businesses that are outside of a district, because the district would pretty much be taking responsibility for all of the businesses within the district, and certainly the partnership does all of the downtown Brooklyn small business component in terms of communication for the public housing developments, the myrtle bid also sponsors a food pantry program that covers all of the developments that miss peterson mentioned earlier.
Okay, thank you, denise, okay, another two, more items here that I'm going to bring to the attention of the committee and all the board and any of the individuals who are currently still here at the meeting.
And I wanted to raise it to the committee But I, don't think, we've there's a more important time that we could take up that issue.
