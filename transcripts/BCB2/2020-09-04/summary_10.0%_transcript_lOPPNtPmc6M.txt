I have a second okay, all in favor, aye, Okay, We're, going to be discussing the statement of community district needs and the Committee Board budget requests for fiscal year.
We're going to be focused on what we can do for the district based on that information, we're going to be focusing on things along the lines that we can actually do without a lot of working capital and basically something that we can do as far as doing outreach to those individuals who need it most right now.
Small business support attracting new business to the district, and we also would like to talk about housing, and although we share that with land use, it's come to our attention that land use might not be drafting as many budget.
So it's just really important to keep that in mind that we want to get as many forward as we can so that we put economic development as one of the as having like a large, the largest block of priorities and budget priorities, It's such a huge issue right now, as part of this Covid-19 recovery, did you receive by any chance the email with the with the items that we wanted to put up on the screen?
It was to also provide opportunities for local neighborhood, revitalization, with recommendations for merchant, organizing public programming, district marketing and branding, and the grants specifically supported that.
We like to look at small business repair and reopening grants and loans, as part of both the short- term and long- term recovery from Covid-19.
I know that this might not be the top of our list at the moment, considering the status of transportation, but it is worth mentioning and considering if we want to prioritize it again this year and finally, from my end, catherine, I'm, going to turn it over to you in a second We'd like to expand eligibility for local payroll grants to cover companies with five or more employees.
It might be a voucher program to help maintain small business businesses, in particular in their existing commercial spaces, and another option we were looking at in our budget is funding a Brooklyn makers, Design, competition aimed at putting local artists and Brooklyn local makers to work within urban renewal and creative place making on our streets.
This means a way that we can spotlight local neighborhood, culture, local, small businesses and community heroes with the work of local artists, and this kind of competition would allow funding for the artists supplies to create things like murals partnering, up with maybe vacant retail spaces as a way to lift the neighborhood, and that would be in partnership with existing organizations like the bids and New York.
The last item on our list is another voucher incentive for small landlords with empty retail spaces, who are going to allow flexible short- term leases for local mwbes as a way to try to help attract entrepreneurship within our community, especially by those persons.
I support, small business initiatives, You know a priority, but I want to add on another priority, and that has to do with the tenets that are in these NYCHA developments within community Board.
We perhaps want to consider, including something when you talk about grants, that there could be some grant provided for those tenants to have the opportunity to be sort of like OSHA trained.
I think that all of the work that the committee did between Katherine and Kate and Lindsay, and especially the focus on the small business and entrepreneur ship within the community, I, think that's great, and I think that the way that you have those items worded in here definitely reflects that, and I was just thinking.
We could be more specific about delineating an item specifically that would focus on retraining or providing these OSHA trainings or and even maybe, emphasizing a re- skilling so to say of the general Workforce population in response to Covid-19 and identifying, like what kind of programs are even needed right now to help people find these new jobs.
Maybe I think it's two different budget, Maybe, I, think, and a way to get more bang for our buck might be to provide the grants to local non- profits, who are already doing this work and to expand their current programming.
So maybe we do one for the OSHA, 10:30 and 40 that prioritizes low- income and vulnerable communities and provide grants to non- profits who are willing to administer the training program, and then we can do another one.
Are you talking about those businesses also, or is this just the businesses that are outside of a district, because the district would pretty much be taking responsibility for all of the businesses within the district, and certainly the partnership does all of the downtown Brooklyn small business component in terms of communication for the public housing developments, the myrtle bid also sponsors a food pantry program that covers all of the developments that Miss Peterson mentioned: earlier.
It was an excellent community event, but in the in the there was different discussions and one of the things that was said Was that you see all of the work that is going on down there.
Is it a fact and if it is, then, of course all of those people need to be put on notice if they have not already been put on notice, so that I do not Okay, thank you, denise, okay, another two, more items here that I'm going to bring to the attention of the committee and all the board and any of the individuals who are currently still here at the meeting.
