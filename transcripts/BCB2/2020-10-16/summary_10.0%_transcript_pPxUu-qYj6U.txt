Interestingly, it looked like Grand, Larceny and Petty Larceny are down, and I wonder if captain rana might be able to speak about the fact that those two items may be down, maybe just because people are not going out as much as they used to be and.
We sponsor food deliveries for folks in the public housing projects- Last week there was a robbery at gunpoint at the times, Plaza Post office and the person at gunpoint took wallets from the customers there and we have not been able to get information on it.
Okay, let's see if he joins, we'll play by ear great thanks, Is, a presentation that comes from about 10 years of work on a project called the Brooklyn bridge.
We're going to present that story with an emphasis on our immediate actions that we would like to support the city in moving forward on the Brooklyn, bridge, challenge of pedestrian and cyclist congestion on the bridge, as well as some of the public space surrounding the bridge.
We see this as an opportunity to bring some of that thinking right into the heart of New, York City and use the bridge as a place for experimentation and and action on these issues.
All, familiar with what it's like to walk or cycle over the promenade in the Brooklyn bridge- It's been a bit of a nightmare over the last few years as that traffic has ramped up and, of course, with Covid-19 and all those transformations.
Zero approach that we built into our proposal was to in basically in the first year, get a new bike lane implemented on the traffic deck.
This group has already commented on the urgency of improving the flow of pedestrians and cyclists over the bridge, so we're moving through this process, and I should note that we've had a meeting with Manhattan Community board one wherein they passed a positive resolution in favor of working with this proposal.
Breaking this down, we've got a proposal for a public space bike ramp and the Brooklyn anchorage plaza, which we'll talk, about.
Similarly, on the Manhattan side, resuscitating a an underutilized or unused ramp from the broken bridge that is currently being used by NYPD for parking, post, 911 and then creating some green spaces to support those areas on both sides of the bridge that connect a new bike lane on the Manhattan- bound I.E north side of the bridge.
The other lane, and, along with this, comes a series of programming ideas like working with youth, creating some spaces in the anchorage for young people to engage with this, both even in the process of the planning and rollout, and also ongoing education and engagement with young people.
That's part of a long- term plan, but our focus right now is to work with D.O.T the community boards and all the stakeholders to get bike traffic moving on the bridge as quickly as possible and on the right hand, of the screen.
You'll, see under the other red circle, a proposal to have a an additional lane potentially for electric assist vehicles, which we know is a big theme right now in the city.
Yes, okay, a single lane of car traffic, to dedicate for the first two- way bike lane on the north side and again, potentially on the on the Brooklyn bound side, an electric assist lane.
Many people have confronted the fact that there's a question about the loading of the bridge and we recognize that this first proposal of using the lower deck for the for the bike lane does not substantially increase the load in the bridge.
These two new ramps, I'm, going to zoom out zoom in on this in a second and the yellow, dashed line, would be the electric assist lane which would start at center and go all the way to Artillery Street, let's just zoom in for a minute on the two approaches to this bike: Lane, the Manhattan ramp on the top and the Brooklyn ramp on the bottom, and our proposal is to create really kind of cool and exciting public spaces.
Cadman Plaza allows cyclists to ride up onto the deck of the bridge, more technical drawings, here, and we have you know really nice plans for the ecological and biodiversity aspect of the space and leaning on the work of wildlife, conservation, Society and Eric sanderson from The Mannahatta Project, bringing back some of the biodiversity from this area and making that part of the public space while supporting the cycling infrastructure just to go over to the Manhattan side.
What it would look like from the level view from the promenade, so this Jersey barrier, which currently is blocking the ramp off, would be shifted over and giving cyclists full access, and here is looking up that ramp with the idea of a pop- up cafe for bike bicycles and cyclists, coming up from the Manhattan side and again.
Lane proposal that was part of our winning competition entry backing this up is this idea of micro force and we want to interweave this into our project wherever we can, which is these small biodiverse forest clusters that have proven that they can be done in cities and done well and bring back biodiversity and plant life and create welcoming spaces for for people in the heart of the city, So we have a few ideas of where these would be deployed on both the Brooklyn and the Manhattan side in Manhattan adjacent to the approaches.
We've got a few areas that, including at the Smith houses, NYCHA Smith houses, as well as adjacent to these vaults, that we're hoping to resuscitate in longer term and just quickly the idea of a of a space for young people, making a really cool, engaging clubhouse kind of space.
This is right, adjacent to the NYCHA housing We think a really awesome place for young people to get together, learn about science, history, technology and engaging issues that local mentors from New York can work with these kids on, hopefully including us.
Types is something that needed to be done through community engagement, and this sketch is just to show that we still intend to work through that, and we know that the removal of a car lane a traffic lane is something that can be contentious, and so, within the competition.
We recognize that, but we also recognize that the changing dynamics of transportation and energy are really forcing us to look at these issues, and we see that Brooklyn bridge is a great place to sort of play that out with the right engagement of stakeholders.
Our community board supports the change of one of the roadway beds to a bike lane in the near term, and it's nice that your proposal has that and so much more So I'd like to open up the questions to committee members.
And, it's 2.5 million, and that's for the two Ramp conversion spaces and the connecting bike lane At some point there were trains that rode over the Brooklyn bridge.
Is, that the inner lane is comes all the way out and basically takes you to tillery, because you can't cross over and bike onto the exit, ramps and likewise, There's a slide there, where you show an area on the platform of the bridge where there's a CitiBike area and maybe a commercial use and a little stopover.
I think, if you, if it seems to be your mission to include biodiversity plus human activity, I, I'm far apart for me to make a suggestion on this creative proposal, but I just like to keep the commercial out off and let them let people just enjoy the view and if they want to stop and relax.
The upper deck would serve folks who want to have more of a you, know, enjoyable view filled air filled, ride, maybe you're taking your time, and the lower deck is more for people that are really their commuters are trying to get from point a to b as quickly as possible.
Maybe you said this, but my question is about mopeds and the bicycles that have motors that the delivery people use a lot, but would they be going on the road with the traffic or with the bikers on the bike?
We see the Brooklyn bridge as a platform for innovation on this kind of issue, and we do not want to hardwire it right now to serve a very particular understanding of vehicles.
So, that's why we would like to reserve this lane over here for sort of the innovation lane for the time being, for for open electrically powered, hybrids, and We do not really know, but that would mean that no electrically powered principles would be officially allowed on this other lane.
You know the nuances yet so that would be one of the important groups to work with, in terms of say, the ramp design, even things that we're looking at in this image and not that walkers are not expedient.
Having, then taken all the elevation out and then having to reverse the elevation by climbing up your spiral ramp onto the bridge, I'm sure the gradient would be good, but they will have already extended all the downward energy and then have to reverse it and on the converse side, on the on the Manhattan side, they're, going to come down to well below the level of park, row and city hall.
One is a follow- up from John's, which is about whether there'll be other like disincentives for bikers to come onto the pedestrian path, because often some of the bike tours will go wherever the view is frankly, and I think those are some of the most dangerous bikers on the bridge.
I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that, and what community engagement will look like both in this first term and in the in the mid to long term great question so just really quickly.
We have not actually formally created the first sandbox meeting Our ideas are to work with groups in the in the in the NYCHA area around here for the Micro Forest to work with the transportation groups and getting you know.
If you want to know more about our process, called the sandbox, you can you can google it There's a video about our process and what it looks like in some of the projects in New York City that we've done in the lower East side, so that will be will be hands- Then you know, we hope by the entire approval process and this process, where you're reaching out to community board two and Manhattan community board.
Projects, like the falls and discovering Columbus, were quite important to us to think about how New York City has done this in the past water on the go a program that we really loved and worked with dion years, ago.
The company can also answer the disruption on current traffic, be it bike, car or pedestrian on the bridge and the length of time.
Covid-19 You know like people coming in for cases, because what used to happen, the biggest issue was the morning time, court and court being right next to a shopping, district.
This is why we had some issues with the shootings near courts and the Fulton Shopping District, and at the same time you know we, since I remember, when these things were happening.
You know at the same time, when I'm mentioning that you know that's, why it's very important that we get the input That's why it's very important that we get the cooperation from the community members and people like yourselves, that if you see something you know, let us know, because we can't be everywhere.
What we hear and have an open hylo to work together and come up with solutions to you know, serve every single person.
If buddy somebody's thinking of any questions about I'll just mention the other thing, I see rise in this neighborhood is package tests that you know people are leaving in their, whether it's in the lobby or in front of their houses.
You know the car test And, it's all not because there's people out there looking for you know like a back in old, days.
That's why you'll only see those two people in the sector- The second question is without getting into you know the debate on it.
I'm certain- have affected your deployment and your in your training and your communications and team management I mean it definitely brings a big toll and a challenge, especially when you know it comes to like quality of life issues or our minor issues.
And if you ask an individual, you know, most people will say: they've always had good interactions with people out of the 84th or out of the 88, which also cover us, but at the same time, police in general, not a specific person or a specific precinct have obviously come under attack.
You know whether you want to protest or you want to just hang out and talk to officer, Or you're, a victim of a crime or you have any other issues.
Maybe, you could speak to some of your initiatives that you may be working on in that regard, for the the NYPD as well has mandated every single officer supervisor and everybody to go into a crisis intervention training, which is like a three day, which is the same thing.
You, know so, but we're trying to stay on top of it, especially with the bike lanes and bus stops.
You know we might have to use every single person, that's working for reinforcement from other pieces that will come and give us.
They would not incur the ire of the community, and it just seems like the easiest quickest solution to having to patrol statues that people do not want around, and if this committee and the police department would be supportive of efforts to peacefully remove the statues of Columbus at the very least in front of the kings County building in a Supreme Court building in downtown Brooklyn.
Most of them are like private If, I may, to close out our Brooklyn bridge forest presentation, with emotion on that, maybe caroline or Rob. You could speak to us about what they may be seeking from us.
We're not calling for the closing of the Brooklyn bridge, like they've done in some other areas, so I think it's clear that we support you know The multi- users of the Brooklyn bridge that includes bicyclists and pedestrians and and Clark, So I would make a notion that we support the proposal as presented and leave it at that.
That's now vehicular on the Brooklyn bridge, And I think it included taking a lane on the lower level of the Manhattan bridge to be exclusively bikes.
As I, understand it, it's to support the Brooklyn bridge forest, including the dedication of what they call, including the dedication of two present vehicular lanes, one in each direction for exclusive use of two- wheeled vehicles, because they talked about motorized and pedaled bikes and the extension of.
I had questioned him about the landmarks issues about having the bike lanes on the upper deck, the promenade painted, etc, and he had indicated flexibility of working with landmarks to either keep them down.
There's, a bike lane there, , Let's just support his day: zero phase, zero plan, We talk about equity for a minute, because I do not know what the Manhattan CB1 group agreed to, but, given that you know they've spent so long against infill on the Smith houses right, it seems kind of strange that we would allow a developer, potentially the developer of Smith houses, to be a title sponsor in this and add to that.
I would like to open it up to other business, which is the the section for the Community Board and committee members to propose other business, and I know John two And then after that will be community forum, where Victoria, if you're still on you, can talk about the statues of Columbus, Okay, so other business, yep.
But then it would be a community board or Executive committee vote to support something like that.
You know all of these groups work together when they have to or when you FOIL something We really should not be doing things like this, without having it on the agenda.
So people at least the community knows what we're thinking about, but I would really ask if it's going to anything's going to happen with this.
