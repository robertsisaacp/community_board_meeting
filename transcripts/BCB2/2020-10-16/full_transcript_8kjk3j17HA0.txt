Ms Thurston, do you want to go first, hi, I'm Jessica Thurston, I'm the secretary Excellent Mr Varela Mcknight good evening, nicole mcknight public member, hey, I believe, that's it Victor! Do we have you on the phone thinking? No okay! Well, we're going to it's going to take a little while before we get Quorum for our meeting, so I'm going to hold off on asking to approve the agenda, but we have a number of people in the audience and I want to be considerate of our speakers. Who've come this evening, so I'm going to invite our speakers to kick off their presentation for the evening. Do we have Miss Rosamond Fletcher from Fort Greene Conservancy? I see Miss Fletcher, but she may be muted there we go unmuting excellent. Thank you just to check in do we also have Mr Nicholas Bajerra from the fountainhouse. We have Elliott Madison. Instead from fountainhouse he is executive, director, yeah, okay, great excellent cool, so I I'm not sure who to kick off with, but Miss Fletcher do you do you were first on the agenda? Should we kick off with you sure we're all together we're a team. Christina is also here, I believe, she's on the phone. I'm here you're there, great okay, so very quickly, we're just going to say a little bit about ourselves and and then about a project that we're working on together. So my name is Rosamond Fletcher, I'm the executive director of the Fort Greene Park Conservancy, I started last year. I have just a spring information. I have a sort of design and planning background, formerly with the design, trust for public space and also the center for architecture. So I'm I was very excited to have the opportunity to join the forbidden park conservancy and in the year that I've been there. We've started some really exciting new things which you'll hear about very quickly. If you do not know about us, we've been around for about 20 years and our mission, which we've recently updated, is to preserve and Nourish Fort Greene Park as a community resource and a public space for all new yorkers for two generations to come, and we do this through programming and through maintenance and through advocacy, so I'll stop right there and just let Christina introduce herself and let Elliot introduce himself, and then we will tell you about this project we're working on. So my name is Christina Sparrick, I'm the treasurer of Fort Greene, Park Conservancy. I was born in four greenhouses a long time ago, moved to East New York, and I came back to Fort Greene and been here for the past 21 years. I'm a certified public accountant who lives with a mental health condition and having a mental health condition. I never believed I was disabled, but an able person with a unique gift, you're going to hear more about our our project, but I just want to give you a little background about my advocacy in 2013. I was assaulted and I called 9- 1- 1 and a huge mistake I made was identifying myself as a person who lived with bipolar disorder, and so when the police arrived, they treated me as a victim, but they did not treat me as they did not treat me as a victim, but as a criminal and like I was crazy and from then on. I realized that people living with mental health conditions did not have a voice or did not have any rights, and that sparked my interest in mental health advocacy and training for cit training for the police department of Department of corrections. That's about it. Okay, Eli hi, I'm Elliott Madison, the Clubhouse executive director and senior director of programs at fountainhouse. We are a organization that works with folks with severe mental illness. We've been around for about 72 years, we're located in Manhattan in the Bronx, but we our model, which we started, has spread in over 30 states and over 30 countries, the closest clubhouse to your community board. I think it actually is in the community border. Very close is the Birkeland clubhouse, so it's a sister clubhouse of ours and our model works together. Social practitioners, so staff that have been specifically trained to work in various environments to really bring up the strengths and people connect them to the services that to bring recovery. We believe in a recovery model of working with people, we've been doing that for 72 years in the city and we're really excited to be part of this project, because I think it's really in line with our mission of trying to work together with folks that need us. So with that. What is this project? The project that we're working on is called the person- centered intervention, training or pcit response pilot at Fort, Greene Park. So in partnership with fountainhouse, and also with New York city parks, we want to assess the viability and the effectiveness of an alternative model to what currently is an enforcement based response to people who are living with mental health illness in Fort Greene Park. So we want to look at something that is community driven non- enforcement based and something that changes the that redirects park, users from what would otherwise be an NYPD referral to an array of health ecosystem resources, so, whether that's wellness opportunities, jobs or housing. These are all things that fountain house does as part of their care management model. It's very important to the Fort Greene Park Conservancy, one of our values that we just reaffirmed is the value of belonging. So it's extremely important that all park users feel like that they have the right to be in public space that they belong, especially those that have mental illness. On those that have experienced trauma. You know, as you know, four green park is at the center of. I think one of the greatest actual socioeconomic disparities in the city there's such a wide difference in resources from one side of the park to the other, and you know we know that mental illness does not discriminate. But we also know that the resources and services to support positive mental health are not equitably distributed. So we think that it's important to provide a very direct connection to services and to also have better interactions in the park, one that are more based on empathy. So what are we going to do? We are saying we're going to embed a dedicated team of peer specialists and social practitioners, so peer specialists being those that are living with mental illness and because of that know much better how to interact with others who are also experiencing that living with it. And so these, this team of social practitioners and peer specialists would function as sort of like trust agents in the park and we'd have sort of different shifts, and they would work to proactively develop relationships with people in and around the park, and I say around because we need to look at the whole ecosystem of the neighborhood. We need to look at you know our neighbor, the Brooklyn hospital center. We need to look at the shelters and we need to have sort of active connections not just in the park, but you know on site with community partners. One other aspect of this is that, and Christina will go into this in a minute- is that the park enforcement patrol that we have would take what we call pcit training and she'll explain that in order to be able to better understand why we're doing this and to be able to coordinate with this team of sort of on- site peer specialists, yeah go ahead and jump in thanks. So I know we have a few minutes left so currently. Now we rely on NYPD to address or respond to all these nine- on-. One calls and NYPD is not equipped or capable to respond to all emergencies. They can not respond to mental health. Calls. Mental health calls need to be responded by a public health response. Too many people too often are being killed by police and it's not right. They need public health services, so we train the retraining, the pep offices, the park enforcement offices on pcit, we'll consolidate some of the training from C, a Christ intervention training which was designed for NYPD, and we will train them also with the peer scented model which peer specialist. When we learned about empathy, anti- racism, cultural competency and de- escalation techniques, this confined model will actually bridge community relations. It will teach people offices how to better, engage with people who are in crisis and who knows themselves. A lot of cops in offices do suffer from mental health themselves too. We're just looking for basically positive outcomes in the community when it relates to mental health and Elliot. I do not know if you just wanted to briefly share about Woodruff park, and then we can take some questions. Yeah, I would like it's a woodwork park. Is the very large park in right, downtown Atlanta, which for many years was perceived to be not a safe place to go because of what was perceived as homeless and mentally ill and people with fiction issues had are were in the park, and we consulted with that group to embed social practitioners in there, and the results were quite staggering as far as the number of people that got homes, the number of people that got connected to addiction, services and things like that glad to share that with you. But what was really important out of that is that things that we're seeing people that were seen as a problem. Actually, what we've always believed at fountainhouse can be part of the solution. They need to be part of the solution. They actually add value to the park, experience for the others and that in Woodruff park the program takes place around a game kiosk, so they manage the game. Kiosks, give out chess boards and cornhole ping pong pedals and stuff, but they added an amenity to the park and that's kind of what we're talking about is it's not. We should not look at people with mental health as a problem. We should look at as lost potential and they are our community and by connecting them with resources by creating services that work, they can actually add it's not just taking up care of a problem in the park, but can actually make the park better for families for everybody that is using the parking. That's why we're really excited to be able to work on a similar model here in our own city. You know we do have a clubhouse in Atlanta also, but it would be nice to work on a model, and you know closer to home yeah, and this model will, in addition to the social worker, would have the peer specialist aspect to it, which we're really very excited about. Just briefly on the status of this we are. We have we're in the process of exploring several very large grants to support this, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and some other Van Moringen Foundation and some others, and so we're very hopeful that we'll be able to start this next year and we do have very high level approval of New York city parks for this, and so we really think it's just a matter of getting the funds and then we're very excited to begin it, but as one piece of it that we did not get into is that we do plan to have a community advisory council as part of it. So before any of this would get going, we would get you know be reaching out, including to this group, to get people more involved in the project, and so that is definitely one of the next steps in the coming months. With that, I think we're available to take questions. I do not know how much time we have well, we can certainly field some questions. Thank you very much for your presentation and really you know hats off to you all for the tremendous work that you're doing, because it's the issues that you've espoused are things that I think our committee is very concerned about as a whole, and I think you know it's great to hear that there are alternative options out there. I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit more about the kinds of people who are act, who would actually engage in lieu of the police officers with the with with someone who's mentally ill in the park? What kind of qualifications would they have? What kind of training and what? How do we determine that? These are the right people to go out and consult yeah Christina? I think, can feel that one right, so I'm going to be training since I've certified a certified cit training, which has been recently pulled from NYPD, because I know you put it in the link that they still have an act of training. I can teach the pep officers on how to engage with people in crisis and second, I'm also a peer specialist, and so I know how to escalate your techniques and Christ's communication skills. So I will also work with the peers as well. Impaired specialists and social workers and fountainhouse is also a professional net as well yeah, so the people that will be working most directly with people that might be in crisis or just people that need some extra services are going to be state, certified peer specialists and then social workers, the right people to really be working with people that are trying to manage with an illness, and that's the right group of people that have historically gotten us the best results for great. Thank you. We've been joined by another member of the committee, Mr Andrews. You want to introduce yourself really quickly. Mr Andrews may be having some connectivity issues. We can come back to him. Do any members of the committee have any questions for our presenters, Mr Varela hi. Thank you. Thank you for this great presentation and as Brandon said this is this is something that we've been talking about here about how we can support both something mental health services, both something ubiquitous but also mobile, and so this is kind of a great project and I'm curious about what it will look like if it were to start if it were fully funded. How many people do you see in the park working how often and yeah start there at the moment, what we're budgeting for is having teams so a peer specialist and a social working worker working alongside each other and having two shifts of those per day. So it's at the moment it's not envisioned as 24 hours, but it is envisioned as 16 hours. I think, depending upon funding, we could revisit that. But so it's meant to be yeah every. You know full- time for both of those teams. So but there would be four individuals that would be part of it and then there would of course, be Fort. Greene Park actually has a dedicated park enforcement patrol, which is really good because in most places around the city, they're sort of roving, and so you never get to work with the same folks, and so that gives us a unique opportunity to train them. So we hope also that they will become active participants in the pilot and just to be clear, they would have access to the fountainhouse kind of ecology of services. We have housing, we have a clinic with both behavioral and medical care. We have home and community- based services. We have care coordination. The participants of this project would have access to all that, so there would be a lot of support for these two teams to do the work that they need to be doing excellent. Thank you any other questions from members of the committee hi. This is nicole mcknight. I have a couple of questions, so how will you identify the people who are in need of these services? Well, how it works and woodwork park is that most people identify themselves. They have. They have specific. They may not identify themselves because of stigma of having an addiction or having a mental health issue, but they're willing to identify themselves as wanting to be respected needing some help, maybe with whatever a food, stamps application or housing. Our idea is to create a an environment around an amenity so that we can engage people to give back. So it's not just an outreach team. Waking people up on the side and saying can I help you. We have a different model, which is we're working side by side with folks so that they can feel free to ask us for help. It's what I think rosamund talked about it's this concept of a trust agent, but also to add to that sorry it's the fact that, like studies show that one out of four people live with a mental health diagnosis, it could be severe a minor in the times of code when people have lost their jobs and losing their loved ones and on so much uncertainty I mean a lot of us even on the phone may be going through some trauma and it does not have to be major, but you could be walking through the park sitting on the bench just crying, because you just lost your job or you're afraid, because you have Covid-19 and you'll see a pair of specials in the consumer or part a pep office to come by and say, hey what's going on, and can we help you and then at that time you may feel like with me, and you may feel, like you made comfortable me and say: hey Christina, you know I'm going through this. Do you want to talk and I'll sit there and just listen to you and that's all? I would do, and I may say: do you want a cup of coffee because I'm trying to de- escalate it? I want you to feel well, I want you to feel safe and even when I'm at building there's a particular guy who gets drunk every day, he gets every payday and scares everybody in my building. But I've known him for 20 years. I'm not afraid of him. Police pick him up all the time, but you know what I can de- escalate him because I know him well. I know what how he thinks and that's what appears that's what appears about getting that connection, that relationship not being afraid to play police scare, everyone who wants a police to come to anyone when they're in crisis. You need a human being human being just to talk to you and listen to you just being there every day you get to know the economy right, it's not coming once a week as part of an outreach van and then going off to another place another. This would be the workspace you get to know the people and they get to know you and to be honest at woodwork park. A lot of it is also referrals. Somebody in the park, you know, can come and say: hey, I think, somebody's really struggling on the other side of the park. Why do not you guys go check it out and see if you can help? You know, people are not afraid to come to the people working at the game. Cart, you know like they may be going up to a police officer or something like that. You know it's different. It changes the dynamic immediately. Thank you. So my follow- up question to your answers, then, is that how will people find out about the services that you're offering because they need to be aware of it to take advantage of it? We hope to have some materials out. We hope to introduce ourselves into the community in the park community in the neighboring park community, because it's not just the park community right. It's not like oh you're, on the other side of the street. We can't help you that's not how this kind of works, but it takes time to be honest, you know, trust is not something anybody kind of is entitled to it's something that we would have to work on in having an amenity having something that we're adding to the park, not just not just to the people in need, but that everybody, I think, we're also very gregarious right, christina. We like to talk so we're talking about yeah we're talking about how to connect this to the programming. The conservancy already does how to connect it to the visitor center and some of the other places around the park that are very active. So how to you know this is something that we also want to discuss with. The community advisory group is exactly there's a sort of subtle balance about presence here. We do not want to come on too strong, and we do not want to be something that people want to walk away from, because they see official shirts on you or something, but we also want to be open and communicate about the project. So that is one of the areas that I think we're still working on and would love to have some input, because it needs to be exactly right for this community. Thank you very much for this. In the midst of this we're joined by another committee member Miss Cobb, do you want to briefly introduce yourself and you're Unmute Miss Cobb there we go thanks. I'm sorry, I'm a coach! Thank you. Thank you. It's nice to see you miss Cobb. Thank you. I think, with this I'll ask. Do any other members of the committee have any questions for the for the presenters? Okay, I'm not seeing any. I did just want to ask you guys. What do you feel we can do as a committee to best help your mission? We we're very interested in this subject. Well, I think in particular the sort of the end of this conversation about like how it you know how we communicate out and how public this is. I think, is something that we want to talk more about both. You know it how it shows up in the park, but also on you know, at different locations around the park through other programs and engagement opportunities. So that is an area we would really love to continue the conversation with you. I think the advisory board we're hoping that some folks from here would be part of that yeah. Definitely great well. Thank you very much just want to ask, because we do want to make everything available for the public, and we have several members of the public who may be here on other matters or they may be here for this tonight. Were there any members of the public who had a question for these presenters about their presentation today. I just want to give it a minute or so just so that I can make sure, because we are living in a digital world yeah. I mean from my point of view. I just want to add oh presenting yeah we're presenting for something a little bit later, but it sounds like a fantastic initiative and as a foregreener for the past seven years, Brooklyn for 11., you know I really look forward to seeing how we can support this. Thank you, you're Jason Burrell, I'm. I am indeed great. Thank you very much for your comments. Sir! That's most welcome! Okay! I I'm not seeing I think there here's a question: how do we reach you to talk about local partnerships? I'll put my email in the chat, it's Rosamund, Fort Greenpark.Org, great excellent! Well, thank you all very much for your presentation this evening. We greatly enjoyed it, we'll look forward to seeing and hearing more about your group in the future. Thank you for the opportunity. Thank you have a good evening. Great, have a nice thing all right! Well we're going to move along to our next point and we're actually going to take it back a step. I'm going to ask. Is there a motion to approve tonight's agenda? We do have quote some moved motion by Jessica. We have a second, I see a second by Acasa, all in favor, with the amendment of doing the presentation. First, as we just did: okay Mr Varela's in favor and I'm in favor, and this cop is in favor too, and this mcknight is in favor great excellent. Thank you all right, we'll proceed with our next agenda item for the evening. I want to ask Miss church to introduce herself too. I'm sorry, I did not introduce you earlier Carol Anne, but you are an important member of our committee, so I'd like for you to introduce yourself good evening, Everyone Carol, Ann, Church assistant district manager for Cv2. Thank you. So, on tonight's agenda we have, let's see one two three four, five, six, seven, eight new full on premise: liquor licenses to go through the first one on the agenda is 224 green, Avenue, Cafe bar laker. Do we have a representative here from this organization? I was representing them, but we adjourn the hearing until next month. I'm just here on another matter. Okay, I got the message from the disc from the board office that that's the case so we'll mark that as moved over for next month. Okay, thank you. Next on the agenda, we've got 306 gold street entity to be determined hi good evening. Who is that Mr Kelly? That is me jake and then the proposed owner is men well sentence? Okay, I see Manuel, okay, great okay, so my screen should be coming up for you and let me know if it does not. No, I can see it. I can see it right and I think maybe it might be helpful to make it a little bit bigger for you. Is this fine with everyone? Okay for me, okay, so just to give you a little bit of background before I introduce man while the talk a little bit more, my name is Jake tristler from Howron and levy. It's good to see all of you. It feels like it's been forever in this strange new world that we're in, but 306 gold street has been operating with an on- premise liquor license since 2016.. The two owners of this license have decided to close their business. They've actually sold their business to the applicant Manuel centestiban as part of an asset purchase agreement. The asset purchase agreement did not include the liquor license. So now we are here to obtain a new liquor license it's the exact same company. It's the same menu same operations, it's just a brand new liquor license and mister sentence bond was actually the chef and manager previously so now he's taking over a larger role just before we go through the application or the packet. Just a few things to point out for everyone. It's a small, peruvian restaurant, with 20 tables, 40 seats and 10 bar seats. The operating hours are Sunday through Thursday 11 A.M to 10 P.M and Friday, and Saturday 11 A.M to 12 A.M recorded background music. Only with no outdoor space. There are three other op licenses within 500 feet: one restaurant one hotel and one tavern tavern bar. So let me know you know if I can go page by page and kind of point things out to you. What would you like to see within the actual application? And pack it so I think if you can just circle down to the hours, that's usually a good thing for us to see and if we can just take a look at that, so it looks like you're going to be open until 10 o'clock during the week 12 o'clock on Friday Saturday, and you have no outdoor area as background music. Only correct okay, all right, so you can see we're at 20 indoor tables, 40 seats, 10 bar seats, it's relatively small at 1200 feet for customer service area 1600 feet altogether, as you said previously: no outdoor, no door areas and again this was a licensed premise. Since 2016. its former iteration has closed again, it's the same concept same menu, pretty much is exactly the same. Even the same furniture inside it's just kind of been passed down, mister to Mr, Santisteban, now and manuel. If you would like you can unmute yourself and just you know, say hi and say you know what your plans are for the space and what your experience has been working working at the location previously manny. Can you hear us? Okay? I do not know maybe he's having some technical difficulties, but for those of you who might not be familiar, the restaurant sits in between the intersection of Johnson, Street and Tillery Street. There's another 500 map you can look at so there are some op licenses. There's tavern wine licenses, a few liquor stores and a grocery store license as well. This is a 500-foot report detailing what those licenses are no churches or schools within 500 feet. This is the peruvian menu for you just to browse, there's a quite an extensive selection of Ceviche. Did you say that the new owner was with the business previously or yeah? So he was the chef and oh great manager of the space great, and I apologize, I'm not sure I think maybe he's just having some problems connecting connecting the audio forward. It's okay! It happens to everybody in this age, so it makes sense. Are you all aware of any complaints or concerns expressed by neighbors or any residents about the existing restaurant north? Anything like that? No! I did a little bit of research. I could not come up with anything. If there are, you know, I'm more than welcome to take a look at that and address any concerns anyone has, but I'm not aware of any, and I do not believe that Manuel is either okay questions from members of the committee Mr Varela. Yes, I see you hi, I am I see on the application that you expect to employ, or you currently employ- or I do not know if it's, maybe you can tell us, will you be hiring 10 to 15 new people, or that is just who currently works there and will continue to work there? It's going to be a mix most likely of both, so this restaurant did close right when Kobe started happening, so it will probably be a mix. Some employees might not be returning, but there will definitely be probably a few new hires at least probably five to seven new hires, possibly more. That will be incurring within a few months. Okay! Well, this is what I'm about to say has no bearing on the application, whether it's approved or not. It's just a sort of kind of a community reminder that we, in addition to the recession, that we're about to experience or that we've already begun to experience there are pockets of high unemployment within CB2. It would be great to see some of those jobs go to the communities that most need them and specifically to brown and black employees, not just in the kitchen in front of house. So I highly encourage you to communicate this to the applicant. If you would yeah, I would love to I'm. You know one of the reasons I love to come to the CB3 meetings and even if I just see the recordings as I'm also a resident of CB2, I love to know what's happening, and hopefully we can all. You know impact change in a positive way within our own communities, and I know that that's a big important factor for Mr Santis Ben as well. Thank you. Thank you. Mr Varela, any other questions from members of the committee hey trying to scroll through everybody. I do not see any other questions from members of the committee members of the public. Are there any questions from members of the public for this application? If you could raise use the raise your hand feature in Webex, okay, I have. I have received a report of no hands and I see no hands. So. Thank you very much for your presentation. Thank you for the committee. Is there a motion regarding this application motion to approve Ms Thurston moves to approve? Is there a second a second from Ms Cobb? We heard that you seconded it. Yes. Was there any discussion on the motion? Okay, I I'll call everybody by my name: Miss Thurston, Mr, Varela, Miss, Cobb, Miss Cobb. If you want, if you want a nod, I can it looks like you're approving or a thumbs up. Okay, there you go Miss Mcknight approved okay and I vote to approve as well too so unanimous. Thank you very much and Mr Andrews. Oh Mr, Andrews! Are you on the line he yeah Mr Andrews go ahead and speak you're unmuted? Oh yes, I vote for it. Yes, thank you. Thank you! Mr Andrews. Okay, thank you. All next up we've got 45 main street evil. Twin, I see. Mr Argullo is raising your hand. Yes, that's me sorry about that. No worries we're happy to have you are you? Are you the only one we have for this application? I'm the only one we have for the application. That's fine! That's fine! All right! Let me do having trouble sharing content right now anyway, so I'm representing evil twin, brewing, evil. Queen brewing, is a brewery that started in 2009, doing Gypsum family-, owned business owned by Yeppa and Maria Yarnett bierzo, who were from denmark. They moved to the states in 2009 doing gypsy brewing, so they have not had production space of their own until recently, in 2018, when we began the build out on our 1616 George Street Ridgewood location, which is a 10 000 square foot brewing facility and office, as well as about a 4 000 square foot courtyard, which also houses our tap room Mr. Yes, you should be able to share content now, go ahead and select there in the upper left hand corner while we're waiting for Mr Gargolo. I understand Mr Harrison is joined for the evening. So hello. How are you sorry, Mr Aaron Sorry, to hear about the bus, Mr Harrison, but we're happy to have you this evening, Mr Gargoulo, if you want to jump back into the presentation, all right? Sorry about that, so we are proposing to open, what's called a branch office which is effectively another tap room. Our New York, State Brewers license, allows us to open five locations or branch offices under that, and we have selected Dumbo and 45 main street. Has that location? You can see the lamp report in front of you? No church is a school within 500 feet. A handful liquor stores and within 750 feet looks like about 10 other liquor licenses. Could you zoom in on your screen a bit? Please thanks. So much okay, much better! Thank you! Okay, no problem! So there's our lamp report there. If we go to the application, we will talk about proposed hours for this new business alcohol service hours Monday through Thursday, 12 P.M to 12, A.M, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Friday, Saturday. Excuse me extending to 2 A.M, potentially music will be all background. No outdoor seating, the numbers for the occupancy have changed since we've gotten an architect in there, so our total occupancy is actually going to be below 75, and I have here an updated version of the new floor plan, so bench seating bar of about 20 and some other bench seating there as well, and that's pretty much it I'll leave it up for questions. When do you plan to open? Did you say that we did not plan to open? Hopefully we're looking at first quarter 2021 at this point in the process and because of the amount of the limited amount of construction that we're going to do on the space, the liquor license will be the driving force in that timeline. Great thanks question other questions from the committee. Mr Varela, two things one: can you talk a little bit about and I apologize if you just said this, but I was trying to read as you were talking. Can you speak a little bit to the resident situation there in is the building is a big building. Of course it is a office building, so it's 12 floors all office occupants and then retail on the ground level. Are you adjacent to or do you face a resident building? Do you have an? Is there any outdoor space that will be utilized? It faces the residents built for relatively not going to be using any outdoor space. Currently we're directly facing the street on main street. I believe there is a residence acrosss, the street from us kind of Caddy Corner. I'm sorry did I miss one part of your question. No, but that does lead me to 1.5. It's just. Do you get? Did you when you were collecting signatures? Did you get any from the nearby residents? Did you get any pushback from any of the nearby residents? We did not collect signatures from that specific building. A lot of that had to do with at the time of starting the application was the beginning of cobit and not having a lot of access to the space in general. We do be part of our. We do have a resident here in the as a letter of support from around the corner, but to our knowledge we have not had any pushback or protest to our business and then my second question is really more of a comment. It's just! It's essentially what I said to the previous applicant about local hiring. How many people do you expect to employ we're looking to employ probably about 15 people at this location give or take to follow up on that? There will be some crossover from our current business, but that's going to be limited, we're looking to hire new for this space. Thank you any other questions from members of the committee. Okay, I'm not I'm not seeing any other questions from the committee. Any questions from the members of the community who are here tonight for this application, 45 main street you can use the raise your hand feature in Webex to indicate that you want to ask a question. If you do okay, I am I see we have someone who would like to ask a question: miss Glitterburn. Do you have a question, I'm so sorry? I thought I put down my hand. I did not mean to raise it. Thank you. Oh okay. Well, that's fine! It's equally fine to have a question or not have a question with that. I'm going to close off the time for public questions and ask the committee: do we have a motion for this application? Mr Varela? Do we have a second okay? Second, from Miss Thurston discussion on the motion? Okay, hearing, no discussion, I'll get everybody's vote now: Mr Varela? How do you vote Miss, Mcknight, Mr, Andrews, Mr Andrews? Do we have your vote? Mr Andrews? You can go ahead and speak you're, unmuted approve and Mr Harrison yeah. I do not see an audio next to his name. Okay, so we may have to put him down for an abstain. Okay, I vote to approve. So thank you all very much for your presentation. All right. The next one on the agenda was 57 front, but I understand they are laid over until next month. So we get to move on 87, Lafayette Avenue. I do not have a name for this application but happy to hear from anyone here from 87 lafayette. Okay, not seeing anyone here from 87 lafayette. We can try coming back to them when we're all done with these, but 71 lafayette, the Brooklyn hospitality partners. You have anybody here from that application brandon before that goes, I mean it does not change, probably, but I see the applicant for the previous one they're just muted, oh okay. I think it's Isaac and Twee. Okay, that matches the name on the application. Mr Antwe go ahead and speak you're unmuted, my presenter is online. His name is Vega Lee. Okay, you can go ahead. Yes, I see this person this Mr Lee. You can go ahead and speak you're. Also unmuted Mr Lee. If you're calling in a cell phone in addition to online you'll need to unmute your cell phone, perhaps we could come back yeah. I think we should move on and we can we can. We can circle back to this one and we're just go through the next ones who are here and we can connect with and we'll come right back to this 71 lafayette, Brooklyn, hospitality partners from that yeah. You have myself Jason brel, representing for Brooklyn hospitality partners, and you also have my partner Ty Lee, and we have a third who's actually taking care of our other space. Our sister space ends well, which is in the same neighborhood tonight. So it's the three of us there's always one of us there so I'll start sharing, and then we can go through it quickly. Let me know when everybody can see my screen here we go so I will give everybody a little bit kind of an overview. So there's myself and tai. We've been partners over at Enswell on Fulton Street, just around the corner of 71 lafayette for the past 18 months, very interesting for the past six months to say the very least, but we're doing well we're open. We have probably 75 of our staff back full time all people that we employed before Kovidz. So that's great to hear the space that I'm going to be speaking about now has continually had the license for the past 15 years. At the very least, it was known as mulleins before it actually dates back as a pub to 1933, so it has been there open operating for a number of years kind of a pinnacle of the neighborhood. The space again came to our possession. Unfortunately, previous owner had some health complications and then Covid-19 hit, and he no longer had kind of the interest in running it and moved to Florida as for kind of the changes, we're making very much cosmetic changes and just modernizing the menu similar to what we did with ends. Well, when we took over that space again a lot of beautification going into the space, but nothing structural going to be happening. You know we there's been no adverse history with the space whatsoever. It has strong connections to the neighborhood and we want to continue that when we speak about our space, we've done a number of you know different events. We had a fundraiser for for bam before the close down we had. It was their holiday fundraiser party Tai. Also, we use the space. He has he volunteers with a group called code nation that takes tech professionals and places them in under resourced high schools to teach technical skills, and we also work very closely with fab Fulton, the Business Administration and Christina Chavez to really elevate kind of the neighborhood overall and really help out businesses, particularly during this really trying time and you'll see that we do have a letter of support from her as well. So that being said, I can go through some of the hours before we get into the concept, so the hours that we're looking for are 11 A.M to 4 A.M, which, again, that is exactly in line with what they had previously. So nothing has changed. We do have a provision to do some earlier. Events say if it were things like the Olympics or the Rugby, six nations competition or if it was a premier league event, there are numbered places that would do this as well, namely policies, the douglas or the chip shop, both unfortunately have closed. So we're very much looking forward to kind of filling that gap and that need and when we talk about live events, the live events would be maybe a jazz band for brunch or a trio playing traditional iris music for St Patrick's day, so that's kind of what we're talking about for there as far as seating and outdoor space. Let me just scroll down and get to that. Oh that's, the layout, seating outdoor. Let me scroll right past it and apologies. There we go here. We go so again we're doing no structural changes, we're keeping the layout, as is indoor tables. We have 28:56 seats. We have bar seats 16 now outdoor tables, we do have private property in front which is on the property line and we do have a patio to the side as well, so we're looking at 18 tables, 36 seats, the private patio spaces aside, that's 10 tables, 20 seats and luckily enough with open restaurants. We do have space because we're on the corner, and there is no bus lane. We do have room for 15 tables and 30 seats and I can give you kind of a look at the layout here: apologies for kind of the formatting, so we're going from the front to the back. So we have that is the open restaurant seating. We have a large sidewalk. Then we have our private space right here. Then we move through to our indoor space to the right. You have the patio seating and to the far right you have. The outdoor restaurant seating directly next to us is 40 acres and a meal as well Spike Lee's studio, which is great and we've already spoken with them, and we've heard a lot of enthusiasm from them as well, because, as you can imagine, spike is excited for some sports to get back to the neighborhood. That being said, I can go through kind of our concept again. Our name is fancy free and we are a traditional pub. So we are really looking to bring back that feel of the contemporary and classic pub culture. For anybody who knows us, anybody has been to endswell, we really pride ourselves on having a top- notch service. So if you've ever seen our reviews again, we have 4.7 on Google and I think, we're at least we're 4.7 or 4.5 on yelp right now, and we have glowing reviews about how accessible our services and how just kind of lovely our staff are- and we very much pride ourselves on that. So not only again are we looking to provide the best fare in the neighborhood, but we want to have the best experience as well a little bit about the redesign. I know we're talking about being very culturally diverse. I will say for our our business currently we're very happy to be very culturally diverse, not only when it comes to ethnicity, but also when it with lgbtQ&As. Well, so very much. We are kind of a minority minded and we make sure that we are inclusive of the neighborhood and when we say neighborhood representing everyone in the neighborhood, we can get down to the sample menu. Again, we're going to be very kind of cocktail centric here at enswell, we have kind of a french twist on things here, we're going to go a lot with kind of staples and twists on and riffs. I should say on classics I think we're lucky enough. Our third partner who's, our general manager at Enswell, is probably one of the best mixologists, I would say in the city and he's come up with kind of a new bar program. That's really going to, I think, drive traffic to not just us but hopefully to the neighbor overall neighborhood overall, because I think all ships will kind of rise as far as the food menu. I think the most interesting thing about a pub is how versatile it can be, so we want to make sure that we do have kind of the staples. Of course you know Mac and Cheese fried chicken sandwich things like that fish and chips, but a pub is able to kind of incorporate a lot of things and soak in a lot of things in the culture surrounding it. So that's why you see a lot in british pubs. You'll see a lot of indian food and curries, and things like that here in the U.S you'll see a lot of nachos and kind of that mexican influence as well. So we want to make sure that we're bringing that all in we're looking at chef right now and speaking with chef who's, local in Fort Greene as well, who has a caribbean background so bringing in that kind of a caribbean element as well so kind of a good melting pot, but with that kind of party pub feel throughout a bit about ourselves, a first generation American, so American Canadian. I came here from Montreal I originally I've lived a little bit all over, so I bartended and lived in London I bartended and lived in Paris at one time I coned a space in montreal which I sold before I moved to New York, which again been here for 11 years, loving it seven years in Fort Greene, and I co- own this space with my partner from Enswell. So time not sure if you want to chime in because I know I'm not monopolizing a lot of the time here. But if you want to chime in and talk about yourself a little bit yeah so I've been here, my name is Ty, I'm the other partner of Enswell and one of the partners of Brooklyn hospitality and yeah. I've been in New York. Now for about 11 years I was actually my name is Ty, but I'm actually vietnamese. My mom gave birth to me in Thailand. That's why my name is Tai from Thailand, and so I came over to this country and yeah, but as well as one of my first bars, partnering up with Jason learned a lot from the business, but my specialty is definitely systems operations and that's what kind of brings to the table and we're hoping to bring that kind of efficiency to the new space too great thanks so much and then I'll, be speaking on behalf of our other partner Daniel who's helming, the bar tonight. So, as you can see, there's always one of us there, so we rarely actually see each other. But that being said so Daniel is going to be a partner general manager over at the new space. Daniel comes with a wealth of knowledge in mixology. He started as operations manager on this creme Brulee cart, which grew from one cart to. I believe it was a fleet of 12 at one point he bartended in San Francisco, which led him to New York to really be at the center of everything when it comes to mixology, and he luckily came to us as a beverage director so for the past 18 months, he's been beverage director over at Enswell been doing so phenomenally so that we decided to bring him in as a partner over at our new space fancy free, so just logistics. I can go into, but I think at this point other than that I can go through the petition. We did luckily, with all the regulars that we have, we were able to collect 40 signatures. People were just really can you move on from the signatures? It's great that you're able to get the signatures. It's just. We do not want to put the signature. We do not want to put all these addresses up on our sure. Absolutely you know thanks absolutely so we have 40 signatures and then, on top of that we got a letter of recommendation from fab Fulton today, and that greatly appreciate your presentation. I think you know the committee will have may have some questions here. The one thing I just want to touch on first is particularly the 4 am closing time and the and the outdoor space the outdoor space mulleins looked like it had this like it looks like kind of like a sidewalk cafe, or something like that in front of the location. Is that the outdoor space that you're using and how? What kind of contact have you had with the upstairs neighbors? Yes, yeah there's? Actually it's the exact same outdoor space that we're using that Mullane's had was that space out front I've been able to get in contact with a lot of the neighbors around the space which you'll see from the petition. Again, most of the people on the position are within either, not if they're, not on the block. They're within, like a two to three block radius of there and everybody's been really enthusiastic. I did go to knock it's either and I can contact the landlord again. It's either vacant or somebody has left town for now. So I did not get any response when I went by. Unfortunately, the only neighbors that I did contact that I did have contact with were over from 40 acres, which is by Glee's studio and they're, all very enthusiastic about having the space open again. So that was kind of my the reaction of that as far as the 4 am license again, there are a number we have a 4 m license. Currently at endswell there is a 4 am license with mohs, which is probably about 200 feet from us, and there was, I believe, frame license at Frank's before closed down, which is prior just prior to Covid-19, okay, and it is intent to really play live music until 3:30 A.M, because that seems to be the what's written there on the license. Yeah, not at all. No, that is strictly for brunch purposes, so it would be it's not an evening thing. We'd also, you know be closing the outdoor space at 11:30, maybe doing last call 11:30 and being having everybody close by midnight because, again we're not looking. I live in the neighborhood. Most of our staff live in the neighborhood and we're not looking to be a disruption again with ends. While we have foreign license, we have no complaints and if we did have any, we would make sure to address them. But again the music is more of a early brunch thing and for special occasions I'm going to ask for questions from members of the committee. I see. Ms Cobb has a question. I'd like to give her the floor. Yes, could you look at times up again? 3:30 absolutely. Can you hear me yeah? I can definitely hear you yeah. I think you said bring the times up again. 3:30 is that 4 am yeah and serving alcohol until 3:30 A.M. Yes, that is, and again that's in line with what they had previously, I'm not saying again that we are going to stay open every night until 3 am or 4 am it's just. We want to have the ability to if we do have an event or whatnot, especially with the fact of the income that everybody is losing currently this year and with the uncertainty of next year. We want to make sure that we have as many available hours to us to make profitable as possible and that's for ourselves and for staff. I know there was question earlier about how many people we would employ. We currently have nine people and as well space from speaking with the landlord this morning at one time did have 35 employees, so that'd be 35 employees from the neighborhood, so yeah. So again, the 4 m license is just in line with what they previously had this church. Have we received any complaints as a as the community board for about mulleins over the past few years or recently? No we've never had anything come into the board. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful to know any other questions from members of the committee. You can't just raise your hand, I'm trying to scroll through to be able to see you. Okay, I'm not seeing any other questions from members of the committee members of the public. Are there any questions for this application? 71 lafayette? If you can use the raise your hand, feature in webex? That would be great and I do not see any hands raised for this application. Okay, thank you all very much for your presentation to the committee. Does anyone want to raise a motion at this time make a motion to approve okay for a second from this Cobb discussion on the motion? Mr Brown, hi thanks, I am, I do not have because I'm aware the lanes operated with those hours and there were no complaints. I do not have concerns about indoor being open until four. Only because in the past we have had a sort of an internal policy around outdoor cafes. This is a commercial corridor. It's not the same as a backyard into a doughnut of the of a block, but 11:30 was the closing hour for outdoor every night. Is that correct? We do currently have it for outdoor until midnight, so starting at 11 am till midnight, but we would most likely do last call 11:30 and get everything closed out by midnight. Okay, so historically someone in the board correct me. If I'm wrong, what we have done with sidewalk cafes has been 11 on weekends 10 on weekdays. Now I think that, in light of Covid-19 is probably kind of a tricky situation right. I do not know what, in fact we are doing in that case, because it's not the outdoor space is essentially the money maker, and so I want to be respectful to that. But Caroline. I do not know if you have guidance on how to proceed with this. Do we in is that once we approve this is essentially the liquor license. You have you know it. It's the jaws of life to change that, so I want to make sure that we would not approve something in light of Covid-19. That then becomes kind of a neighborhood nuisance over the long term that we can't do very little about you see what I mean yeah for myself. I mean, I believe, that's completely valid and definitely again from being somebody who lives in the neighborhood and knowing how things can affect those. You know living not just doing business so definitely respectfully. So we can make sure that, if anything, if it ever was getting too loud, we would just as residents make sure that we start closing earlier. I think for us right now, like we have our extended hours, I believe with city ordinances till midnight for outdoor dining, that's just because again, even with indoor dining beginning on Wednesday, I could say when I was there Thursday, we had three people so really that's the outdoor dining. Why we're trying to kind of make it as kind of robust as possible, because even when the city allows people to come back in as we've seen this week, they do not so we'll still do very well outside and by very much well, I mean we are surviving and we will survive it. But the fact is because something's allowed does not necessarily mean that you're going to have that customer confidence for them coming back, so that's kind of why we want to make sure that we have that ability to serve outside in case people even coming back next year in March still do not feel comfortable going inside. Okay, this church informs me that we can that the city is allowing 11 P.M outside I do not know. Is there anything more? You wanted to say on that Miss Church, okay, well, Alejandro. What do you think is? Do you do you feel like there's a view that you that you want to espouse about this? Like hearing all of this? Do you think that we should have a have an earlier closing time on the outside? Frankly, no, but again, specifically because of the circumstances that we're living under right now, if we were in perfect times, I would. I would ask that we do 11:30 and 10:30 or 11:12, 11 and midnight, and again, because this is a commercial corridor and not the backyard into into a residential block. I see there is a distinction. Historically, we've made a distinction, but no I do not want to in this moment, do that I just do not. I was not sure if we had okay, yeah. Okay, I go. I get what you're saying. Was there any other discussion from the committee? Okay hearing, none, I'm going to call everybody out: Mr Varela. How do you vote to approve Mr Thurston approve Miss Mcknight approve Ms, cobb, Okay and Mr Andrews. Oh, go ahead, Mr Andrews, Second Victor! Do you approve? Yes, I approve yes, okay, great. I also vote to approve. Thank you very much. John Harrison Mr Harrison has dropped off the line if so, when he gets his audio back he'll be back in the in the meeting, but we have to treat it as if he has left the room. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you all very much. I really appreciate your time today and I appreciate that so many new applications are going in. So thank you. Okay. Thank you. We I am told that Virgo Lee is back on the line. Mr Lee. Do you want to proceed regarding 87 lafayette, Mr, Lee, Mr, Lee, you're? Muted? It's really, you are unmuted, but we are not able to hear you. Can you hear me by my by my cell phone? Yes, we can see you now, okay, great, so I'm here representing Mr Isaac Antweep go ahead. We have your opinions all right I'll have to. I lost my audio on my video, so I'm I'll try to verbally walk you through the application and Mr, and we had been in discussions with the previous owner. Jtha Group and Harry acktess was has been the managing member of that company and had a on- premises, liquor license in 2016. Mr and we had been in discussions with Mr Act House for almost a year in the proposed purchase of the restaurant known as the quarter and on August the 31st of this year. He was, he completed the asset purchase agreement with Mr Access and the shareholders and then and that agreement did not include the liquor license and he is now in the process of applying for his own liquor. License a copy and a copy of the complete questionnaire were sent to the community board, which I assume everyone or the members have a copy of, and the hours of operation presently are the following: it's open five days a week from Wednesday through Sunday and then the restaurant is closed on mondays and tuesdays. The hours of operation on four out of the five days of 4 P.M through 11 P.M, which is essentially in a service only and on the saturdays. Excuse me here for a moment: yeah. The only difference in the out on the hours of operation would be on saturdays and sundays. It's open a little bit earlier, which would be 11 A.M for brunch service and then, of course, closing at 10 P.M. This is Mr Antwe's. First, restaurant investment he's been an aspiring chef for almost 10 years. His cuisines that he specializes in is happens to be mediterranean and American, and the menu is going to stay the same. The quarters menu essentially consists of classic american dishes, including things like spaghetti and meatballs to your cavitelli pasta, Nochi with a mediterranean twist, and these are the kinds of dishes which Mr Ant. We fell in love with and has learned through his many years of trying to find the right match for his opening project and he ended up finding the quarter and took almost a year to negotiate the agreement. His partner, his fiancee is a banker by profession and she will be the bookkeeper before the business while Mr Hadley focuses on the kitchen and the dining room operation. The restaurant itself is not a huge restaurant. It consists of 30:39 seats in the what is called the basement level or ground level. There are eight. There is a one stand- up bar with eight stools and there is a backyard area which consists of seven tables and fifteen seats. So, roughly on the main, dining room you have half of the seating and tables tables and chairs and in the back yard, which is part of the property, the remaining seven tables and 15 shares, and then, as I said, with the bar, you have an additional eight seats. The kitchen is in the cellar level and that's where all your storage of your food products as well as your alcohol. What's that place other than that, that's pretty much it. During the period of the pandemic, you know Mr Ant. We have decided to kind of have a manageable schedule that where he could learn the operations of the restaurant, the seller, Harry Actas, has agreed as part of the contract, to train Mr Antwe in the operations. That includes a relationship for all the existing vendors. All of the staff, including the kitchen staff, as well as the wait staff in the dining room will stay on and the restaurant is operating now. Isaac can speak to some of the things that he's done during the first month of training, and that is pretty much the extent of the proposal. The hours for the backyard are going to be the same as the hours for the inside. That is correct, because the backyard is actually an enclosed space, meaning that there's kind of like a cloth, tarp enclosure that shields the noise from the backyard from going up. Okay and the interior dining room space has been soundproofed by Mr Octopus, the previous owner. Is there a separate? Is there a separate sidewalk cafe in addition to the to the backyard? I know there is not okay, great questions from the committee Mr Lee does the backyard face any residential building? The backyard is within the property line and it is there's a double door entrance from the main dining room into the backyard right, but are there any? Are there residential buildings on either side of the backyard or any upstairs neighbors? And has the applicant spoken with them about the the establishment and the liquor license? Yeah the building itself is a mixed- use building. So, yes, there are residential tenants above the restaurant space and they were notified about the application and all during the years of operation of the previous owner, there had never been any problems with noise or any other types of complaints from the residents of the above, the restaurant. Okay, any other questions from the committee Mr Varela, any noise complaints or any sorts of complaints on record for this establishment church do we have anything. Okay, Miss church is shaking her head and the applicant any other questions from the committee. The application says: five people employing five people is that correct, or is that a did? I misread it? Isaac is that the total number of employees that you have for your dinner service? Yes, that's a total that I have for one dinner service because of the pandemic we used to have more, but because of that, you know we can't afford to be able to have everyone on board until things really open up. But for now yes, it's fine, okay, any other questions from members of the committee, none from the committee any questions from members of the public for this application. This is 87. Lafayette use the razer hand feature in webex. If you have a question, okay, I'm not seeing any questions. Does anyone on the committee have a motion for this application? I offer a motion to appeal any motion to approve Miss Cobb. We have a second miss Mcknight discussion on the motion. Yeah. I do not see any discussion all right. I will call out everybody's vote now: Mr Varela. How do you vote Mr? Thurston approve, Miss, Mcknight approve Ms Cobb, that's something different approved Mr Andrews approved okay. I also vote to approve. Thank you very much[ Applause]. Next up this evening, we've got 445 gold street Ms, known Michael Kelly, representing Miznon. Also on the motion. This is an on- premise: liquor license application from his known Uws llc he'll be doing business as Ms known decal, we're at 445 gold street and the lower level of the food court, we're taking over a space that was previously occupied by Fortina. They had an on- premise, liquor license since 7 or July of 2017. we're a full- service. Mediterranean Middle, Eastern, Food Restaurant moshe, currently is on five other on- premise: liquor licenses. Three at the Chelsea market in Manhattan, one of them is called mazone. It's been licensed almost two years. Another cream line licensed almost three and a half years. The Chelsea music hall licensed almost two years or gonzo at 511, ninth Avenue license about four years and another mazon at 161 west second street license about 17 months. Excuse me we'll have the same seating setup as Fortina did 30 tables with 122 seats and a 20 seat bar our hours of operation will be 12 noon to 8:30 P.M seven days a week. There's no outdoor seating there's background music and we may have an occasional dj. It won't get out of hand because the landlord would not allow that there'll always be an owner or competent manager on site. In conclusion, they'll be hiring about 25 to 30 employees, which we'll hire from mostly from the neighborhood and the owner would be asking for guidance from CB2 on how to go about doing that sure. Well, thank you. Thank you. Mr Kelly I'll ask Mr Varela to give our guidance in just a second, but just to confirm this is the location in the bottom of the of the city point food court in the decal market hall that it's basically it's in the basement of the location and it's not facing any residences or anything that is correct. There's no residents in the building! Okay, Mr Varela! Do you want to provide our advice on we're kind of in a rough spot here, because we lost the community center at Ingersoll? If I'm, if that's correct or the employment place, that's what Tania reported last week and Fort Greene Snap is currently, although I just saw the doors open the other day anyway, I guess the long. The short of it is. Could you reach out to Carol Anne, and I will contact caroline tomorrow to come up with or to just confirm that we still have list of contacts? Yes, Eddie Owen has been doing finalities in the area and trying to get some of the people that did work at the other location. A lot of them were also from the area Mr Kelly. Can you confirm whether it's a 12 noon or a 12:30 start time? The application says 12:30, but you see I'm sorry. It is 12 noon. Okay, would you mind amending the application? Then? Yes, I did thank you. I will I'll send it to caroline, okay, any other questions from members of the committee hearing. None any questions from members of the public about this application. 445 gold use the raise your hand feature in webex. If you have a question all right, I'm not seeing any questions. We have a motion for this application motion to approve a second, no discussion, but I would like to note that the cumulative number of potential jobs from the applicants thus far is at 105, which could make a real dent in local unemployment if, in fact, we do hire locally and from the areas who most which most need it great. Thank you, Mr Varela yeah that and really well. It has no bearing on the vote. I ask you to consider that and the importance of it it's something that is critically needed in our community, particularly these times. Okay, I'm going to ask for everybody's vote now. Ms Thurston, how do you vote Mr, Varela, Miss, Mcknight, Mr, Andrews, yes, and I also go to did I ask you Mr Gorilla. I think I did. Okay, he's nodding. Okay, great all, right!

Have there been any complaints or concerns about any of these locations, and I guess I'm I might be a little particular about that applebee's location, because I recall there have been some incidents there over the past few years. Miss Church hi. I do not recall anything at apple peace. There might have been something at some point in time, but definitely not recently. Okay. Anyone else on the committee have any concerns about any of these applicants, not hearing any members of the public for the for the applications that I for the items I just listed.

All right, I'm going to now move to the next part of our agenda, which I'm sorry to skip over it. I just wanted to get through the minutes. Really quick. Do we have miss Rodriquez on the line from the artillery hotel, hello good evening good evening good evening? Thank you for thank you for joining and thank you for waiting to speak. I recognize we have several members of the community here as well. Mr Rodriquez, forgive me for a moment. We, I do appreciate you coming to our meeting. I just want to go through some of the background from our committee's perspective about the artillery hotel and the liquor license there, because we've we've had a bit of a history and that we've had, I believe, four prior meetings on this on the subject. So for everybody's recollection, this all started on September, 2nd 2015 when we had Mr Carlos, Guerreas and David Gibber appear on behalf of the tillery hotel, and we had a discussion about the initial liquor licenses, which were approved with no community comment or- and I do not believe there are any community representatives there at that meeting by a motion of five of nine zero. That's included the beer garden that has been the subject of much of the discussion over the past few years, which was stated to close at midnight every night. At the time of that application. When we had spoken with Mr Grace and Mr Gibber, we were under the impression that there were no neighbors that were impacted by the beer garden, as I believe that was their representation in the in the years that followed, particularly in fall 2017. We became aware of 82 complaints that had been filed with 3- 1- 1 and I believe we received from some contact from our city councilman about the number of 3- 1- 1 complaints and a letter was sent to the artillery hotel's attorneys in October 2017, asking them to appear at our meeting on November 1st 2017, because there was a renewal application to be considered. November 2017 came around and we heard from vanessa vitale and Steven Troub this time, who advised us that they had been very they've, been very busy that the the hotel had was a very stressful and hectic environment, and there were also very a number of members of the community who came to that meeting and voiced their concerns about loud, mute, loud noise and a inability to to get an understanding with management about how the complaints were addressed. So after we had that meeting- and I recall that meeting vividly, we- we missed Vitale and Mr Troub, agreed that the speakers would be removed from the beer garden and that there would be no more amplified music, only acoustic music that would be played out in the beer garden, and we had asked the hotel to come back to our June 2018 meeting. In addition to the residents for a status update the on those conditions, we approved the renewal application by a margin of 501. June 2018 came around. We had a complete meeting, and I remember this one. We had the residents came to this meeting, but that I guess the hotel did not come to the meeting. It seemed like there had been a change in management since the prior meeting, but the residents told us that there had been a party with loud music and that they had also spoken with the new management there, who had told them that they would not use electronic music there in the future, and they cited some concerns about an upcoming event that was supposed to have a band, but they had a conversation with the management who said that it would be an acoustic guitar and it with no electric amplification. So that was the that was the last meeting that I was at on this, but in fall of 2019, it seems that the owners that were previously of the Tillery hotel, the chetrit group, sold the hotel to the a real estate developer, Isaac, hager, and subsequently we had a liquor license where, unfortunately, I was not at this meeting in October 2019, where we heard the transfer of the existing liquor license. This time it was Elky Hoffman and Aaliyah Hughie who attended the meeting on behalf of the Tillery Hotel and presented this transfer application. Once again, we had community members, attend the meeting and express similar concerns regarding music being played from the second floor, beer garden and an inability to contact management. So at that meeting the committee reached an agreement with Miss Huey and Miss Hoffman, where there would be no background, no dj, no live or acoustic sound on the second floor indoors or outdoors or any other amplified sound and the outdoor location would close at 10 pm. This was memorialized in a letter that the board office and to the state liquor authority, as well as to miss Hoffman and subsequently we did not hear anything that I'm aware of as a committee until fall of this year, when we learned there had been a complaint about music being played from the second floor on August, the 24th we heard about that at the last committee meeting and that led to me asking the to see if the hotel could come to this meeting. So we can have a further discussion to try to understand how we can try to achieve a more agreeable situation for everyone involved. I think we're all cognizant that the covenant team has hit us all pretty hard and we need to try to find a way to all work together, the best way possible as a community and subsequently to that. We have learned that on. There appears to have been some kind of foreclosure action going on with the hotel and there might be some kind of sale that's coming up this month. There are some media reports about that, but that's about all I can say in that regard, and then we were further alerted to an incident where there was some soca music being played on September 23rd 2020, and this was apparently coming from the beer garden and the residents had shared that with us, so that those are all the facts that I'm aware of from from a big picture. I recognize there are a lot of nuances in this in this process. I guess I would want to ask Miss Rodriquez first to sort of give her point of view about what the hotel's sense of these of these facts were whether they were aware of these agreements that we've had with other people who've come before us in the past and what, if anything, that they plan to do to try to work on a more agreeable relationship with the community in the future? Okay. So yes, definitely. First I'd like to thank everyone for allowing me to participate in this meeting. I do apologize. I do not have a video up, as everyone else does, but yes to touch based on your point, so I started working as the food and beverage events manager in September. I came with the new owners. I was briefed on these stipulations that the last general manager confirmed on with the community board, but it was not fully. You know detailed. So with that being said, as you guys know, unfortunately, we're dealing with Covid-19 now and the hotel closed in March. With that being said, also, we further most of the the hotel staff and recently were able to bring them back as early as August. Hence the first complaint that you received on the 24th. You know at this particular point I kind of I'm a little bit overwhelmed, because you know I am trying my best to follow the policies and mandates of the city. You know respect the community as well. As you know, I was able to bring back some people. I myself got my job back. I was able back to bring in some staff. I brought back my kitchen staff and you know some other members of well of the food and beverage department as well. So I'm just trying my best to kind of keep things afloat. I did receive some complaints from the front desk from some of the residents as well. I did have a couple of officers that came by to discuss. You know the complaints with me. I have even had you know some officers kind of come by to discuss the number of complaints that we were receiving. I I've even gotten some feedback that they felt. We were kind of being like under the attack in some kind of way, and you know me being someone that just resumed this position in September, it's kind of everything's, unbeknown to me and I'm just a little overwhelmed, so I definitely appreciate the opportunity to sit with you guys to see what we can do, what medium we can kind of come to, so that I can keep these people employed. Had I, if I were allowed to have these weddings and these birthday parties- and these you know bar mitzvahs in the ballroom or even in our restaurant space. I'm sure you know we would not have any complaints at all, but because our we're mandated to have an outdoor seated dining experience only I'm kind of in a rock and a hard place. I would love some feedback, some advice on how we can go ahead and just make this work because, like I said you know, I got my job back. I got some people back their jobs, we're trying our best to kind of make it work. We do not know what's going to happen with. You know this that possible. Second wave. That's going to be coming, especially with all these zip close that the mayor and the governor just kind of shut down. Thankfully we were not one of them, but you know it's just a lot that I kind of am dealing with. You know right now. The food and beverage department is really what's keeping the hotel afloat, as you mentioned, with the whole folk foreclosure article that was put out and everything that you've been hearing. I know that the owners are trying their best to stay afloat with what they were, giving pulse to sale. As you can imagine, they're overwhelmed as well. They bought a hotel in September Covid-19 hit, and now it's just it's just a lot. So again, if you guys can definitely advise me, you know I'm kind of I'm pretty much at your disposal at this point. I do not know what else to do if you guys have any feedback on how I can kind of keep this afloat and just still operate at least until maybe we are allowed 50 indoor capacity where I can bring things indoors, which you know and also the weather is not going to permit me to have. You know any sort of an event on the deck anyway, because it is getting really chilly. So again, if you guys can advise me on what you think how we can come to a medium, I would appreciate it. Thank you, miss Rodriquez, I honestly hearing what you're saying granted uncovered time back in 2017. I can't not, but not, but be familiar reminded of Miss Vitale's statements to us, because she too expressed that she was overwhelmed with the experience back in at that time, and I think we can certainly offer some feedback, and I will welcome some comments from the community as well on this, I'm going to ask everybody to please take it a little bit slow because our secretaries had to depart for the rest of the meeting. So I'm trying to I'm going to have to double dip and be both chair and secretary for the remainder of this, but I think at the first point, Mr Rodriquez. I it would be helpful to understand what what's going on right now, like I in terms of the hours for the outdoor area, it was our understanding from the 2019 meeting originally 2015. We were understanding the outdoors closing at midnight we in 20, as of 2017. It was, I believe it was still midnight, but as of 2019, we had agreed on 10 p.m. For the outdoor area, because the complaints had persisted. Is that still the case? Or is it closing later than that? Currently we do follow the mandate and we close. We stop serving alcohol and food at 11 pm. There has been times where we had two. We had a bar mitzvah and we had two weddings that exceeded the 11 pm hour, where the meet where the food and everything else was done by 12 as well as music. But we do not. We do not go past 12 the latest and I really try hard to not go past 11.. Okay, thank you for thank you for telling me the your your opinion on that and I greatly appreciate the the feedback that you're providing I think from here. I will invite questions from the committee and from the public, but I think from the first instance. I would just say it's probably going to be. Let me just say this: when we, when we heard this application in 2015, there was absolutely no concept that this was a space that would be used for weddings or bar mitzvahs, and I do not think we want to say no weddings or bar mitzvahs, necessarily but I'll. Let the committee in the community speak for that, but I think at the at a minimum. You know at a minimum, and now I'm not saying this is how it has to be, but at a minimum we do not want there to be music on the outside area period. Is that something that the hotel can do given that ev? It's something that the hotels agreed to do twice before for our with our committee? Well, that's why I'm asking, if there's some type of a medium that we can find, at least until we are allowed the opportunity to have indoor dining my hotel guests have nowhere to go when they want to sit down and eat. They have nowhere to go, and it's and it's really, you can't have a dining experience with at least some type of a background music, some type of something happening. So I think that's why I'm just necessarily trying to bridge the two and kind of merge it and just try to figure out a way to offer my hotel, my hotel guests and experience, because our hotel, we still want to offer you guys experience, especially with everything that's happening in co, video. We have people that come here and they just need a staycation. They just need a chance to just stay in a hotel in a nice comfy bed go to the bar have a cocktail they want to have that experience they enjoy the music. You know I have a lot of people from that to live on duffel that come in and actually sit down and relax. It's kind of like a it's very weird. I have a lot of people in the area that kind of come. You know I I'm just again trying to accommodate and offer an experience to my neighbors as well as but, more importantly, the hotel guests that really do not have the option of having indoor dining. We do not offer breakfast anymore. We, you know we do not offer the complimentary sacks that we normally use to do. Everything is out of out of the bar, so I again just want to figure out a way that we can maybe have music. But if it's a situation where there's only a specific type of music, I should have or maybe do not. You want only back that, like jazz and not like, maybe hip hop or not soca, because I heard Soka was mentioned earlier, like if there's something that we can maybe figure out right. I honestly feel I honestly miss Rodriquez. I a lot of the applications that we hear and a lot of the concerns that we hear in a community are from new applications. Possible noise concerns from the community out of fear of something coming to the community, but this is a situation where we're on our fifth meeting and we've had agreements with other people from representing the establishment. In the past, where there it's been agreed that there will be no music and there is music. That's the that's the situation that we're in I kind of feel and I'm going to. Let other people weigh in for a minute here, but I kind of feel like the starting point here is actually having no music on the outside period. I really feel like that's, probably the starting point, because you know we we've said no music inside or outside we've said closed at 10 pm, but- and I understand that's the business that we we're in a difficult time. But this is a situation where the committee and the community has been very tolerant by consistently voting to approve these applications in the past by consistently being respectful of the applicants who come in and or the folks who've come in and represented themselves from this hotel and we're at a point here where the message and the actions that we're seeing from the hotel are contrary to what has been promised to us in the past. So I really I feel like that, would be the place to start, but I'm going to ask I'm going to ask for if you can forgive me for one second, I'm just going to ask if any of the members of the committee had any questions, mr Varela just want to clarify something that sorry the name has disappeared. That Ms Rodriguez said earlier is the dining experience. Are you speaking specifically for these parties? I see the argument not that I'm agreeing that I'm Brandon. I appreciate your point. I see the argument that for a wedding of our mitzvah there should be music, but if you're, if your hotel guests are having dinner, I mean there are all sorts of restaurants open up and down the streets now cafes. I do not hear any music and they're enjoying their meals just fine. So I do not. I do not see the argument. I do not buy that every meal needs to include music, and I wonder if that's what you were arguing that your hotel guests, you feel at a bare minimum. They should have music during their dining experience. My follow- up question is- and this is really maybe from one of the representatives of the community on the nights where there has been no music is the volume of the diners or the people outside still prohibited, I mean, is it still sort of unmanageable, or is it just about the music? So maybe first question for Mrs Rodriguez, maybe can I speak? I can speak Mr Salazar. I will I'll definitely give you a chance to speak in just a second. I want to try to keep this in sort of an orderly fashion. Here and we will give you an opportunity to chime in absolutely Miss Rodriquez. Do you want to respond? Yes, so yes, I can agree with your point. Maybe not every seated dining experience needs to have music. I can definitely agree to that point and emphasize that I just want to say, for example, this Friday this Friday Saturday and Sunday. We do have three events on Saturday. We on Friday. We do have a birthday party, that's taking place, sad Sunday. I have a wedding and on Saturday I have a pop- up shop experience. What I can do for this weekend- and I will definitely relate this conversation to you- know our general manager and everything. But for this weekend I can maybe of course have no music at all for the Saturday event, but for the birthday party and the and the pop- up shop that will be in the wedding that will be kind of difficult to. You know to inform the client on that also case. In point, with our seated dining experience, I had a wedding party that booked 25 rooms last week. They went and did a quick city hall wedding, and then they came back and just asked that they can kind of come back. They wanted to bring their own speaker and sit on the deck and just kind of celebrate. You know the fact that they just got in wedding married during Covid-19, and you know I understand all of my hotel guests. I understand how stressful this year has been and me being a hospitality person, of course wants to accommodate that and it just you know it worked out where we had music playing and they had a very lovely experience. So again, I'm just trying my best to figure out a medium to make all of this work, because in a normal circumstance everyone would be inside. I have a ballroom that holds about 300 people. I have a very beautiful restaurant space, I'm not sure if anyone has seen it, but under normal circumstances this would not be the case. Okay did any other members of the committee have any questions for the applicant, I'm sorry for Miss, I'm sorry. My nomenclature is stuck in that Manner Miss Cobb yeah. This is not a question, it's kind of a statement. While I appreciate the difficulties that the establishment may be having the residency we talked about this before and the residence is having some difficulty they're uncomfortable, it is intrusion and an opportunity, and so I have some concerns about that. I understand her position, but this is the community and I'm very much concerned with what they have to say also previously about the music okay. Thank you, miss Cobb, did any of the other members of the committee want to comment. Okay, I'm going to give the some members of the public an opportunity to comment here. I've got paddy evers Brandon. I have a comment. Okay for one hold on one. Second, miss Everest, Mr Harrison has a as a comment as a member of the committee. I'm going to give him an opportunity to make his comment, then we'll go to miss evers. Thank you so much Mr chair. I just want to let my fellow committee members know and yourself as well as Miss church, that including what the representative from the entity said tonight and to the meetings that you already very succinctly. Summarize what was sent us and having reviewed what has sent us? I honestly do not think that it's a good fit to have this beer garden have any kind of music, and I just I'm taking a very dim view of anything that would get close to that. Because of the history that's been there. This is a location in which not one not two, but, as evidenced by one of the packages or I'm sorry, one of the things that miss church sent us and one of the things that you summarize Mr Chair at least three former and one current. Unless he's off the board, members of this board have had issue with this address and, although I think I do not think it's being a drama queen for me to say that many of my current and former committee members know me to be very pro- business and you know, try to support the businesses and you know, let's lean towards the businesses, I am not leaning that way. So I thank you for letting me say that Mr Chair, thank you. Mr Harrison I'm going to allow the members of the public to have an opportunity to comment we're going to try to granted. We've had, probably very, I would say, we've had some of the most respectful and engaging conversations with this particular community in the past. So I'm not so concerned about this. I would ask, as I do in every one of these circumstances, for everybody to try to keep your comments under two minutes and just to the point and do not try to repeat something that somebody else has said, but but we are here to hear what you have to say so would be interested to hear and we can start with miss evers. Thank you a couple of points. I live in the building right next door to this beer garden. It's like 10 feet from my patio and the one wall of my apartment, often times with music. In past events like I can hear it inside with everything closed with the air conditioning on, and that includes events that have happened starting in July. So I know she. It was mentioned that this, the first events were in later in August. No, we filed complaints with 3- 1- 1, so those are on record. I walked next door. I called the front desk. I have tried numerous ways I reached out to Miss Aliyah's cell phone. She had given us that number and heard nothing back so this has been going on since Mid-, July and there's does not appear to be management on the premises to follow up and to and they and they do not follow up during business hours. I've been told they're, not even there during business hours, and it's not my problem that the front desk may not be able to track the management down that that's a business issue. The I oftentimes do not even do the noise complaints until after 10 pm, so the idea that they're not going until after 11 and until 12 is not true, and so those are all on record. That's the only reason I do the 311 complaints, because the cops can't really do anything about this, but I want it on record and I want the times so it's all there and as the board asked I reached out, Julia forwarded my email from Mid- August. Regarding July and August, complaints to the board, Community Board and I have also spoken with Robert Paris- I believe and had a conversation with him about this. So I followed through on what was asked of me and it's frustrating. A week ago tonight I filed another complaint because it was. This was going on again on a week night until almost midnight. And lastly, the idea that Covid-19 is an excuse is frustrating because I would have been sympathetic if somebody had come to us in July and said, hey or suffering as they start to open things up. Is there something we could work out? But, as far as I know, nobody reached out other than two weeks. I was home. I the fact that we have to come back to the community board again and again and again I do not. I do not trust them and, like yeah, I have my own health issues to deal with. I have my own job stresses to have to take on fighting just to be able to sit on my patio and have a conversation with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. It's not right, and that concludes my comments. Thank you. Thank you. Mrs Rodriquez is Miss Huey still working with the hotel. I would I'm kind of curious if about that, given that the resident was unable to reach her well first, I want to address Miss Paddy. I do want to apologize, because I see you getting emotional and that's the last thing that myself or anyone here at the hotel would want to occur to you. I feel a little again overwhelmed because I feel like this. You guys have been dealing with a lot with the hotel and I literally just got this plate in September, so I do apologize if I did not have the full knowledge of the history enough to know that I was supposed to come to you guys to ask and say: hey guys, we're in this really unprecedented predicament. Can we find some medium, so I definitely wanted to address that and let you know and apologize about that Patty. Secondly, regarding Mrs Huey, Mrs Huey is no longer with the property, but she does assist the owners. She does assist the new owners when need be because they do not have a full scale, general manager, as of yet aside from the one who is assisting so snow. So I do apologize if you were not getting any contact with her, but that's possibly the reason why she's not fully on property. She is assisting the new ownerships. However Miss Rodriquez, to what extent is management on the property at any given time in your opinion, because I think the one of the concerns that has been Crawford ever since 2017 so and I really want. I really hope that you get the gravity of this meeting, because this is the only renewal application in the past four years that we've had to have a meeting like this about in the entirety of the community district. So I really hope that you grasp that, but I want to just ask: there's been like this: there's been like this overarching theme of residents who are unable to reach management. To what extent is management there at any given point and to what extent can you promise and put in place a process where there is a manager in on- site every day at that location, where, if somebody comes and asks the front desk about a complaint, they can speak to a manager. So, at the moment and again due to not having enough staff, we only have our front desk manager during the days around, like a nine to three shift. Sometimes we have our financial controller who's. Also in myself, the food and beverage director, I'm normally here during the the evening hours whenever we have the bar is open and then on the weekends we have housekeeping manager as well as front desk manager. I will definitely relay this message and provide you guys with my contact, my direct contact information as well as the front desk manager's direct contact information, so that this does not happen again in the event that you call the front desk or you come by the hotel and they say there's no one on site or available to speak. I can definitely give you my personal contact information. So anyone can reach out to me if necessary. Okay, thank you, miss Rodriquez. I want to hear from some other members of the community, who've asked to speak and again I'll remind everybody to try to be as brief but to the point, but we do want to hear your feedback Mr Juan Salazar, Mr Salazar. I remember you from the prior meetings. It's good to see you again, you can make your comment. Thank you, chairman, for a lot to speak and you're correct. I've been these meetings before not something like that. I want to do, but I need to do because this has been a problem continues to be a problem and, as we heard from Ms Rodriguez will continue to be a problem because they have this event, and this is very fundamental when they came five years ago before this very committee they misrepresented, they did not say this was a residential neighborhood facing all these homes with long- term residents and so started from there and the agreement, and this is a company. This is a licensee who has agreed twice with their attorneys present. Okay, they have had representation, they have agreed first not to play amplify music again the same thing that you already stated and they do not keep their. You know part of the bargain. Okay, this is a residential neighborhood. The residents were here long before this one business came to me. Okay and this the Covid-19 thing we're all suffering from cover. There are people that are working at night, trying to sleep, so they can work at home and all this music is, it's interrupting everything. So, last time, the same person I'll give you your personal telephone number etc has not worked. That's the problem that they just pay, no attention to the neighborhood they are or the community board, because they feel all we're going to do. Is we're going to come back in six months. We're going to have the same sort of you know everybody objecting and they're making promises and being overwhelmed. We are all overwhelmed and you know I am overwhelmed by the noise and the music and the total disregard for the neighborhood from this business. This is a business. I will ask her to guess that the president that speaking here, we pay more in taxes that this business will pay, probably have tax breaks, etc and everybody's saying they got to survive. Yes, they have jobs, but we all have jobs and we got to keep our jobs. So I again I'm at a loss as to what we're going to do now, because they're going to have all these parties- and I think, as the other committee members said, they agreed this is this- is this is a place they want? People want to eat. This is not a music event and what they have is they have dj's Et, cetera, Et cetera, but I'll leave it at that. This is just a broken record and I no confidence whatsoever they're going to adhere to any that I made here. So that's all. I have to say thank you. Thank you. Mr Salazar Mr Vinicom's hand is up. I want to recognize him very quickly. Yes, thank you. Can you hear me? Yes, we can I'm not going to repeat some of this good comments. We do have an agreement with the owners of the hotel, not with the management of the hotel and Mr Rodriguez. Welcome to your job- and I hope you do very well there and welcome to the neighborhood. But the fact is that Elite Miss Leah Yui is still part of that hotel she's been to our meetings. She's agreed to this on behalf of the management they so the issue here is that I do not understand why it's up to the management to understand this and it gets transferred from one person to another. The owner of the hotel calls the local license. Not Mr Rodriguez not miss you, and this is blatant disrespect for the whole process. I mean we have people on here right now. The community board people they're volunteers. They work all day, they sit here. They do a great job and I find it as total disrespect that the hotel owners are allowing us to go on, and now we just have new management and they're overwhelmed, of course, everybody's overwhelmed. But the fact is that we have an agreement with the attorneys and the hotel that there is no amplified music. It has nothing to do with Mrs Rodriguez Mr, it's because she's managing it. It's with the owners and Miss Miss Siri's been at the meetings, I'm sure Miss Rodriguez knows who miss Ue is, and the fact is that we have an agreement that there is no amplified music would have been really. A good point is that if we got to this point, where you needed to do this to survive, you would have came to us because you knew who we are. You know who the community board is and came to us and said, and especially if Miss Ue is working with the owner she's very aware of this agreement. You know we need to do something. We need some help. Give us this. You know we'll give you a schedule. This is what's going to happen, so I have no trust in what's going on here at all, because next time you they, this hotel is going to come in or it's going to come in for a renewal they're going to bring somebody else in. This is what the owner is: it's not with the management. So if this management is struggling and overwhelmed, that should not be something that the neighborhood has to has to put up with, and it is it is we feel disrespected by this whole process. It's just blasting music. There's no way to stop it. The desk is not helping us and Ms Rodriguez. I do not want to pound on you right now, but I do not think you're right the right one to come. To the meeting I mean we, this is what the owners of the hotel. This is a license. This is not something that some kind of soft agreement we have with the person at the desk. That's all I have to say thank you, Mr Vancouver. No, you know all right, Mr Rodriguez, I'm sorry we're just going to have to wait for a few moments, because there are a few other members of the community who would like to speak Miss, I believe, thank you, miss Ibeli, I believe you're on mute. Can you I'm literally? Thank you. It's okay. We can hear you. I have a few points regarding Miss Hughie. She is still attached to that property. Even as yesterday I spoke to Glomani from Council person, Levin's office and the council person sent a strongly worded letter to the hotel regarding this and right away. Miss Hughie responded to that letter. She does not respond to the community and the residents, but she did respond to that letter. Like oh, you know we'll try, but that's the same thing. We've heard for many years now, in addition to just being a beer garden and an outdoor space, it is actually promoted as an event space that can accommodate 221 people that includes 189 outdoor seats and 32 indoor seats. That's space. It must be standing room only because that space would not or should not have that many people up there sitting down. So it's just going to be lingering and drinking and with the amplified sound, it's horrific, which then leads me to there was a complaint filed and a warning was issued in August that the hotel was not in compliance with reopening guidelines. I'm not sure what has been done to remedy that or what the story is so basically, my point is that through all these years they have just made empty promises. Nothing has been done and I do not see this continuing in a positive way and to miss Marissa Rodriguez point about. Maybe if it was different music. No, it does not matter what the music is. If you sing Ave Maria amplified at 10 pm people who are trying to sleep or trying to work at home because we're all impacted by Covid-19. So please do not use that as an excuse. That's going to be disruptive last weekend, I do not know you mentioned the type of music. I do not know what type of music was, but at certain points there was a dj or mc just screaming into the microphone, and I am one block over and one block down from the hotel so that sound traveled through several other buildings to get to me with the windows closed. So I do not want to reiterate, but I will say it's still a problem. Thank you, miss Misabelli. Thank you. I'm going to go back to Miss Rodriquez, because we've heard a couple of comments at this point, and I have at this point how many other people not too many other people. I believe we have one two, three, four five yeah. We have five more people, but Miss Rodriquez, keeping in mind. We are to try to direct the comments to the chair. Did you want to respond to any of the points that the community members had raised? Yes, I definitely want to I just I want to bring to everyone's attention. As I mentioned, I acquired the specif position in September. I was informed about the policy of no electrically amplified music on the deck. That's what I was told what I was doing is we had these really small speakers. We were streaming music. It has not been any complaints since I've resumed the role as F B Manager Covid-19 hit. Then we closed down for a while, as you know, DHS came in and we had a group in the hotel and then luckily, which you know, is a big factor in why Miss Huey is not with the property. She was not happy about it and about the way that the DHS group was taking over the hotel, the area. Obviously she considered the residents as well. So that's a big part of the reason why she is no longer with the property so to everyone's mention about Aaliyah still being associated with the property. She definitely does care about the hotel. This is the hotel that she opened up and she does care about the employees case in point. I am someone that she okay to hire, so I think her responding to that email was just her way of maybe being an additional armor for me, because you know I am essentially new to the situation, but I do want to emphasize that she did essentially walk away from the property because the ownership decided to take in that DHS group, which again you know I'm trying to avoid, because if that group comes back, I lose my job. Fmb lose their job, etc, and, as I mentioned to you guys right now, the F b is what's keeping the hotel afloat, so I just wanted to touch base to such base. On that point, I definitely wanted to re- emphasize to you guys that, had I known the severity of all of these complaints and issues and broken promises that you guys are saying that you've been receiving since 2015, I myself, Marissa Rodriguez, would have personally, you know reached out to you guys and said hey. This is what I'm dealing with. What can we do, but I was not fully informed of you know the severity of the issues. As I mentioned, I was just told: no electrically amplified music on the deck, so you know I was playing music inside of the bar and just having it lightly streamed out onto this onto the deck again I this is just really extremely overwhelming and William. I do appreciate that your understanding of that and I do understand that you probably think that maybe a general manager or the ownership should be here for the for the meeting. But you know I'm the one that's dealing with this department and I'm the one that's willing to sit here and speak with you guys and try to figure out something that we can do. I literally you know, if even if you guys can allow me until the end of October or even for the next two weeks, so that these weddings that I already have booked and 60th Birthday party, I have a breast cancer and I have a couple of activations that you know I would like to honor for these clients. I do not want to go to them and have to cancel it, and you know kind of hinder their motivation in whatever space that they're currently in. If you guys can just allow me at least you know another two weeks what the weather is changing. I do have 25% capacity that is allowed per the city that I'm trying to reopen our restaurant to allow that 25% capacity with social distancing. So if there's something that again, I'm essentially begging you guys, if you guys, can just meet me in the middle and my birthday's on the 27th. Maybe this could be some sort of a birthday gift for something, but if you guys can just kind of meet me in the middle and allow me to just honor these activations that are on the schedule for the next two weeks, I would appreciate that wholeheartedly. Well, I think our committee will talk a little bit more about it before we. When we hear all the comments Mr Varela did you have something you wanted to add. I know I'll hold until okay, I believe Miss Wallace was next Vita Wallace. Did you wish to make a comment? Okay, let's swallow. If you are mute, can you convert yourself please as well as you are still on Mute? I'm sorry? Maybe we will come back to you shortly. Okay, the next person on our my list is Andrew Begg, Mr Begg. Did you wish to make a comment? Yes, I do and thank you very much for letting me address this meeting. This is the first time I've attended the community board because I just moved into the neighborhood just before the Covid-19 lockdown, so I have not yet attended any community meetings. So this is. This. Is my first, I actually moved here from Manhattan, where I was the president of a Block Association close to times square and we had restaurant row. West 46Th Street was part of the Block Association's jurisdiction and we had a very productive working relationship with restaurants and bars, given that they are so crucial to that block. So I have sat through many meetings similar to this with renewals and requests for new licenses. So although this is the first time I've attended this meeting the subject matter, I've been through many times when it comes to the tillery hotel that the discussion seems to be, as the representative from the hotel requested, that the the Community board Meet in the middle, which implies that the discussion or the decision really is whether the license conditions should be a renewal with music versus a renewal without music and there's requests to me in the middle. But I actually agree with the chair that the starting point is actually no music, because that was part of the conditions of the license. If you go back a few years and if we're going to talk about the negotiation of meeting in the middle, it really should be a license renewal, with a condition of no music versus no renewal at all. Those are the two ends of the spectrum of the of the discussion and the reason I think the the no renewal option has to be on the table is that if you look at the structure of the building itself, there is no way you can have music on that deck without it being broedcast into the block. This is a point that I do not think has come up in the discussion, but the structure of the hotel is basically a sound shell. If you, if you imagine the deck, which is at second floor level, there's a high wall of the hotel on the on the southern end of the deck and on the eastern end of the deck there is another high wall and that effectively makes a Concave structure. That is like a sound shell that you have in parks that any noise on that deck is then broedcast by the shape of the building directly into the block, and even when there is no music, the sound of people talking is amplified by the structure of the hotel. It's a real shame that the structure of the hotel was not picked up during the initial discussion for a license in 2015, because the architects could have put the outdoor garden on the other side of the building on the Flatbush avenue side, and that way any sound would have been broedcast out into a non- residential block, basically towards the Manhattan bridge or over the the park and the the playground. That's there instead of the side of the building they put it on which was directly into residential buildings. So there is no way you can ever have a viable music- oriented business on that deck without effectively broedcasting it even with little speakers directly into the building's opposite and down the block. So the point I really want the board to take into account is the starting point has to be a renewal with no music at all, and I think that the the no renewal of the license option has to be on the table. That's the the comments I have. Thank you very much. Thank you Mr and just for everybody's awareness. We there is fortuitous or not. We are not here considering a renewable application at this time. The license for the tillery hotel was last renewed in late 2019 and I believe it's going to be at least another year for them to come up for a renewal application again unless they have a transfer of ownership, Mr Varela Wait, were you done with your comment right now? I'm done with my comment: yeah, oh yeah. Thank you. I just wanted to thank Mr Begg for his position on that seriously and also to say that Miss Wallace has written a comment still having trouble with the unmute, and I would like for someone to read and I'm happy to read it, but just so that everyone can see it is that okay, Brandon yeah, that's fine! That's fine, okay, so I suggest she writes that suggested the hotel be allowed to serve guests with no music and rent the deck for events with no music. I wanted to let you listen in to what's been playing now, which perhaps paddy can do in this moment, because Patty Ms Everest earlier said that there is music playing right now that they could hear which sort of conflicts with what was being the position of the hotel. Earlier in the conversation- and I wanted to let you know that my wife, Margaret Kwonzo, is considering suing artillery, because we have no confidence in any agreement, we might come to being honored by the hotel. Perhaps only a large financial judgment against them will make a difference. Thank you and, for the sake of I realize that many other people want to speak, but I think Mr Begg makes a very valid point where essentially we I do not know that we should be negotiating for people to live up to the agreement that we've already made or that's already been established, and we should be talking about what we do within the parameters in Mr Beg set up, so we could also reach out to the SLA the state liquor authority. I mean I do not know what they can do, but since renewal is not on the table, but we could send, we could make our position clear that we do not support the rest. Sorry, the applicant at this time or the I'm sorry the license holder, you're correct Mr Harrison. Did you want to make a point? Yes, thank you Mr Sir and thank you Mr farrell. For those points. I just want to clarify something that is. I want to say this that it's just as one committee member's understanding of the process, though I may be incorrect, so I'll. Thank you there to correct me. When I state the incorrectly a point that Mr Begg brought up- or my fellow or my fellow committee members, but in his very lucid and on detailed conveyance of his position and bringing what he sees the fact, the only thing that other should be stated, I think, is factually correct that might be perceived in deference to what Mr Begg said. Is this thing that he said? Well, it's too bad. We did not sort of weigh in where this beer garden was right. So I just want to put it out there unless I misunderstood what he said and then I apologize Mr Bay, but this committee it a obviously right. We do not weigh in on the design of a building in the community board, but secondly, we get the we get the baby and the banana. When it's delivered. You know warts and all so it I won't say it'll never happen, but for us to have a kind of point of view, a venue is going to be never, but that generally is not the case, because when an entity is coming to us for a letter of support to the state liquor authority for their license that they're requesting, generally speaking, the building right, the spaces are decided. So we can say we think it's not a good space, but we can't see we're not going to read it. We're not going to redesign the building. That's that that's not going to happen. That's true right and it's also it's not an option for us because they're generally not coming to us when construction is happening. Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you, Mr Harrison, okay. I want to get everybody's comments in and we do not have that long. A list left of people to speak next. I have Miss Karen Carrell Miss Carrill. Are you on the line? Aaron Carrell? I do not see her so I'm going to move on way long way long. I see quay long, but they appear to be muted. Currently, oh here we go. How are you doing great I'm here? I did not have much to say. I think everybody already said enough and there has been a lot shared tonight and we all are in you know mutually. Have our feelings are mutual about what we have, but I probably wanted to just say: I've left notes. I've called the front desk and they've told me that either would regurgitate what I tell asked him about. Lowering the music to the manager and the management would either call me back tomorrow, but none of that ever happened so, like I just you know, like everyone else would say like. I just do not have a lot of trust in operations of the of the place, so I do not have to say thank you Mr long. The final person that I've got is Travis bartow Mr Bartow. Do you wish to make a statement? Yeah? Can everyone hear me? Yes, okay, great, so I just I want to call out a couple quick things, one, the irony of the fact that we could hear the music through the windows as we're having this conversation and two that I just want to call out. You know this is not a rooftop bar anymore right that plays light music. Occasionally this is a space, that's being rented out to whoever will pay the money and then they're allowed to do as they wish. With the space with no management present as the evening progresses, people play music, louder and louder, they get drunker and drunker and they yell or microphones, which is completely unfathomable. Considering our we all came to an agreement, there would be no amplified music or noise of any kind in the last meeting and then two it's just like at this point. It's incredibly inventive and I think it's just gross negligence on behalf of the hotel ownership- and I am I you know, I do understand the position that any sort of manager has put in who joins this company, and I recognize the fact that they're probably overwhelmed, but as a community we've all been overwhelmed for years and like I do not live next door. I live almost a block away, I'm trying to work on a sunday and I can hear a guy yelling through a loud speaker. It's crazy. I can't understand how it's happening in a neighborhood and a community, this small, that's all I have to add. Thank you. Mr Bartow from the members of the community was there anyone else who has not yet made a statement who would like to make a statement? I'm not hearing any other statements. I do see. There's point about. The hotel has previously asked folks not to call 3- 1- 1 in the past. I recall that from some of the prior discussions that we've had. Yes, I just had one other question that I wanted to ask. Are you still on the line? Oh there, you are in terms of occupancy. What kind of what kind of statements is the hotel putting out about the occupancy on the deck, and can you are you able to address the point about whether or not the hotel is actually playing music on the deck right now? Right now, I do know that there is a television playing as well and we do have pandora streaming again. We do not have music on the deck, but we do have music playing from inside of the doors. As you guys know, I can not have anyone inside so there are people sitting outside that can hear the music that's playing from with inside of the of the bar, and I just wanted to address Travis when he made a mention about there, not being any management. During these events, I just want to say I have been. I work sometimes seven days straight, because I'm here managing this trying to maintain make sure that social justice is being maintained. People are wearing masks things of that nature, so I just wanted to clarify and let you guys know that I have been here. Sometimes I'm working. Nine days straight because you know I still have to do my administrative work aside from me managing these events. As you know, as I mentioned earlier, we are extremely short- staffed as well. So I wanted to touch base on the fact that you mentioned there was no management on the deck and regarding to the gentleman that was on the microphone, we had a sip and paint on Sunday and the gentleman did have a very small microphone where he was just directing to the guests. You know how to paint the structure or the abstract painting that he was having them paint, so I just wanted to touch base on that point. Thank you. The other question I had was about the occupancy. What kind of statements is the hotel putting out about occupancy for the deck? How many people are out there on the deck at any given time? What is the occupancy of the deck? So currently, we do not allow more than 55 people on the deck for seated dining, I'm sorry for large gatherings, but when we do our seated dining event, we do go up to 75.. So at no point and our occupancy normally for the for the deck is 150.. Okay, all right, I've got the I there. I have the original application from 2015 and it says 140 for the outside deck, but 150 140 is probably a small margin and if you're telling me that I guess what I'm, what I'm hearing is your opinion and is that there are no more than 75 people on that deck at any. Given time, that's your that's! Your statement, correct. I do pay for security to kind of ensure that as well, we do not let people up the stairs once we're at capacity, as I mentioned, I'm here for every single event, whether it's seven days straight. So I definitely am here just to kind of make sure and maintain that the front desk manager is very on top of that as well, because we want to ensure that our hotel guests feel safe and they do not see a million people just kind of walking upstairs. So yes, that is correct. If any steps is the hotel willing to take to soundproof the deck in some complete capacity like possibly put a covering over it or you know or make sure that there's no sound coming out, I have definitely spoken with ownership and accounting and suggested that we do get a closure. That's something that they're strongly considering, especially because we do not know what may happen with indoor dining. So we are definitely working and trying to figure out ways to enclose the deck. But you know 20. We have the new owners. I purchased the hotel in September kofi took a big hit, as I mentioned. You know we did take that the Dha DHS group that did help us tremendously, so I'm just trying to assist the hotel in any way that I can to make them generate some form of revenue so that we can keep our staff. You know do not have to close down, do not have to bring in another group and can afford that closure so that everyone can be happy. Okay and finally like from me at least with the foreclosure sale and everything. What are the chances that we're going to have completely different ownership and people representing this hotel next month or the following month? To be completely honest, I have not heard anything regarding that aside from just a minor small conversation, so I could not touch base on that. Okay, Mr Varela. Did you have a point you wanted to raise yeah. I guess I'm just curious and miss Rodriguez again. I understand that you're here as a worker in this moment- and this is- and I feel bad- that you are in the middle of this- and I know you're doing your you're working right now, but this is I'm just curious. What is I do not see any anything except to recommend to recommend SLA to revoke this license and I'm just curious or to not renew in the future, but I'm curious about what, if any of the events that you have planned can proceed without music? Can you can you operate? Can this place have? Can the hotel continue its programming without music? Unfortunately, no, all the experiences that we are offering that have been booked for the next two weeks. As I mentioned to you guys, if you guys would allow me that they all have some form of music there's, definitely no microphones, as if nobody's going to be screaming, it's going to just be just a nice relaxing vibe, but no none of the events that I have. I have a wedding. As I mentioned, I have a breast cancer event. I have a birthday party coming up. I do have another sip and paint as well. So those events all are you know around music and that sip and paint, for example, you're saying, can not occur without a microphone without amplification correct because it's really hard for the person to project their voice for with accuracy. For all these artists that are really just trying to understand how to paint this particular whatever it is that they're painting, so the micro helps them project, especially since we have everyone's social distancing. So it's just for that as well and again guys, if you guys can just allow me, the weather is changing. I have 25, I'm allowed to do. 25% capacity, I've been figuring out a floor plan. I've been working with my chef to just figure out what that experience can be so that we can completely remove having everyone on the deck. So, if you guys can allow me until you know the ending of this month, because I took deposits for all these events and again, I do not want to have to go crush the spirits of everyone again and just let them know hey. I can't I have to give you back your money. I have to cancel the event and then essentially shut down my department, and you know you know, release my staff and possibly myself. So if you guys can definitely allow me until the end, you know until the after Halloween I would. I would appreciate that- and I can give you my word- that I will speak with ownership regarding all of your concerns since 2015. Let them know that you guys want more of a presence or respect from them. You want to hear more from them. You want more responses from management on site. I definitely will relate all these messages to you guys to them on your behalf. Of course, I want to give you guys my phone number, so I can be the person that you're calling texting emailing directly, just so that I can personally know your concerns because, as I mentioned, if had I known the severity, when I got the position in September, I would have personally reached out to the board to ask you guys. After you know, we got our job backs post Covid-19 to ask you guys. What can we do to figure out this medium, since I'm only I've been mandated to only have out an outdoor experience, Mr Rodriquez, I I'm not saying that this is my view, but I just want to fully encapsulate what you're offering just so that we understand. Are you suggesting that if somehow the community and the committee is okay with you, with your hotel holding these events that you've planned in the next few weeks and the accompanying noise that is associated with that you and the hotel will promise to never again have outdoor music on that deck or any sound from music that that's coming out and going into the neighborhood? I can assure you that if you guys definitely allow me that I will personally promise and make it my duty to ensure that never happens again and in the event that there's a set God forbid, a second lockdown or second wave that hits and in 2021 we have to come to this point again. I will reach out to everyone so that we can find a medium together, whether it's like only paints and sips, only weddings, no birthday parties, whatever that agreement will be. I can assure you that, since I'm in the role now, I will definitely I'll definitely honor. That would you be willing to come back to next month's meeting so that we can check on what happened in the month of October? Definitely so, okay. I want to just ask the members of the committee for their thoughts about this, and you know keep in mind. We do not have a license on the table and we have as a committee we can. We could take a point of saying you know. On the one hand, we could write a letter to the SLA and say we do not approve of this app this license, but then we do not have a relationship with the hotel in the future, and I do not know what's going to happen in terms of how this is going. On the other hand, we could maybe agree to allow some of these events or just emphatically state our point about there being no music and at the same time, you know at that point we're looking at the fact that the applicant has promised, over the past several years that they've agreed to these conditions. And what does that say? I just want to hear everybody's thoughts on that point because we need we need to figure out an approach, and I wanted to be representative of what we all think and Mr Smith before you guys make your comments. I have there's this thing. It's called like a silent party where you can have these headphones, that you can put on where the music. If, let's say there, was a dj, all the music will only be streamed through the headphones. I can also suggest to my upcoming events, to kind of implement that starting at especially if it's like on a weekend or during a weekday just to kind of figure out again a medium and something with you guys just try to build a bridge with this, because I do not know any of you and it's my first time meeting with you guys, but I can probably make that suggestion where we can have these silent, headphones implemented into certain events based on the type of event. Thank you, Mr Smith, I'm sorry. I can't see who's Hi Mr Smith. This is taya from the office staff. Yes, hi Tim. I have a quick question from Ms Rodriguez, I'm sympathetic to the financial impact of canceling events. I have a question for you for each of your rental events. There is a required contract that is prepared between the paying client and the hotel. Would the hotel management be willing to prepare and share a copy of an updated event, contract that specifically states that music will end by 10 pm at the risk of the event client losing their deposit? I can spend a contract stipulating 11 P.M, just only because of work following the mandate of this of this of the city. I could definitely afford that, but just so you know a lot of these events, for example the sip and paint we do not necessarily do a contract with them. What we do is call a food and beverage minimum. I just because I understand everyone has a budget and not everyone can afford to rent out the beautiful beer garden at the Tillery hotel, so I would implement like a 1500 food and beverage minimum you and your you just have to meet this number and then you are allowed to have your event and you know promote your brand or whatever. It necessarily is, or have your wedding or you know, celebrate your birthday or celebrate. You know your retirement or whatever the case may be, so there's no set contract, but I could definitely provide you with something if needed, I'm very familiar with a buyout concept and those typically are also contracted, because you need to have some leverage to ensure that the rental client is going to actually meet their bar minimum yeah. So we again, I do not. We do not have a comp contract implemented. We just do a food and beverage minimum and I give them a credit card authorization form where I have their credit card on file in the event that the minimum is not met. We just charge the card, so there's no contract at the moment. Mr Smith. I would just recommend to the committee, I'm not a voting member, but I would recommend to the committee as a former event planner, that you perhaps insist from the owner that you are provided with an updated event, contract that stipulates when the music ends and what penalty is meted out to both the client and the hotel. If that does not happen, okay, thank you. Does anyone else have any any thoughts on this from the committee? I just basically want to say, while I appreciate Mr Rodriguez and for really wanting to work for the community, I think the problem was bigger than her. You know, I think it has to be dealt with on a much higher level. I do not know the owner. I do not know the structure, but you know something needs to be done, whether it's building something whether it's putting a profession, but I believe you we need to talk to somebody an owner or somebody in the building, miss Mcknight, and I agree with Miss cobbs that you know I feel for Miss rodriguez that she is placed in this position that she's actually speaking for the owners, but I think I think a better way to go about this, and you mentioned Mr Smith to have Mr Miss Rodriguez come back next month and discuss what has been happening with the residents and trying to find ways to work out these issues. But I think it would be better if we actually brought the owners back and had them speak to what are their. What are they planning to do some type of mitigation whatever before, because of course, I know I'm new to this, but miss Rodriguez can promise you everything under the sun, but if the owners do not agree to it, it's not going to go anywhere. It's going to be the same situation again, that's a fair point. Mr Rodriquez! Are you willing to ask if Mr, Hager or any of the or anyone else representing the ownership of the and particularly the owners, would be willing to come to next month's meeting? Absolutely I I'm actually very anxious to send them a meeting and speak with them once they come back from holiday. As you know, our owners are hasidic Jews, so once they come back from their holiday, I definitely want to speak with them and let them know everything acrosss, the board that I've been taking notes, and I'm just going to relay this and of course I will let them know that you guys want them to join me in the meeting or you just want to have them as well by themselves here, so that you guys we can all have this discussion. Yes, definitely so: okay, Mr Varela. You wanted to add a point, quick question before I make my point was not the original agreement with no sound with the owners is not that what Mr Vinicom had said that the agreement was with the owners, but we they that the community is getting the run around from each successive management around this and but the owners had already agreed to know music. Is that correct? Well, I could ask Mr Venacome to expand on his statement a little bit just to understand that, just because I you personally factually I'm aware that Miss Huey came to the meetings before and we had and we definitely had the legal representative for the applicant there. I do not believe any one of the churches who are the previous owners came to a meeting or Mr Hager. I do not think I've ever seen at a meeting before, but I, but to be fair, I do not think that they were ever asked to come to a meeting before so Mr Vinicom did you have a separate meaning that you that you met? I thought you were referring to your agreement. Our agreement with Miss Huey and the legal representatives of the owners, the right and I and I and I and I want to I feel like thank you very much. I mean you're getting kind of pounded tonight with this because it's very overwhelming to hear, but the fact is, the owners have the license, not the nothing man right. So, okay, thank you! Mr Vinicone, Mr, Russell I'll, go to you next Mr Harrison. Sorry! So can I continue yes, yeah, okay, yeah, so based on that and another, I again you know the last time it was a very sympathetic position from the management last time and I think that kind of swayed us thinking, okay, we'll them a chance. They won't aware. I could see this going on indefinitely, just new management, something else to bring, and I do not think I do not perceive that any of this. Let's not have these types of parties which are the bread and butter of this space or something to happen. When people are trying to raise revenues, I do not foresee an investment bunch of equipment or in some proofing and his Mr I've forgotten his name already. He wrote the sort of unlikely hood of Sun proofing working in that type of space. I think we need to proceed as if there is very little that they would be willing to do and that they're going to do if anything. At all, I mean at the very minimum between now and beginning today, well turn off the music, but also this community should have been provided a list of events in it and ahead of time, just to know just to sort of have an idea of when they're I mean I live acrosss the street from Fort Greene, Park and every so often my life is disrupted by an event, and I deal with it, but it happens every so often if that was happening. You know three nights a week. You know, and it was happening well into my head. I feel like sympathy for Empathy for the people in this situation, and I do not think I do not think that degree of negotiation is feasible. What we're proposing that they sort of make these adjustments. I just do not see that they're going to come through on that right, Mr Harrison you had it indicated you wanted to speak, yes, Miss. I want to piggyback on what alejandra just said. I agree with all of it, but in so stating and what Miss Cobb said. I want something I said before we left Miss. I believe it was before we let Ms rodriguez speak, but it may have been before we left the community. I guess it was before and with all due respect to Mrs Rodriguez. She is a essentially she is an employee, this body, but more importantly, the community that again and again and again meeting after meeting year after year. This issue has rightfully come because it's an issue. I wish Miss rodriguez. All the best history has shown this idiot that Miss Rodriguez will be here. She will do her best to carry out her duties at some point. It is likely from the history of this issue in this entity, this hotel, she will not be here. We will still be left with the owners and whatever hard work puts into finding this middle ground referred to or whatever words to use. Ultimately, it's. She is not the final authority nor as bill Vinicom has pointed out. Is it really her responsibility to put herself out there and put her and her promise on the line, because she's no authority in something that Mr Begg pointed out- and I think I stated I think respectfully- that we do not have a say in something when it's being built is, is an obvious fact that it's not that you could hear a cricket go off, but the way that the building is designed and where this beer garden is. It does not take much it. It's like having me speak. You do not need much of an amplifier. You do not need much amplified music, the sound will just go out and when person after person during this meeting and during the previous meetings, when we've had the community come out said, I live a block away and I hear the music I live around the corner. So, with all due respect to miss Rodriguez, I can't see on mitigating factors of a canopy that would mitigate the sound. I can't see where promises of well we'll put on headphones is going to mitigate this, because ultimately, two things are quite one is that she was present during the noise that came recently and as much as she's working very hard and trying to please a lot of parties. She has to keep her job and she has to be mindful of the venue making money, but also that you can't control other people at some point. At some point you can you can you can they require? You can make rules, but you can not compel people who are not going to be compelled. The other thing that was reminded of both by my colleagues, but also by Bill and Juan and and others from the community is that in this history, in this long history of this being a problem not once in my view of taxes, have been have been supplied to us over the years. Not once has this ever come down to zero to a place where the community is not complaining boys and I for one- and this has nothing to do with this venue. But I think I can speak to this. I for one here I reside and noises that I can not control and very appreciative of the issue that the residents around this establishment find themselves in and have found themselves in, quite so just to wrap it up. It's what I said before. I have a very dim view of this being resolved to the satisfaction of the community with any measures that either miss Rodriguez or her bosses. The owners could bring to bear because I think the bridge it's a bridge too far. The span is too in the middle, whether we take Mr Begs point of view. Well, you start with this or you shut it down or that it's just I do not think is all unless we just say absolutely no music, which we've said before, and people have agreed to and it did not work or we just have a at the next renewal or in some letter to the SLA now essentially have a position of no confidence in the owners, not in Miss Rodriguez and her in the horrible pandemic that we're all dealing with, but just with their history, independent of Covid-19 independent of Miss rodriguez that they have a history of not materially acting in good faith with the community point. I think you just have to recognize. Thank you so much okay. So I think, having heard all of your perspectives and having heard from the community, I have an idea, and it's not a perfect idea, but it's an idea and a way that we can possibly proceed because it's 9:14 and I do not think we're going to resolve this tonight. But I do think that we need to have some process to try to keep to keep this situation under control and or it's not under control, but to try to keep the situation monitored and to try to keep the all of the parties engaged so that we can improve it. So here's what I would suggest. I think the community has been crystal clear throughout this entire process, that the message that should be sent from our committee is that there is to be no amplified sound from this outdoor area. I think the committee's been clear about that. I do not see any reason why we should depart from that, and I think we should communicate that as our expectation, because it's frankly what we agreed to and what the community agreed to in the past. I think, aside from that, we should ask the hotel- and I think that they've been willing to provide this to do a couple of things for us. One ask them to come back to our meeting next month so that we can see what happened over the course of the month of October. Two have the have the owner? Ask the owner to come three give the feedback from the community that has come from this meeting and I think four provide a copy of the contract that Ms Teo mentioned in her comment in terms of the the contracts that exist with the with the with the external parties. Five keep in mind that you know in the world of music. What is really frowned upon in this circumstance are things that amplify the situation: djs people carrying on late at night, past 11 P.M. Those are the things that I think we would really not want to hear happening in the in the next month or so, but if we can get a copy of a contract and a schedule of events that would be helpful to at least have a mutual understanding about. What's going on from there, I guess I'll just ask the rest of the committee whether anybody has a agree or disagree with my thought process and, if there's anything to add or subtract from it. I quite agree with you Brandon. I think you said it all and I appreciate it brandon they're spot on. Thank you, Mr Harrison, okay. I do not have to get everybody's ratification of that, but Miss Rodriquez. Are you willing to get us a copy of the contract and of the for the for the third parties, as well as a schedule of events that are that are coming? Come up? Ask the management to attend next month's meeting and give them the feedback from the community from this meeting. Okay. So what I can accommodate for your suggestions, as I stated, I have events taking place until the end of the month. With that being said, deposits has been taken. Some of the events are not events that anyone in their personal life would want canceled any weddings, any birthday parties, any breast cancer awareness events. So with that being said, I'm going to do my due diligence to make sure that the music is not extremely amplified extreme extremely respectful, I'm going to suggest the headphones as well, definitely not going to have any dj, but I'm going to figure out a different another way, because again, these events can not not have any music the contract. Yes, I can definitely draft one and provide it for you, because, since Covid-19 has taken place and the hotel has reopened, I have not done anything contract based, I'm definitely giving your feedback. I will be drafting an extremely long email with all the bullet points that you guys provided since 2015, because, like I want to re- emphasize, I was not extremely privy to so I kind of want to let them know that hey I was given. You know a bag of bad apples and you want me to make apple juice, and this is what this is, what I'm doing now as far as coming back within the next month. Definitely so I'll speak with ownership to let them know that you guys would love for them to attend. I would even love to offer the debt as a location in the event that everyone is comfortable. If we can social distance, we can get out I'll, provide food beverage hors D'oeuvres, just so that you guys can meet me too, because I really do not even have my video. That could be another suggestion as well, and I- and I will find I will let you guys know prior maybe Mr, maybe Mr Smith. You can provide me with an email address or someone that I can contact directly. I do not know if that may be carol, but someone that I can contact directly to confirm whether or not ownership will be present at our next event, so that everyone is just you know privy to this in advance, and I can definitely give you a list of all the events that I have for the remainder of the month. Okay, I think one thing there are a couple commit community comments which I thought were important to note, but one thank you for your offer, but we're, but we're not going to meet on your deck. Unfortunately, I we do appreciate it, but at the same time, given the seriousness of what we're discussing, I think you know it's best that we try to meet in a in a neutral form and try to reach an agreeable solution. I mean the this: is people's lives and we're really. We need to try to work out a solution that works for them. I just want to. I want to follow up on a couple of points. One you know, could you can you please communicate to the management or to the to the ownership of this hotel that it is the community's board's expectation that there is no out amplified sound coming from this deck? I mean that I'm not saying you have to agree with it, but I, but I am saying well I mean technically, the ownership already did agree to it, so it's our expectation that they live up to that prior agreement, and I I'm not going to divert from that point. I mean that's where that was the starting point and that's the ending point in terms of our view on this on this relationship, because it we've been down this road for four for four years, and I think that that's really all we can say about. I can't force you to agree with it, but I can tell you that there may be a point in the future where this hotel will have a liquor license come up before us again and we'll have the opportunity to obtain how we feel about that once again and we have the ability to write letters to the state Liquor Authority. So I hope that will be taken into account because we do not always approve every application that comes before this committee. Yes, that destiny will relay the expectation and again I will try my best to accommodate Mr Varela. So, as Juliet notes, you know in 2019 the hotel Rep in the attorney agreed to no amplification at all on the second floor, including in insides and stores open to the deck. I remember that conversation. Clearly, I just gosh. I am sorry Mr griers, but I do not. I do not see how in a month's time, so are you not going to schedule any more events next month, when we see you in November, we'll all will all of November and December be booked out? What? If we have a warm November and a warm December, and so what what's going to happen exactly, are we going to so I do not the I feel for the situation, all of it for everyone, but at this point it's just. I do not see where this ends. What is the end point to the amplified music? When is that going to stop? Are you saying that it's going to stop after the breast cancer event? Is that the last amplified music event, because that would be the day that you that your business begins to comply with the agreement that we made a long time ago? Up until now, you are in non- compliance, okay, and so it is not your fault, but it is the case okay. So our last event that will have any form of a sound will be on the 25th. I completely understand that we're not in compliance, but I definitely want to re- emphasize that this is the only space that our hotel guests have to have a dining experience. As you mentioned, we could not have any electrically amplified music on the deck or the doors open to the deck, but I can't have anyone inside so this is why I'm literally saying to you guys, I'm like a rock and a hard place, I can't have them inside and because of you because- and the community does not want me to have them outside. So where can I have these hotel guests that want to get a beverage want to eat their food wanna play with their dog and our nice little lawn want to just have a moment with their family? I have no space to offer to them, because I can not have anyone indoors, as I mentioned, wait before they do their music. I do not think anybody's saying that the hotel guest can't come out onto the balcony. It's the issue is the music and the. If the music is, it is possible for a human being to eat at in a in a setting without music. That's that that's the issue, that's where that's where the community is coming from, it's just the music, not the hotel, correct, which is understood. So on the days that I have the dining experience. I definitely won't have any music playing, but I do have events or and seated dining experiences booked that require some form of a sound. So as far as just you know, the scenic dining experience not a problem. We can just have the television on streaming, the Nba playoffs and we can have everyone just kind of talking. But as far as you know, these events that I have books which I will send to whoever needs to see it the list of the events up to 10 25th. Those two require some form of sound. I again, I'm working vigorously with my team and the executive chef to figure out an amazing floor plan to accommodate the 25 indoor dining. So at least I can try to again figure out some type of way to allow my hotel guests to have an experience, while not you know disrupting the community, based on a based on the harbor experience that you guys are seeing that you had since 2015. Mr Chairman Sorry, may I say something: Mr harrison. No, it's just Mr Salazar Oh, Mr Salazar. I know we took community comments in a second Mr. Harrison did have his hands up. I did not say no more community comments, but I I'll give you one more community comment. Just after I hear from Mr Harrison. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Mr Chair, sorry about that Juan I'll, be you know, maybe perhaps it's just Alejandro, but I do not think with all due respect. Mr Rodriguez directly answered your direct question, which one the one that was. Where does it end? I thought she said that it's going to end on October the 25th that there's not going to be any more sound from any there's not going to be any more music there's not going to be any more amplified sound from any more events after October 25th. Was I wrong about that? You were not wrong. That is correct, okay! Well, the other thing I have to say Mr chair, because he's trying her best. She said something about sending a birthday, a rather long email request if she was not that at the very least the Community Board Office via Miss Church, be cc'd on that email, which email is this John, I'm Sorry, Miss Rodriguez had said that she was going to be right, sending a rather lengthy email about. I was guessing it to her bosses, though I do not know that was suggesting that the board office and the church be cc'd on that email. Okay, I mean I do not think I do not know to the degree that which I would not necessarily agree, but I, but I would ask Miss Rodriquez. Are you willing to see a member of the board office on your on your email to the to the ownership? I would be willing. However, I do not know if that's a norm in this type of a situation. I do not want to overstep or to ambush for so to speak. So I think that I probably would not okay, so you'd be willing, but you, but you would probably not okay. I understand any other comments from them. Well, I did say I would go to Mr Juan Mr Wand. Did you wish to make a comment? Yeah I'll, be brief, and I think the main comment that I agree with is: where does this end, because we've been here again and again- and I just want you to note that when Ms Rodriguez said the dining experience and we have the television on the and the I think, some sort of game- the Nba, Games and games? That was a real problem too, before it was not just the music. But what happens? Is they have these huge speakers with the television broedcasting, the games and all kinds of people? So because this is a venue where outside people, it's not the hotel residents that are making all these parties they're just renting it and they do whatever they want, and I think we have to go back to day one when they came to for the license. I was in there and they said this was not in a residential neighborhood, which is a question that you have noticed. You ask every applicant at their residence and they made that statement in their application that this was not a residential neighborhood. So from day one, it's been a total disregard for the neighbors, and so the concern and everybody has to you know he have a happy, medium etc, but at the end of the month, then we get the same story and nothing. There are no consequences, that's what the problem is that for the last four years have been no consequences. The only thing has been, you spend all day working come to the meetings and we, you know, attend the meetings and we get promises and these are broken. So there's got to be something that has to be done. I mean this, is the business is not compliant the other lines is they have to be comply with and there's got to be consequences for it, as opposed to just total disregard, and we go through the same thing again, because I do not you know we do not need to. We should be watching the debate at the moment a different debate, but thank you for the opportunity to speak again. No, I appreciate your insight, Mr Salazar. I mean, I think, appreciate that as a community board, we do not have the ability to necessarily impose consequences as a you know, in and of itself, in that we can't sit here and revoke the liquor license of the tillery hotel. But at a certain point we need to try to figure out. What's the best thing that we can do for the community, and I mean I in one in one circumstance and certainly at a given point- it might be that we write a letter to the state, liquor authority and say this is completely out of hand, and we are we're asking you please state, Liquor authority, the hotel will work with us. We need you to revoke their liquor license, but I do not want to go to that point because at this point, because I do not know how much good it's going to do, particularly in the next 30 days, because one we can't force the state liquor authority to listen to us and two in the next 30 days. The applicant will be able to do what what we, what we we'll be able to do whatever they want in terms of they can stay open until, however long their license allows. I mean they should honor our agreement, but it's it. It's not so much that we can do in that regard. I think- and I really believe like the best way to work with this is to try to is to stick with what we agreed before, make sure that it's clear what our what our approach to this was because, as a committee and as applicants, the hotel agreed to do these things and we should not budge an inch from that because it was that was what was agreed and what's going on. Now is literally something different, but at the same time I do think it would be valuable to meet with them again next month and to get some insight into the things that they're doing there, even whatever they are, because you know having more information about things is going to put us all in a more powerful position. But that's my I agree. Mr. Does anybody else on the committee want to comment about this? Okay, if I could make a statement regarding what Mr Salazar stated, so the tvs, as I mentioned before, the Nba playoffs- would be on mute. It would be just a form of entertainment since on the seating dining days, I can't offer any type of a sound. So I just want to re- emphasize on that as well. I also want to just say if you guys can I understand the frustration, but please consider again that this department is the department that is keeping the hotel afloat at the moment. There's nine employees that I bought back, which is including myself once the 25th comes. I have to essentially in some form of way. If the mayor does not increase shut down, you know the entire department, which might lead to the shutting down of the hotel, which might lead to the hotel bringing back in DHS, and just you know, no one here is going to be pretty much working that is employed by the hotel. So I definitely want to ask for a little sympathy. Consideration and just you know acknowledgement on that as well. I am the one that's standing here, letting you guys know that I will try my best until the 25th to keep the levels extremely respectful. We normally do not open on Monday and Tuesday, but we do open the space for our hotel guests to have at least a breath of fresh air in some form of shape or fashion. We do not sell any alcohol or food on those days as well. So please keep that in mind, and you know I I'm just trying my best to keep my people employed and not have to you know for like the entire department and essentially the hotel, so I just would ask for a little bit of consideration in that manner. I know that you guys are frustrated since you've been dealing with this since 2015, but I acquired this position. I love this position. I love the hotel, I'm definitely interested in building a relationship with the community and I will try my best to emphasize all of your concerns to the owners and definitely keep everything respectful until the 25th. There will be no extending past the 25th. You have my word because I'll just figure something out at that point I do not want to you know, have such a lengthy conversation about something that has been. You know promised to you guys again so I can relate. I can assure you that Mr salzar will not go into or actually was, Mr Valeria, we'll not go into November or December if we do have a warm month or anything of that nature right, and I think it's also the expectation that we that there's at least some manager on site, particularly in the evening hours- and I want to make sure that point is communicated to the owners too- that there should be somebody there where, if a community member needs to speak to a manager, a manager needs to be available to to speak with them and not a problem. As I said, I'm here at every single event, so I can give you guys my personal cell phone number. You can call me text me whatever you need, I will be on site, I'm the on- site manager during the evening, okay, Mr Varela. So I really appreciate that I swear to you guys, thank you and someone. Mr Greenstein is burning screens tonight. If you can post your number in the chat, if you'd be willing to do that, I do not see how this business is going to change their business model from one month to the next, if in fact trying to survive. So essentially, I think we have to prepare the between now and the renewal of the application when we can vote against the renewal at that point or between, even if we send a letter to the SLA tomorrow to revoke the liquor license, it's not going to happen within the next month, so I think we need. Everyone here needs to just accept that in the next month they are going to continue to hold these events and what are the three or four things or 10 things that need to happen this 10th month to make it manageable is it is that phone number is helpful? I guess: does the music need to come off instead of 11 at exactly 10? Does what needs to happen in this next month to make it feasible for this? For you, because it looks like it's going to happen anyway, even if we did all the things the most drastic things, it's not going to happen in October, but the events are going to happen in October right, so is there anything? Are there other things that miss Rodriguez can do like a hotel can promise in this next month that can make it more manageable? For you, the experience I mean honestly, I do not. I do not know I mean I certainly would want to ask any member of the community to answer that if they, if they want, but I, but I do want to know that I think you know it's equal to the point that you know they're, that the hotel may disregard what our expectations are for them in the next month. You know the there's, no reason that we should ever expect anything different, so we should expect that there that they should that they should honor their agreement. I do not care if this meeting goes 12 hours, I'm still going to come to that view, because it was something that we agreed to miss church. Did you have a point you wanted to make? Yes I'd like to so we keep saying that there was an agreement with the hotel. There was not an agreement. This was essentially a condition of the license and to my knowledge, based on the letter, that's written that is legally binding. I understand that Covid-19 means that some things have changed as far as method of operations, and I do not know how it affects this, but we need to start from the point that those conditions in that letter are legally binding. That's a good point great point: there is an option on the state Liquor Authority website that anyone can write a complaint directly to the state liquor authority about the establishment too Mr Finicum. Do you want to make a statement? Yes, I think the point is well taken. I do not think we should agree on going out of compliance. Miss Rodriguez just is going to have to take that back and just say we're out of compliance and- and she needs to make a different decision about that with the owners. But I do not feel comfortable tonight going and saying we're going to allow them to go out of compliance. That was that was contin them, limiting quite sound on the contingent upon us going ahead and giving them the okay on having a liquor license. So the fact that they're out of compliance they did not have well John, they did not, they did not have the they did not come. I got ta go. I can't do this at the same time as the meeting. I'm sorry. So the fact is the fact that they went out of compliance without telling the community or the community. That's a problem, and I do not feel comfortable, allow leaving this meeting saying it's okay to be out of compliance for the rest of the month. That was, they got the liquor license contingent upon them, not doing this and they went ahead and did it anyway and that's all I have to say about out of compliance. Okay, I agree: can we make a motion Brandon yeah, caroline? It would be helpful to know if, when someone is not in compliance with the like, if they're fringing on the deal, can they is that straight to the SLA, that's what we would have to do so then I make a motion that we file a complaint with the SLA to that the business is not compliant with the license that we agreed upon effective immediately or that we do this right away. Does anyone know how that applies? Pulse Covid-19, because again, I'm re- emphasizing that the only reason we are not in compliance, because we have been in compliance since the hotel has been acquired in September, and I got my position. I can assure you that there was no music from the month of September to December and music only started after Covid-19 and after we've been mandated for the city to have our people outside on the deck. So I just want to know if that is something that I it seems like. You are privy to SLA stipulations again, I do not know. Do you know that something that is included or will be acknowledged? I'd like to second Mr Varela's motion and say: if we need to add a stipulation that there are Covid-19 requirements, we may not be aware of we can, but that does not undermine like we can still make that motion. I think and submit a letter or do whatever for you know, whatever form that needs to take, but I fully support that idea. Okay, so to be clear, the motion is to write a letter to the SLA expressing our concern about the non- compliance with the terms of the existing liquor license that we most recently approved in October 2019.. Is that correct, Mr Varela, or is there something more to that yeah, essentially to inform them that the business is not complying with the liquor license as it was granted to them? Okay, any discussion on the motion. Okay, hearing no discussion, I will ask each of the committee members how they vote Mr Varela in Favor, Mr, Miss, Cobb, Mr Thurston in Favor, Miss Mcknight, I'm in favor, Mr, Andrews, Mr, Chair, yes, Sir now. I know that music is an issue for us, but what we? What are we going to do when all this stuff has been contracted for all the stuff has been paid for the dj's, whatever they decide to do, has already been paid for and if they cancel it. I need you to vote on the motion we're at a voting point in the motion. The discussion is closed and I we can definitely take your comments, but I need you to vote either. Yes, you're in favor of sending the letter expressing our view of non that they're non- compliant or no you're, not in favor of that. How do you vote in favor? Okay, I vote in favor, also unanimous. We will write the letter, okay, Miss Rodriquez. I I'd still ask you to convey the information that we discussed to the minute to the owners and invite them to come back to next month's meeting, because I'd love to be able to speak to them. That's not a problem. I definitely will relay that to them I'll. Let them know everything I'll. Let them know about the votes in the motion to see if they want to maybe do anything regarding that with the SLA directly, so that we can again just have a perfect medium. I do not think that the hotel wants to let go of the staff. I do not think the hotel wants to bring back the DHS homeless group. I just you know, I'm we're going to definitely make this work, so I appreciate you guys time. I appreciate you guys allowing me to speak and accepting me into this meeting today. Thank you very much and thank you to all the members of the community to for coming out and spending your time and our meeting and sharing your sharing your thoughts on this in a respectful manner. I really appreciate that too. I just want to know, because we've had a lot of discussions over the years, mostly with liquor licenses before they actually go into effect, but this particular discussion has always been respectful with this community, and I really do appreciate that, because it's added to our ability to really zone in on what the issue is. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to the to the committee members appreciate your time. Thank you all for your time. Thank you and hanging in there. Thank you. Everyone! Thank you. Thank you. So much have a great night. Everyone have a wonderful night all right. Well, thank you. All we're almost done with the agenda and I'll try to keep it somewhat brief throughout this, but there are a couple of other things that we need to mention. We already did the minutes. We have the chairpersons report. So let me go super quick through the chairpersons report one. I had the great privilege of attending a presentation from the Brooklyn center of health disparities last week that Miss Blackshear had promoted and which was being hosted by Nyu Langone, and I think Nyu Lang going downstate. Yes, and it was, it was a really wonderful presentation. Particularly, there was a video about Brownsville that was played and about some of the many of the things that our committee knows are real issues that we have that have impacted the public housing communities for years, particularly, I recall they have seven different public housing buildings in a very close space and it's one of the most closely dense communities in New, York or anywhere, and between that and the culture of over policing, the culture of poverty, the culture of having lack of employment, the food deserts. I know we've spoken a lot about that in our committees in the past. It creates a system of stress of constant stress that people live in on a daily basis that impacts them from like a fight or flight kind of context in just in terms of their daily life. You know I do not know, I'm not going to go into too much detail because the late hour, but I used to coach little league down in brook in red hook, and I remember one of my players used to would tell me he was like a 10:11 year old kid that every day he got up, he went out the door. He feared he had to fight somebody just to leave his building, and you know I it's a it's a life that like it's a context. I could never imagine, but you know it's I it's. It seems to be like the same kind of stress that it was being got by this video, which is it and I think, like I'm thinking, what can we do as a community committee to really support the health equity goals that we have as well as to combat this issue? I think you know maybe there's something we can add to district needs in terms of adding a adding a maybe New York's in this is just my crazy idea, so feel free anybody to shoot this down, but maybe department of small business services should look at giving grants to so- called b corporations that are aligned to the as opposed to what traditional corporations are aligned to, which is promoting the goals of the stockholders or the owners. B corporations are aligned to promoting the goals of all community members. People who are impacted, I think, like the blue, marble ice cream company is a B corporation. Seventh generation is a B corporation, but any business that is a B corporation would be looking out for other community members. If we can promote, if we can ask like the city Department of small business services, to promote adding the corporations to areas surrounding our public housing developments, particularly in the areas of food and healthy food, because I'm not sure we're doing a whole lot with regards to healthy food with our current district needs statement, maybe that's something that we could shoot for. Does anybody have any thoughts on that or feel free to criticize me? I love the idea. One thing I would just add just like consulted in my past life on helping companies become be Corpse is that it just can be expensive. So I wonder if there would be something that we could advocate for that's like a grant program for you know and support for applying to become a B corp. If, like a simple way, I think about it is like a lot of small farms right north of the city are not certified organic, but they have all organic practices and just can't afford the certification like. Are there stipulations we could put in place? That would say if they do these following things and you know elevate a social good in the same way they elevate value to their shareholders, then those should be more worthy of you know getting business with SBS or something like that. Obviously it's a bigger process, but I think it's a really cool idea: okay, Mr Varela and then Miss Mcknight, Mr, Varela. Sorry, I think Miss Mcknight was first I'm sorry. Okay, I'd be happy to defer to miss Mcknight Miss Mcmahon. Well, thanks Brandon, I give you credit, you're thinking outside of the box and one of the presenters, because I actually went to the symposium last week. He was talking about thinking outside of the box, but one of the things that I heard Presenter at the presenter mentioned, is that you can go to the community and find out exactly what they need. So I'm thinking instead of the corporation. Maybe the grants can go to community- based organizations who actually know the needs of the community, but that's just my thought on it. Okay, I think that's a fair point. That's a fair point! Any other members of the committee have any thoughts, Mr Varela, so this is sort of my favorite public health topic. As you know, this is kind of why I joined the committee was specifically to talk about the effects of chronic stress on the body and the ways in which it affects everyone differently. So what you were saying, fight or flight is great in a moment, for you know a day before a meeting before the birth of your child, but if it's chronic, it sort of increases the wear and tear internally in your body right. So there are many different ways to tackle that, but really it's about control and empowerment within a community. How much control and power do they have to sort of pay you back in a bit upon what miss mcknight was saying and- and that really requires some major upstream policies as a case as a case in point, Alaska is one of these states that, for all intents and purposes, should have pretty poor health and for a long time no one can figure out why it was that they were fair and better on all sorts of health indicators. And it's because every single alaskan receives it receives a dividend check the same dividend check at the end of the year, based on the sales of the oil. This is an area I do not know particularly super well, but they receive a check because of the oil that they sell. So everyone gets the same check every year. It's a great unifier in that in amongst the alaskan population and researchers who have been tracking their health show that it brings down all sorts of barriers between Alaskans and keeps them healthier, which is why a poor country is. It can be healthier than a country with a lot of sort of inequality within it because everyone's in the same boat. So we live in a community where every other block you have poverty and every other bloc. You have extreme wealth and that's bad for absolutely everyone, including the wealthy people, which is why the one percent of the United States is unhealthier than the one percent in every other westernized country. You know we're richer, but we're still sicker. Even our one percent is Sicker acrosss the board anyway, I could go on for hours, but I did send that email after the last meeting with all of those documentaries that are all exactly about what Brandon just brought up. I really encourage people to take the time to watch at least one or two of them they're. All. Quite I did try to watch, but the links did not work. So if you can just oh I'll, resend I'll resend, okay, I got started Alejandro, but I need more time to watch those. I'm sorry, but I I'm aiming. I am aiming to complete them my 11th year of sending out these documentaries I'll keep going I'll. Do it for 15 years. Okay. This is very important for us to continue discussing and I'd like to recommend that we in one of the community boards, maybe the next one, take time to really talk about. This is death and not now when it's 10, almost 10 o'clock and the well, I got you a costume, but miss church. Do not. We need to get the statement of district right now. No, we do not that's a joke, she's laughing she's laughing, but I want to know. I know I want to know what the answer is, because what did you ask? I'm sorry, what were you asking? My answer is: if we want to add a district need, do we have to do it tonight, or can we wait till next month or is next month too late next month is too late? The submission is the end of October. So here's my here's, my proposed district need and anybody make it it's that the city Department of small business services, provide grants to assist community based organizations or be corporations with starting in with starting up focused on healthy food in areas proximate to our public housing pride projects- okay, I'll put it in writing and send it to then and okay. If we're thinking about that there's one other thing I want to mention, because Miss church brought it up to me before the meeting last week and it is important and that is Miss church went to the city borough. The city budget, consultations that you know occurs every year and you've got to love the city they're cutting the sanitation department like Crazy Miss church. Do you want to provide any more specific details on that sure I do not have the document up, but so they've cut little basket collection, they've, cut hazardous waste collection, E-, Waste collection, some street cleaning was restored because that had also been greatly reduced. So I mentioned to Brandon that we should consider adding some of those services on our on our budget priorities. I will see if I can pull up the document really quickly to provide some more specifics on the cuts, but I think the some of the cuts have real public health implications for us yeah. The one thing that I thought really struck me is: they want to get rid of the electronic waste Curbside collection and basically, if you do that, you're, basically trying to strike a deal with the community. That makes no sense, because not everybody's going to go to one of those fairs to get rid of their computer. You know they're going to find a way to just dispose of it in the trash, and I think it would be fair to say for one district need that we need to the city needs to maintain and or its existing e- Waste collection service on a on the existing basis that it has and and separately that we should also send a message that this is not the time for cutting back on on collecting the trash and and other basic sanitation services, and one that is, I think, of particular interest to the to the committee is they've also eliminated some of the funding associated with rat mitigation that too yeah. So here's what I propose and I'll do this in a motion so that we can be very clear about exactly what we want to add. I would propose that we add we can make it four additional district needs, one, the one that I espoused earlier about. The community- based organizations and b corps engaged in healthy food located near our public housing buildings to continuing the e- Waste disposal service that exists so that people can continue to do that from a curbside collection standpoint: three, not reducing the services of litter basket collections and other sanitation services and then for not not reducing services associated with with rat mitigation, because there there's no science to indicate that the rats went away. So that's my motion is anyone. Second, any discussion on the motion. Very none take everybody's vote. I see Miss confidence, Thurston and Miss mcknight has all said they're in favor, Mr Varela. Are you in favor I'm going to have stain on this one? I would have want a little bit more time to think these through and compared to the other ones. I do not know if this in the long run dilutes all of the other ones that we've already sort of agreed upon. Okay, abstain: that's fair, Mr! Andrews! How do you vote Mr Andrews? Are you still there? Mr Andrews will be marked as abstain because he's not entering so. I think that motion passes. We've got four in favor, I vote in favor and two abstentions: okay, otherwise, for my chairs report, I'm going to have a conversation tomorrow with the New York Academy of Medicine, which is a non- profit, supporting health equity with Miss Church, and I believe our conversation is at early afternoon like three something like that yeah something like that, so that that's when we're having our conversation. If anybody is interested in joining, please just send me an email and I'll try to loop. You in just to hear more about what this organization's about and with that I'm going to end my chairs report. Does anyone have any other business to raise? I just want to introduce myself. I oh wait. One second carol. I will absolutely give you a chance to introduce yourself, but that's the next section. We have to finish other business in any other business from the committee. No other business from the committee. Oh Mr Varela did you have other business Mr Varela is withdrawing his other business and that's okay. We are now at the final point in the agenda, which is community forum, and we have a comment from a member of the community carol. Would you want to introduce yourself- and I perhaps state your last name and we'll be happy to hear what you have to say sure very quick? My name is Carol Rubinstein. I am here on the behalf of caroline church. She invited me. I work for Canberra, the non- for- profit service provider that is having we're in the aloft hotel through DHS, I'm serving homeless clients. So there have been numerous meetings that we have been reaching out to the community downtown Brooklyn partnership. Caroline carolyn has been involved with that. So I just wanted to come to the meeting and introduce myself. In fact, we have two shelters in the community opportunity house, which is a small men's shelter. That's been there for 10 years on the corner of Tillery and Prince Street. We have a very small piece of that building, there's another women's shelter, but we do not run that and then we recently moved into the aloft hotel because of Covid-19. So I just wanted to come here hear if there are any issues and we're always open to conversation and discussion. Thank you very much. It's great to hear more about your organization and I'm sorry that you have to mention it at 10 o'clock tonight it's. I wish we had more time to talk about it with you, and I would encourage you to come back to another meeting of our committee to talk about it further, because you know, I think we might have questions and other thoughts and thank you for inviting him sure I can come. I could probably come to the meeting in November if it plays okay, if it's okay on your agenda and certainly can talk about Campbell, absolutely that would be great any other members of the community want to add a statement or anything to our meeting. Now is the time Msi belly are you mentioning? Are you are you making? I just want to say thank you. I know this has been a long meeting, so thank you all the most welcome Mr Belly, any other members of the public want to make a comment. Okey- dokey. At that point, I'll entertain a motion to Adjourn Mr Varela Miss Cobb. We all agree yes, Ms Thurston. Do you agree? Also, you do good yeah. I got ta assume Mr Andrews does, but thank you all for your. Thank you all for your time tonight and I hope you all have a great rest of your week. Thank you very much brandon. Thank you.
