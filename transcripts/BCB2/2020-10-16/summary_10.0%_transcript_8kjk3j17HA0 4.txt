Good evening, everyone thanks for coming to the October edition of the health Environment Social Services Committee meeting for Community Board 2.
I'm going to hold off on asking to approve the agenda, but we have a number of people in the audience Do we have Miss Rosamond Fletcher from Fort Greene Conservancy?
You do not know about us, we've been around for about 20 years and our mission, which we've recently updated, is to preserve and Nourish Fort Greene Park as a community resource and a public space for all new yorkers for two generations to come, and we do this through programming and through maintenance and through advocacy.
We want to assess the viability and the effectiveness of an alternative model to what currently is an enforcement based response to people who are living with mental health illness in Fort, Greene, Park.
We want to look at something that is community driven non- enforcement based and something that changes the that redirects park, users from what would otherwise be an NYPD referral to an array of health ecosystem, resources, so, whether that's wellness, opportunities, jobs or housing.
It's, very important to the Fort Greene Park Conservancy, one of our values that we just reaffirmed So. It's extremely important that all park users feel like that they have the right to be in public space that they belong, especially those that have mental illness.
And we'd have sort of different shifts, and they would work to proactively develop relationships with people in and around the park, and I say around, because we need to look at the whole ecosystem of the neighborhood.
Is, the very large park in right, downtown Atlanta, which for many years was perceived to be not a safe place to go because of what was perceived as homeless and mentally ill and People with fiction issues had are were in the park, and we consulted with that group to embed social practitioners in there, and the results were quite staggering as far as the number of people that got homes, the number of people that got connected to addiction, services and things like that glad to share that with you.
We have we're in the process of exploring several very large grants to support this, the Robert, Wood Johnson Foundation and some other Van Moringen Foundation and some others, and so we're very hopeful that we'll be able to start this next year, And, we do have very high level approval of New York city parks for this, And, then we're very excited to begin it, but as one piece of it that we did not get into is that we do plan to have a community advisory council as part of it.
You know be reaching out, including to this group, to get people more involved in the project, and so that is definitely one of the next steps in the coming months.
You very much for your presentation and really you know hats off to you all for the tremendous work that you're doing, because it's the issues that you've espoused are things that I think our committee is very concerned about.
I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit more about the kinds of people who are act, who would actually engage in lieu of the police officers with the with with someone who's mentally ill in the park?
These are the right people to go out and consult I think, can feel that one right, so I'm going to be training since I've certified a certified cit training, which has been recently pulled from NYPD, because I know you put it in the link that they still have an act of training.
Impaired specialists and social workers and fountainhouse is also a professional net as well So the people that will be working most directly with people that might be in crisis or just people that need some extra services are going to be state, certified peer specialists and then social workers, the right people to really be working with people that are trying to manage with an illness.
They may not identify themselves because of stigma of having an addiction or having a mental health issue, but they're willing to identify themselves as wanting to be respected needing some help, maybe with whatever a food, stamps application or housing.
It could be severe a minor in the times of code when people have lost their jobs and losing their loved ones, and on so much uncertainty, I mean a lot of us even on the phone may be going through some trauma And it does not have to be major, but you could be walking through the park sitting on the bench just crying, because you just lost your job or you're afraid, because you have Covid-19 And you'll, see a pair of specials in the consumer or part a pep office to come by and say, hey, what's going on, And can we help you and then at that time you may feel like with me, and you may feel, like you made comfortable me and say: I would do, and I may say: Do you want a cup of coffee because I'm trying to de- escalate, it?
You need a human being human being just to talk to you and listen to you just being there every day you get to know the economy right, it's not coming once a week as part of an outreach van and then going off to another place.
's something that we would have to work on in having an amenity having something that we're adding to the park, not just not just to the people in need, but that everybody, I think, we're also very gregarious right, christina.
That is one of the areas that I think we're still working on and would love to have some input, because it needs to be exactly right for this community.
I did not introduce you earlier Carol Anne, but you are an important member of our committee, so I'd like for you to introduce yourself good evening, Everyone, Carol, Ann, Church assistant district manager for Cv2.
So it looks like you're going to be open until 10 o'clock during the week 12 o'clock on Friday Saturday, and you have no outdoor area as background music.
You say that the new owner was with the business previously or So. He was the chef and oh great manager of the space great, and I apologize, I'm, not sure I think maybe he's just having some problems connecting connecting the audio forward.
I'm, going to close off the time for public questions and ask the committee : Do we have a motion for this application?
So, that's great to hear the space that I'm going to be speaking about now has continually had the license for the past 15 years.
Has he volunteers with a group called code nation that takes tech professionals and places them in under resourced high schools to teach technical skills, and we also work very closely with fab Fulton, the Business Administration and Christina Chavez to really elevate kind of the neighborhood overall and really help out businesses, particularly during this really trying time.
Most of our staff live in the neighborhood The music is more of a early brunch thing and for special occasions, I'm going to ask for questions from members of the committee.
3:30 is that 4 am yeah and serving alcohol until 3:30, I'm, not saying again that we are going to stay open every night until 3 am or 4 am We want to have the ability to if we do have an event or whatnot, especially with the fact of the income that everybody is losing currently this year and with the uncertainty of next year.
We, currently have nine people and as well space from speaking with the landlord this morning at one time did have 35 employees, so that'd be 35 employees from the neighborhood, So again, the 4 m license is just in line with what they previously had this church.
The fact is, because something's allowed does not necessarily mean that you're going to have that customer confidence for them coming back, so that's kind of why we want to make sure that we have that ability to serve outside in case people even coming back next year in March still do not feel comfortable going inside.
There are residential tenants above the restaurant space and they were notified about the application and all during the years of operation of the previous owner, there had never been any problems with noise or any other types of complaints from the residents of the above, the restaurant.
Thurston, approve, Miss, Mcknight approve Ms Cobb Next up this evening, we've got 445 gold street Ms , This is an on- premise: liquor license application from his known Uws llc He'll be doing business as Ms known decal, we're at 445 gold street and the lower level of the food court, we're taking over a space that was previously occupied by Fortina.
Mr, Kelly I'll ask Mr Varela to give our guidance in just a second, but just to confirm this is the location in the bottom of the of the city point food court in the decal market hall that it's basically it's in the basement of the location Do. You want to provide our advice on we're kind of in a rough spot here, because we lost the community center at Ingersoll?
I just want to go through some of the background from our committee's perspective about the artillery hotel and the liquor license there, because we've we've had a bit of a history and that we've had, I believe, four prior meetings on this on the subject.
This all started on September, 2nd 2015 when we had Mr Carlos, Guerreas and David Gibber Appear on behalf of the tillery hotel, and we had a discussion about the initial liquor licenses, which were approved with no community comment.
And I, believe we received from some contact from our city councilman about the number of 3- 1- 1 complaints and a letter was sent to the artillery hotel's attorneys in October 2017, asking them to appear at our meeting on November 1st 2017, because there was a renewal application to be considered.
This time, who advised us that they had been very they've, been very busy that the the hotel had was a very stressful and hectic environment, and there were also very a number of members of the community who came to that meeting and voiced their concerns about loud, mute, loud noise and a inability to to get an understanding with management about how the complaints were.
We missed Vitale and Mr Troub, agreed that the speakers would be removed from the beer garden and that there would be no more amplified music, only acoustic music that would be played out in the beer garden, and we had asked the hotel to come back to our June 2018 meeting.
We had community members, attend the meeting and express similar concerns regarding music being played from the second floor, beer garden and an inability to contact management.
This was memorialized in a letter that the board office and to the state liquor authority, as well as to miss Hoffman and subsequently we did not hear anything that I'm aware of as a committee until fall of this year.
When we learned there had been a complaint about music being played from the second floor on August, the 24th we heard about that at the last committee meeting and that led to me asking the to see if the hotel could come to this meeting.
There are some media reports about that, but that's about all I can say in that regard, and then we were further alerted to an incident where there was some soca music being played on September 23rd 2020, and this was apparently coming from the beer garden I would want to ask Miss Rodriquez first to sort of give her point of view about what the hotel's sense of these of these facts were whether they were aware of these agreements that we've had with other people.
I got some people back their jobs, we're trying our best to kind of make it work.
They bought a hotel in September, Covid-19, hit, and now it's just If you guys have any feedback on how I can kind of keep this afloat and just still operate at least until maybe we are allowed 50 indoor capacity where I can bring things indoors, which you know And also the weather is not going to permit me to have.
Do not think we want to say no weddings or bar mitzvahs, necessarily Let. The committee in the community speak for that, but I think at the at a minimum.
Well, that's why I'm asking, if there's some type of a medium, that we can find, at least until we are allowed the opportunity to have indoor dining my hotel guests have nowhere to go when they want to sit down and eat.
They just need a chance to just stay in a hotel in a nice comfy bed go to the bar have a cocktail they want to have that experience they enjoy the music.
You know: I have a lot of people from that to live on, duffel that come in and actually sit down and relax.
Because, you know we we've said no music inside or outside And I understand that's the business that we we're in a difficult, time.
This is a situation where the committee and the community has been very tolerant by consistently voting to approve these applications in the past by consistently being respectful of the applicants who come in and or the folks who've come in and represented themselves from this hotel.
So I, really I feel like that, would be the place to start, but I'm going to ask I'm going to ask for if you can forgive me for one second , I'm just going to ask if any of the members of the committee had any questions, mr Varela just want to clarify something that sorry.
I, see the argument that for a wedding of our mitzvah there should be music, but if you're, if your hotel guests are having dinner, I mean there are all sorts of restaurants open up and down the streets now cafes.
Okay did any other members of the committee have any questions for the applicant, I'm.
I understand her position, but this is the community And I'm very much concerned with what they have to say also previously about the music Thank you, miss Cobb, did any of the other members of the committee want to comment.
I just want to let my fellow committee members know and yourself as well as Miss church, Do not think that it's a good fit to have this beer garden, have any kind of music, and I One of the things that miss church sent us and one of the things that you summarize Mr Chair at least three former and one current.
I will definitely relay this message and provide you guys with my contact, my direct contact information as well as the front desk manager's direct contact information, so that this does not happen again in the event that you call the front desk or you come by the hotel And, they say: there's no one on site or available to speak.
I, want to hear from some other members of the community, who've asked to speak and again I'll remind everybody to try to be as brief but to the point.
And, as we heard from Ms Rodriguez will continue to be a problem because they have this event, and this is very fundamental when they came five years ago before this very committee , they misrepresented, they did not say this was a residential neighborhood facing all these homes with long- term residents and so started from there They have agreed first not to play amplify music again the same thing that you already stated, and they do not keep their.
You know who the community board is and came to us and said, and especially if Miss Ue is working with the owner.
Sorry we're just going to have to wait for a few moments, because there are a few other members of the community who would like to speak.
I do not know what type of music was, but at certain points there was a dj or mc just screaming into the microphone, and I am one block over and one block down from the hotel so that sound traveled through several other buildings to get to me with the windows How many other people not too many other people.
I am someone that she, okay to hire, so I think her responding to that email was just her way of maybe being an additional armor for me, because you know I am essentially new to the situation, but I do want to emphasize that she did essentially walk away from the property because the ownership decided to take in that DHS group, which again you know, I'm trying to avoid, because if that group comes back, I lose my job.
Fmb lose their job, etc, and, as I mentioned to you guys right now, the F b is what's keeping the hotel afloat, As I mentioned, I was just told, no electrically amplified music on the deck, So you know, I was playing music inside of the bar and just having it lightly streamed out onto this onto the deck again.
Matter, I've been through many times when it comes to the tillery hotel that the discussion seems to be, as the representative from the hotel requested, that the the Community board Meet in the middle, which implies that the discussion or the decision really is whether the license conditions should be a renewal with music versus a renewal without music and there's requests to me in the middle.
Those are the two ends of the spectrum of the of the discussion and the reason I think the the no renewal option has to be on the table is that if you look at the structure of the building itself, there is no way you can have music on that deck without it being broedcast into the block.
The license for the tillery hotel was last renewed in late, 2019, And I believe it's going to be at least another year for them to come up for a renewal application again unless they have a transfer of ownership.
I just wanted to thank Mr Begg for his position on that seriously, and also to say that Miss Wallace has written a comment still having trouble with the unmute, and I would like for someone to read And I'm happy to read it, The hotel be allowed to serve guests with no music and rent the deck for events with no music.
Think Mr Begg makes a very valid point where essentially, we I do not know that we should be negotiating for people to live up to the agreement that we've already made, or that's already been established, and Set up.
But for us to have a kind of point of view, a venue is going to be never, but that generally is not the case, because when an entity is coming to us for a letter of support to the state liquor authority for their license that they're requesting, generally speaking, the building right, the spaces are decided.
There would be no amplified music or noise of any kind in the last meeting and then two And I think it's just gross negligence on behalf of the hotel, You know , I do understand the position that any sort of manager has put in who joins this company, and I recognize the fact that they're, probably overwhelmed, but as a community we've all been overwhelmed for years and like I, do not live next.
There are people sitting outside that can hear the music that's playing from with inside of the of the bar, and I just wanted to address Travis when he made a mention about there, not being any management.
So I, definitely am here just to kind of make sure and maintain that the front desk manager is very on top of that as well, because we want to ensure that our hotel guests feel safe and they do not see a million people just kind of walking upstairs.
Any steps is the hotel willing to take to soundproof the deck in some complete capacity like possibly put a covering over it or you know, or make sure that there's no sound coming out, I have definitely spoken with ownership and accounting and suggested that we do get a closure.
I've been mandated to only have out an outdoor experience Are you suggesting that if somehow the community and the committee is okay with you, with your hotel holding these events that you've planned in the next few weeks and the accompanying noise that is associated with that you and the hotel will promise to never again have outdoor music on that deck or any sound from music that that's coming out and going into the neighborhood?
I want to just ask the members of the committee for their thoughts about this, and you know, keep in mind.
While I appreciate, Mr Rodriguez, and for really wanting to work for the community, I think the problem was bigger than her.
But I think I think a better way to go about this, and you mentioned Mr Smith to have Mr Miss Rodriguez come back next month and discuss what has been happening with the residents and trying to find ways to work out these issues.
My point was not the original agreement with no sound with the owners is not that what Mr Vinicom had said that the agreement was with the owners, but we they that the community is getting the run around from each successive management around this The owners had already agreed to know music.
At all, I mean at the very minimum between now and beginning today, well turn off the music, but also this community should have been provided a list of events in it and ahead of time, just to know just to sort of have an idea of when they're I mean I live acrosss the street from Fort Greene, Park and every Often my life is disrupted by an event, and I deal with it, but it happens every so often if that was happening.
I do not think is all unless we just say absolutely no music, which we've said before, and people have agreed to, and it did not work or Just have a at the next renewal or in some letter to the SLA now essentially have a position of no confidence in the owners, not in Miss Rodriguez and her in the horrible pandemic that we're all dealing with, but just with their history, independent of Covid-19, independent of Miss rodriguez that they have a history of not materially acting in good faith with the community point.
Think one thing there are a couple commit community comments which I thought were important to note, but one thank you for your offer, but we're, but we're not going to meet on your deck.
Could you can you please communicate to the management or to the to the ownership of this hotel that it is the community's board's expectation that there is no out amplified sound coming from this deck?
Because it we've been down this road for four for four years, I can't force you to agree with it, but I can tell you that there may be a point in the future where this hotel will have a liquor license come up before us again and we'll have the opportunity to obtain how we feel about that.
I completely understand that we're not in compliance, but I definitely want to re- emphasize that this is the only space that our hotel guests have to have a dining experience.
We could not have any electrically amplified music on the deck or the doors open to the deck, but I can't have anyone inside The community does not want me to have them.
That's that that's the issue, that's where that's where the community is coming from , it's just the music, not the hotel, correct, which is understood.
Just want you to note that when Ms Rodriguez said the dining experience and we have the television on the and the I think, some sort of game- That was a real problem too, before it was not just the music.
I, mean, I think, appreciate that as a community board, we do not have the ability to necessarily impose consequences as a you know, in and of itself, in that we can't sit here and revoke the liquor license of the tillery hotel.
The best thing that we can do for the community, and It might be that we write a letter to the state, liquor authority and say this is completely out of hand, and we are we're asking you please state, Liquor authority, the hotel will work with us.
Need you to revoke their liquor license, but I do not want to go to that point because at this point, because I do not know how much good it's going to do, particularly in the next 30 days, because one we can't force the state liquor authority to listen to us and two in the next 30 days.
And I really believe, like the best way to work with this Is. To try to is to stick with what we agreed before, make sure that it's clear what our what our approach to this was because, as a committee and as applicants, the hotel agreed to do these things, Anybody else on the committee want to comment about.
Just trying my best to keep my people employed and not have to you know for like the entire department and essentially the hotel, so I love the hotel, I'm.
And the renewal of the application, when we can vote against the renewal at that point or between, even if we send a letter to the SLA tomorrow to revoke the liquor license, it's not going to happen within the next month, so I think we need.
Certainly would want to ask any member of the community to answer that if they, if they want, But I, do want to know that I think you know it's equal to the point that you know they're, that the hotel may disregard what our expectations are for them in the next month.
I know that music is an issue for us, but I need you to vote on the motion.
I just you know, I'm we're going to definitely make this work, So Thank, you very much and thank you to all the members of the community to for coming out and spending your time and our meeting and sharing your sharing your thoughts on this in a respectful, manner.
I just want to know, because we've had a lot of discussions over the years, mostly with liquor licenses before they actually go into effect.
Think There was a video about Brownsville that was played and about some of the many of the things that our committee knows are real issues that we have that have impacted the public housing communities for years, Particularly, I recall they have seven different public housing buildings in a very close space And, it's one of the most closely dense communities in New, York or anywhere, and between that and the culture of over policing, the culture of poverty, the culture of having lack of employment, the food deserts.
Other members of the community want to add a statement or anything to our meeting.
