This meeting of the transportation and Public Safety Committee of Community Board 2, is called to order and recording may begin. The meeting is now being recorded for the purpose of transparency and for permanent public access on the CB2 youtube archive all attendees. Please keep your microphone muted. When you're, not speaking, district staff will actively assist in maintaining this protocol. It is the practice of community board 2 to conduct remote meetings with all committee members cameras on for full transparency. We encourage all attendees to also leave their cameras on, particularly if you're given the floor to speak, to maintain appropriate discussion and voting process. I will make it known when and which topics are open for comment by committee members then board members at large and then the general public. If you wish to speak, please use the webex feature in the participants panel to digitally raise in your lower your hand, and I will call you in order if you have questions that fall outside the public comment time. Please put your questions in the chat panel and we will address them if relevant to the matter and if time permits, if any attendee experiences technical difficulties with the Webex software or features during the meeting, you can consult Help.Webex.Com or after the meeting you can reach out to the district office. It is our desire to provide access for all of our neighbors, regardless of physical ability or limitation. So if you require accommodation or assistance, please call the district staff 72 hours before any public meeting. Did we have any accommodations today? Okay, there now we will begin roll call and John if you could go through the list. George, yes, present, Vice Chair, Cheryl, Gills, dear Cheryl. Thank you. John Quinn, President, Ernest, Augustus, Sandy, Belboza, Present, Doreen gallo. I'm sorry John Dude! Next! Do we have yes here during gala, she said: she'll join late. What was that Julia Doreen said she'd be late: okay, Brian, Howell, Patrick, Kalacki he'll be late as well. No I'm! Actually here, I'm sorry, I'm here with bad connections. So no video! All right. We hear you Cam Patrick, Sid, Meier, Cyril scala. He said he'd be late and caroline todd are you on she sent an email if you just put in the chat box that she was having trouble Carolyn. Are you on I'm here? Yes, okay, we have a quorum. Thank you John, so I will have a. Is there a motion to approve the agenda for tonight and said? Second, thank you. The first presentation is by captain Adil Rana, the new commanding officer of the 84th precinct. Are you on captain? Is there anyone from the 84th precinct present? Caroline, do you want to do you have the contact information for captain Rana? I made that error did not. I Rob has his contact info his direct contact in for Rob. Can you find out, please thank you. I imagine the Brooklyn bridge forest presentation is going to take some 30 minutes, so I would rather give captain rana the opportunity, if he's going, to be joining within the next minute or two in the meantime, while we prepare for him, I would be happy to share the crime statistics. The comstat reports a little bit out of order, but in preparation for captain Rana's joining up the meeting. Is it possible for me to share my webex if that's othea as host, I'm not sure hi Julia, you have Presenter privileges. Go ahead. Okay, thanks all right. Can everybody see this yep? Okay? This is the 84th precinct comstat report for the week and the month, and we review this every month, usually during the chairs report session, but this time we'll review it while we're waiting for captain Rana. I just wanted to note a couple things. Interestingly, it looked like Grand, Larceny and Petty Larceny are down, and I wonder if captain rana might be able to speak about the fact that those two items may be down, maybe just because people are not going out as much as they used to be and, as we have spoken in previous months, the shooting incidents and shooting victims are up in the in both 84th and 88th precincts. Although the murder rate is the same as last year now going to the 88th precinct, the numbers are quite a bit higher six murders instead of one this year and 19, shooting victims 14 shooting incidents, which is you know about the same percentage jump as the 84th, but quite a bit more in the 88th than the 84th juliet. If I could share in the ADA, do you hear me? Yes, one of those shootings of three teenagers occurred on Myrtle Avenue wow within the business improvement district, and as of my checking today, we do not have that. Particular crime has been solved. It was an evening at about 10 or 10:30, and one of the teenagers is part of the Myrtle Avenue Food delivery program. We sponsor food deliveries for folks in the public housing projects and he was one of the teenagers I was told he was 16 or 17 years old. Wow. That's very sad! Thank you for sharing Jenna Julianne, yes hi, so on Atlantic Avenue. I think it was last week there was a robbery at gunpoint at the times, Plaza Post office and the person at gunpoint took wallets from the customers there and we have not been able to get information on it. So if we could get something tonight, that would be good from the captain sounds good. I spoke too soon about no emergencies coming up too. I should also add that the precincts are being asked to assign some of their officers routinely to pope to barclays because of all of the gatherings that occur there and then the marches that occur afterwards. So in a recent meeting with the 88th Precinct Council, the captain did report that, while he is at full staff, he does not always have his full staff to deploy routinely because some of the offices are assigned to barclays. Okay, I would like to stop sharing my screen now and then we can go back. Rob did were you able to get in contact with captain rana or the 84th? We can't. We can't hear you Rob if you're yeah, as I as I posted in the chat panel, captain Rana, had to respond to a call, and he hopes to have that wrapped up in 10 minutes. Okay, so then we'll proceed to the presentation is Scott. Francisco present. Yes, I'm here representing our team hi there we'd love to hear about Brooklyn bridge forest and, if you'd like to take control of the screen to do a presentation, sure I'd love to so, let's see share content. Just let me know if this is coming through. We see it great well, I want just before we get started. First of all, thank you so much for having us- and I think, there's three or four others of our team in the room here with us. I'll do the majority of the presenting, but we were thinking it was going to take longer than this. So I'm just wondering will the will the captain come towards the end of the meeting, or should we take a pause which would be fine by the way for us if we wanted to do it that way? How long do you think? Your presentation would take I'm hoping to go through the slides in about 10 minutes or so and then, but I think there'll be lots of discussion. That's what we're hoping for. So I would hope so Rob. Do you think that we could push the captain to 6:45? You know what, when it seems like you're wrapping up, I will I will let him know that we're ready for him. Okay, let's see if he joins, we'll play by ear great thanks, guys great yeah, I'm happy to be interrupted and take a break so well. First of all, thanks again for having us- and this is a this- is a presentation that comes from about 10 years of work on a project called the Brooklyn bridge forest. We were thrilled when we heard about the competition that the New York City Council, launched at the beginning of the year, along with Van Allen Institute, and our team rallied to put together an entry for the reimagining Brooklyn bridge competition, which we were delighted to be the winners of announced in early August. So we're going to present that story with an emphasis on our immediate actions that we would like to support the city in moving forward on the Brooklyn bridge, challenge of pedestrian and cyclist congestion on the bridge, as well as some of the public space surrounding the bridge. So our project is really about the bridge as a centerpiece of the city and also a potential icon of global sustainability that connects the history of the bridge and the use of wood on the bridge to force conservation at a global level and also in New York City in terms of public space and micro forests around the bridge. This is all really centered on the promenade and we're going to go back and forth through some of the solutions about the the bike lanes in particular, and our ideas for the promenade space. Our team is a really diverse group of people, some of whom are here with us tonight. Most of us either live in New York or have lived in New York, but we've spent time around the world working on some of these issues, and so we're just. We see this as an opportunity to bring some of that thinking right into the heart of New, York City and use the bridge as a place for experimentation and and action on these issues. The company, the presentation or the concept of the Brooklyn bridge forest is based on really three main concepts. One is public engagement and making decisions for the bridge by engaging communities. Part of what we're doing here tonight. We have a proposal to get bike lanes implemented on the bridge immediately. That was part of our proposal that we could start very quickly with a pilot we're going to talk about that mostly tonight, and then the other is the sustainable sourcing of the wooden planks for the promenade long term from a partner forest in the tropics. Many of you may have some of you may have seen the presentation, so I'm not going to go into the entire history of our proposal. I think that I've, given you sort of the broad brush strokes. We have this phase zero, which is really what can be done immediately on the bridge to solve some of the congestion problems. I'm sure you're. All familiar with what it's like to walk or cycle over the promenade in the Brooklyn bridge- and you know it's been- it's been a bit of a nightmare over the last few years as that traffic has ramped up and, of course, with Covid-19 and all those transformations. It's a whole different set of issues. Our phase, zero approach that we built into our proposal was to in basically in the first year, get a new bike lane implemented on the traffic deck. We called the lower deck of the Brooklyn bridge, along with a series of public space interventions that would come along with that. When we did this presentation, we had we created three timelines, because the bridge is such a historic structure. You have to think of it in long term. History as well as you know, medium term and then, and the short term is really over the next few years, and we put together this phase zero approach, which is again what can be done right away and we're talking about reevaluating the needs DOT has expressed those needs. I know this group has already commented on the urgency of improving the flow of pedestrians and cyclists over the bridge, so we're moving through this process, and I should note that we've had a meeting with Manhattan Community board one wherein they passed a positive resolution in favor of working with this proposal. So breaking this down, we've got a proposal for a public space bike ramp and the Brooklyn anchorage plaza, which we'll talk about. Similarly, on the Manhattan side, resuscitating a an underutilized or unused ramp from the broken bridge that is currently being used by NYPD for parking post, 911 and then creating some green spaces to support those areas on both sides of the bridge that connect a new bike lane on the Manhattan- bound I.E north side of the bridge. On the other lane, and along with this, comes a series of programming ideas like working with youth, creating some spaces in the anchorage for young people to engage with this, both even in the process of the planning and rollout, and also ongoing education and engagement with young people. So just to get really sort of simple and practical. Our phase Zimmer proposal is to implement a bike lane a two- way bike lane on the outer lane of the Manhattan- bound section of the bridge. So if you see this red circle here, this is really like the heart of the phase zero proposal, which is a quick and inexpensive deployment of this bike. Lane you'll see on the top level. We have some grander plans for the reconstruction of the promenade that really respect the history of the bridge, using wood, as it always has been, and actually creating long- term. An additional bike two- way bike lane. That is, a slight expansion of the promenade on the upper deck along with some, what we call lookout spaces which allow for some expansion of the pedestrian area. So that's part of a long- term plan, but our focus right now is to work with D.O.T the community boards and all the stakeholders to get bike traffic moving on the bridge as quickly as possible and on the right hand, of the screen. You'll see under the other red circle, a proposal to have a an additional lane potentially for electric assist vehicles, which we know is a big theme right now in the city. So just looking at the cross section of the bridge, the upper deck is where the promenade has always been historically and the lower deck for a variety of different traffic uses over the years. And what we're proposing is to take a single leg. Is everyone able to hear me? Yes, okay, a single lane of car traffic to dedicate for the first two- way bike lane on the north side and again, potentially on the on the Brooklyn bound side, an electric assist lane. Many people have confronted the fact that there's a question about the loading of the bridge and we recognize that this first proposal of using the lower deck for the for the bike lane does not substantially increase the load in the bridge. One of our team members who's actually present with us tonight, is part of the Silman engineering company, which is one of New York's, prestigious engineering firms and has done a preliminary load calculation. So what we're proposing tonight is something that is doable within the load limits of the bridge from our preliminary research on this just to put it in overall perspective. This is a collapsed view. We're talking about the green line being the bike lane that goes from between Brooklyn and Manhattan. Using these two new ramps, I'm going to zoom out zoom in on this in a second and the yellow dashed line, would be the electric assist lane which would start at center and go all the way to Artillery Street, let's just zoom in for a minute on the two approaches to this bike: lane the Manhattan ramp on the top and the Brooklyn ramp on the bottom, and our proposal is to create really kind of cool and exciting public spaces. That also form the entrance and exits to this new bike lane, and this is what allows the bike lane to be on the outer lane of the northbound section, because getting on and off the bridge is one of the biggest challenges for using that lower deck. So we've come up with some innovative solutions on both sides and we'll zoom in on that a little bit further. So some of you are probably quite familiar with this triangular space, which is currently a kind of staging loading underutilized area right now, some trucks and equipment parked in it we're proposing a spiral ramp that is made of scaffolding. It's a temporary pop- up structure that would be low- cost quick and easy to deploy. That would get likes on this on this lower deck of the bridge very quickly, and within this we would have one of our micro forest concepts. That's part of our overall project with public spaces for gathering social distance gathering, as well as a variety of vendor spaces using the the approach vaults, not necessarily penetrating the stone, the stone wall recess, but just using the recessed portion, which is about three feet deep and tucking. Some temporary vented space in there from the ground level view. This is sort of what it would look like, and this ramp again starting connecting to some of the bike lanes coming down off. Cadman Plaza allows cyclists to ride up onto the deck of the bridge more technical drawings here, and we have you know really nice plans for the ecological and biodiversity aspect of the space and leaning on the work of wildlife, conservation, Society and Eric sanderson from The Mannahatta Project, bringing back some of the biodiversity from this area and making that part of the public space while supporting the cycling infrastructure just to go over to the Manhattan side. Briefly, some of you may be aware that there is a ramp, the ramp that used to go to. Maybe you remember, using it to park row which has been blocked off since 9:11 and used by NYPD our proposal for parking currently, so no access to cars right now or trucks, we're proposing to resuscitate that and use that as the on and off ramp on the Manhattan side, it's a very wide ramp. It's 24 feet wide, which means that not only a bike lane can be placed there, but it can be created. It can be turned into a kind of plaza space for cycling infrastructure like a CitiBike dock, a small cafe and other amenities for cyclists to use and really celebrate this low carbon transportation. Here's a here zooming in on the aerial view of that you can see the bike lane with plenty of space left over for other cycling, related infrastructure on that ramp. Here's what it would look like from the level view from the promenade, so this Jersey barrier, which currently is blocking the ramp off, would be shifted over and giving cyclists full access, and here is looking up that ramp with the idea of a pop- up cafe for bike bicycles and cyclists, coming up from the Manhattan side and again, here's the current is the current situation, NYPD using it for parking, and our proposal was to turn this into the on- ramp for the bridge. So really that's the core of our bike. Lane proposal that was part of our winning competition entry backing this up is this idea of micro force and we want to interweave this into our project wherever we can, which is these small biodiverse forest clusters that have proven that they can be done in cities and done well and bring back biodiversity and plant life and create welcoming spaces for for people in the heart of the city, and so we have a few ideas of where these would be deployed on both the Brooklyn and the Manhattan side in Manhattan adjacent to the approaches. We've got a few areas that, including at the Smith houses, NYCHA Smith houses, as well as adjacent to these vaults that we're hoping to resuscitate in longer term and just quickly the idea of a of a space for young people, making a really cool, engaging clubhouse kind of space. That would take this approach. Vault. Sorry. This is the anchorage vault and turned it into a welcoming space. This is right, adjacent to the NYCHA housing and we think a really awesome place for young people to get together, learn about science, history, technology and engaging issues that local mentors from New York can work with these kids on, hopefully including us. Maybe just one more thing about public engagement. We were the one finalist entry that really saw the decision- making process in terms of traffic and dedication of different traffic and transportation. Types is something that needed to be done through community engagement, and this sketch is just to show that we still intend to work through that, and we know that the removal of a car lane a traffic lane is something that can be contentious, and so, within the competition we were the we were the entry that really held back and said. We want to make sure that this is done in consultation, so that folks, you know, there's many people, hundreds of thousands of people that drive cars acrosss the Brooklyn bridge. We recognize that, but we also recognize that the changing dynamics of transportation and energy are really forcing us to look at these issues, and we see that Brooklyn bridge is a great place to sort of play that out with the right engagement of stakeholders so and maybe I'm just going to stop there. I'm sure there are lots of questions and there's much more to talk about, but take a deep breath and we can start the conversation and I can show more images as they become useful to answer questions. Thank you Scott. It is a very creative, fresh and hopefully viable proposal. As you know, our community board supports the change of one of the roadway beds to a bike lane in the near term, and it's nice that your proposal has that and so much more so I'd like to open up the questions to committee members. First, please actually julia. If I may, I realize there's one important thing. I forgot to say which might be a question, and that is how does this get paid for? I should say that our proposal is based on a zero- cost solution to the city. So we're basing this phase in our proposal on external funding so that the city would not have to pay anything for this, and we have received interest from sponsors for the project, nothing of course firmed up. Yet, but that's our intention, I should just say that even better great thanks, I just need to clarify sponsors, do not mean bridge tolls to any extent does it. No. This would be essentially corporate underwriting of the project and our budget for the for the phase. Zero components that I've shown is about is quite low and it's 2.5 million, and that's for the two Ramp conversion spaces and the connecting bike lane and we've purposely designed it to be very modest in its origin, initial scope, so that it could be done quickly and affordably John. Do you have further questions? Oh sure, at some point there were trains that rode over the Brooklyn bridge. Is that space that the trains occupied vacant or has it been occupied taken up by some other service over the bridge to run the runway in the 1950s yeah? I do not know how visible this light is, but you can see the historic transformation of the bridge from when it was first built in 1883 whether you have horses and carriages and then the trains came on in the in around the turn of the century. Well, there was actually a trolley car. I took a cable car when it was first built, then they added additional training cars up until the 40s, and then it got converted all to car and truckees. Well, no truck you car you, I guess, there's a there's a crap! There's a truck size limit right, yeah! No, they removed the truck. There were no trucks and when they did the change in the 50s, they removed the well. They did not allow trucks at all, even like a Van truck Cube Fan. Well, that's not! No, not even no commercial traffic. No commercial traffic is permitted over here and it's been that way since 1957., if you know they occasionally drive over illegally or the post or the or the police department sends over it, but no from its no commercial traffic is permitted at all period. I guess I violated that a few times with a pickup truck, so I guess there's, but so anything larger than a pickup truck would be immediately sort of flagged as potentially commercial. I guess! Well, even you know they. You know, there's no commercial truck allowed in the Fdr same rule and the police do patrol that. So, even if you have a commercial pickup truck, you know there's a good chance of getting stopped. They really do actually great. Well, thank you for that Clarification John. Did you have any other questions? Can you provide the traffic and bike statistics by hour that are currently using the bridge? Do you have that kind of information? Oh, we do not at our fingertips, but I'm sure it's available from DOT. I do not know if they've been doing over through Covid-19 analysis and we understand there's a bit of a rebound that comes now with car traffic, which you know had has gone up and down. So I do not know what the latest statistics are right now, but you can get that and give it if D.O.T has it and give it to the community. Board. Yes, and I should say that the goal in a way the goal of this presentation is to is to further a relationship with DOT and sort of create a platform for working with DOT, who has supported the concept generally by saying that they, before a cable study, is being done. They do not support the expansion of the promenade and therefore they do support the conversion of a traffic lane to a bike lane so they're kind of already on board with the basics. But the particulars have not been worked out yet Sid did you have any comments? Juliet, I have a question, so you know you're doing two- way a two- way bike race. You know, that's still going to be fairly crowded for bikes. Why are you considering the two- way, the lane, the the lane of crap the traffic having a one- way? You know one eastbound lane for bikes and a separate westbound. You know in the and I understand the issue of the elected of the electric bikes and the rebels and stuff, but you know the why you know it would seem to me that if you're going to make it safer, as we know, one way, traffic each way is safer than two- way traffic since a small area. It's a great question, very good question and an important one for us and there's several different ideas at play here. One idea is that the entrance and exit conditions that the north and southbound portions or sorry the north and south sides of the bridge would require are quite distinct from each other, so we're trying to keep the bike traffic clustered to concentrate the activity and the benefits for those entrants and exits, make it easier for bikes to basically manage the exit and entrance from either side. That's one thing, the other is that we're not sure that doing both lanes at once is feasible for a number of reasons, so we'd like to be able to have a fully operational system with even one lane deployed and see the second one is more of an expansion. Maybe it's a phase 0.5 or something like that, and the other is that the investment in the infrastructure for having getting on and off the bridge, I'm going to go back to this slide here. For a second sorry, forgive me, let me just myself so these things are interlinked. These two ramp plazas that we're proposing are part of the self- funding strategy, I.e they create a kind of a charismatic space. That is not only going to be great for bicycles, but it creates something interesting for a sponsor to get behind. So basically these kind of parts of the project you could say, because they've got something nice to show just putting a bike lane on the Manhattan- bound side of the bridge on the inner lane does not really give you that it's sort of a it's a fairly canal, potentially practical solution, but it has its own. It has its own challenges as well. I'm just going to go back one slide, so it requires that it requires the bike to be on the inner lane of the bridge because of the exit and entering requirements, whereas this one both opens up to and requires in fact the bikes to be on the outer lane of the bridge, which is a more pleasant experience, because you're actually out there and with the view and not sort of surrounded by the cars, and it's all about how you're getting on and off the bridge. At this point, so they're actually two fairly different solutions and we think that they can work in synergy with each other. But your pictures actually show that in case they're on the outer one, you may be describing them differently, but the what they're, both the on the north side, it's the north, it's the north most lane on the south side, it's the south. Mostly. I do not know why you're describing those are the outer legs they're, not they're, the outer part of the bridge. It's not the inner form. Let me let me go to that. It's it's! Actually! That's the sorry! Just get back to that picture here so here you can see it. It's the oh on that lane yeah on that lane. You see what I'm saying. So this is looking. Why would not you do the okay outer lane is looking towards Brooklyn just to be clear. So on the north side, it's the outer lane on the south side, it's the inner lane and the reason is getting on and off so to get onto the outer lane. You have to have an access point that supersedes all of the entrance ramps and it becomes quite complicated, but it's doable and if we look at the bigger bigger section here, let's see if I can Ryan I understand, but I also point out that picture has a busted which is a lot of the bridge right. Yes, thank you Juliet. I think you can see. I think you can see it in this picture here is that the inner lane is comes all the way out and basically takes you to tillery, because you can't cross over and bike onto the exit ramps and likewise, as you enter you're entering off center and you're staying you're hugging the inside all the way acrosss. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, cyril yeah. I had a question Scott. This is a terrific proposal. It's really exciting, and I congratulate you on your effort. I there's a slide there, where you show an area on the platform of the bridge where there's a CitiBike area and maybe a commercial use and a little stopover. Can you bring that up again, yeah almost there? Well, here you can see, you can see it from the aerial view here and then yeah, you guys the container with all the biodiversity plantings that you're doing. I you mentioned some about a commercial location. Would you consider just letting that be a sort of a spot where people could stop and just be quiet and calm with some plantings and no commercial use at all where they could just have a spot, a place where they could sort of contemplate and relax while they're on their journey and not have anything commercial leave the commercial out and put your plantings and things like that? Would that be a consideration? Absolutely? Actually this rendering really deserves to have some of that biodiversity in it, and I think we just did not get it in at the last minute in the competition, but you can see in the distance just behind it's this there's the vestige of one of the other micro forests, we're showing up here on the top of the housing, but we should see in the foreground here some of that planting. What I will say about the commercial piece is our vision, for this would be something very specifically tailored to cyclists and a very kind of modest tailor- made commercial adventure and maybe even a co- op run by cyclists. So it's not to be something attracting people up there for anything other than serving maybe coffee and water to cyclists. So it's a very special it's a very special idea of serving the cycling community, but it's, but by no means is it essential and we're not relying on revenue from that at all. That's what I was getting at. I think, if you, if it seems to be your mission to include biodiversity plus human activity, I would just it's just a suggestion. I'm far apart for me to make a suggestion on this creative proposal, but I just like to keep the commercial out off and let them let people just enjoy the view and if they want to stop and relax, that's a good thing, a bench or two, but leave the commercial because that brings food that brings trash. That brings other issues also. So that was just my point. Otherwise it's a terrific proposal. Thank you very much. It's a great suggestion and we definitely will think about that. That's a that's the kind of thing that we want to have a community voice to really decide whether that's the right solution or not. I do not see anybody else's hand raised. So I'm going to ask a question about the landmarks of this. We had always back henry, oh yeah. How do you do this? Okay, after the landmarks question I will get to you sandy then, have you had any conversations with LPC about potential landmarks implications? We had been told, can't paint anything green. You can't paint green bike lanes on the Brooklyn bridge. You can even put a barrier in between the bike lane and the pedestrian lane on the Brooklyn bridge. You can only put some lean, demarcators, okay, so explored it's a great question julia and there was a landmarks representative on the jury for the competition who we understand from her directly was one of the greatest supporters of our proposal, but that does not mean that that's going to be a green light from landmarks, so we absolutely have to explore the real ramifications and we have not done that officially. Yet we have we've taken a very conservat conservation- oriented view to the to the promenade, but at the same time, with the suggestion of expanding it under the kind of mandate of the competition, I should say that our original premise for Brooklyn bridge forest was not to expand. The promenade at all was to work with the existing width and just use the forest as a sponsorship for the planks of the promenade, which is the 16 foot wide promenade as it stands now. So, if the bike lane on the lower deck is successful, we could imagine that there is no bike lane on the upper deck on the promenade level, and that would basically take us back to our very original proposal where the pedestrian promenade is just for pedestrians up there and then the landmarks issue would essentially go away because the promenade would not be affected. I think if the city, if there's a, if there's a strong mandate from the city, to incorporate bicycles on the promenade which, by the way, were not part of the original bridge design, when the bridge was originally designed, there were stairs on the promenade and there was no bicycles and the bicycles were acted in that. I believe it was in the 70s when the promenade was ramped. And so you could. You could say that it was never imagined that there were. It was never intended that there would be bicycles up there. So solving the bicycle issue successfully on the lower deck could mean that promenade returns to pedestrian only and that's essentially, what we're also doing in our in our solution, because we've got we've offset the the bike lane on the upper level. But we do have this. We do have this really strong feeling that bicycles up on the promenade are wonderful in the sense that they enjoy that experience in a very special way and if you're, at a bicycle on a lower deck amongst the car traffic, it's not the same experience and if New York wants to sort of fully embrace bicycles. You know in that, in this type of experience, there's really no other way to do it than to have them up on the top. So we see one vision as the long term. You have both a lower deck bike lane and an upper deck bike lane the upper deck would serve folks who want to have more of a you know, enjoyable view filled air filled ride, maybe you're taking your time and the lower deck is more for people that are really their commuters are trying to get from point a to b as quickly as possible. So these are some of the options that we have in mind sounds good. Thank you, Scott, Sandy! Okay, can you hear me? Yes? So maybe you said this, but my question is about mopeds and the bicycles that have motors that the delivery people use a lot, but would they be going on the road with the traffic or with the bikers on the bike lane? I'm so glad you asked it sandy and because it gives me a chance to say again that our concept is that we've got a separate, dedicated lane for those there's innovative electrically powered vehicles. So let me say a few more words about this. The transportation landscape is changing quickly and we're seeing hybrids of all kinds that are being introduced, that we do not know yet how to deal with. You know: we've got scooters and bicycles. Some of those bicycles seem like a normal bicycle. Some of them are almost like a motorcycle and everything in between we we've got and every year from now into the future, we're going to have new vehicle precedence. We want the we see the Brooklyn bridge as a platform for innovation on this kind of issue, and we do not want to hardwire it right now to serve a very particular understanding of vehicles. That may be quite different in 10 years time, let alone in five years, let alone right now, because we're still trying to catch up with what's happening. So that's why we would like to reserve this lane over here for sort of the innovation lane for the time being, for for open electrically powered hybrids, and possibly this eventually, you might expand that to two lanes. We do not really know, but that would mean that no electrically powered principles would be officially allowed on this other lane. Perhaps there's a great area there, I'm not sure exactly where you draw the line. Is that helpful? Well, I you know I live on Atlantic Avenue. We have wide sidewalks and it's now it used to be just the delivery people on the electric bikes and for before that bicycles, using the sidewalk and now maybe it has something to do with Covid-19, because we're getting a lot of mopeds riding on the sidewalk. So there does not seem to be enforcement. I do not see it and pedestrians are supposed to get out of the way it just it's very aggressive, and so, if you know, I think you have to have some sort of plan about this, because it's like the wild, West yeah and it's dangerous and that's the problem with the way the bike lane the promenade. Now you have pedestrians and bikers in conflict, so you're trying to separate them, and I just want to say in the 70s before the ramps I used to carry my bike up the steps trying to get over the bridge and then the ramps came. So that's great, it's nice to hear the confirmation of that of that history and that change from someone who's used it. Yes, because I'm 75 today, that's right! Congratulations! Now! Yes, some cake! I'm going to go, I'm going to bring it out and show it to you later. Okay, this is cheryl and then and they're going to take caroline todd after cheryl, instead of her coffee shop. What about a bicycle repair, a mini bicycle repair shop, because you are some place that you can get air or get fixed or something instead of a coffee shop? Actually cheryl, that's exactly what we were envisioning here. You can see. This is a repair shop in the end of this container. So oh great yeah, I mean that was really. We thought about bike storage as well, possibly so we're kind of we want to think. We would only do this in conjunction with the cycling community and really understand what would be their priorities. So again, it's definitely not a commercial venture for the fake for the sake of making money, it's only there to serve that community. I think a repair shop for light repairs would be fantastic and they could even work with, say, recycle a bicycle or one of the local organizations to do you know you could drop your bike off and have it. You know picked up in a few days. There's different ways: you could use it, but we would like to be really creative about that. Thank you for bringing that up. It's a great idea. Thank you. Caroline! Well, great thanks. There are a lot of things about this project. I really like. Obviously, the number one goal is to provide more space for people walking and bicycling acrosss the bridge, and this definitely does that. So thank you. My question with this kind of motivated toward equity and the planet is if this private, 2.5 plus million dollars, is financed from banks that also finance you know fossil fuels and other destructive things. Will you take it think about public money? That's a great question and we have not got there yet, but that's a good time to ask the question and it won't certainly be our decision solely. It would be a decision that would be made in a lot of consultation with other stakeholders. But what has happened so far is that the interest that's been expressed has mostly come from new from local developers. Our goal would be to have a partner in this not to someone to give us some money. It would be a partner who believes in this in the city and wants the space to be successful. The way we framed it so far is there would be very minimal branding presence and obviously that's going to be one of the kind of exchange value components right and we do not. I mean here's the CitiBike right there, I I'm reluctant to say we do not want it to be like CitiBike. Citibike is a great infrastructure, but we want it to be subtle and we want to be meaningful. So we're looking for someone who who's will, who has that kind of funding available, but really has the vision for the project, and it would be very. It would be very hypocritical if we, you know Brooklyn, bridge forest, which is all about conserving the rain forest which we're all dependent on in this world and have someone who's out there cutting them down. So I mean we there's definitely boundaries that we're going to have to put up before we consider funding from anyone thanks Scott, so we have John quint, the last community board member who is going to speak, and then we have three members of the community who are going to speak. Captain Rana is going to join in about five minutes. So let's try to keep the questions and responses concise. Please go ahead. John Thanks, Juliet, I'm not a biker, I'm a walker and pre- pandemic. I walk over the bridge back and forth every day to work and therefore have to contend with the bicyclists. Have you had any discussions with transportation alternatives about how they feel about this quickly? One way yes or no? Have they weighed in? Yes, they were. They were on the jury that awarded us the prize. So and I have you know we have a history of working with them, but we have not done the deep dive with them on this. You know the nuances yet so that would be one of the important groups to work with, in terms of say, the ramp design, even things that we're looking at in this image and not that walkers are not expedient. You looking for expediency, but bikers who use the bridge for commuting, are looking for expediency and entering on park row and exiting artillery is a straight shot. You're now forcing bikers on in Manhattan to go below the bridge and then to come up a steep ramp and you're forcing bikers who are entering in Brooklyn, who would be at Hillary and Adams to now. I do not know how they would get there. Would they go up to cadmium, plaza, west down cadmium, plaza west of the triangle? Having then taken all the elevation out and then having to reverse the elevation by climbing up your spiral ramp onto the bridge, I'm sure the gradient would be good, but they will have already extended all the downward energy and then have to reverse it and on the converse side, on the on the Manhattan side, they're going to come down to well below the level of park, row and city hall and they're going to have to divert from there and I'm not sure, I've never biked down there. So I do not know how they will get down to the park row entrance. But just looking at that, there's no easy access. They can't go through police headquarters and they can't go around the municipal bridge. So have you considered the how you're going to get bikers to not simply join the pedestrians anyway? Well in terms of that part of it that once a bike lane has been, if there's only the bike lane on the lower deck pre upper deck bike lane, there would be no bikes allowed on the promenade, but that that's the rule. But how do you enforce it and how do you and because you're give the Pedestrian walkway is an invitation to take the easy way and not to because bikes do not care about pedestrians they're in the pecking order. Bikes are the alpha person. They do not want to be next to cars, because cars are the alpha person, but when you now give them the choice of fighting with pedestrians and putting up with them versus making those long to my mind, long detours down cabin Plaza west and then up from whatever that street is down there, Frankfurt or whatever the street that the bike lane ends on. How do you? How do you invite them to do that? John, there's a there's, a longer answer that I do not know whether we have time for, but we have studied the connections and there's there are some compromises, but there's also some benefits, so it will shift the overall pattern of cycling for bridge users right now. We have it in our mind that tillery and center are sort of the entry points, but we're going to be shifting that there are. There are bike lanes that have just opened up down here. I will just ask that you take John Quinn's suggestions. As you know, a pedestrian and a you know, member of the community and then like, follow up on that. That's great okay! Thank you. I'm going to ask Monica Greco who's, the first community member who raised their hand, Monica hi, thanks Juliette, and thanks Scott, for this really exciting presentation. I just had two quick questions. One is a follow- up from John's, which is about whether there'll be other like disincentives for bikers to come onto the pedestrian path, because often some of the bike tours will go wherever the view is frankly, and I think those are some of the most dangerous bikers on the bridge. But my second question was about the participatory model that you mentioned in your presentation. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that and what community engagement will look like both in this first term and in the in the mid to long term great question so just really quickly. On the on the disincentives, I mean in the depending on how the phasing rolls out, but in the time period, where there's a lower bike lane and no upper bike lane enforcement on the promenade would be, in my mind, relatively straightforward, because there's sort of an absolute no bike riding on the bridge that becomes then a police sort of a policing issue, both self- policing, as well as something more formal and I can think of a variety of strategies, technologies and so forth. To help with that to jump to Community Engagement Pilot project. Our company has done a lot of work with what we call the sandbox method, which is getting stakeholders sort of around the table and designing things together. We have not actually formally created the first sandbox meeting yet so we've our ideas are to work with groups in the in the in the NYCHA area around here for the Micro Forest to work with the transportation groups and getting you know, the right stakeholders, obviously there's a number of institutions and organizations that we want to bring to the table like transportation, alternatives and a number of others. We call it co- design the idea that we're not coming with a fully formed solution, we're coming with ideas that need to be worked through that kind of negotiation, so to some degree that answers John's last question is like is this: is this the right solution? We can't say that it is for sure, but we think it's a good place to start, and once we have those folks around the table, we'll quickly get a good idea of whether it is or not. But if you, if you want to know more about our process, called the sandbox you can you can google it there's a video about our process and what it looks like in some of the projects in New York City that we've done in the lower East side, so that will be will be hands- on and it will be fun and it will be taken seriously by us and then you know, we hope by the entire approval process and this process, where you're reaching out to community board two and Manhattan community board. One is appreciated as well. Thank you. That's a critical part of all of this great Eric Walter you're. Next, thank you Julia and thank you John. Can you guys hear me? Yes, okay, my question has to do with Caroline's a question from earlier about funding. Can you share any information with the community board about who these potential sponsors are or what that process looks like? I can't share much because there is not a lot of specifics to share yet other than outreach that we've just started feelers with you know, friends in the in the community, basically who work in different sectors who have said you know I'm working with this company that you know they're really interested in what you're doing the real estate angle has come up a few times, so I I'm not avoiding the question, but there really is not much to say other than what we've heard is. This is not a lot of money, even despite this rough economic times, there's companies that are in New York for the long haul that could actually come up with these kinds of funds who would believe in a project enough not to demand too high a degree of kind of brand presence. So there's been about four or five developers that have been named. We have not even reached out to them yet they're being sort of, I won't even say, quoted yet they're, just being maybe gently introduced to the idea, and I think it's going to be a learning process, you know we may find that it's a lot harder than we think. On the other hand, if, in fact, we can do this for less than three million dollars with this kind of impact, that's totally doable. At the end of this presentation, I had a bunch of slides under precedence and the precedence of the of the New York City kind of art. Projects like the falls and discovering Columbus were quite important to us to think about how New York City has done this in the past water on the go a program that we really loved and worked with dion years ago. You know you would have all been. You know, I'm sure, seen the falls when they were up, and you know this is done. It's there's a way to pay for it and it has an impact. What we're doing is actually something that has a much greater impact for people in terms of you know real impact in their lives than these art projects, which were much more expensive, so Scott I want to thank you. Captain Rana has joined our meeting. I know we had another member of the community who had a question alec. Perhaps you would not mind emailing your question to the Community board and then Scott could get back to you individually. Would that be? Okay? That's fine with me. Thanks yeah I'd love to take questions and feel free to share my email address and I'll circulate it to our team, and we will maintain contact with you all and help to work with you further. Thank you, Juliet. At the end of the meeting, we'll do a motion to support your presentation, that's great Juliet and the questions that are going to be answered. If the company can also answer the disruption on current traffic, be it bike, car or pedestrian on the bridge and the length of time it is anticipated for this project to be completed and whether it is a bike surface that minimizes speeding, that's it. So if you could get back to Us Scott and those answers will be distributed to our committee members. Would you like me to stay on until we go through the resolution phase or it will be a while? So we do not have to do that. Okay, then we will stay tuned and look forward to getting those questions and providing as much feedback as we can for the community board. A very nice presentation. Thank you very much Scott. Thank you all good night, good night, good night, captain Rana. We welcome you and congratulate you there you go. Thank you. Thank you, Julia and thank you all the members that are present. Thank you for accommodating us. We know things come up last minute and we are happy to hear you speak about your goals for the 84th precinct and we would be happy to share with you our thoughts as well. No, definitely again, I apologize you know. I should have been here with six o'clock, but at the same time we had a 911 call the man with a firearm. So that's why we had to run out yeah. No definitely you know it's great to be in this neighborhood, it's a very unique and diverse area, whether it's residential business or whether it's the people that live or live or even work or even pass through here. So it's a great place and of course you know such an important location comes with a lot of difficulties, a lot of challenges and a lot of demands. You know whether it's the crime area, whether it's quality of life or whether it's just you know a day- to- day, issues that we might encounter, but I'm glad that you know we have partners such as yourselves and other in this community that are willing to help each other and help us serve every single one of you guys. So I'm really glad and happy to be in this precinct in this neighborhood and I'm looking forward to working with every single one of you guys. You know, I always say you know I'd be lying. If I say I'm going to solve all the problems, but I'm telling you one thing: whatever comes up, we look at more than 100 and make sure that we can assist and be there for every single person. We really appreciate you taking the time to come, meet us and come talk to us, and we have spoken to some of the NCO officers have come out to the Community Board meetings. I guess I'll just start with you know. Our primary concern with public safety is the gun, violence that has increased throughout the city and understandably, the related gang activity that that leads to that violence. So maybe, as a startup could you let us know, what's being done and yeah I mean I'll, be honest with you. Maybe it was my bad luck or maybe whatever you want to call it, but as soon as I got assigned him, we took four shootings in Farragut and I'm pretty sure it would have been more. But thank God knock on wood. It was not the way the shots fires were being coming over and we were dealing with the situations, but we took four. Obviously we were used to it this in this neighborhood, but just Farragut alone. I have at least four to six officers, 24:7 patrolling that area and the hot spot locations. You know and doing you know, visits to each building to make sure that you know we do not have any crew members or gang members with a firearm, or you know just lingering around looking for their target because there's a lot of gang on gang or crew and crew, I should call it violence and some of it comes from other part of the city and some is just internal, but we did have an individual that got shot he's from Farragut, but he got shot in somewhat of bed- stuy Fort, Green area. You know he did die, you know should I say you know that it reduced some type of violence in the area because of it or at the same time we are looking at retails, where more individuals are trying to come into this neighborhood to take their revenge for his killing. So you know, but the challenge is every day: that's what we have so many officers dedicated just into those hot spots when it comes to you know the gun, violence. You know, that's why some areas you know. Obviously we get complaints about seeing less officers in other areas. You know you will see that if there's more is concentrated on violence and then you know to that does not mean they're not out there. They're not answering the 911 calls, but it's just you probably won't see as many, because we are concentrating at this time on the violence rather than anything else, but thank God. You know those were it and we had. You know I want to put a band- aid or you know whatever you want to use it, but you know we're looking at hoping that there are no more shootings, at least for the rest of the year because of the deployment that we have. Thank you do you have. We had heard in the past that, because our community district houses, the court systems that sort of attracts rival members, do you have any theories about the increase in gun violence. Well, in regards to that, you know, I do not know. I should not use these words, but I think we're because of Covid-19 we've been lucky because courts are closed, so we do not deal with any in- person. You know like people coming in for cases because what used to happen, the biggest issue was the morning time, court and court being right next to a shopping district. That would, you know, bring more people and have them linger around for a longer period and what happens is when you go to court. You know you're going to get checked, for you know, weapons or other things. So people come without weapons. So now the rivalry begins. They know that you have a court date at what time it's open source information or whether they know through other crew members. So now the time they can confront these individuals. So this is why we had some issues with the shootings near courts and the Fulton Shopping District, and at the same time you know we, since I remember when these things were happening. When we increased our manpower and patrol in around the court area, we were able to get you know, individuals with firearm or find locations where they were hiding the firearm before they go into court. So you know at the same time, when I'm mentioning that you know that's, why it's very important that we get the input and that's why it's very important that we get the cooperation from the community members and people like yourselves, that if you see something you know, let us know, because we can't be everywhere at any. You know at all the time, but if you see something suspicious, you know we'll definitely investigate it. I'll give you an example. Like I mentioned before, we recovered a few firearms, because the community members saw somebody, you know stashing it by a vehicle by the tire or in a construction area. Underneath the cone you know or something like that, we would have. Never. You know we're not going to go inspect the cones. You know until someone tells you know, so we were able to find firearms like that and perfect example. Today, the one that you know I had to run out to there was another passerby. He saw somebody near the court, something that looked like a firearm being stashed into on top of a tire or a vehicle. You know so again. If we do not get a cooperation from the community, you know we can't pretty much. We can't do our job to full satisfaction. That's why I say it's very important to have the community and police working together in every angle. You know because obviously, there's going to be issues, disagreements or whatever that's what we hear and have an open hylo to work together and come up with solutions to you know serve every single person. Thank you. Captain! I'm going to open it up to my fellow committee members to speak with you and then afterwards I would be happy if you would hear our district needs relating to public safety. That would be great. Okay, thanks committee members. Well, if there's anybody that would like to specialize yeah, so hi captain rayna how you doing I've been getting your holiday information about what each holiday means over the year or so that's nice. Thank you. I have a question about an incident on Atlantic Avenue. I think it was last week the times Plaza Post office at between third and fourth, there was a robbery. It was at gunpoint. The person took wallets from the customers in the post office and I wondered if you had any information on that, because we did not really get any yeah. You know I was it was shocking and then I do not know I mean I who walks into a post office. You know I usually hear that in the bank. So what happened I'll give you? The breakdown, was the person walks up to the teller and demands? With a note saying I got a gun. Give me your money and you know the banks are trained to just hand over the money. Do not talk to them, nothing, the post office. Guys, are you kidding me and he walks away from him like get the hell out of here. So of course you know the guy is like what the hell just have. Oh, I should not say guy because we do not know if it was a he or she you know. So we do not know if it was a male or female, but at that you know, because it was it had a rig on and all that stuff. So but anyway, so, while walking out, he sees somebody with a wallet or a phone or you know, obviously with the phone. So he comes back said. Oh give me, I'm going to shoot. You give me your wallet and give me that phone also. So, of course we tried, I mean, and he walks out immediately. We tried to track the phone, but we were not excessive and unsuccessful, because the person that owned the phone was not able to log on to his find my iphone, and so we were not able to track it down right away, but within minutes this is how quick people travel within minutes. The same person was using the credit card on Pennsylvania Avenue and Atlanta Cam or at a grocery store. So you know we obviously have a video. We have the pictures of the person there is. They are working on the case trying to get a better video and better picture from the grocery store. The postal off the police is working with our detectives to make sure that we get this person apprehended immediately as soon as we can, but other than that I mean no one was hurt, thankfully, but this is how it actually went down. Thanks captain other committee members, I mean, while somebody's, if buddy somebody's thinking of any questions about I'll just mention the other thing I see rise in this neighborhood is package tests that you know people are leaving in their, whether it's in the lobby or in front of their houses. Just if you know, if we can have everyone come up with a system, you know either a location where you can put in the building which is secure or have it delivered when someone is home or have it delivered to somewhere, where somebody is there, because a lot of time, these individuals they do, is they drive a walk around and they see they'll just peek the head in through the windows. If they see a package or something what they'll do is they'll break the door and enter that location, that's how you know they're stealing, there were times that they just got vitamins out of it, but we were taking. You know, burglary because it was by you know they took it by breaking into a location illegally. So you know it's best to protect. I know we all, especially with Covid-19. You know everything is by mail. You know we all do our shopping by mail, so you know that's just something to think about. That's, what's you know really driving our crime in the last 28 day period is the burglaries and most of them are either. You know a storage area where the bikes were stolen or the packages when someone broke into the building, the other one that I saw the issue that I'm looking at is you know car cat. You know the car test and it's all not because there's people out there looking for you know like a back in old days. You know they would jimmy their cars. You know in the car and leave. This is more. You know, because of us, we're being lazy. You know I probably guilty over myself, but I try to educate myself every day, not to do it, but you know we want to run into the store because we do not want to turn the car or for ac purpose. So now the winter is coming because of the heat purpose and within seconds I've seen some surveillance cameras the person as soon as they walk into the store, the car is gone, and I we've seen so many of those cars, and you know just for this precinct alone for car theft. We have 37 for the year and within the last 28 day period we have seven. So it can tell you that how many you know is growing. This car theft is a big issue. Julia. I have a question. Yes, Sir go ahead, thank you for coming. Captain reyna, it's great to see you coming to our meeting. You come more often you're very welcome to come. I was hoping we can do this in person, but hopefully soon we'll get rid of this Kobe thing and then we'll be done, and I just what I'm saying that is also all of you are more than welcome to. If you are comfortable, you know my door's always open. If you have any issues or something like that, I know Robert Paris is great. You know we have a great relationship, but you guys are also welcome. You know to stop by the priest, and my office door is open for you guys. I want to just sit at cheryl because she's being quiet, cheryl, gelbs, the co- chair of the committee, is on the 84th Precinct Council correct. I just wanted to commend to two of your officers hunt and Detective Condon, who have been great representatives of the police department and they become actually friends in the community. So if that, if that happens all over, I think it'd be a great advantage for the community and the police. Those are two of my best guys and you know, like you said, I give their examples to a lot of other officers and a lot of other NCO officers. You know because they're not only about fighting crime but they're also about connecting they're, also about solving issues. You know whether it's a small issue or not and I'll just give you a head. You know like a little just earlier today. You know because we also having issues about bikes that are being stolen. You know some of them when we do not, we do not see it because it's like very you know it's a couple hundred dollar bike, so you know some people might not report it or it's not tracked as a felony, but we do have a lot that are very expensive by two thousand three thousand five thousand dollar bike, but we just did an operation and continent hunt was the part of that operation. We set up a statement to see if we could catch somebody, you know unclipping a bike or stealing it. So these guys are always you know. Thinking about you know, ways to make sure that all of you guys are safe. So these are one of the best officers to thank you. Okay, Patrick go Ahead, Captain's, very nice to meet you over the camera thanks for joining us. So I have two questions, one I'll preface by repeating what zero said. Condon and Hunter are excellent and and kind of the long lines. What you just said, they're very curious, interested detail- oriented. You know they reach out. It's great is there so the first question is: what are the budget prospects for that program is that is that is that still? Is there any talk of not continuing that as if there's any cuts made due to the fiscal issues? As far as I know, NCO is like one of the the model that the department is still pushing. You know we want to make sure we have officers just like connor and hunt. That's why it's not everybody's, not a NCO person. You know like that's why you have these people. You know for different sectors that are hand- picked, so we can make sure that they are well- rounded. They know how to fight crime, they know how to connect with people. They know how to you know, be social workers and police officers at the same time. So as of right now, I have not heard any cuts to that program or eliminating that program. I think, if anything, you know some I'll be honest with you. A lot of people have come up and said: oh, why can't we have more NCOS? You know the issue is having more NCOS will mean same thing as patrol you'll. Have so many people concentrated, so you won't have that one- on- one touch anymore, so these individuals are there to have that one- on- one touch with every single person in that sector. So that's why you'll only see those two people in the sector- yeah I mean they always can bring in other other colleagues, which is great too. So the second question is without getting into you know the debate on it. The discussion around funding changes and other protests have, I would imagine I I'm certain- have affected your deployment and your in your training and your communications and team management and I'm just curious to understand specific ways that you can share that you have managed through that environment of the last several months. Yeah I mean it definitely brings a big toll and a challenge, especially when you know it comes to like quality of life issues or our minor issues. You know because when you mention deployment, when you know we only have limited resources, we want to make sure we concentrate those resources towards violence or felony crimes. Where you know people's lives are in danger. You know that does not mean we're looking away from anything else, but it just might be the release. The resources might not be there to. You know fully address it immediately. It might take some time, so it is challenging. You know obviously downtown Brooklyn being downtown Brooklyn, the hot spot for everything we have the Brooklyn bridge. We have the Mahan bridge. We got the cabinet Plaza park, we got. You know borough hall, where we have the blm mural. We have Columbus statue, you know every day we have some type of pop- up protest, not to mention you know the teachers. Now we had the board of Education ev. You know a couple of days a week. You know during the weeks people the teachers were coming here, then you had the landlord and tenant court. You know people were protesting in front of that because of the tenant the different, I guess the policies because of cover they were changing due to rent control. So there's a lot of stuff happening in this area and you know to manage that it is challenging, but you know we are doing it and you know we that's why a lot of people say. Oh, we do not see officers all the time you know they're there. You know we're making sure that you know we respond to every single request. You know whether it's a three one or nine on one call. You know so deployment is affected, but we are trying to manage it as much as possible. You know a lot of time. We get outside help when it comes to large protests or demos. So you know that is very helpful, but you know just to mention you know we have to keep extra officers, let's say by the Columbus park and in borough hall, because we want to make sure those facilities are safe, so that eliminates those four or five officers from let's say patrolling Farragut or patrolling you know Dumbo or controlling any other area. Thank you yeah. I appreciate that and you got you really are ground zero. It's a it's an important debate to have. You know. You mentioned the social service side of the work of the work and it's an important debate to have, and hopefully it can be had in a constructive way. Thank you very much. So I do want to stay on this topic for us because we did have a heart- to- heart conversation about it in our committee and as moderated by some folks in the criminal Justice arena. I know John Quinn, you have a question. Is it about this topic? And I mean it sort of you sort of picked up on the theme that I wanted to go to because Cyril and Patrick just before and other people have commented that we all love our local cops. You know they're the retail side of the of the picture, and if you ask an individual, you know, most people will say: they've always had good interactions with people out of the 84th or out of the 88, which also cover us, but at the same time, police in general, not a specific person or a specific precinct have obviously come under attack. Sometimes physical and certainly political attack and you've got your, and I think, Patrick just said that you know your precinct is, has been since the killing of George Floyd, a big part, a big central part of the issues that have unfolded in protests, because Barclays became a centerpiece of gathering and then people would move from barclays onto the Manhattan bridge, roadway or walkway onto the Brooklyn bridge, roadway or walkway, and I live on Adams Street and there were confrontations right in front of my building that were not pleasant, not pleasant. For the cops and not pleasant for the protesters and that kind of activity and behind my house is Manhattan bridge so where there were a lot of criticism of the police in general for putting forming a cattle pen and hemming in demonstrators and not letting them either continue over the Manhattan bridge or disperse as they wanted to do, and I know you're, even though you hold a high rank and you command, we just saw the Rob Paris just circulated the head counts at the various precinct. You have a large staff because of the your the staff having to serve not just the residents of the precinct, but the people who are precinct is the physical boundaries of the precinct are flooded by people every day because of the courts and because of Fulton Mall and because of all the buildings along Court Street, and we have lots of businesses and who bring in a lot of people. And of course we have all of the subway stations which bring people in not to mention schools and everything. So we've got we spent and Juliet started to talk about that. We spent the whole meeting talking about defunding the police and controlling the police and stopping the police. I believe we used the word reallocation of funding all right. We called it reallocation. Excuse me, thank you Julia, but you have you know. I have no idea if any of the officers under your direct command have been the subject of complaints, but how do you for all of us for the people who live here and the people who come in? What's your role and what's your philosophy on avoiding the conflicts that have, you know been on a daily basis and for many months after memorial day they've calmed down, but who knows, we got an election in three weeks. Who knows what kind of reaction is going to come after that? How are you? How do you deal with the what we would, as we were talking about the peaceful citizens who are reacting with the NYPD as opposed to the you know, we've talked about crimes and those are the people we want to interact with, but not the people who are lawfully and peacefully protested. I mean I'll, be honest with you. One thing about NYPD: is it's one of the most diverse largest police department, if not in the nation, but the whole. You know the world and the other beauty is that NYPD has been always been proactive in reaching out to the communities and being there for the the communities before anything goes wrong. You know, obviously we're going to have issues we're all human there's going to be some person, that's going to mess up, but as far as and there are checking balances for that, you know there are you know, like you guys could call you know, ccrb. You know any person to make a complaint. If there's a criminal issue, they can call internal affairs, then we have our intern. You know for the precedent loan. We have individuals, that's you know they're there to inspect the officer's test them. You know how they respond to different jobs, or you know, or they'll call up the police station on the phone, how they interact with that person on that phone. So these are tests that are being done throughout the you know, the years or days or you want to whatever you know what you want to mention and then, of course, if someone fails that test, there's a you know, depending on what the issue is, then they dealt with in that accordingly, you know, but everyone I know for sure that NYPD, like especially in the a4 prison, you know we're here to work with every single person. You know whether you want to protest or you want to just hang out and talk to officer or you're, a victim of a crime or you have any other issues. You know the officers are there to help you out. You know this is what the beauty about it is. You know you have the free. You know you have the freedom to you know, have your voices heard and we're here to make sure that everyone gets to do that safely, and you know, obviously we want to make sure it's not violently done with you know as long as you're within the law, we're going to stand with you and help you out as much as possible. Thank you. Are there other questions from community board members? Okay, captain I'd just like to share with you some highlights of the priorities that we put together in our recent meetings that would be applicable to the NYPD. One of the main ones is training, so we would. We would support increase in officer training for dealing with persons with mental health issues or homelessness or drug or other issues, as well as de- escalation training of officers when they are responding to calls and bias and sensitivity trainings. So that was one of our priorities. Maybe you could speak to some of your initiatives that you may be working on in that regard, for the the NYPD as well has mandated every single officer supervisor and everybody to go into a crisis intervention training which is like a three day, which is the same thing. They you work with different scenarios. You know, there's a psychologist and you know like there's a presentation about everything: it's a three- day court. You know training course at the end, they do the workshops, so you know they are on top of it and you know to how to interact with and how to de- escalate. Like you said, you know how to buy that few minutes with that emotionally disturbed person that you know it might not take to the next level. So you know they are already on working on that not working on it. They have been working on that and I think, if I'm not mistaken, every officer shoot or is it should have been already trained in pricing, intervention, training and the other one. You mentioned the biases training. I think every person again was mandated to attend a training which deals with you know your biases internal everyone advice in one way or the other. So you know that was another training that was given to every single person they had outside. I guess firm, or you know, or entity that came in and actually did the whole training for every single officer. That's good to know it's great. Thank you. One of the other ideas kind of relevant to that is the suggestion that first responders sometimes be mental health professionals. If the issue is a mental health emergency and not necessarily a a crime being committed, it could be somebody threatening to harm themselves or somebody else, but it's somebody with a mental health issue is that anything that's being talked about rather than having a police officer respond, having a trained mental health professional respond to those issues. I'll be honest with you. I know I've only heard about those things, but nothing in you know in writing or anything I mean especially with you know now you know John mentioned defending or reallocating. Whichever way you want to look at it, there's a lot of resources that be, you know either put on shelf or you know be thought of, and I think one of them I heard was: let's say it's not related to this, but crime victim. You know, specialists, they would have representatives that would reach out to like domestic violence and victims or any elderly or other crime person. You know like so all these things are being thrown around, but we do not know anything right now. That is concrete to what you just mentioned. Thank you. Yes, generally. We did support the reallocation of funds to promote more social services, community building and economic and educational opportunities for the at- risk population. That may otherwise be. You know committing I'll, be honest with you. I know there's a lot of talk, I mean again not to be you know like political or anything like that. It's just you know the department. If, depending on the resources, you know there's a lot of programs that it does, especially with the youth that rescued- and you know I remember- I used to run sports league. You know I ran it for 10 years for kids under 19. and all that money came from. You know the funds that the city allocated and because of that I run into individuals that you know I'd be shocked. I can't recognize every single player or any you know they will come up to you and say look I was in your you know, program and the person is a doctor or a lawyer. I have a few of those guys that became police officers, so you know they say that you know these programs actually help them. Instead of you know getting you know getting them in the right path, instead of them going into the wrong path. So I think you know these programs, you know, are very you know critical for our communities. You know build up, you know not everything is what you see. You know the just the cars driving around and that's it. You know, there's a lot of programs, a lot of community engagement that goes on with these funds. That's great and it's great to hear that you participated in that it's awesome and then one final one. That is, it's kind of you know it's not really in the realm of this discussion. It is it's off to the side. It does not. You know it's not a nationwide issue, but the placard parking abuse. It's just it's just a thorn in our sides, and you know anything you can do to think about ways to address that would really be appreciated. Yeah I mean I know this again. This is a hot spot. You have so many agencies here and, as you can see how the streets are so narrow and tight and providing parking for all these agencies and all these different units. You know it's a very challenging. You know part, you know I'm getting blown up on twitter every day, so you know I mean I'm not saying you know, that's not a concern. I mean if you come into the precinct every officer you know, there's posted everywhere, where they're supposed to park, where they're not supposed to park where they can use and where they can't use their placards. Some of them is what people forget sometimes is the eight foot prison is made for prison? You know if you, if there's a traffic agent, they do not belong to the hateful police. They belong to another. You know unit, you know if they're doing something that does not mean they aim precinct is not doing you know a good job or something like that, so we're trying to stay on top of it. I know we're getting a few calls. You know, I think we got an email today about cathedral place or a cathedral and thinking street right. Next to it. I had cat catherine. I do not remember the street, but it was right next to the one again there's construction going on there. The sidewalk is already closed, so this should be no, you know they're not eating any pedestrian traffic or anything like that. So if they park in there, you know I'm not saying you know that we're going to go out and you know start enforcing, because that's another agency, that's their location. You know so, but we're trying to stay on top of it, especially with the bike lanes and bus stops. You know to make sure that you know none of that. Those things are obstructed, but you know so many vehicles, if you drive around you know with having only four rmps four sectors to work. You know it's not easy job just to go, and just you know dedicate one person just to start writing summonses. You know they have to do other duties while you know throughout their tour, so you know if they get the call or they get to respond or they can see something they will take cash. Thank you now. If you have time for a couple more questions, I just wanted to. Is there anybody else from the community board that has any more questions? Otherwise, I'm going to open it up to the community Juliet. I had one more question: if you do not mind quick yeah, I just curious captain how many police officers are in the 84th precinct and do you expect that amount to stay steady? We have about give and take with civilians officers assigned to like the metro, tech area, Brooklyn bridge, and you know we have about 200,200 by 250 officers, but some of them again are fixed at certain locations, so they can't be touched to do anything else and to increase, I'm afraid, we'll, probably even go low instead of high, because there are no academy classes as of right now there is a talk of an academy class that might start next week. I think it is, but it's still not confirmed yet. So if that happens, you know the number is obviously going to go low instead of high. So I'm hoping that's not the case, you know, because you know it's hard enough to do the job with the you know, with the people that we have, but you know, but we'll try to manage. That's what I'm saying like it's challenging and especially you know. Someone mentioned election coming up and we already foresee a lot of demos, so you know we're hoping for the best. Thank you any questions from the community. Caroline. Does anybody have their hand raised? No one indicated: okay captain. We thank you very much for participating in this discussion. Miss Kalanchong, oh yes, there are two hands: caroline todd and someone named Victoria, oh Great, Caroline and first and then Victoria great. Thank you. Thank you. Captain rana for coming to speak with us. I really appreciate your time, I'm not so when officers have to go to a protest at the last minute. What is there one single duty they're being pulled from, or is it an NCO officer and another type of officer? What types of officers are? Does the 84th precinct currently have? Well, everyone is trying to patrol, and then they have other you know assignments like the nc officer. We try not to touch them unless it's like really necessary. Even if we have to eliminate the patrol officer. What we will do is you know backfill them with the NCO, so they will be in their own sector doing patrol. So we do not lose. You know the dedicated individuals to protest. So you know, but depending on how big- and what's the time you know if a pop- up process happens right now, you know we might have to use every single person, that's working for reinforcement from other pieces that will come and give us. Thank you. I'm sorry. I was muted Victoria. Thank you. Thank you for being available for questioning captain Rana, I'm part of a community education group. We on the weekends go to different statues of Columbus around the five boroughs and we do teach- ins for the community about you, know relearning history and things like that and we've noticed since we've been doing these since July at every statute, there's at least one police car, sometimes up to 10. and at one of our teachings we had as many as 15 police cars respond to our teach- in and it's very peaceful. We were not facing anything and I get there's a lot of tension, especially around Columbus statues, and you know, I'm sure, that's not how your department wants to spend their resources and we can obviously see it's very expensive to even have one officer patrol a statue for 24 hours. So I wanted to ask: why do not we remove the statues and then they would not have to be patrolled and they would not incur the ire of the community, and it just seems like the easiest quickest solution to having to patrol statues that people do not want around, and if this committee and the police department would be supportive of efforts to peacefully remove the statues of Columbus at the very least in front of the kings County building in a Supreme Court building in downtown Brooklyn. Well, that's something that you would have to bring up to your local elected official. We have nothing and no say in that situation. You know we actually make sure the property and the lives are protected. Thank you and victoria. We can continue that conversation amongst our committee after captain Rana is finished with it. Thank you, okay. I want to thank you again captain for joining us and we hope that you will again soon hello. Excuse me Juliet, there's another question eric okay, thank you! So much captain Ron, I was curious. What is the department's policy on whether or not patrol is done in a car or in a walking patrol, and do you have any kind of leeway over that policy or kind of what the breakdown is between those two different types of patrol? Oh man, what do you mean like walking over vehicles yeah like cops, walking a beat as opposed to kind of driving around in a neighborhood? Well, you know you have. It depends on what area you're like if you're on Fulton Street, if you when, especially when the holidays, are coming up, we're going to have individuals on footballs throughout Photo, Street and in the shopping area around it. So those people will be. You know on foot patrol and then you have patrol officers that respond to 911 jobs. They have to be in the vehicle to respond to different areas as quickly as possible, and then even then they are instructed to do some of their time available time on foot. You know it's called. You know a community visit. You know so they're supposed to go and interact with people in the community, but other than that I mean. There's! No such you know, I do not think, there's anything that you know that one has to do over the other. Is there anything that we can do as a community to encourage more kind of community visit time or kind of encourage the officers to be outside of their cars more frequently if it means to know when to be there or you know, be able to say hi to them or walk out to them, I mean listen. Interaction is the most important thing. You know, that's how you learn about each other, learn about the situation, then you know and be more. You know transparent with everyone. You know. So I welcome you know speak to your NCO officers. You know that's the first step and then we'll make sure that you know we set up locations. You know we already have locations set up where they're supposed to go and you know do their visits, but you know we can add more locations to those on their assignments when they are on patrol. Thank you very much now. It may be too late to get any added to the list, but if you had any capital or expense priorities that you would like Community Board 2 to help you prioritize and put on our list so that you can more easily get funding. What would they be? I mean first of all, I think the one everyone probably demands is you know if you get some cameras, you know in certain locations, you know which will help. You know one deter crime and then, of course you know catch the individuals. You know that do commit the crime. You know that be obviously the first you know priority would be in certain locations. You know there are a lot of cameras. You know throughout the 84 preaching jurisdiction, but you know again, most of them are like private and then you know we have to wait for subpoenas and other issues that come with it. I think we have cameras on Fulton Street on our list, but that is it's good to know. That is a top priority. That's consistent with yours! Okay! Thank you very much again. Thank you. Thank you again. Everybody have a great night all right, thanks everybody for participating in that I would like to take a step backwards. If I may, to close out our Brooklyn bridge forest presentation with emotion on that, maybe caroline or Rob, you could speak to us about what they may be seeking from us. Is it a letter and to whom would it be addressed? Well, you know, when you ask what they would like to see they, they did get a resolution from community board one in Manhattan, and I shared that with you and Cheryl and Carol Ann earlier today, without going into all the where ads 40 in favor of unopposed three abstentions, and so I think they would be very happy to receive a similar endorsement from Brooklyn community board too. But you know you are your own committee and your own board. You should respond as the sentiment and process seems appropriate. Thank you, Rob. Is there a motion that somebody would like to put forth I'd, but I would like clear that we're limiting it to one lane in each direction we're not calling for the closing of the Brooklyn bridge, like they've done in some other areas, so I think it's clear that we support you know the multi- users of the Brooklyn bridge that includes bicyclists and pedestrians and and Clark, and so I would make a notion that we support the proposal as presented and leave it at that. Is there a second? Is there a second? Second brian? Did you second it? Yes, okay brian seconds, instead of doing all in favor, I'm going to do anyone opposed? Oh can I sorry discussion sure I just want to point out that we also passed a resolution calling for a lane in each direction on the Brooklyn bridge a couple of months ago. We can keep it in. I just want to point out that we recently did ask for that as well. But can I sit to I understand your motion, your emotion, he was talking about this phase. Scott was talking about his phase zero and his phase. Zero is simply the one the ramp on the north, the outside north Lane Manhattan ground and you. I was not sure that in what you were saying, you were talking about two lanes now we're talking about both the out the brook the Manhattan bound north lane and the Brooklyn bound north lane, which would be the inner well. I thought the proposal frankly was both plans. I thought I mean that I can't hear you so sid it is. It did include both lanes as a phase a second phase. The first phase was just the outermost lane of the north side of the bridge. Should we just simplify it and say approved as presented? What are we saying? What was presented was, I thought just the phase zero and everything else was prospective unfunded and I it was not just phase zero. The other parts were in the presentation too. Well, there was one, but there was no. There was no detail on the rest of it. Does that include pranking, the you know the out the the platform over the traffic that he showed in the plan. Well- and I guess what's the I guess, I should ask the question and Rob mentioned it: what exactly was the motion of CB1 and Manhattan? What was their language? Oh, you have to give me a second john. Okay. Are you supporting only the first phase or the presentation? Is that a question to me or for me to Sid sorry, I'm supporting one lane in each direction and the planking fragment. I think that the both of the that that's a that is a very pro pedestrian bicyclist and it leaves two lanes of traffic remaining for the cars. I think. Okay, that's all I wanted I sort of well. I would like to know what CB1 did, but certainly now I understand Sid's motion, which is the entire proposal that was in the powerpoint, which included taking away, which, as Brian pointed out, we've already supported, taking away one lane of vehicular traffic on each side in each direction. I do not think we did any. We were talking, then about moving bikes or of giving bikes more exclusive space by taking a lane in each direction. That's now vehicular on the Brooklyn bridge and I think it included taking a lane on the lower level of the Manhattan bridge to be exclusively bikes. If I remember our resolution, it does frankly it does not. You know I'm so I'm supportive of that as well, but I think what right in front of us right now is. Can you restate the motion, as you understand it, yeah, as I understand it, it's to support the Brooklyn bridge forest, including the dedication of what they call, including the dedication of two present vehicular lanes, one in each direction for exclusive use of two- wheeled vehicles, because they talked about motorized and pedaled bikes and the extension of. But you know, if you look at that. Well, because I'm going to have a comment on that and the extension of the walkway by building a deck above the present vehicular lanes on the bridge is that is that a fair statement of your emotion all right? But now, if you remember, because we never talked about it, but his expand. The Brooklyn the bridge forest showed that on the upper level, he liked to call the upper level. The present pedestrian level, the expansion included the inclusion of a further dual lane bike path. No, I do not believe that, yes, that is, that is accurate, because he had proposed the bike lanes in the road bed of the bridge were an interim first measure. I had questioned him about the landmarks issues about having the bike lanes on the upper deck, the promenade painted, etc, and he had indicated flexibility of working with landmarks to either keep them down in the interim location or potentially to move them up or to have both where one becomes a speedway and the other one becomes more of a slow meandering bike path. No, I did not hear him he's taking bikes totally over that upper level. Quite simple cheryl he had if he looked at his power point it showed on that on one side it was decking for, and that was on the south side. There was decking so that people could get closer to the statue of liberty and have a better view to the south, but there was decking on the north side and that was to provide because it was green with a divider line down it for further bike planes. Why do not we just do that support the interim portion of his presentation, since he did not fully explain and develop the law and that's what I said and I would be more happy in supporting his phase zero because that's what he has funding for and that's what he has engineering for, but I do not think he has anything beyond that for anything beyond the points he labeled as phase zero. Excuse me Juliet. Would you like to see that slide again because it's on their website? Thank you, yes, Carolyn. Could you share your screen? Give me a Sec Sid. Are you open to that? I would like to. I would like to add that we would also support removing the bike from the network. Halfway completely, I mean I just I just see that as whether they're slow fast or whatever the safest thing is to remove them completely in the longer term plan. They are separate, they're, not they're, not co- mingled with the but there's another slide where he shows the well. Even that shows, I think it shows someone standing on a bike there. It shows someone on the upper level on the north side of a bike. There's a bike lane there, okay, so sid, how about? Let's just support his day: zero phase, zero plan, yeah right yeah. Can we talk about equity for a minute, because I do not know what the Manhattan CB1 group agreed to, but given that you know they've spent so long against infill on the Smith houses right, it seems kind of strange that we would allow a developer, potentially the developer of Smith houses, to be a title sponsor in this and add to that. Do not allow us to get where we need to go, and so I support this, but I'm very apprehensive if it includes private funding, so he did not really explain it, but his website did- and I checked it out beforehand- the sponsors basically get a logo on a plank of wood that goes on the bridge. That's what they get in this environment of you know. Maybe a statement can be added, but this is up to sid about concern about the you know, given his prioritization of the environment, that we would also want to prioritize equity in consideration of who the sponsors are something like that. I have no problem with that and I frankly think we should support city funding, so you do not get involved. Who gets priced? You are a location maker said so well. I would agree that we should put in something about equity and that we also support the city funding forever great yeah. Thank you. Thanks for sharing the exactly four and a half million dollars for the bqx that they do not need, so that they can spend two and a half. Can I say something: can you hear me? Yes Andy, I have a problem with developers and this is very vague. We were just in a situation with an event we're doing this weekend to that a developer somebody reached out to a developer that we fought for a year on Ulurp and the developer overthrew, or are zoning that protected our community from towers next to low rise buildings. I just have a problem with developers and it was too vague. I do not really want to Sandy. I changed. We support city funders, so it takes developers out of it completely yeah all right and Brian you're still good with your second. Yes, I am okay, great, let's put it to a vote and then, rather than saying all in favor, I'm going to say anyone opposed. Does anyone abstain, fantastic, so unanimously approved? Thank you very much. I in the I'm going to move on for chairs report. I had intended to work with you to prioritize our budget priorities, but it was too late if you'll check your email. Taiya has already emailed you the budget priorities for everybody to vote on, and I believe the executive committee will meet before they are due. The community board will only be able to submit 30 budget priorities. I believe- and I think that is for one of the categories- and maybe caroline you can tell be more specific about the number for the other category or Rob. What's up it's 25 in each category? Okay, when I remember it being traditionally: okay, 25 capital, 25 expense, so not all of ours are going to get in, but I think we did a good exercise to really think through these and also to let people know the MTA New York City transit priorities were taken out off last year, because that is not a city agency and they had not been responsive to us having the various stations such as York Street station, on the list of priorities, and so they were removed last year, so they are still not on this year. Actually Juliette. I was instructed to add them back, oh okay, so I were able to get them on okay, great. I added the York Street priority. As well as, of course, the accessibility issue- okay, great thanks- caroline I'm glad that you were able to get them on. So it will be good for. I think elected officials to be aware of those priorities, even if they are not able to be funded directly by the MTA. I have no other items in my chairs report unless Cheryl would like to share anything about the precinct council meeting. No, it's in council meetings because our members are older and we do not want to have in- person meetings. So hopefully I think November we're trying to do with zoom. The NYPD is trying to set up a zoom meeting, but unless we can do zoom meetings, there will be no meetings, because I do not want to have people in the room that makes sense and it's getting colder. Yeah. Okay, thank you, cheryl. I would like to open it up to other business, which is the the section for the Community Board and committee members to propose other business, and I know John two you had some and then after that will be community forum where Victoria, if you're still on you, can talk about the statues of Columbus, okay, so other business yep. I I'll wait for John if he's still here, but I also had something when he's done. You know we're not hearing him and I can't tell who's on the phone. So Brian go ahead. Yeah on our June meeting, we looked at a bunch of presentations for D.O.T for protected bike lanes. One of them was to put to install a protected bike lane on the east side of Navy street between Flushing and sands, as opposed to the two on- street bike lanes, and I brought up like currently the greenway as being constructed by Ddc Narrows, just east of the wegmans, and remains narrow until right before Flushing, and I believe you mentioned to me that Contemporary and I spoke to Terry Carter of the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway initiative, who mentioned that? Yes, indeed, that is temporary, but temporary, meaning two to three years, and so this is potentially a like two block detour, where you're forcing people to cross Flushing them back. I just wanted to update the community. That's correct, we're working with ddc up in my professional capacity, we're working with Ddc and they had plans to rip up Flushing the sidewalk on Flushing in front of wegmans in the near future. We are, we are just working out the grades with them as we speak and came up with a detail that was pretty well worked out, so their contractors are already ready to go. So I'm not I'm not sure about the area that you're talking about being a two- year lead time. I did hear from Community Board to District office that the area that we heard in our presentation in June from Flushing to sands Navy Street, won't be until 2021, but I believe the Flushing avenue part in front of wegmans and then to Navy Street is in process. Basically, there's construction now between, I believe Cumberland to just use the wegmans and that's all been torn up. I'm not sure if you're referring to that section or from that's the same contractor that is engaged and responsible to Navy, okay, I'm just passing along with Terry Carter said, but I'll defer to you. Since you are working on the project, I mean I'm not. You are just working with CDC, so you know Ddc is working on the project. I would hope that it is not a two- year project and it is not what I had been informed. Thank you, okay, any other business before community forum. Can I just say something: can you see me Julia Sandy? We hear you okay, so I do not know. D.O.T was meeting with the with a group of people from the from Brooklyn heights, specifically about the north heights. They want to close. They want to do work over there and have cars not exit. I think it's exit 28 to cadman Plaza, but instead exit on Atlantic Avenue because of the work they're doing and I and I initially was not in well. I was not invited and I somebody said called me to see why you know, and nobody from Atlantic Avenue was part of this, so I emailed and anyway the D.O.T feels that there are not there's not the volume to create traffic at Atlantic Avenue because they have to get off at the Avenue exit, go, make a left and go down Furman Street into Fulton landing. So I just because it's very late, so D.O.T assured that they will continue to monitor the traffic along Atlantic Avenue and the Atlantic Avenue Interchange during the construction period. So I do not know you know we have to see. How can I can I jump in here for just a quick moment. Have I've been doing a couple of things like counting cars at the corner of hicks and Poplar? You know right at the end of right near the construction site. I've just done it like 10 times and then also measuring a noise level and noise level is one thing you know that's another issue, but in terms of the cars it is, it really is not an issue. I must say they are right. It's it. Just has not changed that much. You know in the sample that I've done and I you know I I'm walking around there- a fair amount so, but hopefully they'll continue monitoring it well. I just want to say that Atlantic Avenue at that interchange with hicks, you know it's prone to traffic jams and Hicks Street south of Atlantic does not have any capacity, it can just sit there and they have very complicated turning conflicts. So what I would suggest, I'm just saying I'm just saying that, even though they're saying there's not that much traffic, it's already a difficult location, so we have to see and they and they said they would monitor it and so we'll see. I just wanted to bring it up. So thank you for bringing it up and it reminds me to get back to John Dew's initial comment in the beginning of the meeting that I agree with. I think that we should, as a committee, put together our list of DOT issues as we do on a year as we have done on a yearly basis. I can circulate by email the list that we had been working on and then let's update it to get those issues on there so that we can forward that to DOT in advance and then invite them to a meeting again to address those issues we did have. I believe it was Diana Soriano. Do it last time for us and it's it helped to have the questions in advance. I believe so issues like that, but a lot of us have those kind of issues. So let's send the document around and then maybe Carol Ann. Would you be willing to take and consolidate people's sort of study area study questions? How about we do a google doc, so everyone can enter directly into the document. Okay, I do not know how to do Google. Docs, though so, can somebody volunteer to do that I'll set it up and then everyone will just enter it. Okay, that sounds great and I will pop you once you send me the link. I will cut and paste what I have in there from the previous meetings. Okay, thanks, caroline you're welcome. I would like to open it up now to community forum and the first person I would like to invite is victoria because she emailed me about these statues before the meeting. Thank you, everyone for your patience and letting me speak again. So our group was mostly concerned with our main goal is to have the statues removed, but we're also just concerned with how much it was costing the taxpayer and the borough to you know. If we already know the salary of a police officer is between 40 and 85,000. You know we can safely assume that it's anywhere between 14,000 and 28,000 a month just to have one officer, surveillance, Statue and I'm sure, that's not how captain Rana wants to spend his his department's resources. I'm sure that's not how the community wants to have their resources spent and just knowing that it has not fostered the best relationship between the community and the police department when they're interacting in that way, when they're peacefully protesting and they're kind of getting confronted with, you know four to ten police cars. So I want to know if you know this is kind of our first. Try at engaging our local officials, so I thought you know transportation and public safety. This would be a ripe concern for this community. I just wanted to know what could be done. I think the ideal situation would be to remove the statues. Then the police officers could go on to help. You know, stop gun violence and gang violence, and it would be a win- win for everyone, but I wanted to know if the committee would be supportive of advocating for the removal of statues and be helpful in that process, navigating that process so Victoria. I thank you for bringing this to our attention in the realm of discussion. Of you know NYPD budget and resource allocation. I think if the goal is the removal of the statues, it may be best to present your argument to the youth, education and Cultural Affairs Committee of Community Board too, and maybe with more of the the background knowledge about why it is inappropriate to have a statue of Columbus. You know we renamed Columbus day indigenous people's day. Why do we continue to have the statues? I think that we, our committee, could support it from a budgetary perspective. A you know, inefficient use of resources and over escalated, forceful response to peaceful protesting, but I think that if the fundamental goal is remove the statues, I think it should be an initiative, and I just thought of this- I'm sorry I should not. I should have suggested this earlier initiative that is taking the lead by from the Yucca Committee okay, and what would that support? Look like? Would that be like a letter or a statement to that committee directly once I speak to them or how would I gain the transportation public Safety Committee support once I bring it to yaka, it would be a community board level support so that after yucca hears it and takes it over if they, if they decide to do so, then I would support it from from our perspective, but then it would be a community board or Executive committee vote to support something like that. Okay, thank you. That was very helpful. Would the district office like to add anything to that? It may also include the Parks Department as well, so the parks and recreation committee because, for instance, this statue is in Columbus park, so it's on their property yeah, I'm sorry! I did not get everything you said Julia. Do you think that would be a better committee for them to address than the Parks Committee? Well, it depends on where we have where we where the statues are located, but if we're just speaking of the Columbus statue, then probably the Parks Committee, because it's their statue, okay- and I know Victoria- you have an educational background. Your goal is educational, so maybe some more of a presentation might be helpful when you do bring it up to the Parks Committee. Okay, that's a good idea. Thank you. Thank you. Could I propose a motion which would be the same way we do studies for the Department of Transportation to do a study of the ypd regarding this matter in regard protecting statutes rather than people. Okay, yeah, I mean I do not see why both could not help. Okay. Is there a second two? It would not. Let me rephrase motion to study NYPD costs related to patrolling Columbus park, who would be doing and who would be doing this study? Who would have that information? How would this be able to tell me how much it costs to go to these statues? Omb NYPD Ccrb, you know all of these groups work together when they have to or when you FOIL something yeah. It's a signal, the point of it. We really should not be doing things like this without having it on the agenda, so people at least the community knows what we're thinking about, but I would really ask if it's going to anything's going to happen with this, that is there not be a vote on this that would be tabled and put on the agenda for next week and next month, so that people have noticed and that we just do not do something without getting some public comment from notice of the public about what we're thinking about that is an excellent point said: yeah, that's a good point. I was just trying to give Victoria and her group of educators another option, but because they'll both take the same amount of time, I think the other committees would be better. Those are welcome award. Thank you both of you, given Victoria Givencid's suggestion. I think that you should try to get on the public agenda of whichever of those two committees would find it appropriate so that the public would be notified of your initiative is Victoria still on. Yes, so thank you. I wrote that down. So will this be on the public agenda for next month's meeting or no not of this committee? But when you do the outreach you can via the district office, probably to the two other committees, you can figure out which one of them would be willing to host you. Okay, if you're able to check the chat feature in Webex, I've sent you some information. Thank you. No problem thanks Tia is there any other community forum great hearing, none? I think that was the last agenda item. Am I wrong motion to Adjourn? Thank you, Sid. Oh, no, I'm wrong approval of the minutes before you before you move to adjourn any problems with the minutes. John they're always excellent. Thank you very much for taking them and now is it okay. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody. Thank you. Bye, good night, happy birthday, Happy, Birthday, Sandy, Happy, Birthday, Sandy,.
