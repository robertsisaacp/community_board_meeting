Rob has been the only one that has consistently been in the office, but taya, gustavo and especially carol anne have done a fantastic job of moving the business of community board 2 along and responding to the information requests and any of the concerns that have been raised by our constituents and for that and to speak You know, especially on the difficult times I wanted to take this moment, as part of my report to say thank you and to commend them for the excellent work that they've done, because it's not easy.
They've done a lot to bring forth some level of greater efficiency, some automation and, just frankly, thinking outside of the box to make us a more efficient community board so that whether we are in person or we're virtual there's, hopefully no degradation and service that any of the board members would have witnessed or any of the community and the constituents that we serve within community board too So with that I just want to take the time to say thank you to each of them for the fantastic job they've been doing to manage the office.
Under these circumstances, Another part of the report that I want to use is the office has been doing a lot with trying to address some of our communication platforms and the ways that we utilize our website, and so with that I want to take a portion of my report and ask taya if she's ready to present the presentation I'd like for everyone to take a look at and just give you a little insight of what's been taking place while we've been in this pandemic, so today I'm going to turn it over to you You share your screen and present some of the work that we've been doing in office.
It has to remain mission driven Like most of you in march, we basically had a lot of overnight purchasing and process decisions to make The. Bureaucracy, That is how we selected, which tools that we were going to acquire by may We had basically completed the office operations transition, as well as our public facing remote protocols and then by June After launching the remote committee meetings.
Some of you've been getting links to more digital archive assets recently and now that we've done the internal work on the left, we're ready to focus outward We're, also going to be adding links to a new public google drive and we were able to follow the department of education's lead on security protocols and structure for that I heard dan rather being interviewed recently about the first remote national party conventions and the impact of social media on politics, and he was making this really great point that the rest of the world is already permanently digitally dependent.
So, in this case, tiny DOT cc, slash, bko2 public is going to take you to a new secure public Google drive like I You know pick an adjective about our digital and communication platforms, but I wanted to make sure we did it in a methodical way and also wanted to make sure we did it in a way that it could be supported by the staff in the office, because that what I didn't want is you know when you, as we all know, once you launch a digital platform and you're providing information, the work is not in launching the work isn't maintaining, and so you have to maintain So. That was the primary focus I had for the delay, because it was important for me in consultation with the executive committee and with the district manager that we made sure we did it right, and so hopefully we will make sure that we have this plan laid out.
But, given that we have at least two that I've seen in person, the honorable joanne simon and as well as senator cavanaugh I, wanted to take a moment to afford some time for each of them to address the general body and those that are on today's chat, today's webex and so something, and if you have any comments you want to share with community board too and if not just a simple hello and hear your voice is good enough.
So people can engage in the ways we all need to engage with each other at this time and obviously that'll really serve well in the long run, especially for people whose primary means of communicating is digital, so that you know Is. We think it is very important?
We had scheduled another one for the first week of april We postponed that because of the onset of Covid-19, but it is now rescheduled for september 17th and we have subpoenaed a lot of the people who were videotaped engaging in some very questionable behavior, so we're hoping to shed some light on it and also then pass a series of laws that we think will strengthen new york's commitment to fair housing and I, appreciate all of you being here and engaging with the community and obviously I'm happy to take any questions.
They're no longer working bill, It's a little difficult to hear some of the points that you're stressing because they seem important, not a problem, see if I can do that for you , so we're talking about jobs, we're talking about helping small businesses and finally, also we're also talking about the fact that we're going to need affordable housing Now. The problem is, if you don't have a job, it doesn't matter how affordable the housing is, because you can't pay the rent So. We need to focus first on small businesses to make sure they stay viable so that they can hire people, so they can actually pay their the rent, we're requesting funding You know what we have 19 commitments: here: fun to complete a neighborhood 360 commercial district needs assessment Okay, also provide neighborhood 360 grant program , we're also looking to expand the neighborhood 360 fellowship program, we're looking to expand the love your neighborhood grant program, the idea, basically, if you're focusing on issues that would not require a lot of money to actually get them going.
We heard from the director of the fort greene senior council who talked about how resilient their seniors have been in the course of the pandemic and how they've had a great outpouring of support from elected officials donating masks and how the seniors have taken really incredibly well to the the zoom platform meetings and doing a number of activities in a virtual sense that they would have otherwise had gone to the center Amazing we've been able to do this with the virtual settings that we've been in, but it's been a testament to the board office staff and their ability to support us with these meeting formats and then last week we just had a meeting where we formulated our district needs, and we on the health committee are We, have a unique ability to focus on a wide range of priorities, from environmental to sanitation, to your basic health needs and I.
You know that that's the very distressing news about the impact of Covid-19 on the parks we're meeting again on september 21st we're going to be talking about a folk project that is starting about that time at the anchorage plaza and we'll be having a presentation from what is, in essence, a friends group at golconda skateboard park, and Every day, the year round, This group actually had a voting drive.
We had two meetings in one in June and one in august on the transportation and public space side, We heard presentations on bike lanes, expansion of bike lanes from dot, namely at smith and jay streets, 4th avenue on navy street, and we also heard from a community member who was advocating for bike lanes in the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, which we support and we actually added to our statement of district needs protected by bike lanes in the road bed area of the Manhattan and the Brooklyn bridges.
Would we also support redirecting funding from the NYPD to support educational opportunities, job training, internships, social service initiatives, things that would address the root causes of why crime is happening, and so that is probably in line with you , know: multiple other committees on our community board, spanning from yucca to economic development, to health and social services Overall, we support increased accountability, rethinking criminal justice and providing the support for people prior to them entering the criminal justice system Those were a lot of the new additions that we came up with for the statement of district needs that, hopefully, you guys will see and support in when we review those as a whole body.
I see elizabeth adams from council member levin's office, elizabeth Hi, everyone nice- to see everyone this evening and really great to hear about all the committee updates and We are focusing on the success all the time we have the september 38th deadline so really trying to make sure that everyone knows how to fill out the census to share it with others on their block in their community and their networks.
A couple of things the da throughout the summer and his team have been participating in PPE and food distribution drives, and so we've definitely wanted to remain in contact with the community throughout this very difficult time, knowing especially for our first responders, their needs for having ppe's, as well as those in the community and also for people in our neighborhoods who may be in food.
This coming saturday, the da is having a gun, buy back that will be in east Brooklyn and for those who are interested in one to get more information if they haven't already Org But the da along with my team that I work with and our office of public engagement are out in the community spreading the word for this because it's been a horrific summer with all kinds of shootings going on throughout Brooklyn and the city, and if we're able to collect just a small number of those guns that are out there that are killing and harming people So again, that's this saturday, the 12th for our gun, buyback program, Thank, you john and it's nice to see you around 350 j street We also have from the mayor's community assistance unit.
The city is working with 60 bus companies to make sure that takes place on time and we're providing them with PPE To. Make sure that the you know environment is safe because again health and is the priorities Health and safety is the priority here , so we've supplied them with 300 000 mass 10 000 face shields, 3, 000 bottles of hand, sanitizer and electric static sprayers for every bus garage so that they can sanitize their buses and again ensure that this environment, for these kids is safe, I see two people from congress, member hakeem, jeffrey's office You want to speak for the office?
I take vigorous notes for the office to make sure that we capture everything and know what the community wants needs and how we can be most helpful.
Those are just some of the things that the congressman has vigorously been working on during the past few months, while during the entire time being overly concerned with the safety of his constituents throughout the community in which he represents it's leechurch at mailhousegov and the office number 718-237-2211-718-237-2211, my cell phone number 347-461-4059-347-461-4059 Thank you so much for such an informative community board, meeting You know a few short updates on some of the latest work that our office has been doing, so this might actually not be widely known, but the comptroller's bureau of labor law enforces prevailing wage and benefit rates for construction and building service workers employed by contractors on any city , public work project Essentially when companies on these public contracts fail to pay the proper wages and benefits the comptroller enforces the law so that we're able to go recover the money owed to workers and ensure that they receive the money through our office's outreach In light of Covid-19, we decided to take extra measures to ensure that these wages are returned You know we hosted phone banks, know your rights workshops and actually all this resulted in our office being able to return over 2 million dollars in unclaimed wages to more than 100 workers.
Since this pandemic started So, if any of you can think of any groups, community organizations, even just you know, groups of people that would like for us to give a presentation on prevailing wages and how our office can help.
So you can always contact me and I think before I heard some discussion about the NYPD budget So during this pandemic, our office actually identified areas in the budget where we can put resources from the NYPD back into the community and just as sort of like this blueprint baseline, we are able to identify about one billion dollars in cuts over the course of four years.
I reopen schools with as much in-person instruction as possible, provides transparency about transmission status within school communities and also improves the quality of any remote instruction that remains necessary You know once again: I'll drop that report in the chat and then the next school proposal that our office put out is that we propose the first of its kind bike to school plan for new york city high school students So. We call on the city and film top our philanthropic partners to provide free bikes and city bike memberships to low income high school students and to build one and a half miles each of protected bike lanes around 50 different new york city, high schools, Within the next year, 18 of high school students walked or biked to school, in 2015 down from 23 in 2009 and 40 of high school students attend a school within their home district and 83 percent within their home borough So, with cuts to the mta transit service, school buses operating at a limited capacity, and the continued need for social distancing We believe that this bike to school proposal offers a sustainable, safe and just healthy way for our students to get to school and then, finally, due to sanitation cuts, you may have noticed we've seen an uptick of rat sightings and this affects business corridors.
Try that again, okay, representing from the Brooklyn public library, in particular the clinton hill clinton hill branch, great I, am happy to say that the clinton hill staff is back at the clinton hill branch and we are getting ready for lobby service We, don't know exactly when that's gonna happen, but hopefully soon we are having our meeting room renovated so that we'll have a nice meeting room and maker space when we eventually move to letting patrons back into the building and we've also created a team space walt whitman If all goes well should be opening for lobby service next week, so people will be able to return their items at walt whitman While.
You know hear your feedback as someone who's new and wanted to continue, as I've always said that you know, doors of communication are open, feel free to reach out to me and leave any of the executive committee and clearly you've already established a report with rob.
