Rob has been the only one that has consistently been in the office, but taya, gustavo and especially carol anne, have done a fantastic job of moving the business of community board 2 along and responding to the information requests and any of the concerns that have been raised by our constituents and for that and to speak.
One of the benefits that we have is that we now have a full complement of staff and the staff has been working and doing a lot of what I simply think is just good work for community board too, but definitely getting the office in order.
Part of the report that I want to use is the office has been doing a lot with trying to address some of our communication platforms and the ways that we utilize our website, and So with that I want to take a portion of my report and ask taya if she's ready to present the presentation I'd like for everyone to take a look at and just give you a little insight of what's been taking place.
So our thinking is:- wouldn't it be so much better to start on that transition work now, so that the current board can help shape the future direction of the office.
Recently, and now that we've done the internal work on the left, we're ready to focus outward We're also going to be adding links to a new public google drive and we were able to follow the department of education's lead on security protocols and structure for that.
Also why we know exactly how little time this work will take after the initial setup Thanks to the Brooklyn bro president's office support and the next phase is free because of social media.
That process has taken place, then we'll report back to the executive committee, which will continue to act on behalf of the full board, while we're still in this pandemic, restriction, environment, restricted, environment,, I think others would tend to agree.
But, given that we have at least two that I've seen in person, the honorable joanne simon and as well as senator cavanaugh, I, wanted to take a moment to afford some time for each of them to address the general body and those that are on today's chat, today's webex and so something If you have any comments, you want to share with community board too and if not just a simple hello and hear your voice is good.
I, want to also just remind people of a couple of things that are coming up: One census,: if you have not completed the census, please do it matters to everything, as you know, on the community.
So people can engage in the ways we all need to engage with each other at this time and obviously that'll really serve well in the long run, especially for people whose primary means of communicating is digital, so that you know.
We need to the city, does not have the power to do that, they're on their own, so I've been working with new assembly member from lower Manhattan and also brad lander and keith powers, who's, a council member from Manhattan to get that going.
It is online, And. We have subpoenaed a lot of the people who were videotaped, engaging in some very questionable behavior, so we're hoping to shed some light on it and also then pass a series of laws that we think will strengthen new york's commitment to fair housing.
You know the staff work with me very hard to try to have the report done for tonight.
There are many items that each member of the office is working on and sometimes in what has been traditionally presented through the district management report.
What we basically did was we had an informal meeting with a couple of my different committee members to address the upcoming statement of district needs and also budget approval, lindsey einhorn, katherine gilman and kate.
We feel that the district needs to talk about jobs, because a lot of people have lost their jobs, they're no longer working, bill.
If you don't have a job, it doesn't matter how affordable the housing is, because you can't pay the rent So. We need to focus first on small businesses to make sure they stay viable so that they can hire people, so they can actually pay their the rent.
We feel also that we need to focus on those we're also looking at specialized incubators to support different sectors as well as communities and business owners that support recovery and encourage new startups by creating space for shared resources and ideas.
We're also looking to fund Brooklyn makers, Design competition, aimed at putting local artists and makers to work in urban renewal, creative policemaking on our city streets, a lot of artists.
Amazing we've been able to do this with the virtual settings that we've been in, but it's been a testament to the board office staff and their ability to support us with these meeting formats and then last week we just had a meeting where we formulated our district needs.
We've crafted some district needs and some of the highlights include the idea of having mental service mental health service vans to go out into the community and serve people and who are underserved.
We, know that there is going the demand for high higher end housing is one that's going to be questionable for the future, I think on that, because we're concerned that you know how many people are going to still want to come into our area, knowing that a lot of people have been looking to leave the city or you know much less.
You know that that's the very distressing news about the impact of Covid-19 on the parks we're meeting again on september 21st We're going to be talking about a folk project that is starting about that time at the anchorage plaza and we'll be having a presentation from what is, in essence, a friends group at golconda, skateboard park, and it's one of the few parks that is really used the year round.
We heard presentations on bike, lanes, expansion of bike lanes from D.O.T, namely at smith and jay streets, 4th avenue on navy street, and we also heard from a community member who was advocating for bike lanes in the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, which we support and we actually added to our statement of district needs protected by bike lanes in the road bed area of the Manhattan and the Brooklyn bridges.
There are resources like social workers, social services, mental health, counseling, drug abuse, treatments that are alternatives to incarceration, and this program has actually proved to be successful in red hook by reducing recidivism, and it also helps the people who go through this system free up their records so that after they complete the program, they no longer have the criminal record of these misdemeanor acts that brought them to the court system in the first place.
It takes over three hundred thousand dollars to keep one person in jail on average and given that the city and mayor de Blasio is pushing to reduce the incarcerated population from 11 000 down to 4 000, there are funds that could be accessed to be reallocated towards these more restorative justice programs, which have the same sort of resources that the community courts have where people go through.
And so that is probably in line with you know: multiple other committees on our community board, spanning from yucca to economic development, to health and social services.
Those were a lot of the new additions that we came up with for the statement of district needs, that, hopefully, you guys, will see and support in when we review those as a whole.
We are focusing on the success all the time we have the september 38th deadline, so really trying to make sure that everyone knows how to fill out the census to share it with others on their block in their community and their networks.
Our office is doing a school supply drive and we are taking a whole list of folks, so not just backpacks but ranges of school supplies and expanding it this year with things like headphones and things that young people could use, particularly during world learning time.
A couple of things, the d.a throughout the summer and his team have been participating in PPE and food distribution, drives, and so we've definitely wanted to remain in contact with the community throughout this very difficult time, knowing especially for our first responders, their needs for having ppe's, as well as those in the community and also for people in our neighborhoods who may be in food.
But the da along with my team that I work with and our office of public engagement are out in the community spreading the word for this because it's been a horrific summer with all kinds of shootings going on throughout Brooklyn and the city, and if we're able to collect just a small number of those guns that are out there that are killing and harming people.
The city is working with 60 bus companies to make sure that takes place on time, And we're providing them with PPE.
I take vigorous notes for the office to make sure that we capture everything and know what the community wants needs and how we can be most helpful.
It's a pleasure to see you guys all 63 members here in this meeting tonight, as we've returned from a very uncertain time that we were dealing with our community just want to highlight some things that the member has done during this.
The office number 718-237-2211-718-237-2211, my cell phone number 347-461-4059-347-461-4059 Thank you so much for such an informative community board.
Just going to give you know a few short updates on some of the latest work that our office has been doing, so this might actually not be widely known, but the comptroller's bureau of labor law enforces prevailing wage and benefit rates for construction and building service workers employed by contractors on any city.
So, if any of you can think of any groups, community, organizations- Even, just you know, groups of people that would like for us to give a presentation on prevailing wages and how our office can help.
During this pandemic, our office actually identified areas in the budget where we can put resources from the NYPD back into the community and just as sort of like this blueprint baseline, we are able to identify about one billion dollars in cuts over the course of four years.
It offers a set of recommendations to safely reopen new york city schools for fall 2020 amid the Covid-19 19 pandemic.
You know once again, I'll drop that report in the chat Then the next school proposal that our office put out is that we propose the first of its kind bike to school plan for new york city high school students.
I want to thank the community board members who participated in the recent breaking bread, dinner, oscar luckett Your borough president is very active in and around the borough on various issues, whether it be gun, violence or Covid-19, 19 response or as simple as giving out backpack supplies, which we did in brownsville.
Know, hear your feedback as someone who's new and wanted to continue, as I've always said that you know, doors of communication are open, feel free to reach out to me and leave any of the executive committee and clearly you've already established a report with rob.
Great, very quickly, I'm working with a wonderful group of people on a campaign sponsored by president adams and I serve on supported by community board 2.
