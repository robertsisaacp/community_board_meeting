Tonight, I really do not have a lot to say, but I do want to take this time to be to commend the office so under the leadership of Rob Paris, and you know, Carol, Ann, Taya and Gustavo.
Rob has been the only one that has consistently been in the office, but Taya Gustavo and especially Carol Anne, have done a fantastic job of moving the business of community board 2 along and responding to the information requests and any of the concerns that have been raised by our constituents and for that and to speak.
One of the benefits that we have is that we now have a full complement of staff and the staff has been working and doing a lot of what I simply think is just good work for community board too, but definitely getting the office in order.
Part of the report that I want to use is the office has been doing a lot with trying to address some of our communication platforms and the ways that we utilize our website, and So with that I want to take a portion of my report and ask taya if she's ready to present the presentation I'd like for everyone to take a look at and just give you a little insight of what's been taking place.
So our thinking is, would not it be so much better to start on that transition work now, so that the current board can help shape the future direction of the office.
Also why we know exactly how little time this work will take after the initial setup Thanks to the Brooklyn Bro president's office support and the next phase is free because of social media, so quickly.
That process has taken place, then we'll report back to the executive committee, which will continue to act on behalf of the full board, while we're still in this pandemic, restriction, environment, restricted, environment,, I think others would tend to agree.
So people can engage in the ways we all need to engage with each other at this time and obviously that'll really serve well in the long run, especially for people whose primary means of communicating is digital, so that you know.
We need to the city, does not have the power to do that, they're on their own, so I've been working with new assembly member from lower Manhattan and also Brad Lander and Keith powers, who's, a council member from Manhattan to get that going.
It is online, And. We have subpoenaed a lot of the people who were videotaped, engaging in some very questionable behavior, so we're hoping to shed some light on it and also then pass a series of laws that we think will strengthen New York's commitment to fair housing.
You know the staff work with me very hard to try to have the report done for tonight.
There are many items that each member of the office is working on and sometimes in what has been traditionally presented through the district management.
Was, let's change the format a bit and be able to show the different tasks and the different items that the various members of the district office are working on, so that you can get a clear picture of who's assigned to what the progress that's been.
What, we basically did was we had an informal meeting with a couple of my different committee members to address the upcoming statement of district needs and also budget approval, Lindsey Einhorn, Katherine, Gilman and Kate Yearwood Young and myself We presented it to the full committee, our first committee, beginning of this month and based on that, we came up with 19 requests and explanations of why they're needed.
We feel that the district needs to talk about jobs, because a lot of people have lost their jobs, they're no longer working, bill.
Is, if you do not have a job, it does not matter how affordable the housing is, because you can't pay the rent So. We need to focus first on small businesses to make sure they stay viable so that they can hire people, so they can actually pay their the rent.
Looking at specialized incubators to support different sectors as well as communities and business owners that support recovery and encourage new startups by creating space for shared resources and ideas.
They have working we're looking for a voucher program as a measure to help elevate housing and eviction crisis in the borough to both residential commercial spaces, okay, which was already discussed earlier by our honorable anyway.
We've actually had four committee meetings in that time, but I'm going to give a very abbreviated summary of all the interesting things that we're doing.
Amazing we've been able to do this with the virtual settings that we've been in, but it's been a testament to the board office staff and their ability to support us with these meeting formats and then last week we just had a meeting where we formulated our district needs.
We've crafted some district needs and some of the highlights include the idea of having mental service Mental health service vans to go out into the community and serve people and who are underserved.
We had a district need focused on on on providing more on really the city, getting more preparedness and supplies and training for future pandemics.
You know that that's the very distressing news about the impact of Covid-19 on the parks, we're meeting again on September 21st We're, going to be talking about a folk project that is starting about that time at the anchorage, Plaza and we'll be having a presentation from what is, in essence, a friends group at Golconda, Skateboard Park, and it's one of the few parks that is really used the year round.
We heard presentations on bike, lanes, expansion of bike lanes from D.O.T, namely at Smith and Jay Streets 4Th Avenue on Navy Street, and we also heard from a community member who was advocating for bike lanes in the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, which we support and we actually added to our statement of district needs protected by bike lanes in the road bed area of the Manhattan and the Brooklyn bridges.
There are resources like social workers, Social, Services mental health, counseling drug abuse, treatments that are alternatives to incarceration, and this program has actually proved to be successful in red hook by reducing recidivism, and it also helps the people who go through this system free up their records so that after they complete the program, they no longer have the criminal record of these misdemeanor acts that brought them to the court system in the first place.
Would we also support redirecting funding from the NYPD to support educational, opportunities, job training, internships, social service, initiatives, things that would address the root causes of why crime is happening, and so that is probably in line with you , know: multiple other committees on our community board, spanning from yucca to economic development, to health and social services.
So, those were a lot of the new additions that we came up with for the statement of district needs, that, hopefully, you guys, will see and support in when we review those as a whole.
A couple of things, the D.A throughout the summer and his team have been participating in PPE and food distribution, drives, and so we've definitely wanted to remain in contact with the community throughout this very difficult time, knowing especially for our first responders, their needs for having ppe's, as well as those in the community and also for people in our neighborhoods who may be in food.
Org and you'll find more information there, but the da along with my team that I work with and our office of Public engagement are out in the community spreading the word for this because it's been a horrific summer with all kinds of shootings going on throughout Brooklyn and the city If we're able to collect just a small number of those guns that are out there that are killing and harming people.
The mayor announced some more details on the Learning Bridges program, which will provide free child care to you know high need like families that require it, so that if a family needs to go to work or has some other priority They will have that 3,000 seats will open up on September 21st and then by the end of the month and by largely by the summer, we'll have a hundred thousand seats on that as well.
The city is working with 60 bus companies to make sure that takes place on time, And we're providing them with PPE.
I take vigorous notes for the office to make sure that we capture everything and know what the community wants needs and how we can be most helpful.
It's a pleasure to see you guys all 63 members here in this meeting tonight, as we've returned from a very uncertain time that we were dealing with our community just want to highlight some things that the member has done during this.
Those are just some of the things that the congressman has vigorously been working on during the past few months, while during the entire time being overly concerned with the safety of his constituents throughout the community in which he represents.
Gov and the office number Thank you so much for such an informative community board.
I think I'm just going to give you know a few short updates on some of the latest work that our office has been doing.
So, if any of you can think of any groups, community, organizations- Even, just you know, groups of people that would like for us to give a presentation on prevailing wages and how our office can help.
During this pandemic, our office actually identified areas in the budget where we can put resources from the NYPD back into the community and just as sort of like this blueprint baseline, we are able to identify about one billion dollars in cuts over the course of four years.
It offers a set of recommendations to safely reopen New York City schools for fall 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
You know once again, I'll drop that report in the chat Then the next school proposal that our office put out is that we propose the first of its kind bike to school plan for New York City high school students.
Bklyn, library, business And there's a lot of other programs going on everything from virtual story time to how to use a database to book discussions Thank you, Tracy, and I want to share with everyone that the Brooklyn public library is going to make an extensive presentation at the October 28th Cultural Affairs Committee meeting there'll be updates on several of the branch Libraries operational plans during the coronavirus and some other updates that I do not want to be a spoiler for so save the date for that, because I think that's going to be a really excellent.
I want to thank the Community Board members who participated in the recent breaking bread, dinner, Oscar, Luckett, Brooklyn-Usa. Your borough president is very active in and around the borough on various issues, whether it be gun, violence or Covid-19 response, or as simple as giving out backpack supplies, which we did in Brownsville.
Know, hear your feedback as someone who's new and wanted to continue, as I've always said that you know, doors of communication are open, feel free to reach out to me and leave any of the executive committee and clearly you've already established a report with Rob. Moving on to item number seven on the agenda.
I just wanted to mention that the borough and the city are still looking for poll workers, there's training through October 9th for anyone who would be a first- time coworker, and if you take the training and work one election, you get a hundred dollars.
So, you can capture it and then you can work with the board office and they will help guide you on alternatives that you have once again.
We would go right through department of environmental protection, , I'm gross from the New York City 2030 district.
