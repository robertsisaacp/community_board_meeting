Let me just say at the outset that who has not been a part of our meetings in the past. We will introduce ourselves momentarily in accordance with the agenda. I will remind several people that, if you're, not speaking, please put your phone on mute. The background noise does not help with having an efficient meal. So again put your phone on you if you're, not speaking, if you can just go on and turn your speaker off. That would be helpful too. I understand that there are certain items tonight where several people have requested to speak. I just manage expectations at the outset. One will not have the opportunity to speak. It will be more of a concise way that a representative to communicate the concerns of the community to get to the topic that warrants that level of participation that I'm going to pick up with the agenda and introduction of committee members. I am Lynn, Eason attorney, share community board, - and I. Will now ask the first vice chairperson - yeah everybody.

Okay, great next item on the agenda item number four committees for action, finance and personnel. I'm gonna turn it over to mr. Jordan, who serves as the to repeat first vice chair of the Community Board, and she has a finance and Personnel Committee. Mr. Jordan, okay, Thank You mr. singletery good evening, everyone. So this is a review of the fiscal year. 2021 budget, which will miss, who has to be voted on tonight. The committee met last Thursday on May 20th, and we went over the various line items and also just want to make sure make note of the fact that we were asked. The entire every community board was asked to process a reduction to the original budget that we were allocated due to the Covid-19 19 situation. So we were asked I think all community boards were asked to drop 8712 dollars from their total budget. That was allocated so in that, in our case, it gave we had done that the amount, what we're going to discuss today or actually what I'm going to present to you today is just a budget for otps, which is other than personal services. The rest of the budget is devoted to salaries, so there's a handout I, don't know if everybody got the handout to be on the back of the handout or maybe a second page. We had fiscal yet 2020 that we had approved last year for twelve thousand eight hundred and forty three dollars, and we had fiscal year 2021, which we had. The committee voted on, and that was for nine thousand five hundred fifty dollars, which shows a decrease of about thirty-seven hundred dollars. Approximately I'm gonna go through the line items so that you just have some understanding. My name is code 100 office supplies. We had 750 out budgeted last year, 600 dollars this year, and let me just preface the rest of my comments with the fact that we did go over this with staff and they had agreed that they would be able to operate with what we had budgeted for 2021 for the storehouse. We used to have a line item that we had budgeted there, but we didn't. There was a requirement for us to purchase stuff from the storehouse, but that's no longer a requirement at this point. Food and forage is just actually just water, the water, cooler rental and the water itself. With the we anticipated. We won't use as much since that's a monthly charge, so we budgeted 144 dollars instead of 168 from last year postage. We have sufficient funds in escrow. In fact, we have a total. We actually our use of postage and the postage meter has been slower as been decreasing, I would say slowly decreasing, but discreet, decreasing even more even more than what we anticipated. We have a total of four thousand three hundred and thirteen dollars in escrow right now, which would last us and actually even with the without you still decreasing, which was last us a number of years. So we did not budget anything for postage. Data processing supplies. You really that that's the toner for the all-in-one printer that we have and from 6:50 we budget, we reduced that to $400 a contingency data processing equipment. We had purchased just about all new data processing equipment that is laptops and desktops for the office this year in fiscal year, 2020. So as a contingency, we just left $800 in there. Of course, if that's not used, we can also move that someplace else. Phone and Internet that's a standard charge. 2000 960! We put, we actually pay that through dks and that's been a standard charge for the past few years anyway, rental office equipment. That's the postage meter. We have to pay at least for that meter and it's five hundred and fifty dollars and that's we had budgeted this thing out. We did last year local city, travel and meals. That is not only meals for the executive committee when the executive committee meets, of course, that doesn't include the meeting that we're having now, but when we meet in person there's a modest meal allowance that's allowed, as well as travel and meal allowances, if necessary, for the staff. So we had 2009 I'm, sorry to $2,800, budgeted in fiscal year 2020 we reduced that to $2000 for this year for fiscal year 2021 now I should also mention that the fiscal year does not start until July 1st. So this fiscal year 2020 ends in June 30th office equipment, maintenance, that's the printer maintenance, it's really done by a per page usage so and we've the staff agreed also that we could reduce that from 630 dollars from the last fiscal year to 400 dollars for fiscal year, 2021 printing that really involves letterhead. It's envelopes business cards $350 we had budgeted before we reduced that to 200, don't think we're actually gonna even gonna use that, but still that's there in case we have to replenish letterheads or business cards or whatever, as I said before, that money could be transferred to other line items if needed and staff training. We had a budget of $2,000 in fiscal year. Twenty we had reduced that to fifteen hundred dollars, still thought. That was an important thing that we should not. You know that we should budget it, but budget some money there, and that was fiscal year. 2021 $1500, so all told our new budget for fiscal year. 2021 is nine thousand five hundred and fifty four dollars and the line items line, item explanations now so miss Singletary and open to any questions. So, given that this is a budget item, this is something that should be voted on. So let me entertain a motion to accept the budget as presented Thank You Bobby can I get a second Thank You Carlton any discussion on the motion on board members. Our staff will still remain the same. This doesn't knock out any the hard-earned staff that we've been able to obtain recently as hard as it took for us to get this staff. We are naturally do anything to get rid of the staff. So please remove that strike that from the record records, don't let that seep out in the air. We are happy with the employees that we have. If you have any questions, call me I will hug you in spite of it, but don't go anywhere and everybody's here, all right, so yeah. If they listen to you, I'm gonna, hug, everybody. So please don't change any other questions on hearing, none all in favor, aye Jessica to know that Juliet's on a call - I've been on the call since Jessica was introduced for the record. Keeping. Thank you thanks. Oh yeah, that's the cool thing about web bags. We can see when you join, so we knew you stick them with the motion hold on sticking with the motion. I want to do this right. Is there any so everybody has voted there, any abstentions. Are there any anyone in opposition? Okay, great. This sounds unanimous now who had a question today. I just forgot to mention to everybody that the committee had voted to accept the new budget. Seven zero thinks that that's kind of mutant, a but I appreciate that thanks I appreciate that I love, the fact would be in federal. That's great so will be wanted to agenda item number five. We have new business, there's a Landmarks Preservation Commission certificate of an appropriate appropriateness application. Carlton. Are you prepared to take this part of the agenda? Let's start the first one is 30 st. Felix place in the Brooklyn Academy of Music historic district. It's a proposal for 24 stories, new building on that lot, it's being proposed by the Brooklyn music school with a developer partner, and the idea is that the school would get additional space rehearsal and performance space and would benefit from the income from this property. Is that it that's the introduction? Yes, Dan Kaplan from XF collaborated by believers on the call, and you want to share the presentation and again yes, I! Will you need to give me permission I believe to do that? It's D Kaplan! Thank you there with me, and everybody see that yes, now we can yes see my cursor moving actually yeah. We can see that the mouse very small is any way you can make this full page as opposed to within the don't worry, yes, absolutely better, much better! Thank you! Okay! So there are two people I would like to introduce. That is, gonna are going to present with me. First is Brian Kelly from the Gotham organization, and also that he'll precede me and then after me is Shelby green from the chair of the board of directors of Brooklyn music school. As was said before, my name is Dan Kaplan I'm, a senior partner, I've affected, collaborative and hi. This is Lenny Singletary chicken meeting for two I don't mean to be rude and interrupt your presentation. So this is going to be my last question before I. Let you get on your flow. How long do you think your presentation is going to take I think from beginning to end where it's no more than 15 minutes? All right! I would appreciate it if you made the Tim, but if you need 15 make it 15 I'll just had my second espresso, so I'll talk really fast gravity goes gravity goes a long way in community boy 2. So thank you. Ok! So Brian do you want to go ahead? Yes, with brevity in mind, hi everybody, its Brian Kelly from the Gotham organization. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to present this evening. I believe we briefed the Land Use Committee in December of nineteen on this proposal. That was a voluntary meeting to get the board up to speed on what our goals and objectives more for the site that we own at 1:30 st., feel extreme. We bought that property back in 2015 quickly. The Gotham organization is a hundred-year-old, firm or expertise. 14 track record is in public-private partnerships, creating affordable housing, community facilities and working in public-private partnerships. We bought the property in 2015 with the idea, after being contacted by leadership at Brooklyn music school, to help create an expansion and combination of market rate and affordable housing. The proposal that we've reached at this point is the result of a number of iterations over the last number of years, which would result through getting the certificate of appropriateness referenced through landmarks. Subsequently, to that, we would apply for a reason, so in Euler, which we would be in front of you next year, for the up zone of this property would be from a c6 one through c64 and c6 six. It would expand our zoning law that we share with one Hanson. An iconic building in the district to include Brooklyn music school would be a hundred and sixty four thousand gross square foot development that includes a 20,000 square. Foot, expansion for BMS, the height of it wouldn't exceed 285 feet or the shoulder of one hanson would include up to a hundred and twenty homes that would include 30% set aside as moderate-income, affordable, homeownership, affordable, homeownership, being the concept of creating both social and economic equity within the community. Very importantly, the design we propose exceeds and will respect all the requirements of easements that are put in place benefiting one hand, including white air, off site loading generator and egress. That's relative because the site when it was purchased in 2015 came with it a zoning law development agreement. We share rezoning lot with one Hanson. The site was sold as a development site, but we have boundaries to work with and to make sure we respect our neighbor in context, architecture and design working around these easements and next the project highlights expansion of Brooklyn music school, creating an educational, cultural hub, a base to serve underprivileged youth across Brooklyn and New York City Shelby will talk more about more than three-quarters of the students are at no pay, meaning this social equity. To this, the unique, affordable home ownership, while not intended when Marshall districts have created barriers to affordable housing. This is an opportunity, through a vacant, lot to create the home ownership and really important to us and to the communities to create a respectful and appropriate mix. Civic character from this development within the neighborhood and with that I'll pass it along to Dan. So he can explain the development from the ground up. Thank you, Brian. This is an overview of the site from the air. The red is the development site and the yellow in is the zoning site and which Brian referred to before with we are proposing this up zone 2 in fill the vacant site, its density at a transit, rich location. It provides home ownership, as Brian, said, and will provide 20,000 square feet of expansion for Brooklyn music school Shelby. Well, we'll talk about that momentarily as Brian also mentioned, we've been at this trying to find a very balanced development proposal, 2016 with a different architect. 2018. We got involved and was a number of stakeholder discussions here, is the proposed building and still deemed to be too tall 750 370 feet, and our proposal today is a respectful height that is at the shoulders of one handsome place and is at a more modest development site quickly. You all are very familiar with what's happening around the site, but this is a drawing my office put together, showing the two bridges at the water going all the way up, Flatbush to the park, the development that has happened in downtown Brooklyn and our site is this little red sliver. It's no surprise that development has happened here. The rezoning basically recognized the fact that this part of downtown Brooklyn is a transit, rich and actually historically, this has been the case also one Hansen and 67 and 62 Hansen were all built as part of when the Long Island Railroad lines came in and it was really established that and they really form a real part of the historic district personality. This is an aerial of the historic district our site is in is in here it's a polyglot. You know really there's the brownstones there's those two buildings I talked about already that were really the eye rises around us, the transit, the church and the BAM, the civic and cultural complex. You know the site very well, it's a beautiful set of architecture around it, including bamm-bamm Fisher, the church, the townhouses and the Williamsburg Savings Bank Tower. This is Brooklyn music school. It was really amalgamation of four townhouses that got put together in that townhouse scale was something that's important to us. We want to call. It was also very important to us to come up with a use that extended in the historic district, the Civic and cultural uses of BAM. Of muse school of the church, and that's one of the key drivers why Brooklyn music school needed to expand it was so appropriate to be on the west side of st. Felix today. This is the site on the left. Is the it's a parking garages from Ashland these two that these are the two generators these are will get in a moment. This is a vent that needs to be preserved and on the right. This is also showing the parking garage there's windows on the West Side East Side that need to be maintained in the sort of light and airy evening, as Brian described, there's a whole bunch of easements that came with the cell. We are respecting or even going beyond all those the windows I talked about the generator the vent, but what was not covered in the easements and that we are proposing to maintain is on the north side. There are as a band of windows that we are our design proposal. We wanted to create an ensemble with the two buildings of the church and the tower were designed by the same architect and built within two years of each other, and we want to be the third element in that complex. We want to establish an appropriate scale of the same Felix treat street wall and there's a north lot line, facade so ad, that's very prominent. That needs to be carefully designed. So this is a step up of the proposal. St. Felix is in the foreground, Hanson the church. So the first thing is the two floors of the music school plus there's a below grade floor. As then, we setback 15 feet to establish that townhouse concept scale. Then we set back 20 feet from the south to preserve the view of those windows from the easement and we set back 5 feet to start the wedding cake of the building on the Ashland Street Ashland frontage place frontage set the building back 48 feet that preserves these line of windows here and then, as we go, we can't it further and create a gap between the proposed building and one Hansen so there, if one handsome, could really stand free as much as possible and then on the on looking Northwest there's further stepping of the building so in scale. This is the church, that's the tower, and ours is this scale in between. When we looked at how to treat this call, a building architectural e we've really discovered, there's really like two different colors and material flavors, there's one Hansen, BAM and BMS in the sort of limestone zone and the church, the townhouses and Fisher in the more of the brownstones, and as we started thinking about how this third building could we both relate to the church and to one Hansen. We looked at a sort of a fade between tan to brown, and what that allowed us to do was keep all three buildings talking to each other, but they maintained their individual identity so that the tower was tan versus the brown of the of the top of our proposed building and at the base. We were tan as opposed to the brown of the church, but then it also allowed us to make a basically a very direct connection with BMS. We also looked very carefully at the existing building and picked up on some of the architectural cues. We basically have east and west facades that are more in the vertical mode of one Hansen and then the north and south mourn the quieter lot line with shadows of party walls at the base. We've looked at a glazed terracotta scalloped, glazed, Terracotta spandrels, to create interest and in the shadow and scale here it is now I'll go through a series of before-and-afters, but before I do that here it is in context, low, church, medium building high tower a little closer. You see that the coloration difference between the church and the tower the setbacks, the this texture of the lot of the of the south wall really relating to one Hansen, but the gap and the coloration difference allowing them to Stanford. So with that these are we call before and afters and shows photo realistically what the building will feel and look like in its context. So this is Flatbush. Looking north, you can see a little bit of the arena, and so this is the proposed building in the middle of the screen. The future towers are ghosted in looking down. Fourth Avenue that basically, the new building in the blue is completely obscured by one Hansen, preserving this iconic view looking south along Ashland and Fulton BAM, the fauna, one Hansen and I think this is really where our thesis comes most into play. We've really kept the one Hansen freestanding, if you will, we've peeled back the building, we've created daylight between the proposed building and one Hansen, and we've changed the color so that there is a contrast from Hansen looking and portrait place before and after similar situation with the coloration and the gap daylight Flatbush before sneaking in the corner, it's rounding it out with street-level views, st. Felix Street base and then I'll go to Ashland. This is looking north along st. Felix, the brownstones on the right, the church on the left, VMs and the proposed we're proposing our residential entrance here and the BMS entrance a little further down. I think that's clear from this North looking south again the church, the development site and BMS for the right- and here you can really see that the first, the street wall of BMS really picks up on the cornice line. The building sets back 15 feet then rises up and sets back again. The entrance to the school is in a terracotta, thin design. We had been here to you all in person that virtually in December and showed you this rendering, which showed a more glassy effect, and thank you for your input. We have gone back to the drawing board and created a really a quieter subtler, I think more appropriate entrance with these things. Finally, before I turn it over to Shelby, I want to just talk you through the Aspen base. There are two schemes for Aspen: there's a preferred option which really I'll show you in 3d in a moment, but really has two stories along ashlynn, including a second floor of BMS, and the fallback option is: it is really a one-story screen wall. The only reason we would do option two is option. One works with all of the required easements and requirements for one Hansen. It just requires a temporary emergency generator, that's not possible for technical reasons. We will use the fallback, but our preferred and primary option is option one. So with that this is the street view along Ashland. Here you can really see our proposed base: architectural language, brick piers with altar stone base, glade, Terracotta spandrels and a concave banjo pattern BMS on the second floor, with their nice windows, overlooking the flat bush, an entrance for BMS and a perforated metal garage door. If again, if we cannot achieve the technical issues with the generator, we will do the same architectural vocabulary, a one-story piece along that way. Here it is from the opposite way: the south BAM Fisher our proposed building. You can see what a nice presence the MS Hanna is on this sort of important view, and then one Hansen's architecture to this and then again the fall back. If the technical issues are not sooner, I will turn it over to Shelby, I'm sure there'll be questions afterwards and I have Bryan one quick thing before Shelby proceeds is again I want to clarify that this is a precursor to the Europe application which we would expect to submit later in the year. The LPC process is required first to ensure the bulk and envelope and the design of the building provides a framework for your as well as the environmental review. So the certificate of appropriateness, sort of in sequence of events is the critical path before the actual you work. So I just want to make sure we're clear to the board of sort of how the this will flow process wise through the government agencies and with that we'll go to Shelby. It shall be on. You I think it's hard to it's hard to hear you. Shelby I can try again Shelby you came off of you, then look there you go. We can hear alright. Okay, I just wanted to spend a couple of minutes or, in my view, of what the Brooklyn music school has been to the community, what it's doing now and what this project means to BMS and fulfilling its mission. It's been around for more than 110 years, and it served as an anchor in the community where both accomplished and aspiring artists to come to learn to grow. Its founding principles were equity and inclusion, meaning that it believed that access to music instruction was a birthright of all, and the school has kept that those ideals more than 90 percent, of its more than 6,000 students today receive music instruction at no or reduced cost in more than sixty percent of its students are at or below the poverty level. The student body, faculty and staff, and even the Board of Trustees, also reflects a mixed demographics of the community and more than 60% of students identify as people of color and more than half the faculty does also, and the school offers every kind of instruction in all your honor of music and arts, but it's so popular that it's bursting at the seams. It is experience more than 27 percent increase in growth over the last four years, and performances at the house are very unpopular. This new space will mean doubler performance and rehearsal space available to the school, enable the school to offer a digital music lab and allow music production, and it would also involve making the space more accessible to persons of all abilities. Okay, the project will allow the BMS to contribute to the community in another way, as well as Brian suggested by offering affordable housing. So we hope that you will support what we believe to be a project that offers many kinds of community benefits back over to the chair over to your questions, so that was the excellent presentation and I. Thank you all for being efficient and thoughtful of time. As you made, the presentation was excellent. I hope that we didn't cause you to make a decision to leave anything material out, but it seems like the presentation was well laid out so me to say. Thank you mr. Gordon, this chair question from the commentary and from neighbors or neighboring buildings about the proposal. I think now every considers themselves and I think probably there on the board is what I could say. Everybody considers themselves a supporter of the Brooklyn music school and they want to see the Brooklyn music school succeed. So to that extent, I think that you can get percent support. Something should be done to help support the Brooklyn music school. Now most we did get one comment in favor of the full from I think it's the downtown Brooklyn partnership and I think they supported it holy moly seed that the board and correct me anybody correctly from wrong feet. The pose project most felt that this was would not fit, or at least especially because of the height. It would not necessarily go along with what the academy of music historic district would be. Now the Brooklyn Academy music historic district is mostly from what I could see moderate Drive buildings. Would this fit in context? Would the Brooklyn Academy of Music historic, district, even project? That's one question I also got received from Karen Johnson who's, our committee. You know our landmark land-use committee secretary and she had a concern that, because of the largeness or the bulk of the property that the that so many families will be moving into that spot and it may affect not just a Brooklyn music school but would affect schools in general that you have so many families coming into that spot. That may really have heavy gas. A heavy amount of children would be living that building and which is normally a good thing, but it could affect the school whatever schools that would be I, guess available or sent right at that location. So those are things that sir, the heights is the biggest concern we receive several companies on that and almost every commentary was concerning about the height of the property. I can I I'm here with my wife. We look at one-one-nine, thinks it's right across from the school, we're curious about what the plan is for the old music school building. If this new building happens and that and the all the you know, the school transfers to the new building sorry go ahead. Show me I was gonna. You should answer you so bees on mute, Shelby, you're on mute again. Sorry, okay, that plan the plan is to renovate the existing buildings in a phased process as soon as the new facility is constructed and to allow offering more instructions in all different kinds of programs and to also renovate the Playhouse and the existing structure as well. So those plans are ongoing as we're moving forward with that and your building, so the middle school would occupied both spaces, the new space and the old space, wouldn't when all the constructions, complete, yes as well, so is Gotham been involved in renovation of the old building as well as the construction of Moodle. So let me let me do this because I don't want to take away from the float in gaming. Mr. the chair of the landmarks Land Use Committee gave an overview of comments that have come in and hopefully that it's Brian Froud Brian Kelly from yes I need to follow the protocol of allowing my colleagues who sit on an executive committee meeting to answer questions and you get to listen in and I. Don't mean this to be disrespectful until I acknowledge you to speak. That way, it allows us to keep control of the minutes. So we know who asked questions from the committee and who asked questions from the community, because I heard a lot of dialogue, but no one introduced themselves. At least I didn't catch that part. So, with all due respect, if you allow me to ask the committee members to ask questions, then we'll find our way to circle back to the community while I do have everyone's attention do not misinterpret what I'm suggesting everyone from the community will not get an opportunity to ask a question to speak on this. That's not gonna happen, because we need to keep this orderly. What I suggest is that anyone who's not called upon this evening and who may have a question if you forward your questions and comments to the district office, we will keep a catalog over those questions and make sure that they follow a fool along with this project so that you can get an answer and you can keep abreast of your concerns. Are we clear all I need is a simple, yes or not of a head. Thank you. So I'm Jessica, the question I have for you is when mr. Gordon was giving the synopsis of information. I was communicated to him and through information that came through his committee. Are you able to capture that in a minute? Okay, great any other executive committee members of community board to let me have questions on there's Juliet, -. Okay, so let me let me go with Barbara first yeah, all right, I, just wanted to mention. I, was planning to ask the question about what the existing building what would happen to the existing building after the fact, I have two other questions on this new proposal for this building, where the mixed-use will there be market rate apartments and mixed used apartments on the same floors. Sure Brian Kelly from Gotham can I answer. So the development will include 120 home up to 120 homes, B be affordable and market rate homes would be in there dispersed in accordance with HPD guidelines. That means they're not located with biased to sight line. They can well the affordable homes cannot all be located on one floor there I quited ly distributed based on the HPD design guidelines and that's, for example, no more than one-third of any units on any floor can be affordable. That's it that's an example and then two other two other things or in terms of support the chair will receive. But there are letters of support from Abney building, Congress 32bj, downtown Brooklyn partnership, Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, downtown, Brooklyn or Alliance. So, just for the record, there will be more than a half a dozen letters that the testimony was expected to be provided life. There was a question earlier about height and what does that mean for total number of units and therefore school children, type of environmental impacts will be addressed during the Euler process and that will be studied in an environmental assessment. This proposal tonight was to go over. You know, architecture and buildings form. It was a good question. One other question: have we anything from BAM either in support or against this proposal? We did give them an overview or he left, because he retired, but will have to follow up with them, but the feedback was positive. Thank you. I am wondering if you're proposing any more affordable housing than is required under mandatory inclusionary housing, and if you could explain to us what income levels in not in terms of ami but in terms of actual income levels, are proposed to be served under mih. There's four options. We are proposing, what's called the workforce option, which fits best with home ownership and we are providing a deeper skew than that option requires. It would be five percent of the units at 70 percent ami from an income level depending on household size, that's incomes from fifty two thousand to seventy, eight thousand, so that could be at seventy. Eight thousand two or three occurs in one household on the high side and five percent at 90 percent ami depending household size, that's sixty thousand to eighty-nine thousand get the eighty nine thousand could be up to three income earners and that 20% at one hundred ami, which is adjusted for household 75210. So a typical example: 20 percent at 100 ami with that 75 to $110,000 income. It could be a teacher and a bus driver that could be a waiter. You know service work if it could be this various combinations that are reflective of moderate-income working class to be able to qualify at the end of the day the uncalculated is households can't spend more than 30% of their income on their common area, charges which any homeowner has and their mortgage payments. So it's ultimately programmed to make it affordable, HUD guidelines. You need to speak up I'll, ask you reduce asking for the alert schedule. We commute. We've been in process with City Planning, but only for a pre-application statement and then the reasonable worst-case development scenario. The next step would be an EIS and the actual your application. Our expectation is to produce those documents by some point later this year, whether it be end at the summer or early fall. Considering the environmental review takes at a minimum months, I don't anticipate, we would be in an actual Euler process until 2021, so we'll be back in front of this board. Any other questions from board members Jessica just a quick one. It's really more for Carlton because of the kind of scope of feedback that we got I'm wondering if you could just very quickly explain what we're voting on tonight for the record, as distinct from that. We know the difference, but I do think it's helpful for both people to hear what this piece of the puzzle is versus. What later this piece of the puzzle would just be. Will this be considered for a landmark preservation, certificate of appropriateness? Would this be appropriate in the historic district? In this case the Brooklyn Academy of Music historic district I think we're again where some of the questions came up was. Would this building be appropriate in this historic district? And that's what we'll be voting on this will actually proposal proposed building be appropriate for this store in this particular historic district. Any other question from board members lean in a little more okay. Now we can. This is Dan from FX collaborative this building, really from a zoning point of view, the right under the rezoning would have unlimited height. However, the certificate of appropriateness and the special controls that will be imposed during the euler Pro limited to the design that you see in front of you, it won't be, cannot go any higher. The setbacks will have to be cracked and so that they are very specific to the remarks approve design. Okay, chairperson, do you mind if I just address the height issue, yeah we'd like to hear about the height issue? Thank you. I appreciate that so I know. There's a lot of questions about the height and I hoped I had addressed it in my initial presentation, but it's you know we do design a lot of buildings and historic districts and I always come to the table with like what would a architect who was working around the time of the other buildings. How would they approach the building? How would they approach the design of the building, and in this case it's a very young, unique situation? Is that the same architect designed a tower and the church and what we thought was the best and most appropriate was to create a mid ground between the two and something that would form an ensemble as if you know it was the same office and the site next door is available and really create an ensemble where we spent a lot of time and architectural thought and looking at three-dimensional models and renderings and so forth to determine the appropriate height and, at the end, the two things that really sealed it for us is one keeping it below the shoulder of one Hanson and two and I think this is very important, is pulling the tower away from the streets in a way that really makes it much more gentle on the pedestrian experience. I really think what we've proposed here is quite appropriate. So I do appreciate the time and space to say that Juliet I haven't a comment. Um- fer of the site, I think that we heard on some of the letters that came in when you say that you could have built an unlimited, Heights I, don't want people to be misled, because my understanding is that as of right, there is no f AR that could have been used to build anything. Perhaps you could speak to that like right. What we're? What we're talking about here is approving the bulk of a building that currently couldn't have been built. Okay, so that thank you for that distinction. When I referred to what could be built as of right, it would be under the as of right condition with the rezoning. What can be you're correct in that? Currently, the site is the parking lot itself and one Hansen, and it does not include polka music school so and under the current zoning there you're right there's a negative F failure there, any other questions from board members. Mr. Singletary just had one and maybe I missed this, but all the affordable housing would be on that one site yeah. So there would be correct all in this building one front door, one doormen accessed by everybody to the same amenities units district distributed through the building. So it's a tremendous opportunity for moderate income, households -, you know footprints down and in the neighborhood and build beyond social equity economic equity and that, instead of paying their landlord rent every month, they get to advertise a you know a moderate small mortgage and you know, create liquidated value on that property for themselves. So if they stay in their home 10-15 years, they're getting the benefit of being a homeowner versus paying rent so I, that's a tremendous attribute to the affordable homeowners, homeownership concept. I can also say, since we've been at this for a while, we've met with a lot of different groups, whether it be a Conservancy, whether it be a part related entity, whether it be a cultural arts organization from a global perspective, sort of Brooklyn focus groups, citywide groups. The reception to this has been very positive. I can understand, on the flip side that people who made it live next door or around the block, felt like their view forever. One's gonna be available on all four sides. To the end of you know the face of the earth I think we have to look at the moment in crisis. We are in New York City of what does it take to create progress, and this creates an opportunity for Brooklyn music school who's, laid the groundwork for more than 100 years in Brooklyn, for youth, to expand, not shrink to monetize the value of their rights to own and build out their facility and to create affordable homeownership without use of public capital, meaning not requesting direct subsidy of you know the affordable, homeownership opportunities, so I think when we all sort of take a step back of what could this create? We realized it's a two hundred and eighty five foot building, but we looked at it sensibly and how a wedding take this, have we respected our neighbors? But how do you ultimately, in a moment of crisis, create something for the greater good? And we think this strikes that happy balance? That's sort of that happy medium. So this is this is Lenny. Let me let me kind of move this along. So unless there are other members, who've not already asked the question I want to move this along. So we hear from the public and I'm gonna ask for five questions from members on the call who are not from the community board who's, not part of things that the committee to ask questions once again: five, but before I. Do that, though, when you, when you were speaking just now, you mentioned about ways to be inclusive and ways to help I'm at a time of crisis and I, believe another presenter also used the term inclusive I'm. In that same context, what efforts have been made to reach out to the community that, on that part of, let's say, business groups that are advocacy for different larger scale initiatives in the district I'm talking about grassroots? It's a pocketbook neighbors who may be affected are in close proximity to the project. What level of outreach have we had there? So in terms of yes, we've met with some of the business focused entities that want to see economic development, but we've also met with the Fort Greene Park Conservancy we've met with mo Khanna. You know: we've met with Fulton Area Business Alliance, which is really important for small businesses in the neighborhood I mean cut you off, I, don't want to be rude. I get I, get the businesses. What I'm talking about is non businesses, residential people who live close proximity to the project, non-business representatives I'm, so my just actual people who so in so the idea behind the meeting to cohesively and strongly communicate what the development was and is we had the meeting in December for a public meeting which we voluntarily came to the board and said we'd like to present this project to the community, so that homeowners on our on st. Felix folks in the neighborhood would have a seat at the table to see what we're proposing and I stated in that meeting. What we don't want to do is show up when it's just official action to take such as a Euler. So you know we created a teaser website, an informational website, st. music. You know that it's we can post it to the community board, but same field music and living comm. We created an informational website. We held the community board meeting - as a follow-up to that informational website. Going. Lots of folks are understanding what the development is about. We issued a press release so that all the local periodicals, including major sources of news, could pick it up. So we've aimed to be transparent early on can I, say I've knocked on everybody's door, I just I, don't know that would be most efficient, but any group that is of interest in meeting with us or figure out how they can collaborate with us in Brooklyn music school, we're candidly very open to that. Thank you. So this is going to be a bit challenging. We've never done this before I'm gonna actually do this in a very orderly way and Rob. Can you or say explain to me? Is there way that we can, in a digital format, acknowledge non-members by you know having them raise their hands like how's Eric control, we're doing this because you can't see everybody on the screen in order to recognize who's responding. My screen is not that large and you can see the debt questions. Mr. Singletary can I see what again chat questions if you click on the voice, balloon should open up. Yeah I see that money. This is a Brian. How old I was wondering if I get in a question there getting two questions before I want to try and get the community first as hold off. Let me so Bob I see this chat just I'm. Looking at this doesn't necessarily tell me that people want to do anything outside of a chat. They may not want to speak I'm just trying to figure out outside of the chat. There's anyway, like you could see someone who's raising their hand. Do we have that functionality? There is that functionality and I, don't cuz I, see he's built full annoyed raised his hand, I'm, not gonna, call on Bill, but I see he raised his hand. So clearly that feature does exist, and so how do I get to see that with so many people? Can you share with us how you did that all right? So here's? What we'll do? Let me just jump in for a second I see. Is it Cassie? Carillo am I saying that correctly, hello is a representative SEIU, okay, great! So, if you wrote a letter of support, I'll take that as you've had a chance to give comments. So, let's see who else raised their hand see? Hopefully everyone knows how to raise their hand, all right so I'm, looking through this functionality now I do not see anyone else. When you raise their hand, please don't let the chat stop with you. If you successfully get your questions answered through the chat, please continue that way. Person I see that Andrew last also has this Andreas he's a he's, a he's, an exec committee member. So that's Andrew. Last a whacky I'm looking for non-committee members I'm trying to move this along. So thank you I appreciate that. So with that, let me jump to Brian. Thank you. Two questions. The first one was one or not yeah. There is a plan drawing and showing the leasing, hilux building line in relations and some buildings. Perhaps I and its that somewhere in the presentation there. I can provide that if you want me to do it now and share screen or we send it in its it's also in the its it in the you know, the landmark submission. So let me know how you want me to do that. Just curious whether or not the building will take up more like frontage distance on the sidewalk, then the EMS program, so okay, good happy to answer that question currently so, as I mentioned before, BMS was originally built as a Browns as a series of four brownstones and they had Stoops and when they were combined to create BMS and I. You know when the teams like they were the super carved off and those entrances made the face of the building of BMS to set back seven feet from the property line. In contrast, the church is built to the property line. We will Macri on the south side with the church and then at the entrance. Our new proposed entrance to BMS. We are making the transition from the property line back to the seven feet so that we smooth a transition. My mother question I'm trying to do my best to channel my John to just curious. If one doubt was tonight, you will just shut down. I can mute. You can not the not the transit the mystery team did not. The protest in this review. I wish to Tom just go ahead. Sure thank you, I'm just curious if there any sort of improvements to transit, cow or Nevins or Atlantic, that will come as part of this project jump in for a minute Brian before you answer that keep in mind everyone. There are certain aspects and great questions like the previous one that will be part of the EIS and we haven't gotten there. Yet this is really about the architectural design, so I don't want to loose like that. The project like this can naturally raise a ton of questions right, but I want to keep the remaining questions going forward. That part of us before us tonight that we get to vote on is the design texture and then some of the questions come in naturally relate to community outreach. But since when I did ask that question bill, you could sponsor. That would be great sure, transit improvements are funding to transit is more customary when there's a density bonus associated with a transit bonus, in this case the ability to create the zoning for areas being generated by mandatory inclusionary housing and ultimately, at what were able to recoup on sales of those units. We are cross subsidizing those inclusionary housing units with the market rate homes. So that's, essentially, the public benefit being created Brian since you're talking about also contributions want to be clear that the relationship we have with Brooklyn music school is to create a Quarren shell for Brooklyn music school and also fit out the facility through the air rights that we purchased from them through the through the zoning law, development grant, meaning we're landing their air rights onto our facility. Given the light of fiscal cots, this is an opportunity where private investment which the city is going to need is going to create a cultural hub expansion. So there was a comment earlier that Brooklyn music school is supported, of course, who could not love drunk music school? My own niece, you know, goes for the halloween event and as interested in signing up for classes, but 20,000 square foot, schools don't get built without capital. So this development that includes affordable home ownership is generating economic activity to also create Brooklyn music school. So you're talking about a building between mih and Brooklyn music school, where more than 40% of the floor area is essentially non revenue generating Inc, it doesn't make profit. So this is where you know good is created by private investment and revenues generated by the market rate. Also it doesn't go to transit, but it goes to create a school expansion which otherwise will not get public funding, affordable, home ownership and HPD has massive budget cuts right now? Okay, great! So now let me let me take questions that are coming from members of the community and, let me just say this: there are several people: who've now figured out how to raise their hand. I want to say thank you, those of you who already submitted testimony respectfully I'm, not calling when you begin to repeat what you've already written so I see you raising your hand but I'm, not gonna, do to repeat what I am going to do is call on members from the community, so I'm gonna start with James golden who is a member of the public. Remember the commune of the public was raised his hand. So James are you on it? Are you unmuted I did not mean to raise my hand, no problem. We still love you next Lucy Coe team that you meet with the residents of st. Felix, Street and also the residents of one handsome place to get their feedback. You said you met with many of the businesses, but I did not hear you say that you met with the actual residents who have invested their money and their effort since you're, creating st. Felix treat the lovely Street. In addition, I am very concerned about the future of housing and I'm hearing that many of the middle class will be leaving the city after this Covid-19 depe Demick and now we have 85 are across the street. Many units of housing and I am concerned that we will see buildings going up that will remain empty as the middle class leaves the city and the so-called rich people who have been buying up the expensive buildings will not win straight interested in New York City in the near future. So my feeling is that it is appropriate to be building anything new until we get a good assessment of our economic viability who will be occupying I have been leaving the city. That is the target of a lot of your weather. The question is why Campbell gave a million dollars to the music school and trained us to have that money is being spent to upgrade the music school. That's a great question, but that's nothing to do architecture, so I think I did want to supervise one point of clarification. Sorry I just want to make sure that we capture Lucy's question in our minutes. It's a good question, but I'm just dealing with appropriateness right now, so that was later guideline it. With regard to communication with one Hanson, we are not only in communication, what one hands and the condominium board and every condo has legal representation we're in contact with their attorneys, but we have met with board members of the one Hanson building condominium. They represent the interests of one Hanson, that's how they're organized so. Firstly, we presented this project to them in the past. Secondly, is we have given them a copy of our landmarks application, so they have the full application? And thirdly, given that challenging times with communications were in right now, we did offer a multitude of times to have a zoom presentation of our application prior to this hearing. So for disclosure we've been a neighbor, that's communicating! That's number one. It I think critical. In regards to the comment about the middle class leaving the city, the affordable home ownership concept is part of attracting and keeping the middle class in the city. We add an affordable housing crisis before Kovan and it will only exacerbate post kovat. Secondly, is it's our risk too vendor capital and build this development and were sensible developers, so I think the risk on us for the numbers the pencil is on us and we can make that decision on how we price the units how big they are? Well, let the market speak to that, but I think this actually directly addresses the kögel issues at hand. So the next question I see yeah I may not be able to get this correct, but I think the first name is Shawn. Is that correct? Your name seem to be all jumbled together with is the first name Shawn? Is that correct there you go I'm. Sorry, sir wanna hope you give me. Okay, that's fine I meant to change that. Would I guess it came up automatically populate it like a username or something. That's fine. What's your question architecture, you know, I think the building. It looks really pretty. You know as yet the second floor, but small entryway I just was looking like. Is there a way to make it more appealing from street level rather than having the perforated garage door, but also you don't want to compromise the privacy of the cars, but was there a way to do that made to be too late? Cuz I know you already designed the building looks great, but then did something the answer on the Ashland side is the door is required because there is a loading easement that benefits one Hansons, so we need to have a door so that the loading for one Hansen is maintained or legally required doing. It's also important for the function of one Hansen, but we can take the comment about the materiality as a suggestion like we did on the same field, Street frontage at our last meeting and based on also how landmarks reacts to it, we'll keep it in mind as long as it could still function as an operable door. Yes, exactly thank you for your call. Okay, so no need make an announcement. It's been brought to my attention that this meeting is set up to in probably at 8 p.m. that was something I wasn't aware of. As we started this meeting so given that in 723 and we've spent a considerable amount of time on this topic- and we have other items on the agenda that we need to cover, let me ask two things: there's a whole host of individuals that have identified themselves through emails to the board office and through this chat that have strong support for the project and strong support for the music school, as was noted by my colleague and the chair of the committee in his opening remarks. I do not want anyone to go away from this conversation. Thinking that that's not acknowledged, it is and I fully appreciate all the entities that have been supportive and also Brian went through a list of people that were supportive, so in totality don't think that your voice hasn't been heard. It has but I need to move the meeting along and so as customary to those who know me, I will apologize in advance that I'm about to be rude, but we're gonna finish this meeting before you two o'clock. So if anybody has feelings that are hurt, please email me I'm, happy to give you a pre written apology, but we're gonna move along. So that's it for this part of the conversation on this topic. Mr. chair I bring it back to you for emotion on the action that needs to be addressed tonight, so that if you go before the land, most reservation committee for the certificate of appropriateness and application I've taken into account both the support for the Brooklyn music school and the concerns for my motion would be to approve the project, but with a 12-story I, rather than as a four-story height, that would be more appropriate for the Brooklyn Academy of Music historic district will be a not as overwhelming for the rest of the properties in that historic district and still will allow a project to go forward which would be in support of the Brooklyn music school will be to approve, but at a 12-story height. Is there a second on the motion? Ask I'm not asking for a vote I'm just asking for a second, it's Jessica Thank You Jessica. Is there any discussion on the motion juliet? I discussion wise. I don't think that would be economically viable Carlton, while I applaud your efforts to try to maintain the contextual 'ti of the building. I think that they're gonna need more height in order to be able to do their 30%, affordable housing, 20,000 square feet for the school I. Think cutting the building in half would probably make this project not happen. So maybe there's a middle ground that we could be shooting for. I was gonna, suggest something modest like a make sure all the mechanicals are within the envelope that they all the bulkheads on own mechanicals are within the bulkhead that they proposed, but maybe there's something you know in between those two, its Brian just to clarify. I. Think that just for the point, our mechanical lion- Brian, I'm, sorry, you gotta, you gotta, go you don't get a chance to speak now. Sorry, this is a strictly an executive committee conversation any other discussion on the motion bill said he tends to agree with Juliet any other discussion on the motion. Aye hearing, no other discussion on the motion and not hearing an amended motion all in favor. Yes, Rob, that would be fantastic. No, you call me less your Gillette for myself Nate. No, you voted yes, penny five Bush, no still annoyed Smith. Yes, no motion fails to pass by a vote of two in favor said it opposed no extension. I'll entertain. Another motion to accept I'm, sorry, I'll, entertain another motion to move the 1:30 st. Felix, a tree application is going to land well, Preservation Commission for certificate of appropriateness, and the only other thing I can think that we can do is simply a move to approve, as presented so it'll, be the full 24 stories. Is that a question or motion? That's my motion approve as president second by bill Flournoy. Any discussion on the motion. Can we make sure that the goals are within the envelope that they proposed accept that as a friendly amendment? One of the reasons I asked about the Euler when it was good actually going to go forth? It's because one of the public members did bring up a point currently right now we're seeing in the city and we're also probably to see a lot of departments they're going to be on the market. I'm, not sure if the market rate housing are going to be at a rate that will support the entire. What I'm just voting on right now is voting on the building itself when they come back for Euler, we'll see what the conditions are at that point in time. Any other discussion on the motion hearing the rob, walk over chair votes last Chung. Yes, mr. Gordon, yes by Bush, no mr. Flournoy, yes, mr. Brandon Smith, no mr. Singletary! Yes, the motion passes by a vote of seven in favor, two opposed no extension. Thank you everyone and to everyone. That's unless, under the sound of my voice, for the participation and for the presentation tonight, we go on to the next item on the agenda: 163 Bond Street, mr. Gordon 163, Bond Street, it's in the bowl. Basically, it's one of those rear, your back of the building things they're looking to do a extend the rear of their building, also partial, with on the third floor, and they want to put in a railing as well towards you know, which would be in compliance with the code, but basically what I want to do is if they would step in there rare you know the rear of their building a little bit further. It's one of these typical small boy, Boerum Hill stone buildings, and they want to extend it into the rear of the further out mr. Lee mr. boarding the architects Eric Jacobi gives on the call unmuted I. Do the architects have a presentation for us? Okay, can I ask you two to be brief and speak up a little bit. You sound real faint lucky hit you much better great. All right I will try to go very quickly. Now, wait, I, don't want I, don't want you to lose any materiality of your presentation. You shouldn't be rushed because another presentation went long. However, do you have a document you want to share with us? Are you just going to speak to us? No I can share okay, fantastic. Could you make it full screen, please very shrunken, so it's 163 Bond Street, it's located in the Boerum Hill historical district. It's the photo it's between my D Street on between Bergen and my car. Okay, exactly so it's a short block right here. I guess they're! All these short blocks. Yes, exactly so here's a photo of it. There's a city bike. Here, it's a pretty diverse strip, relatively architecturally speaking, so we're right in the middle of a row we'll get some closer photos of it. This one has already been marking had some work done on it and we're right in the middle 163. So what we're proposing yeah? Sorry, it doesn't affect the front or the street side of the building. We're gonna, replace the windows with historical windows, but no repair work, so we're replacing the windows will repair the cornice but there'll be a 12-foot addition at the back and an addition on the roof. That's setback with mechanicals on the top and a deck on the existing buildings 36 feet. So it'll now be 41 42. So here's the plot plan again an existing two-story building with a cellar and we're gonna, be doing an addition at the back and on the top in the deck our little plan. The extension I just need to know if you've notified the neighbors on either side that there will be this construction that could affect their properties as well. Yes, we've spoken to them both and we're very early in the process, but yes, they're both aware that we're gonna be doing the work for sure sorry, this is Lenny again. Can I can I just jump in for a second in fairness to you, Sarah as you giving your presentation can I everyone, including the chair, to hold their questions. That way, you can go through your presentation in this entirety and we can have questions at the end. I just want to be fair to say, like we watch the previous presenter. Thank you thank you. So, yes, we spoke in so it that there'll be no work in the cellar. The Edition will be on the three existing floors and we'll be going up a story creating a new third floor, so its basement for a second and a new third that'll be set back and the deck on the back. So these are the views of the front which we won't be changing by code. As you mentioned, we have to have a railing. This is sort of you know. You'll, never see it like this, because it is that back but it'll be a brick full story on the top and the rear will be brick as well all the way up. So this is the existing condition. This is the two neighbors we're the middle house, so this one had work done as well, but it's still maintaining the street line which we're hoping to maintain as much as possible and these two slightly taller buildings on either side just a close-up of what it is we'll be replacing the windows to go to the arched window. But that's about it on the front is the original building again we're just going back to the arches, maintaining the existing condition as much as possible on the existing facade again just looking at it, some more, not so much to say about it. So here is you'll see you know tears the building from the corner, so you will see a little bit of it, but very minimally because of the way these larger buildings are on either side. The main thing we wanted to point out is that at the rear, which this is the this is 161, which is the larger building which comes out which has had the work done on it. So our building is not coming out as far as that, but because there is an empty lot and you know it's a garage because there's a parking excuse me here, you will be able to see the back of our railing through the cars. Presumably, so that's sort of our most visible point will be on bike off there. So again, this is the newer building that will be right behind we're not coming out as far as that, but you will see the back of our deck. Presumably if none of the cars were here in real life, I think the visibility will be slight, not so strong, but that is their sort of moment. So here's 163 sorry that was 165, and this is 161, which is so. This was the existing three, but 165 has had already a rear addition and a rooftop addition as well. We will be coming out not quite as far as 165, but the deck will be almost as far so. This is sort of the existing rear yard. It's pretty deep. This is the 165 next to it. The newer building that will be moving alongside this is the roof condition, so we will be coming taller than this building when we go up here, we are at the back yeah. Once we come out, this is 165. The deeper one will be: adding me: hey, that's our 12 seat in there and with our deck, were basically flush with the adjacent building, but our actual building will not come out so again. What you'll be able to see from Wyckoff will be the stair and the corner of the deck through the area, and then we just zoom lands but I, don't think, there's anything particularly exciting. This will be the rear. This is the existing rear view, these two lower ones, so we will come up higher with the addition of the code required railing. This is the rear view, so we are going up and height a full story. This is the section. So again it is coming back. It is step back as we do want to minimize as much as possible the view from the street. All attention to ourselves extent possible and that's the deck at the back. It is you know, getting larger you've been there about ten years and there are more of them. There were, so this is sort of the comparable at the back again we're going up our selves to some degree and the mechanical. You won't be able to see from the street we can set the back far in the building, but there will be. You will be able to see. You know from certain points along the street at the top of the addition for sure, which will be brick there. We are didn't speed too much. All I got right now, it's a twelve foot addition. How does that conclude? Your presentation? Yes I, think that's all I have right now: okay, I will entertain a motion to approve the application to Landmarks Preservation Commission certificate of appropriate appropriateness for 163 Bond Street I move to approve, as presented I, get a second mr. singletery Thank You. Mr. Jordan any discussion on the motion from board members. Yes, I was wondering if the architect has rendering don't have any photorealistic renderings no I mean you will see a couple feet at the top of the railing and the brick, but we don't at the moment have any other questions from board members yeah question C, hi, Cheryl, Street, so I know exactly the building they're talking about this is a building we looked at years ago before we bought our house in Whitehall Street question for you that 161 is huge. It comes back really way. Back, 161 was being done. They went through that parking lot to do all the work. How are you gonna get the work done, you're gonna be going only through 163 or you gonna ask the condo for accessed on Act's 161 for access to do your work. If that was a major catastrophe, they said they did 161. You know what I'm talking about yeah I mean the current owners had mentioned: that's how they did that building. Our current plan is not to do that. I mean to go through 163 I mean work is done all the time in Brooklyn walking through the existing building. So the current plan is not to go through the parking access today and I said: okay, you're, not gonna, calm as far back as 161, then we wouldn't see it. You wouldn't see your back only your extension to the top the church who are you putting on you may probably just see that a little I have no complaints about it, but I was just wondering how you're gonna do all that work without getting access. So any other questions from board members I have a question from Betty fibers on the views of Bond Street. Looking straight at the building, didn't catch any drawing of what we would see in the way of height and I'd. Also like to note, you speak with the neighbors across the street from 163 Bond Street, who would be looking at the building we haven't talked to the neighbors across the street. I mean if you you'll see if you crane your head up, you'd see it. You know straight on it'll, be pretty hard to see the places it'll be most visible from would be. You know here. Basically, you know kind of further down not on bonds, but on the other corner of Wyckoff I, don't think it'll be very visible from you know. Directly across the street I mean on the upper storeys. It will, of course, or not, of course well, but we haven't yet spoken to them. No, because there are people that live across the street and they live in a historic district, we're happy to say, given that I lived in Boerum Hill, most of the effect would be more from the rear and from the front I mean it's. I was living in Boerum Hill. It took me years to realize that there was something by haunting a lot of those buildings when you're on the facades of the front. It's almost everything is really over by every little building. That's there! So any work, that's done usually towards the rear or the top. You don't really confused on see it coming from the street side or from across the street towards another building. It's pretty much cut. You know altogether very close, and so you wouldn't really see much going on at the rear. If you're looking across the street, thank you Bill Speaker anyone else. What was there anyone else who had a question while we're in discussion? Okay, great all in favor? Actually, no sorry Rob! Let's do a roll call, please! Mr. Jordan, yes, Thurston! Yes, no, you know why you know why and I will include that in the letter mr. Brandon snow. Yes, the motion passes by a vote of eight in favor. One opposed. No, it's ten great. Thank you. If you're looking along in the agenda, we're moving on to the next page, I see item here for a street seats application address is 274 Hall Street that looks like la salud diner Matthew Hamilton is the co-owner Terry. Mr. Hamilton made numerous assertions that he had made this application as in past tense. However, a check with the Department of Transportation revealed that he has not made a location and when confronted with that information on agreed that, yes, that is the case. Okay, all right, not sure how to respond to that. Let's move on to conversation of Water Street between old Fulton Street and the bend in the road from the two-way traffic to a one-way, westbound, I'm sure we, some of us will call this I think this was the last thing we discussed. We all got together and so Rob is there any information that you want to share with us regarding this application there was a lot of support from both the Fulton ferry landing Association they presented to the Transportation Committee in November. This went to a full board vote err. The board voted unanimously 39 to zero to zero committee, asked D-O-T to analyze the conditions, and he replied that they did so and agreed with all the community board and the community's suggestion that this one block be made one way like the rest of the street. They are asking for the community boards I'm okay to proceed. So what not? Okay, be the unanimous vote. Well to be honest, D-O-T was before that this be done with a single vote, but the way community board two has historically done. This is vote to request a study and then vote on the results. We are now in that second phase. So here's what is what is what I'm saying right and I'm only trying to be efficient here, I'm, not one who says you know, because we've always done it that we continue to do it I believe in looking at things in determine matter what voted unanimously, I, don't I, don't think, there's need for us to now. Have the exact committee unanimously? Excuse me committee members for being presumptuous, but if we voted once unanimously, why would we vote again now? So you have my full support to write a letter saying we're in support of the study because it didn't contradict the vote of the committee. Do I hear any objections to my statement so for me to the chairpersons report. Is that correct? Yes, great, so report part of why I had been two reasons why I had been a little delayed in? Allow me we're not allowing us to shaumbra work in support of having committee meetings, because that new technology was gonna be a bit of a challenge and we need to walk through some kinks. The board offers wasn't at full capacity. Well, now that we are I would like to announce that in the month of June I'd, like for all committees to effectively have committee meetings using the WebEx technology that we have in place today, I ask that as each of you as chairs and co-chairs, please be patient with the office as they set up your respective meetings. You should not make the presumption that your liaison is then gonna, be the host for your committee meeting. So, for example, I see Carol as lovely face in my window. If Carol Ann is the liaison for your committee, you should not make the presumption that she's going to be a host for your meeting. It may require the resources of other board members, who are a little bit more familiar with the functionality of this tool, because this is the tool that's been recommended to the city agencies, so just exercise patience, I think now we're starting to get the hang of this I will remind everyone that, as we have committee meetings or the month of June, it is important that everyone must register to receive the link to engage and be participant in the meeting. That's a very needed security measure and that helps us keep from having people just photobomber jump in now. Nothing is foolproof because I see I suspect that people could forward the information, at least, if you do, it, gives the board office an opportunity to verify and acknowledge that you should be in a meeting, in which case you will then receive the link and be accepted into the meeting. So we will meet I, expect all of the chairs and co-chairs to work with the office to be able to set up meetings as per the normal schedule, a relative schedule that is and I hope that everyone has a good and efficient meeting, because there could be a lot of items to catch up on or there may not be. But at least we can say that we engaged as we were according to with this new technology and then as customary with the way human board to has been functioning, but then going to summer recess for July and August. In this case, if there's anything that comes up, as is the custom and has been approved, we would act on behalf of the floor board. Any questions make sure that you I guess you guys also have the emails for the public members, especially since our Terry is a member. So for that question, Carlton the board office would retreat the virtual meetings the same way they would as the in-person meetings and whatever notices that would go out, but go out the same way. That would that would be the only way for those individuals to communicate to the board and to the host that they would receive acceptance into the virtual room. So we'll follow doing that. There are some individuals who are not computer literate email. So for those who don't have email, if you happen to know who them is on your respective committees, don't have email, I would suggest so that we don't lose interpretation and have everybody trying to answer questions that may be correct. I mean that advisors, individuals, the court called the board office and together we'll find a solution that will help them get to the meeting. That doesn't mean that it may be something that's acceptable to them, but remember we have limited options because we're limited to technology and distancing our phone numbers, the people could call n key I'm. Sorry repeat that the meetings all have phone numbers that someone could call into from a regular phone in the event that the some reason they couldn't use a computer there aren't there are there is the functionality to be listen-only, so that function is as well. So that's why I said the board office would be the best conduit to communicate that to those who are computer, savvy or those who may not be good question bill. Any other questions from board members yeah, so the somebody from the district office will be assisting so that, as the chair of my committee, I won't have to also moderate the technology. So someone will assist you Betty the same way. They've assisted me: I've, not pressed a button since I've been one in this meeting or the previous. Thank you, that's part of why we took so long because I wanted to work the kinks out so that you could be hands-free and be the queen to off of the community. Other questions. Okay, great. So that concludes my report. I'll turn it over to the district manager caught up in a written report. Hope to have it out in the next few days. So Rob I do have your attention. Would you ask the presenters for both presentations tonight under landmarks to send the hard copy of their respective presentations up David, because I think in some of the comments I referenced, one or two individuals suggested that maybe the information wasn't current and in that way, could you distribute it to the respective to the respective committees and the Executive Committee I can do that. I think they comment with regard to 1:30, st. Felix Street is that the renderings on the architects website are not up to date, but I will get a copies of both of the presentations and I note for everyone that shortly before the LPC hearings, all presentations to the Commission are posted to the Commission's website and you can look at any presentation going back several months if not years and see what it can actually be presented. Is there any other business before the committee tonight? Yeah I was like an update if any everything else that's going on like it's the BQE discussion, just gonna go away for discussion, just gonna go away for a while. You know we've heard that there's no attention or interest at this point, so just every so often, if you guys can update us, it would be great. So, let's that's noted it's a bit of a wild card for tonight, because I'm not sure that there's been much discussion on either those topics. I think everybody's been full Cove it, but, as Dooley is duly noted and as we hear information or as the board office does a good job of producing newspapers, both local city and global I'm. Sure they'll continue to pass that information along, but do we know the wolf will continue to work through that and give everybody an update as information becomes available. Much appreciated. Is there any other business before this committee? Okay, great we're up to fortunate in the agenda where, as community forum as our mind, everyone I mean Jessica, get your stopwatch ready. If there are members who want to speak on the community, you get two minutes literally two minutes, and then you will have to have your comments conclude. So are there any representatives from the community I'd like to speak to on this part of the agenda? Treiber hi Paul? How are you I'm? Fine? Thank you have two minutes Paul. This was yours sure, I'd like to speak to the issue of the use of the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges by pedestrians and cyclists, and as a result of the coronavirus, there has been a large decrease in public transit use in a corresponding increase in cycling and walking. Both of these bridges are already at or over capacity for non motor vehicles. The Brooklyn Bridge is especially problematic due the number of vendors, especially on the Manhattan side, due to the police presence at a narrow choke point on the bridge and the number of tourists who are standing around taking photographs. Often in the bicycle lane, it would be important for the community board and for the community to work with the Department of Transportation to provide safe routes through and around these bridges for people as New York City opens up over the next few months. Well, thank you for pointing that out. I know that the minutes and will reflect your comments to know that members of our office are on this call. It's an extent that we can initiate a conversation with D-O-T. Well, the areas that bound with thinking in Ybor too I think we're more than happy to communicate. That I would also say that points from your part feel free to reach out to DLT as well. I. Think initiatives like this garner more attraction when the more support we have, and so perhaps this is a great opportunity for us to work together to engage in that level of safety. Thank you any other questions from community members. During the community phone hearing. None you need to speak up. Can you hear me now? Yes, real, quick, please go to our website Brooklyn - usa.org for any updates in regards to Cove at 19. We have a cove at 19 web page. We also have a link for people who need who need items, PPE, etc. You can fill out a link there for those who wish to donate. You can also go to this same link. Our office is adapting programming to reach people via video conference. Telephone teleconference and online means you can reach the borough president through Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, and also old fashioned emailing, with sending emails to ask Eric at Brooklyn. Vp nyc.gov, and the only other thing I wish to say, is to thank community board - for posting, the vigil for dr. Georgiana glows. We will be doing this. We have been organizing it with her family for tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m. if you have any questions. Please feel free to reach out to me via email. Most of you have it for those who don't I, won't repeat my email, but you can text me on my cell at 907, seven, four, three, five, twenty nine Thank, You, June and I also want to just follow up and mention that only is the borough president in his office and his entire staff and active and engaging in this remote setup. But there are other city agencies that are also functioning in the same capacity such as the New York, City, Law Department, and, in particular, the juvenile delinquency unit, and so just an example that you know the city is still functioning, and this is a great reminder at least to me that business as usual doesn't mean business going forward. This used to be a time where you would never be able to do business. Virtually and so I'm always someone who's optimistic, and this pandemic has been really a true strain on human life and human society globally. There are things that we're learning through this, and so it helps you keep the perspective that the glass is half-full and therefore the empty. So hopefully this will be something that will allow us to collaborate going forward using as much virtual opportunities and technology as possible. Any other comments from the community before I entertain a motion to adjourn hearing. None I'll entertain a motion to a job before you adjourn. Many I would just like to take Rob and to stop for doing an excellent job of keeping us posted and everything that's going on and every morning I wake up. I see all these emails. There's two dated what's going on, so we stopped thank the week. We think Bob and the staff at the last meeting I think we thank Bob and the staff different things. The staff is okay. We not gonna thank them every night. Thank you for helping me get past the meeting. It was supposed to end at 8:00 at 8:05. So, thank you to the technology powers that let us go five minutes over good night remain safe. Take care, we'll speak to you, so chairs get ready for your meetings in the month of June good night.
