It will be more of a concise way that a representative to communicate the concerns of the community to get to the topic that warrants that level of participation that I'm going to pick up with the agenda and introduction of committee members.
Okay, great next item on the agenda item number four committees for action: finance and personnel This is a review of the fiscal year 2021 budget, which will miss, who has to be voted on.
It's, a proposal for 24 stories, new building on that lot, it's being proposed by the Brooklyn music school, with a developer, partner, and The idea- is that the school would get additional space rehearsal and performance space and would benefit from the income from this property.
First is Brian Kelly from the Gotham organization, and also that he'll precede me and then after me is Shelby green from the chair of the board of directors of Brooklyn, music, school.
We bought the property in 2015, with the idea, after being contacted by leadership at Brooklyn music school, to help create an expansion and combination of market rate and affordable housing.
An iconic building in the district to include Brooklyn music school would be a hundred and sixty four thousand gross square foot development that includes a 20,000 square.
Expansion for BMS, the height of it, would not exceed 285 feet or the shoulder of one hanson would include up to a hundred and twenty homes that would include 30% set aside as moderate- income, affordable, homeownership, affordable, homeownership, being the concept of creating both social and economic equity within the community.
The site, was sold as a development site, but we have boundaries to work with and to make sure we respect our neighbor in context, architecture and design working around these easements and next the project highlights expansion of Brooklyn, music school, creating an educational, cultural hub, a base to serve underprivileged youth, acrosss, Brooklyn and New York City Shelby will talk more about more than three- quarters of the students Are at no pay, meaning this social equity to this, the unique, affordable home ownership, while not intended when Marshall districts have created barriers to affordable housing.
It provides home ownership, as Brian, said, and will provide 20,000 square feet of expansion for Brooklyn music school Shelby.
You all are very familiar with what's happening around the site, but this is a drawing my office put together, showing the two bridges at the water going all the way: up, Flatbush to the park, the development that has happened in downtown Brooklyn and our site is this little red.
Our site is in is in here You know, really, there's the brownstones there's those two buildings I talked about already that were really the eye rises around us, the transit, the church and the BAM, the civic and cultural complex.
It was also very important to us to come up with a use that extended in the historic district, the Civic and cultural uses of BAM of Muse school of the church, and that's one of the key drivers.
We want to establish an appropriate scale of the same Felix treat street wall There's a north lot, line, facade, so St. Felix is in the foreground, Hanson the church.
I think that's clear from this North looking south again, the church, the development site and BMS for the right- Here you can really see that the first, the street wall of BMS really picks up on the cornice line.
Or, in my view, of what the Brooklyn music school has been to the community, what it's doing now and what this project means to BMS and fulfilling its mission.
The student, body, faculty and staff, and even the Board of Trustees, also reflects a mixed demographics of the community and more than 60% of students identify as people of color and more than half the faculty does also, and the school offers every kind of instruction in all your honor of music and arts.
The project will allow the BMS to contribute to the community in another way, as well as Brian, suggested by offering affordable, housing.
Now the Brooklyn Academy music historic district is mostly from what I could see: moderate Drive buildings.
You know our landmark land- use committee secretary and she had a concern that, because of the largeness or the bulk of the property that the that so many families will be moving into that spot and it may affect not just a Brooklyn music school but would affect schools in general that you have so many families coming into that.
One- nine thinks it's right, acrosss from the school, we're curious about what the plan is for the old music school building.
The. Chair of the landmarks Land Use Committee, gave an overview of comments that have come in and hopefully that it's Brian Froud Brian Kelly from yes I need to follow the protocol of allowing my colleagues who sit on an executive committee meeting to answer questions and you get to listen in and I.
You know we do design a lot of buildings and historic districts.
Is that the same architect designed a tower and the church and what we thought was the best and most appropriate was to create a mid ground between the two and something that would form an ensemble as if you know it was the same office and the site.
Next door is available and really create an ensemble where we spent a lot of time and architectural thought and looking at three- dimensional models and renderings and so forth to determine the appropriate height I think this is very important, is pulling the tower away from the streets in a way that really makes it much more gentle on the pedestrian experience.
Um- fer of the site, I think that we heard on some of the letters that came in when you say that you could have built an unlimited Heights I do not want people to be misled, because my understanding is that, as of right, there is no f AR that could have been used to build anything.
Currently, the site is the parking lot itself and one Hansen, and it does not include Polka music school so and under the current zoning there you're right There's a negative F failure, there, any other questions from board.
We are in New York City of what does it take to create progress, and this creates an opportunity for Brooklyn music school who's, laid the groundwork for more than 100 years in Brooklyn, for youth, to expand, not shrink to monetize the value of their rights to own and build out their facility and to create affordable homeownership without use of public capital, meaning not requesting direct subsidy of you know the affordable, homeownership opportunities, so I think when we all sort of take a step back of what could this create?
We hear from the public And I'm going to ask for five questions from members on the call who are not from the community board who's, not part of things that the committee to ask questions once again: five, But before I.
We've met with some of the business focused entities that want to see economic development, but we've also met with the Fort Greene Park Conservancy You know: we've met with Fulton Area Business Alliance, which is really important for small businesses in the neighborhood What I'm talking about Is non businesses, residential people who live close proximity to the project, non- business representatives, I'm, So My, just actual people who so in so the idea behind the meeting to cohesively and strongly communicate what the development was and is we had the meeting in December for a public meeting which we voluntarily came to the board and said we'd like to present this project to the community, so that homeowners on our on St. Felix folks in the neighborhood would have a seat at the table to see what we're proposing You know we created a teaser website, an informational, website, St. music.
I just I do not know that would be most efficient, but any group that is of interest in meeting with us or figure out how they can collaborate with us in Brooklyn, music, school, we're candidly very open to that.
Schools do not get built without capital, so this development that includes affordable home ownership is generating economic activity to also create Brooklyn music, school.
So you're talking about a building between Mih and Brooklyn music school, where more than 40% of the floor area is essentially non revenue generating It does not make profit.
It does not go to transit, but it goes to create a school expansion which otherwise will not get public funding, affordable, home ownership and HPD has massive budget cuts right, now?
Let me ask two things, there's a whole host of individuals that have identified themselves through emails to the board office and through this chat that have strong support for the project and strong support for the music school, as was noted by my colleague and the chair of the committee in his opening remarks.
Mr. Chair I bring it back to you for emotion on the action that needs to be addressed tonight, so that, if you go before the land, most reservation committee for the certificate of appropriateness and application, Both the support for the Brooklyn music school and the concerns for my motion would be to approve the project, but with a 12-story I, rather than as a four- story.
Ask I'm, not asking for a vote I'm just asking for a second I think that they're going to need more height in order to be able to do their 30%, affordable housing, 20,000 square feet for the school I.
Yes, no motion fails to pass by a vote of two in favor A tree application is going to land Well, Preservation Commission for certificate of appropriateness, and the only other thing I can think that we can do is simply a move to approve, as presented so it'll, be the full 24 stories.
It's one of these typical small boy, Boerum Hill stone buildings, and they want to extend it into the rear of the further out Mr. Lee Mr. boarding , the architects Eric Jacobi gives on the call, it's located in the Boerum Hill historical district.
The main thing we wanted to point out is that at the rear, which this is the this is 161, which is the larger building which comes out which has had the work done on it.
Allow me we're not allowing us to shaumbra work in support of having committee meetings, because that new technology was going to be a bit of a challenge The board offers was not at full capacity.
You ask the presenters for both presentations tonight under landmarks to send the hard copy of their respective presentations up David, because I think in some of the comments, I referenced, one or two individuals suggested that maybe the information was not current and in that way, could you distribute it to the respective to the respective committees and the Executive Committee Is that the renderings on the architects website are not up to date, but I will get a copies of both of the presentations and I note for everyone that shortly before the LPC hearings, all presentations to the Commission are posted to the Commission's website, and you can look at any presentation going back several months if not years and see what it can actually be.
It would be important for the Community Board and for the community to work with the Department of Transportation to provide safe routes through and around these bridges for people as New York City opens up over the next few months.
