Let's start the first one is 30 st Felix place in the Brooklyn Academy of Music historic district It's, a proposal for 24 stories, new building on that lot, it's being proposed by the Brooklyn music school with a developer partner, and the idea is that the school would get additional space rehearsal and performance space and would benefit from the income from this property.
First is Brian Kelly from the Gotham organization and also that he'll precede me and then after me is Shelby green from the chair of the board of directors of Brooklyn music school I'm, a senior partner, I've affected, collaborative and hi Just had my second espresso, so I'll talk really fast gravity goes gravity goes a long way in community boy, 2 Yes, with brevity in mind, hi everybody, its Brian Kelly from the Gotham organization.
Building in the district to include Brooklyn music school would be a hundred and sixty four thousand gross square foot development that includes a 20,000 square, the height of it wouldn't exceed 285 feet or the shoulder of one hanson would include up to a hundred and twenty homes that would include 30% set aside as moderate-income, affordable, homeownership, affordable, homeownership, being the concept of creating both social and economic equity within the community.
A zoning law development agreement, The site was sold as a development site, but we have boundaries to work with and to make sure we respect our neighbor in context, architecture and design working around these easements and next the project highlights expansion of Brooklyn music school, creating an educational, cultural hub, a base to serve underprivileged youth across Brooklyn and New York City Shelby will talk more about To this.
We wanted to create an ensemble with the two buildings of the church and the tower were designed by the same architect and built within two years of each other, and we want to be the third element in that complex treat street wall and there's a north lot line, facade The first thing is the two floors of the music school plus.
This new space will mean doubler performance and rehearsal space available to the school, enable the school to offer a digital music lab and allow music production, and it would also involve making the space more accessible to persons of all abilities The project will allow the BMS to contribute to the community in another way, as well as Brian, suggested by offering affordable housing So. We hope that you will support what we believe to be a project that offers many kinds of community benefits back over to the chair over to your questions.
So the middle school would occupied both spaces, the new space and the old space, wouldn't when all the constructions- complete, The chair of the landmarks Land Use Committee gave an overview of comments that have come in and hopefully that it's Brian Froud Brian Kelly from yes I need to follow the protocol of allowing my colleagues who sit on an executive committee meeting to answer questions and you get to listen in It allows us to keep control of the minutes We know who asked questions from the committee and who asked questions from the community, because I heard a lot of dialogue, but no one introduced themselves If you allow me to ask the committee members to ask questions, then we'll find our way to circle back to the community while I do have everyone's attention do not misinterpret what I'm suggesting everyone from the community will not get an opportunity to ask a question to speak on this What I suggest.
We know the difference, but I do think it's helpful for both people to hear what this piece of the puzzle is versus In this case, the Brooklyn Academy of Music historic district This is Dan from FX collaborative this building, really from a zoning point of view, the right under the rezoning would have unlimited height, However, the certificate of appropriateness and the special controls that will be imposed during the euler Pro limited to the design that you see in front of you.
Is that the same architect designed a tower and the church and what we thought was the best and most appropriate was to create a mid ground between the two and something that would form an ensemble as if you know it was the same office and the site next door is available and really create an ensemble where we spent a lot of time and architectural thought and looking at three-dimensional models and renderings and so forth to determine the appropriate height and, at the end, the two things that really sealed it for us is one keeping it below the shoulder of one Hanson and two and I think this is very important, is pulling the tower away from the streets in a way that really makes it much more gentle on the pedestrian experience.
The site is the parking lot itself and one Hansen, and it does not include polka music school so and under the current zoning there you're right there's a negative F failure there, any other questions from board members, Mr Singletary just had one and maybe I missed this, but all the affordable housing would be on that one site There would be correct all in this building one front door: So it's a tremendous opportunity for moderate income, households , you know footprints down and in the neighborhood and build beyond social equity economic equity and that, instead of paying their landlord rent every month, they get to advertise a you know a moderate small mortgage so I, that's a tremendous attribute to the affordable homeowners, homeownership concept.
We are in New York City of what does it take to create progress, and this creates an opportunity for Brooklyn music school who's laid the groundwork for more than 100 years in Brooklyn, for youth, to expand, not shrink to monetize the value of their rights to own and build out their facility and to create affordable homeownership without use of public capital, meaning not requesting direct subsidy of you know the affordable, homeownership opportunities, so I think when we all sort of take a step back of what could this create?
We hear from the public and I'm gonna ask for five questions from members on the call who are not from the community board who's, not part of things that the committee to ask questions once again: five, That, though, when you, when you were speaking just now, you mentioned about ways to be inclusive and ways to help I'm at a time of crisis and I.
Believe another presenter also used the term inclusive What efforts have been made to reach out to the community that, on that part of let's say, business groups that are advocacy for different larger scale initiatives in the district A pocketbook neighbors who may be affected are in close proximity to the project So in terms of yes, we've met with some of the business focused entities that want to see economic development, but we've also met with the Fort Greene Park Conservancy You know: we've met with Fulton Area Business Alliance, which is really important for small businesses in the neighborhood What I'm talking about is non businesses, residential people who live close proximity to the project, non-business representatives I'm, so my just actual people who so in so the idea behind the meeting to cohesively and strongly communicate what the development was and is we had the meeting in December for a public meeting which we voluntarily came to the board and said we'd like to present this project to the community, so that homeowners on our on st Felix folks in the neighborhood would have a seat at the table to see what we're proposing You know that it's we can post it to the community board, but same field music and living comm We held the community board meeting - as a follow-up to that informational website.
So we've aimed to be transparent early on can I, say I've knocked on everybody's door, I just I, don't know that would be most efficient, but any group that is of interest in meeting with us or figure out how they can collaborate with us in Brooklyn music school, we're candidly very open to that Is. There way that we can, in a digital format, acknowledge non-members by you know having them raise their hands like how's Eric control.
Let me ask two: things, there's a whole host of individuals that have identified themselves through emails to the board office and through this chat that have strong support for the project and strong support for the music school, as was noted by my colleague and the chair of the committee in his opening remarks.
Mr chair, I, bring it back to you for emotion on the action that needs to be addressed tonight so that if you go before the land, most reservation committee for the certificate of appropriateness and application, both the support for the Brooklyn music school and the concerns for my motion would be to approve the project, but with a 12-story I, rather than as a four-story height.
My motion approve as president second by bill Flournoy It's, because one of the public members did bring up a point currently right now we're seeing in the city If the market rate housing are going to be at a rate that will support the entire Yes. The motion passes by a vote of seven in favor , two opposed no extension That's unless, under the sound of my voice for the participation and for the presentation tonight, we go on to the next item on the agenda: 163 Bond Street, mr Gordon 163, Bond Street, it's in the bowl Your back of the building things they're looking to do a extend the rear of their building, also partial, with on the third floor, and they want to put in a railing as well towards you know, which would be in compliance with the code, but basically what I want to do is if they would step in there.
One way like the rest of the street They are asking for the community boards Okay be the unanimous vote.
That doesn't mean that it may be something that's acceptable to them, but remember we have limited options because we're limited to technology and distancing our phone numbers, the people could call That's why I said the board office would be the best conduit to communicate that to those who are computer, savvy or those who may not be good question bill, so the somebody from the district office will be assisting so that, as the chair of my committee, I won't have to also moderate the technology Thank.
It's an extent that we can initiate a conversation with d-o-t I Think initiatives like this garner, more attraction when the more support we have- and so perhaps this is a great opportunity for us to work together to engage in that level of safety Thank you any other questions from community members, During the community phone hearing, Brooklyn - usaorg for any updates in regards to Cove at 19.
