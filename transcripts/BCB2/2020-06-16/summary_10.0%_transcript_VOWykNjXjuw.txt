If people can see you at the time, you're speaking so I will let you know when topics are open for comment by Committee, Members, Board members and the general public, if you, as you, know, we're doing this through WebEx. If you have questions that do not get her during our public comment.
If you require any accommodation or assistance or you know of anyone who needs those things for full participation, please contact the district office at least 72 hours before any public meeting takes place.
Not only is she great, but she is very highly skilled when it comes to technology, so Taya Mueller is our new liaison working with the with the Parks Committee Caroline Church has done a phenomenal job.
I'm, always delighted to have people from the parks Department here I think we work closely with them.
The topic is capital projects in general, but I think your focus is going to be on Commodore Barry Park, which is something that's very dear to everybody's heart on this committee and put a lot of focus on it and as well as the other Park, so I'm going to turn it over to you Davy, and thank you again for being here great Thank, You Barbara and thank you thank you.
You I did not think to ask beforehand, but hey I may have whether you have a PowerPoint I , do not know how I have a PowerPoint for the capital Ah, okay, so I can figure that out, but I just want to maybe go through the Covid-19 response.
Users and the safety of our staff, as you know, members of the community that also service parks and help maintain that.
So, you know initially when people needed to stay home because of childcare, issues.
You know I, think in the interest of safety, we've had to close a lot of parks, amenities and I You know from the event perspective.
This thing is changing everyday, but what I can recommend is if you're thinking about it, get your permit in and if you have any question, Nancy and her staff are amazing in the permit office, so Nancy Jose, Joe Darnell, all those guys can help you out so feel free to give them a call Nancy's in the office, most day.
The last thing I'll say that community gardens have been closed, but what we've been allowing through our green thumb program is for some people to you know for a kind of the minimal amount of maintenance to happen in order to keep these Gardens alive and well so green thumb gardens are closed, but You know some maintenance can take place.
You can work with Dave, Barker I think he's starting some of these programs up as well, but for the most part, it's just very small, kinda self, sufficient volunteer groups are allowed to come back from the park.
Can, you share sort of the dynamics behind that, and you know the suggestions that I've heard have been proactive, like people should take their own garbage out so which exists in a lot of parks.
Yeah I think we've had a lot of success with that Now that Suzanne's question was a little bit about the garbage.
You touched on not having a seasonal stab, but with all of like the protests and the March that are happening, a lot of them start or end in our district, like a cabbie Plaza or tree park.
The organizers, I, think, are dealing directly with the police with respect to the trash, and you know that just comes from any large gathering of people.
We are just kind of where we're just being cognizant of the event and trying to send our people back out once the event has cleared out so like admin once they go, acrosss the bridge or for once they come down You know, and you know, and definitely trying to try to keep in the park as the best of the clean.
If there was something I think in Manhattan, where you know I, think Park staff kind of did not read the room in terms of you know what was what was kind of more of a money from the temporary monument or lunch See , those like white ghost bikes around the city, so some of them They see something that has a little bit work here, put into it to just kind of check to make sure before they just remove it.
We do not have any plan at the moment to open up the large pavement area, but I wish I had a better answer for you, but at the moment there's no point: Are you trying to envision Carroll Park, because I have been there Anyone with authority been on a site visit of Bridge Park to because it appears like there's a like very tall, serious metal gate that could separate the two so to the right to what seemed to be a reason why it could I just wonder if it's actually been closely looked at or if it was just sort of you know, part of it, especially since the park is going to be renovated.
Is there any plan to put social distancing markers in any of the areas where people are gathering Obviously the huge issue with Domino Park Yeah, not in our district, but that you know they had introduced the social distinct circles.
You know I, think there's a bit of an enforcement issue with respect to like mulling circles in it.
You know if you have suggestions, we're open to them and we can listen to them, but nothing's planned for at the moment, I think.
I think one conception that people have is that you know you just need to get the guys to the site.
I think the timeline is even more delayed and You know we're looking at projects that we're supposed to start in the spring, getting pushed back to late summer or even into the fall, if not sometime, in 2021, because you know some of these projects made it through the procurement cycle to the point where they were bid out and they and we had a contractor on board ready to go.
We've had a lot of issues with trash collection, which was a tough one for us to work out when the Park first opened so well.
So you know just kind of modernizing it that that's all that this project is You know once construction starts clicking along a little bit more next.
We brought this to the community board a couple I think, maybe last year it's we're hoping that it can start this fall.
You know as I think the people in the Parks Committee are aware.
What I heard in general was tell me if I misheard that obviously their delays until the city can figure out the budget impacts from coal bed and have a sort of floats down to Park, but Bridge Park, Given that the funding is in place from the Jehovah's Witnesses like is that Ana different you know?
We might ask them to be removed temporarily during construction, but I think that the new design calls for this Chris Any other questions from non committee.
You know these are the types of things that how I think the budget cuts will start manifesting themselves in your neighborhoods, so just be mindful of that, and obviously we're doing the best that we can.
Let me know, and we can work with you, guys, I'm, trying please reach out to us.
So, but what you could do is start thinking about topics for on the fall while ways looking for new topics and I.
