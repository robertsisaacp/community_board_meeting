We really appreciate it, we're going to be talking tonight both about Commodore, Barry, Park and perhaps capital projects in general about the parks and also work on our annual update of capital projects If anybody who is not a committee member has something that they want to say about those things briefly, at this point in time in a moment, I will give you the opportunity to do so.
The topic is capital projects in general, but I think your focus is gonna, be on Commodore Barry Park, which is something that's very dear to everybody's heart on this committee and put a lot of focus on it and as well as the other Park Everyone at Community, Board to for hosting us tonight, Denise Palmer, the regional manager for West Brooklyn, so covering kamini board to couldn't join us tonight.
You know, members of the community that also service parks and help maintain that So. You know initially when people needed to stay home because of childcare issues.
I've been in the office every day as how are our field staff, so they are essential workers You, know, I, think I think you know I, don't know if in community board, to your people clapping at 7:00 o'clock every night, but you know parts workers are also in that You know these are people putting themselves out there That said the important stuff for you guys, as the parks committee is kind of, how does that shake out in parks?
You know I, think in the interest of safety, we've had to close a lot of parks, amenities and I This time, I, don't think we're taking any applications for special events: leap, sports, leagues, similar things, sports leagues, have been canceled through the end of the summer season.
I know that the mayor said he's still looking into it, but there are just a lot of logistics in terms of hiring workers getting them on board and in addition to the lifeguards there's, you know, if there's a lot of our seasonal staff that works at the pools, as you guys might encounter during summer, Similarly on swimming city beaches are open.
You know we're trying to take actions that will limit the net amount of team sports or activities where people you know just because, due to the nature of the recreation, will come into contact with each other You know something like soccer is something that we're seeing that people are I will say that our rec staff has done amazing work, trying to bring some of that program online to parks at home, its NYC parks at home, maybe Chrissy and Olli Walks virtual talk, part tours another class with part staff The last thing I'll say that community gardens have been closed, but what we've been allowing through our green thumb program is for some people to you know for a kind of the minimal amount of maintenance to happen in order to keep these Gardens alive and well so green thumb gardens are closed, but you know some maintenance can take place and then maybe I'll open up for questions If you have groups of volunteers of ten or less and you'd like to volunteer, please you know reach out to your OC, your so your outreach coordinator, you know I, think we're looking to allow groups that regularly volunteer Barker, I Think he's starting some of these programs up as well.
Okay, We don't have any plan to do any signage about it at the moment, but you know I think one thing we're grappling with is not having our full summer seasonal staff and at that hurt a lot.
We have a large sign committee, so You know or the signs in Brooklyn or we try to do it as a citywide, I think we've had a lot of success with that Now that Suzanne's question was a little bit about the garbage you touched on not having a seasonal stab, but with all of like the protests and the March that are happening, a lot of them start or end in our district, like a cabbie Plaza or tree park, Are you hiring extra staffer or your current staffers doing overtime to make sure that the parks are still clean.
You know we are just keeping it the whole site locked off at the moment there We don't have any plan at the moment to open up the large pavement area, but I wish I had a better answer for you, but at the moment there's no point: Are you trying to envision Carroll Park, because I have been there Has anyone with authority been on a site visit of Bridge Park to because it appears like there's a like very tall, serious metal gate that could separate the two so to the right to what seemed to be a reason why it could I just wonder if it's actually been closely looked at or if it was just sort of you know, part of it, especially since the park is going to be renovated and I'm gonna call a multi-purpose flight area Is there any plan to put social distancing markers in any of the areas where people are gathering You, know , I.
Oh, like you know, if you could Spence the 10 feet apart and tell people that that's where they can sort of set up their little picnic, you know it might just without enforcement Anyone, who is not a committee member before I, just with us, Carolyn I, think I've been meaning to say hello to you.
I think the timeline is even more delayed, and you know we're looking at projects that we're supposed to start in the spring getting pushed back to late summer or even into the fall, if not sometime, in 2021, because you know some of these projects made it through the procurement cycle to the point where they were bid out and they and we had a contractor on board ready to go some projects, never even made it to that point, and so the Office of Management and Budget is kind of telling us to just slow down a little bit and to hold back from releasing new bids until they can kind of inventory, How much damage, I.
You know as I think the people in the parks committee are aware.
You know these are the types of things that how I think the budget cuts will start manifesting themselves in your neighborhoods, so just be mindful of that, and obviously we're doing the best that we can If there's anything the committee can do to help you Barbara I am sorry to report that since Davey first stopped speaking, we've all been trying to get rid of individual We should have also put up here the statement of community district needs, and that would make it easy to go through it as we do that The look at this statement of community needs, so I hope people have looked at it, I'm open to changes or do we need to remove anything I have something I'd like to add when we get so the question: first, you speak up a little bit.
