Instead, we're I have an update on the parse Department capital projects, so With that I think I can amend that on my own Rob and then ask for approval of the agenda based on that change.
I am , I'm, always delighted to have people from the parks department here, I think we work closely with them.
The topic is capital projects in general, but I think your focus is gonna, be on Commodore Barry Park, which is something that's very dear to everybody's heart on this committee and put a lot of focus on it and as well as the other Park Everyone at Community, Board to for hosting us tonight, Denise Palmer, the regional manager for West Brooklyn, so covering kamini board to couldn't join us.
If you I didn't think to ask beforehand, but hey I may have whether you have a PowerPoint , don't know how I have a PowerPoint for the capital, So Covid-19, 18, right, I.
You know, members of the community that also service parks and help maintain that.
That said, the important stuff for you guys, as the parks committee, is kind of.
You know I, think in the interest of safety, we've had to close a lot of parks, amenities and I This time, I don't think we're taking any applications for special events, leap, sports, leagues, similar things, sports leagues, have been canceled through the end of the summer.
This thing is changing everyday, but what I can recommend is if you're thinking about it, get your permit in and if you have any question, Nancy and her staff are amazing in the permit office, so Nancy Jose, Joe Darnell, all those guys can help you out so feel free to give them a call Nancy's in the office, most day.
The last thing I'll say that community gardens have been closed, but what we've been allowing through our green thumb program is for some people to you know for a kind of the minimal amount of maintenance to happen in order to keep these Gardens alive and well so green thumb gardens are closed, but you know some maintenance can take place.
You share sort of the dynamics behind that, and you know the suggestions that I've heard have been proactive, like people should take their own garbage out so which exists in a lot of parks.
Yeah I think we've had a lot of success with that Now that Suzanne's question was a little bit about the garbage.
We are just kind of where we're just being cognizant of the event and trying to send our people back out once the event has cleared out so like admin once they go across the bridge or for once they come down You know, and you know, and definitely trying to try to keep in the park as the best of the clean as we can.
In the lines of you see those like white ghost bikes around the city, so some of them They see something that has a little bit work here, put into it to just kind of check to make sure before they just remove.
We don't have any plan at the moment to open up the large pavement area, but I wish I had a better answer for you, but at the moment there's no point: Are you trying to envision Carroll Park, because I have been there Has anyone with authority been on a site visit of Bridge Park to because it appears like there's a like very tall, serious metal gate that could separate the two so to the right to what seemed to be a reason why it could I just wonder if it's actually been closely looked at or if it was just sort of you know, part of it, especially since the park is going to be renovated.
And I'm gonna call a multi-purpose flight area Is there any plan to put social distancing markers in any of the areas where people are gathering Obviously the huge issue with Domino Park Yeah, not in our district, but that you know they had introduced the social distinct circles.
You know I, think, there's a bit of an enforcement issue with respect to like mulling circles in it.
You know if you have suggestions, we're open to them and we can listen to them, but nothing's planned for at the moment, I think.
I think one conception that people have is that you know you just need to get the guys to the site.
We've had the budget approved and it was in construction for those sites that have yet to start construction,, I think the timeline is even more delayed and You know we're looking at projects that we're supposed to start in the spring, getting pushed back to late summer or even into the fall, if not sometime, in 2021, because you know some of these projects made it through the procurement cycle to the point where they were bid out and they and we had a contractor on board ready to go.
I know: we've had a lot of issues with trash collection, which was a tough one for us to work out when the Park first opened so well.
So you know just kind of modernizing it that that's all that this project is We brought this to the community board a couple I think.
You know as I think the people in the parks committee are aware.
What I heard in general was tell me if I misheard that obviously their delays until the city can figure out the budget impacts from coal bed and have a sort of floats down to park, but bridge park, , Given that the funding is in place from the Jehovah's Witnesses like is that Ana different, you know?
Rather, the look at this statement of community needs, so I hope people have looked at it , I'm open to changes or do we need to remove anything I have something I'd like to add.
I did you know one of the big takeaways is that whenever Dee cast is looking for space in downtown find boss a real barrier that they have trouble surmounted, they think that will police on 350, J Street is up in a few years, and there may be a lot of moving around at that time, with potentially community board to damn.
Think then, we've gotten through here with little glitches, and did you make it onto the call I know you were here at least part of the time, but we'll have to work on that with Andrea, As we heard Davey say you have to be flexible and things change by the day, so we may be doing it this way, again.
