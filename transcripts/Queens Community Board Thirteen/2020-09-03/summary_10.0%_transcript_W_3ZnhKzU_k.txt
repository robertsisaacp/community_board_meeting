This particular powerpoint has been crafted, so people who have children who are going to school or working with children going back to school will have a full understanding of what is involved in terms of mental and infectious rates regarding cov19, and I want to thank all of everybody who's presenting tonight and Returning back to community board 13, we're excited to be with you all tonight and behalf of dr marez and our team were just grateful for the partnership with community board 13.
I know there are a ton of questions that folks have on their mind, and so we are delighted to have members of our behavioral health and medicine service line here with us tonight to kind of look at the facts and then we're going to invite dr peter tamiko, who is director of psychological services, a part of our behavioral service line, to speak more about the stress and the uncertainty around covid19 from a psychological perspective and leave you all with tools and tips and tricks.
How does one go about reopening a school in the context of a rapidly changing pattern of community spread of a pandemic that has not been seen in this world for over a hundred years, and the decision to reopen schools involves weighing the public health risks of opening against the educational and other risks of keeping buildings closed, in-person instruction for kindergartens through grade five and special needs.
Fortunately, new york is in a much better situation than it was before and that's why we're having this conversation Many of you have read about this, and some of these slides actually come from the newspaper, but, as you know- There is a full-time school model and the model for right now for new york, as you've heard, is one to three days per week in school.
As you probably know, a contact is somebody who spends 15 minutes or more by definition, within a six foot radius of a case without them both having protected ppes and in the case of a school, since nobody is going to be wearing eyewear and many of the young children may or not be able to keep their masks on.
a risky and difficult event chicago third largest school district in the united states is not going to open and is fully online, but their rates are much higher than new york, Schools across new york can reopen this fall if they're in a region where the average rate of positivity is below five percent, but, as I said, we're below one percent most of new york has new york city virtually all of it right now, as we speak, all of it is below one percent, all five boroughs, many teachers and parents across the state have expressed concern as the viruses spike in other states post-school opening This is, of course, people are afraid.
Many people in new york city are essential workers that have to go to work and depend on their schools to watch their kids.
Many people in new york city depend on schools for their kids to get food and across the country So these are important considerations that cannot be overlooked in decisions about reopening the school now.
Drivers of Covid-19 19 spread in the general population, as it's been demonstrated with rsv and gastrointestinal disease, but as a general rule, they seem to be much safer than teenagers, and I also has- These kids are going to leave school and if you think that you're going to be able to control the habits of a 16 or 18 year old kid and keep them quarantined or keep them with a small number of people, it's extraordinarily difficult.
It's going to depend most importantly, as I said, on, the community rates have spread, and fortunately in new york, they're good, but I also think that it's not going to be without problems, You can be prepared that there's going to be another classroom or another school where it's going to crop up, and you want those whack-a-moles to be reasonable and not to result in large outbreaks and under those circumstances, We can hope for problems with grandparents problems with people watching children coming home from school.
You know, you'd have to get folks who are over a century old to have anything similar to what has been experienced before and hear stories about it, and you know similar kinds of conflicts about keeping people's masks on, and you know fines for such and having a conflict in the social order in terms of keeping ourselves safe with this invisible enemy- I was just speaking to somebody this morning and as dr farber was saying, the announcement from new york city public schools that now you know they're not going to open until the 20th or so or a couple of weeks, hence from the original plan and all and just that news there was well , I think that's going to be my job.
You know they were really on a tight rope in terms of being late, and you know in terms of spring and as as school was you know in terms of child care issues, and this looks like it was gonna, be the piece of information that was just gonna be too much, The degrees of stress that people are dealing with in terms of even anticipating what's to come, so work challenges.
You know your family like each other anymore, and so we wondered we wanted that in the middle of the summer, with her with our kids, you know and establishing new routines and trying to deal with the increased proximity, and you know getting thrown off your routines and your way of life at home and folks are dealing with considerable losses.
A parent, a family can opt for full remote and it's just a form to fill out, or you know, communication to be made, and that can happen at any time going forward.
or I should a rel, a relative, a sense of hope in terms of what you know what you could be wishful about, drawing some positive meaning from difficult times identifying yourself as someone who is persevering as a coping family, and we certainly hear that from a lot of our health care workers.
and again I mentioned earlier, creating new family rituals or routines, I think, is important for us to feel grounded in what those can look like some role issue about roles- You know, trying to coming home from work and then also having to deal with or trying to work from home and then also trying to deal with the remote learning from school, and you know and trying to not, you know not being able to have access to child care and trying to pull off this.
So our families have talked about that too, in terms of helping out so again, preservation of routines and then also creating new ones overall, with a child who we been working with in the clinic as an example with the expected school was a kid who who was?
So this kid was trying to adjust to the to the light to the home life of remote learning and was really thrown off the fact that he had jim or wasn't having jim In terms of you know the school and the the schedule where he at 10 o'clock was expecting to be in gym then and english was moved to 10 30 as it had been in the school, and it really calmed things down for him.
This example working that out and then, of course, try and find time for self-care and some fun information sharing, again really important that you are here tonight, listening even at least being informed about your school's plan, their response to the governor, their response to the department of education, their you know, promise so to speak to you and the neighborhood and the city and the student body, and being informed about that and sharing that with your kids in terms of knowing what to expect I would practice some mask wearing if it's not something that you know you've been doing and going out And so you know you might want to practice that some and have some exposure to that before they get in there, but you know being letting them know what to expect and what the plan is and that kid should be wearing mass staff.
I mean what I would tell my kid just like you would mention and or have a plan for them in terms of bullying that might be going on in the school.
