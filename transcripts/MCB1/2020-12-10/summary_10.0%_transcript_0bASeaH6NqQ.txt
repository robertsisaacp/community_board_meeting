This is the battery Park City Committee of Community Board, one I am Tammy.
If you would like to be on the email list for the environmental protection, which will be reviewing all of the resiliency plans of battery park city in detail, please make sure that you email the office or Justine.
Although I haven't been at the other meetings for the environmental committee, Eric I, don't know that Nick is here, I haven't seen that, yes, he is, and he can unmute him here.
So, Let's go through the conversation that battery Park city authority came through with us in the environmental protection meeting was about the picnic lawns.
The conversation was about moving lawns from the right side when you're looking at the screen, which is considered the south side further over to the north side, the circulation maps that you see have to do with the ways that you may experience and experience the park.
The summary from these presentations were that they liked option one out of one and two, but they wanted to retain the south long as well, in whatever form it was, and that the possibility of adding not more natural plants for them to attack attain wedge design could be done in the pavilion area or other areas, and that the request was to go back to the drawing board, find ways to add more native plantings and less cement.
The people that are not talking, mute, their microphones, I think it's makes microphones like pretty distracting.
Study two is very similar, but in response to us saying that we didn't like the fact that you couldn't have any type of access from the front of the street, there is like a seating area that could be walked up as in long steps that you see that's more towards the south side of the service.
This was again in response to the conversation of not having any access towards the front, and here you have on the north side a the seating area, like you saw in study two and a ramp added on the south side for three, and what that does.
That's an elevation, look at just the large green swaths again, There's no entrance access for the public, except on the northern side, very similar to one, but the difference is instead of multi-sections of varying levels of planting, It's just kind of a large hill walk-on.
You can see that the major pedestrian circulation and the bike circulation does not necessarily work out, because the dialogue became the fact that you're not providing a place for bicyclists who are coming off the bike path that are on in battery park.
If they are not crossing onto the greenway you're, then pushing them on to the lower levels of the esplanade which may or may not be functional, because if there's an event, you're not going to be able to go that way, so then you're forcing people to go up the Las up the hill with all of the pedestrians.
So we'll keep going and the concerns that were raised by Bob Schneck last time, was: yes, there may be a railing, but that's an awfully long way to go.
Looking at the drainage here, there needs to be two places that they are able to access the system the conversation became is the plan is to put one in the north, and one in the south.
They may need two in the south, and these are to check and see what's going on with the drainage that is below ground, which we know is what flooded, for example, over by the millennium and the Wagner Next Lucian next.
The bike is in the grass and tree area to remove the grass and tree area along little West, Street and then existing tide gate is the Purple box and what they said was you have to be within a certain square feet from the interceptor gates our questions and have not been answered yet are whether or not they can be located in the crosswalk, because there is a large area of crosswalk that is not underground, that is over by Morris.
This call is whether or not you'd have to alienate parkland, because the promenade is mapped parkland next same things: control locations next, So this shows what they're talking about you can see the Wagner on the right, the Orange Box, for what they're looking at looks benign, but you have to imagine all those trees would go away because you need to build something.
Is, If we put it in this in the middle of West Street, we have to move it far enough away from the battery park, underpass that it's not going to interfere with the retaining wall, but there's so much space in the middle.
There's does seem to be flexibility, The places that they, the concerns that the community have or do not seem to match with the concerns of this slide, is actually good for showing a constraint that they're they say they're operating under, which is that the gate that this control house controls needs to be south of that M9 box, which you can see, is basically right there at first place, and it said, was that was optimal.
We discuss it on the call and whether Nick or Eric, can speak to that, I'm unsure, but they said that the control House could go further north as long as it is within 200 feet of the gate, But the gate had to be south of N9 itself right and the gate is on the right.
The conversation was nobody thought it was a good thing to take space out of the West Thames Park because to build a 10-foot gate house there, because that is the lawn area for West Thames Park.
Don't think we asked that question because that feels like I mean that hotel.
We going to discuss the placement of one of these kind of eyesores right near that beautiful park, where the kids are playing, or is that good too.
Commission is keen on keeping a fairly consistent aesthetic for these types of structures, So I think that what they're going to want to do is try and keep them look consistent across all the projects, so, whether it be battery park, city or East, side, coastal resiliency, Et, cetera, I, don't know how much wiggle room there's going to be I, don't want to speak for the Pdc, but I also want to make it clear to the folks in Nepal.
It's, not just the battery park city authorities call as to what these things look.
This is where the committee asked whether or not you could have the stair-like things there and also an elevator in the center to provide parity if possible.
But I, think Betty alluded to an interesting point, which is what are we trying to accomplish with an entrance at that point, making it easier who wants to enter at that point other than people being dropped off on cars and cars.
Now lots of people who actually live here are going to have a less charmed life, because I think some, at least from the people I talk to and meet.
That being said, I think that resiliency as I've thought for years, is a really major issue, and one of the opportunities that, in my opinion, If I were a ruler of this process, would be to drive economical solutions that could work.
That would kind of solve the resiliency problems without building huge restaurants or centers, without tearing up that those wonderful gardens without changing those spaces in front of puree that I'm very comfortable with, without disrupting those existing bike paths that worry had so I would ask that we focus on coming up with the simplest solutions, not spending a lot of money using that money for other things, because there's going to be more other things that people have to worry about than ever before, so I could enter into all of these discussions, about which one of these, what kind of advantages are there are to this entrance or that entrance.
I think that now we're going to have more and more people on more and more kind of little electric vehicles, we're going to even need to think of new parking spots and imagine new ways to handle those, because if you have one you wouldn't park it on the street, you'd try and get it up to the up to next to the restaurant.
Simply raising you know the way Bob suggested doing something right along the edge, but making a promenade on top of that, So that, yes, you have the park with the usable, workable spaces, but you also have a new Vista up.
Bunker, is not going to be a very attractive solution or do much to enhance property values in that building or anywhere else on little West Street, and there are alternative places to put that the median solution was probably the best in terms of its aesthetic appeal, whether it can be done from an engineering, perspective.
That's my question: Did you meet in the promenade Bob. Other fact is that placing not in the promenade itself, but in the planters that are between the bicycle and the promenade that actually reduces the least amount of greenery and trees, whereas putting it on the street you're removing three or four major trees that provide shade and a great deal of attractiveness to that Vista.
Can, you know connecting the battery to the rest of Manhattan through this beautiful park.
Those are going to be saltwater, resistant species of trees, selected, okay, yes, My understanding is just perfect, I, think I kind of know that I'm well confirmed, But I.
Okay I, don't know the answer to that, but very good question and probably a combination of expertise from DEP, maybe somewhat less than eot, and the Public Design Commission, Of, course, I think would want to have a pretty consistent, aesthetic but very good question.
Then I'm, just gonna go back to the lawns and go back on record, saying that I see no reason that you couldn't take a look at making retaining the south lawn and keeping a north lawn and finding ways to incorporate native plantings within the amphitheater that you're building in other places, to be able to reduce the amount of concrete.
I think we're an alignment there, which then brings to the point Justine's taking it from here about the fiscal and physical distancing concerns for Wagner, Park, Resiliency.
After, looking at the Wagner park, the latest design for the southern Battery park, city, in light of, what's going on with coal, the whole Corona virus pandemic and Covid-19, and the New York on paws and physical distancing, and also the shellacking that our economy has taken since February and March because of the virus and really truly not much of an end in sight until a vaccine comes which might be 20, 21, 22, 2022.
We also want the committee to talk about it and think about this sorry hold on one second, because I think I'm getting a food delivery, but give me I can't mute, myself.
Park's resiliency is based on the idea that we have to protect our community all of battery park city, as well as all of lower Manhattan from flooding.
The question that we're looking at and proposing today is focus on what must be done to protect property, save the money that you've raised and push it towards other things in battery park.
What would be, when is all built, a continuous flood barrier from as far as the 23rd from the East side, all the way down through two bridges around the battery up through battery park city and then ultimately, above battery park city up on the West side, it's coastal resiliency to protect vast swath of lower Manhattan, there's a slide that we repeatedly show and.
We put in all our presentations that talks about the amount of amounts of land and amount of buildings we're protecting and, If I have it right, our battery park, city, residency, project, contemplates flood, protection.
What I'm, asking about is whether or not we have to go through the expense of renovating a restaurant and building more space for the battery park.
At a time when there's such other urgent needs such as parkland and park, space and open spaces for the people in this community and all of lower Manhattan that are flat flocking to us, And if we can push this off push off some major stuff.
That would then be able to be scaled back once the north and the South Battery Park city, unity, Projects, were in place because the assumption it was built upon is that the North state, Park, City and south side of the park city projects are permanent projects and once those kind of pain, points or pinch points are sealed off, You would no longer need to have that extra protection at all field.
A question, for you is what portion of the overall southern battery Park city budget is the cost of Wagner just Wagner itself.
The concern that Justine outlined I think is shared by many, that the proportion of costs that to the overall budget that you've got for just the Wagner Park facility seems like pardon the bad comparison.
I. Think as Justine outlined earlier, there's not much there by way of protection of the residential and commercial properties in battery park.
Because, again, as I said, What the soft battery fluctuations project contemplate is protecting that entire swap of lower Manhattan and the reason why South battery city, the project that we started, design on first or very close timing wise with the ball field, is because the area's most affected by Hurricane Sandy, you recall, was the hinge by Puree Plaza, where the water poured in and then around behind five center high school on the left highway that wiped out our ball.
However, Lisa I'm, going to send you something now, if you don't mind doing it up, but one of our prior presentations that we made to the community I think it was south battery park city going to project.
Send you, the second one we did in January, was that same coastal lobby under the same conditions assuming 30 years, they're, 30, inch, 30, inches of heat level rise by 2050, and it shows what happens when our south standard proximity, resiliency alignment is in place and you'll see that it protects all of the areas that we're talking about residences, commercial, establishments, subsurface, infrastructure, etc.
Nick I think we're going at it and kind of dancing around the same thing and yet not reaching the same conclusion.
Thank, goodness you guys are addressing that, and you are what I'm saying is use, whether it's deployables or some something else at the moment to protect and connect the pieces by Wagner Park.
Democracy for battery park city is still saying: 300 million is enough, and I don't see how we're going to do everything that needs to be done and still have the conversation about affordability.
As in battery park city, We have no deal on Gateway Plaza, yet we are still looking at ridiculous, pilot.
You know I'm open to any discussion, but I want to call on other people.
And I think that my concern has always been about coordinated New, York, City planning for lower Manhattan, and I've always thought about how important it is to straighten out things with the army corps of engineers.
If I were the boss, here, is to say, we have to figure out how we can do things that are inexpensive and practical and spend money with really excellent engineers to figure out how to do this as inexpensively as possible, so that we can help ourselves up along the up along where Tribeca is, for example, I think that we should pioneer economical, solutions, not look at all of these at kind of destroying.
And I think that as a community board, we're all responsible for seeing these things in kind of lined up sheets that show us how much they cost.
We talk about resiliency and we talk about sustainability, but you know, in my view, sustainability is a really important word here, because we're talking number one about the environment, we're talking about also financial sustainability and for those of us that want to live in battery park city for a long time, and we want to make the money last, It's, really expensive, and, as Bob said, We have something beautiful, so I say that in order to sustain us environmentally and financially that maybe we do what Justine said.
And they're, all streamed, live and online for access after this back, but rest assured that our board always looks at the most cost-effective way of doing this going to make sure things are done in a top-notch fashion to the world-class standards that battery city isn't before, but also obviously done in the most cost effective manner as possible.
One person might not be operating to someone, But these are not things that we're looking to overspend on we're looking to spend exactly as much as we need to make sure that again, hundreds of buildings and thousands of residential units are protected as one continuous integrated system, and there are discussions we directed the committee back to the discussion we had was last launch.
We're seeing bond rating agencies beginning to downgrade bond issuers like the battery park city authority, who don't have appropriate measures in place.
It protects the investment everyone who lives in battery park city, because if we don't do resiliency, then you're not going to be able to get.
It's not a more straightforward thing, but the money we spend on resiliency through the issuance of bonds, which we are in a very lucky position, like necessarily the city of New York, is that we are able to finance these projects ourselves for the issuance of bonds, which allows us the more flexibility that the more kind of aggressiveness they get.
These things done in as timely as fashion is possible, but the money that we spend conditions of bonds or issuance of debt to finance these projects does not one iota affect what you as a battery park.
Put it another way, If we didn't do resiliency whatsoever, which, for all the reasons I just went, through, I, think we all agree, we want to do.
It would simply be more money that goes through to the city of New. There would be less money for battery park city and more money for the city of New York, which is the bond money now money which would still then, incidentally, turn around and be building a resiliency project, except probably in 50 years from now, which means five to ten more years of you getting exposed to storms and not having the protection to be able to get insurance potentially and to see the bond rating decrease, which means, when battery park stays working on a project that you really do want you'd be able to borrow money not as cheaply as we do now because of all our sterling bond rating, so it all packed together.
The battery park city collects each year.
If, we're paying less in bond service, because we've issued less debt, That simply means more money is going through to the city of New York.
We shrink our operating budget, That means more money's going through to the state of New York.
I, don't know what the right answer is, but at the end of the day, I fear, people are going to look to battery park city and say: Oh you're, a cash cow, we'll just keep charging you and charging you.
You know, match up that law and do that and use that money in battery park city for that, If there's a way to make that happen, great, if not, maybe the city needs more money, but then they can also not raise our pilot to create and get more money.
It sounds like what you want to do: is, let's save money and build our community on a foundation of sand.
I. Think that if Betty carefully looks at the plan and looks at the way it's designed around the jewish museum and kind of in the yardage between the jewish museum toward that hill and between the hill and battery Park city, it is not as expensive as building a castle on top of a building a mountain, a mound first and then a castle on top of it.
Think one thing is rather than talking about what kind of finishes we should have, whether we need more stairs here.
I think that what we have here is something that started with a with the controversy over whether or not we needed another restaurant in that park in the first place and it's expanded to this, is it expand.
Now, What that demonstrates chef and thank you very much for driving, But the second thing demonstrates is that modeling updated now with the South Valley Park City residency project alignment, so the same project we've been talking about with that alignment in place.
It shows you the level of protection it provides battery park, city and bath swap will attend, including everyone's home, everyone's business, that's on the dry side of the barrier.
Just one question: is this: showing is this just with the South Battery park city improvements.
Okay, It does go into north battery park city because we haven't that doesn't count for that.
I think we're all saying we all want resiliency.
Think Marianne Braberman has a question in the chat saying: Could we get data about what buildings our experiences is experiencing as far as collecting maintenance on time.
But I did just want to emphasize the fact that you know your the conversation that's being had right, now.
We heard loud and clear that you folks, you know, wanted a replacement for the Wagner Park pavilion.
So I want to move on to the next topic, please, which is applicability of recent changes to city and state law on e-scooters and e-bikes in battery park.
The state law that was passed in the budget session this year essentially created a legal pathway to e-scooters and e-bikes in New York city.
It's saying you can't do it in the parks and then same rights and responsibilities as operators of bikes.
Right like some simple motor, but this is the electric scooter, so it looks like where bikes are permitted in parks.
Talking about air Park lands is what I want to focus it on and we need to sorry go ahead.
The applicability of that when applied to battery park city is to I, don't know what degree when they say the Hudson River, park.
In the same way, so I would have to ask Eric or Nick to comment whether that whether or not e-bikes were even though they're currently against the rules to go on the greenway and Battery park, city.
What I'm saying is if the state law prohibits it and Hudson River park, if it also prohibited it in battery park city, because then it would still, there would still need to be legislation.
Now is legal at this city, but with the Hudson River Park Trust, Bob Tony can give you a very good synapses of the whole thing because they almost spend.
The leadership with at that advisory council made it very clear, they've been discussing it, They do not want e-bikes or scooters or anything, but then every park city, just ended.
In which case maybe battery park city falls in.
So I think it's fair to say that battery park city has no interest in being a separate entity.
They are legal on illegal New, York city in certain areas, We want that same model, I think to apply to battery park city as I understand you can't ride them on sidewalks.
That would be the same kind of approach in battery Park City.
I'm not aware of any building in battery park city that has an entrance on the esplanade, especially down around south coast.
They, open, on, On, South and avenue, or battery place, So there wouldn't be a need for a delivery worker to write down the escort unless they were just looking to ride down the estimate or they didn't know.
I think in most cases, they'd be going right through the doors the building's entrance, which is not on the astronaut and not on the sidewalk, except for the distance that you're getting from the street into the building.
We are part of New York City and want to make sure that we're coordinating with city and state D.O.T, certainly on how that manifests itself, but in as much as the escalators parkland, and these things are not to be written in parks, I think we may be covered, but again I'm, not an attorney and have to research.
So, I, guess glad to hear you're saying you want to do with the Hudson River park.
So, presumably battery Park city authority could amend this rule to match whatever the state law is.
I think then it's important for some representatives from the Battery Park City Committee, to come to the transportation committee meeting.
Rules in battery park city exist exactly the same as they are in all other state.
Setting aside, the important legal considerations could I just ask the committee I recognize that the greenway is a thoroughfare for a lot of cyclists, but are there other areas that are of grave concern as it pertains to motorized bikes, because in independent of what the regulations are, I think it's something that we would want to have our eye on.
People, who use e-bikes and e-scooters in Barre, Park City, because I see them all the time.
You, wouldn't think of going up a one-way, street, but.
And I think there are broader problems, not even in battery park.
So, the first things first is I wanted to go through, as promised with the committee, which we said we would do last week come back with updates on the reopening of battery park city and its various facilities.
Remember that right when they talked about a lot of their projects, now kind of being momentarily quote-unquote pause because of Covid-19 as I understand it like I, don't want to speak for EDC, so please I will reach out to them and ask them to get you guys, an update, but as I understand, it, some of their projects are now slowly coming back.
But I, think the theme of the evening has been the more open public space the better, and we want to try and deliver that to you.
There will be one north battery park, resiliency, meeting.
A lot of things are shared from the battery park city authority and around the district as well, especially during Covid-19.
