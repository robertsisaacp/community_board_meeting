Connecting event, okay, welcome everybody. It's 612.! This is the battery Park City Committee of Community Board, one I am Tammy. Meltzer I am have been the chair of this committee for the last couple of years. I am now chair of CB1, and until everybody is sorted and with our sorting hats, our acting chair will be our co-chair. Justine Kucha, so Justine, I'm here to help turn over for the month of July and then figure out how we move along in August. So we're going to start you're welcome so Justine's going to take a lot of it from here. We have a robot and a some of the overview of the design changes to Wagner. Where is presented at the Environmental Protection Committee, oh Judy's, here, Judith Weinstock, just signed on sorry to interrupt all right. Thank you all for over. Thank you, sorry about that. Thanks, Jude, okay. So one of the things for the Battery Park City Committee to remember is very often updates, depending on the schedule of the battery Park city authority have been given at the environmental protection. Since some changes came quite late. I, don't know about the outreach that was done. I know, I was surprised by some of the things and one would have thought that I might have been in the know. So the first thing we're going to do is go over the changes that were done for shown the slideshow that was shown in environmental. If you have, if you got the agenda, hopefully you had a chance to click through. If you didn't have the agenda, this is going to be a quick sweep swift overview. We have both Nick and Eric on the line who can answer some mild questions. I, don't know about detailed questions, because that belongs to Gwen and her team and a come as far as I was to understand and they're not joining us right. They could. They were unavailable this evening, so it was either show everybody or not, show everybody tonight, no showing everybody. Yes in the future. We are working on our listserv. So if you would like to be on the email list for the environmental protection, which will be reviewing all of the resiliency plans of battery park city in detail, please make sure that you email the office or Justine. So you can be on that specific email list. Even if you are not a part of that committee, all right Lucian, do you mind hitting the slides all right, so am I taking it from here. Tammy yeah I mean whatever I mean. How comfortable are you with the presentation or you want error? I was going to have well I was going to ask Nick or and or Eric to kind of go through it, because I was not at the last meeting, although I haven't been at the other meetings for the environmental committee. So if you want to do it with me or you want to do it on your own or Eric I, don't know that Nick is here. I haven't seen that, yes, he is, and he can unmute him here. Sorry about that yeah! No, what I was prepared to do. Tammy is you know there were items that we covered, so everyone has the context good afternoon, everyone or good evening I should say so. We did a an update with the Environmental Protection committee on June 15th two weeks ago and committed to coming back to the community board later this summer or in September. When we have some substantial updates, we didn't have a whole lot of updates from that last meeting on what we discussed. But if there are questions on what is in what was in the Environmental Protection Committee presentation, then I'm certainly happy to take that feedback and bring it back and answer as best I can yeah there's going to be all right. So, let's go through the conversation that battery Park city authority came through with us in the environmental protection meeting was about the picnic lawns. We have long advocated for less cement and more pink lawns, more commiserate to what the experience in Wagner is currently slides and the conversation go ahead. Lucian the conversation was about moving lawns from the right side when you're looking at the screen, which is considered the south side further over to the north side, the circulation maps that you see have to do with the ways that you may experience and experience the park. Whether or not you're mobility challenged go for it. So the Conversat there were three parts of the conversation and the presentation. This is part one which was the discussion of the removal of a south technical home and adding it to the north side. The very first picture that we saw is that being changed by what these slides are or is that the result of all these changes? This was the current design that they showed with more walls and clamping less lawn on the north side. Yeah please Lucian Option one is you can see where they have added an additional lawn area on the north side. That is still has universal access go ahead option. One shows that the elevation difference from the esplanade up to the top. So there's a 21 foot rise from the point of the esplanade to the top of where quote-unquote the lawn is. The additional lawn areas would be staged up. As you see here and flat to the walkway. So at the 16 foot elevation you would be able to access the new lawn spaces that they've shown in the top right go ahead. Option two was also presented at the committee on the environmental. It was not widely appealed and because of the ADA access and the elevations, it still provides a lawn entrance and access it's a little bit wider of a lawn, but you will see go ahead to the next one. Please in this the lawns are tilted, so there is no way to have a flat lawn, so it becomes a three-foot tilted lawn from actually a little bit more. So this was a conversation. People on the environmental and the resiliency. There was no resiliency benefit either way. It was simply a design, and most people agreed that they would prefer to have direct access to the lawn, especially in the thought process of kids and mobility challenge to be able to be flat to the lawn versus a step down with people potentially falling. That shows it side by side. You can certainly see you know one of the downsides for option. One is, it seems to be a smaller section of lawn, that's added versus option, two, which has a deeper section, but these are not necessarily finalized and it was unclear to the people on the environmental review as to why you would have had to have lost the south lawn that was also desired. So the summary from these presentations were that they liked option one out of one and two, but they wanted to retain the south long as well, in whatever form it was, and that the possibility of adding not more natural plants for them to attack attain wedge design could be done in the pavilion area or other areas, and that the request was to go back to the drawing board, find ways to add more native plantings and less cement. The people that are not talking, mute, their microphones, I think it's makes microphones like pretty distracting I, muted, bobsack too, all right. So that was the update for the lawns themselves and we're going to talk about all three of these afterwards, so we can have the feeling from the homeowners coalition as well. This is a dialogue about battery place and this is the front scape of oops. Let me take a look at my attendees I. Think there's somebody in there I might need to move over Eric moving you back all right. This is the front scape change to battery place. There was a long amount of dialogue on this and I. Think Nick. Can jump in and unmute when I or Eric it was not widely happy. There was a lot of concerns. You can see that the where the people are walking on the bottom of this slide, that is the sidewalk, and then there is a very tilted elevation to get up to the 21 foot, which is the height of the elevation. That entrance that you see center in the block is actually a service entrance for restaurant workers and trucks, so there is no pedestrian access from there, nor public access is only from the Far South and the far north. So this shows you what they're talking about from that driveway that you saw it's just as I said park, service carts and food service carts. This was the first internal draft study that they showed us again. I'll go over the committee's feedbacks, keep going so this shows what it would look like in terms of the front. So the bottom half is the sidewalk and then those are basically just terraced planted areas and a full ramp up and a full ramp down go ahead. Study two is very similar, but in response to us saying that we didn't like the fact that you couldn't have any type of access from the front of the street, there is like a seating area that could be walked up as in long steps that you see that's more towards the south side of the service entrance. So you can see that's more of a seated pavilion, but you know what are you looking at? Is the question you'd be looking at the Wagner from that perspective and the street go ahead. You're looking across that makes sense, there's not much to look at okay, so this is study three and this provides ADA access. This was again in response to the conversation of not having any access towards the front, and here you have on the north side a the seating area, like you saw in study two and a ramp added on the south side for three, and what that does. Is it's less greenery in the front as shown by the strangely, it doesn't show it. That's. Okay, that's study four and that's pretty much what they have now, where it's just large green swaths keep going. That's an elevation, look at just the large green swaths again, there's no entrance access for the public, except on the northern side very similar to one, but the difference is instead of multi-sections of varying levels of planting, it's just kind of a large hill walk-on. Basically, you can't get from point a to point b unless you go to the edges and go up the hill, all right, please! Okay! So here are the shows of the different studies, the impacts to the planting coverage and how that might look, and so you can see that the top one, which is the first one, has a maximum planting availability but doesn't provide any type of access to the street level. The second one has a proposed stair and handrail wooden amphitheater seating on the south side and the bottom one has proposed handicap rampant seating slope, planting beds around that okay. So this one caused a lot of consternation in dialogue and we'll talk about this as well for the I think if you live here and you walk there or bike there every day, you have a far different idea. You can see that the major pedestrian circulation and the bike circulation does not necessarily work out, because the dialogue became the fact that you're not providing a place for bicyclists who are coming off the bike path that are on in battery park if they are not crossing onto the greenway you're, then pushing them on to the lower levels of the esplanade which may or may not be functional, because if there's an event, you're not going to be able to go that way, so then you're forcing people to go up the Las up the hill with all of the pedestrians. Thus, when you take a look at the circle points that they have as their intersection points, you will have bicyclists skateboarders and everything else, riding up and down next one at the skateboarders on the hills yeah. So these are design changes that, where the conversation keep going and again what you're seeing is that in the center there's no direct access. So this is the main access right now. What they don't show is right, just past that fire hydrant on the left is the crosswalk to the school. That's there that's the edge of first place, and you see the major access way going up to the pavilion building. So you can either be on the sidewalk on street level or go up the la if you've missed the la and you're on the sidewalk. There is no access until you get back to the corner of pier a or you walk back to the Jewish Heritage Museum, because that area in the middle is service entrance only so this is the entrance coming from the edge of pier a and the concerns that everyone raised was that if you are a bicyclist and you've come right past pier a you're either going to go straight down on the esplanade or you're going to ride up, there's no bike path, and perhaps the car so we'll keep going and the concerns that were raised by Bob Schneck last time was: yes, there may be a railing, but that's an awfully long way to go and you can see circle seats and other things go ahead. The plantings you know the concerns is, they are looking to blend in with pier a plaza. You know. We of course, all love the native palette, because that's what we're used to in battery park city by the incredible parks team, a really more natural look, so hopefully that's what they mean by blends in with puree Plaza versus changing. What's the natural look of the gardens that we so admire and, like now, keep going okay, let's go back to I'm gonna. Do oh I can do drainage now too, so this is the interior drainage. This is part three, so part one. You saw where the lawns part two is the streetscape side of battery place and the updates from that from Epc. People were very concerned that there was no bike path that allowed people to bike without going up with the pedestrians and down with the pedestrians there didn't seem to be. If you were older or handicapped accessible, the questions were, if you were making a service entrance, couldn't you put an elevator there to get people up and couldn't the service entrance? Why does it have to be directly in the middle? Couldn't you rethink the service entrance to a side and have access instead of it being a main gate front without access to the park? Does that mean the gate open up right by Psis 276? No, the concern is that main gate is a service entrance. Only to access the La's to get to the park comes from the edge of the jewish Heritage Museum from the very connected edge there. Okay. So, for example, if you were parking buses, you would hope that the buses do not back up into the residential building or the crosswalks, but all right interior drainage, this interior drainage. There are many things that were presented that they need to do in terms of the underground water, which is something that we're very familiar with, and we've advocated for them to fix for a long time. They're looking at the drainage here, there needs to be two places that they are able to access the system the conversation became is the plan is to put one in the north and one in the south. However, there is a possibility. They may need two in the south and these are to check and see what's going on with the drainage that is below ground, which we know is what flooded, for example over by the millennium and the Wagner Next Lucian next. So the map that you're looking at the important parts to look at you've got Wagner where they're doing the flood alignment and they're making that resilient, and then they have the other sections they're looking to put in gate. They call it southern gate and Control House Zone and northern Gate and Control House zone. We are advised that there is a potential that they will only need one gate, not necessarily two, and that is something that we're going to need to opine and comment on either through environmental and battery park city or from battery park city, those gates that you showed that it could be both of those. It could be one of them and then maybe one in the north neighborhood or correct that it could be okay and we didn't see the picture of the north neighborhood yet because they they're not that far along the goal. Just that would be part of that would be part of the North Baton Right, the main, the predominant part of the conversation yeah. The predominant conversation was to hopefully see if we can design it as such, so as to have one control house in the south as opposed to one as opposed to two. So that's, let's talk. This is what they're talking about that's needed inside all right. So this is not. You know some place. That's it's not. Some place, that's accessed routinely other than for repair maintenance and there are cylinders and machines in there. So here's part of an example of the gate. This is not our neighborhood, so keep going. This is the shape and size of a cross section and elevation. So the building in itself at his highest point, is 13 feet by 2 inches tall. The length of the entire thing is not specked on here, but it's 10 foot at the lowest 13 at the end, and if you can kind of take a look- and you know do the measuring by where they are, it looks to be at least 30 to 45 feet based on scale 45 feet long. Actually, if you look at the scale, it's more like 60 feet, long, potentially, okay, next, so this is an example. It's a flat metal tile on the roofing and the exterior is brick or glass brick with a granite base, and you can see from the height what they're talking about in terms of a normal sized human being walking by the aluminum windows are all above head height. So it's a granite floor, a brick wall and windows start if you basically I, am assuming that's an average six foot tall person on the measurements for the detailed render okay keep going. Okay. This is slide one that shows what it might look like. It's interesting in its perspective of where it's located, simply because they are showing it alongside of West, Thames I, believe that looks like not sure. On the east side, that's on FDA along FDR drive. Oh that picture right there right. So that's resent that says representative example of the North gate, so that's a gate that could be, for example, up by the ball fields somewhere on the north side. Somewhere, we don't know where so on the bottom. It says South Gate, building view from the southwest on the top. It says north gate not sure which one it is, but here are the potential interceptor locations that they're talking about. We did have a long dialogue about putting it instead of where they are suggesting. One is they're looking to take out a large chunk either in the promenade area, which is option two I believe what they're, showing there option three is in. The bike is in the grass and tree area to remove the grass and tree area along little West, Street and then existing tide gate is the Purple box and what they said was you have to be within a certain square feet from the interceptor gates our questions and have not been answered yet are whether or not they can be located in the crosswalk, because there is a large area of crosswalk that is not underground, that is over by Morris in between first and second, it's an extremely large area and occasionally police cars are parked in there and the answer you can see where they're talking about the off ramp. They said it is not feasible to put it above the battery park, underpass necessarily due to what it needs. Subterranean our argument back to them is: there are places along the D.O.T route there in the medians that could fit this. The answer that we had thus far was it's not necessarily desirable because of the access, but if they're not accessed on a daily basis, I'm really unsure why we would put something so large, either in the promenade or in the greenway. The other question that I asked Nick that I'm hoping he'll be able to answer on. This call is whether or not you'd have to alienate parkland, because the promenade is mapped parkland next same things: control locations next, so this shows what they're talking about you can see the Wagner on the right, the Orange Box, for what they're looking at looks benign, but you have to imagine all those trees would go away because you need to build something: that's 13 feet tall by about 40 feet. Okay, so that's taking out part of the promenade itself for the footprint looking south wait, see I mean, let's see, I, don't know what the next side looks like, but on this slide here the promenade, so that's the road, then that's the walkway. That's the Little West Street they're, talking about putting it in the promenade and where you want to put it is the next one yeah I want to put it is in the middle of 9 am yeah! That's what I'm saying. We can't quite see it here. Can we no because they weren't necessarily happy about the thought right? Okay, just making sure all right, let's see, Eric oops, sorry Eric, I'm moving you over Sarah, I'm moving you over moving you back! Okay! So please! So that's a 13! But okay! So here are the advantages and disadvantages. It reduces the concerns that I have. Is it reduces the width, the pedestrian promenade? It also puts a 13 foot tall by 40 foot length, building in front of and alongside the cross area. I guess what I'm going to be for Nick is about the retaining wall is, if we put it in this in the middle of West Street, we have to move it far enough away from the battery park, underpass that it's not going to interfere with the retaining wall, but there's so much space in the middle there's no retaining wall there to worry about, because even putting in the promenade it says it's a away from the retaining wall. All right! No that's this up! This option is away from the retaining wall option. One is by the retaining wall. Okay, next and while they say option two, the control House does not remove green space. It removes park land, so okay option three again potential promenade and greenery. If you can go to the so, this is removing all of the trees, but leaving the promenade in the width that it is so in the space that you see there, you lose the greenery. That would be there and again. You've got a 13 feet tall by 40, wide building. That's there. So you would have little West Street you'd have the building of the Wagner you'd. Have the street you'd have the Gatehouse Control House building, then you would have the promenade, then the grass and then the greenway is now time to ask questions. Are we just listening? I'm hoping we're at the last slide. For goodness sakes, we're close I think Lucian go for it. So there are the benefits for option three. So these are the mitigation strategies. There's does seem to be flexibility, the places that they, the concerns that the community have or do not seem to match with the concerns of this slide, is actually good for showing a constraint that they're they say they're operating under, which is that the gate that this control house controls needs to be south of that M9 box, which you can see, is basically right there at first place, and it said, was that was optimal. They didn't say it was impossible. No, that's not one perfect, because it's supposed to be controlling the flow below that, like that, they did say that it could go further north, and that was in part of the diagrams. When we discuss it on the call and whether Nick or Eric, can speak to that, I'm unsure, but they said that the control House could go further north as long as it is within 200 feet of the gate, but the gate had to be south of N9 itself right and the gate is on the right. It's the control house on the left on the west side that we're talking about. Can you enlarge that one yeah may go back again, so the two things in blue? What's blue box needs to be south of M9, and the big blue box needs to be within I, believe it was 200 feet of the little box. So the conversation was nobody thought it was a good thing to take space out of the West Thames Park because to build a 10-foot gate house there, because that is the lawn area for West Thames Park, no one like that. There is not I mean, and the conversation was that might not need to be done if there's a gate in the north, so the second south gate might not need to be done. If you can slide back south a little bit, so we can see put that gate at the top. There stop oh yeah, so the conversations that we were having are, if everyone who's familiar with crossing West Street, is that whether or not it could go into the large median crossing that's over by second place. It's a long, a very large and long median. That's zigzag shaped, and the answer was they it was. Is it convenient thus far that the they said that it would be inconvenient for them to access it? So I'm going to leave that where it is now and let's do Q&A everybody can. If you raise your hands, I will recognize hands first as a way to go down this. To make it a little bit easier and Tammy can I ask that Lucian with his mouse point to what you're talking about yeah, so the department will be and then I think Jeff has been waiting patiently to talk Jeff Mihawk, Jeff, Myhawk Go, for it should we go back one? Maybe one go back, one see where that is wait for the av to catch up to you yeah. It might be two slides one more okay right here. Why couldn't we have that if it has to be in this vicinity? Why can't we put that move that to the left and put it in the median planter between the promenade and the bike lane? Is there a reason why they couldn't go there well, I think that might have been option. I know. You know we didn't ask that question. So we there may be some utilities or something but I don't think we asked that question because that feels like I mean that hotel. Although if you look at the diagram, you do see, some utilities running under those trees, I was just wondering at me- seems like a natural place to put it would buffer sound from the hotel. It's it would be removed further from the hotel's entrance. It would not block a sight line of cars driving along that area and seeing a pedestrian walk right out by that fire hydrant in the line of traffic. That's a heavy traffic area right there I live a block from here. This is where a ton of taxis are a ton of black cars. A ton of tourists, ton of ubers and lifts coming and dropping people off at that hotel, and if you have that thing there and it's their 10 feet tall, it's going to be a sight line, blockage to people crossing the promenade. You know right there in front of the cars and also, why not move it further away from the hotel and Jeff you're talking about the traffic on little West Street correct at this moment. I'm talking about the traffic coming right at us right now, yeah people walk from that promenade crossing right there and these cars. Don't always there's not a stop sign there right now there used to be a long time ago, I think so there isn't now. So people try to cross there and you have to watch it when you're driving cause people just walk right in the way. So why not move it? So it's not a sight line. So it's in the middle of a median of planners it can have maybe iv growing I, don't know what can grow on or I think you can grow on this thing or not, but I don't know why it needs to be that close to a hotel. What about Tammy's suggestion, which is yeah no way in heck? Does this one make any sense? The other one is in the pedestrian path, so it's over a little bit, but I think that also would be blocking the sight line as you're suggesting. So let's move it into the middle of West Street, the middle median of West Street, the West Side Highway, all right we've, given them that request to look at that right, I'm asking now Jeff. Do you have an issue with that? One or you see a problem with that, assuming it's possible I, don't think it's possible down here! I know that area really. Well, there really isn't right. Now, that's the up and down ramp into the underpass. It's parallel. Where it is there, it would have to go north because of exactly that reason, and so that that's the engineering inquiry is if it were north, where you actually have a median. Is that close enough to where that gate needs to be located, and they were going to look into that yeah? That would be even more ideal. Also wondering are we going to discuss I I'll? Ask now like? Are we going to discuss the placement of one of these kind of eyesores right near that beautiful park where the kids are playing, or is that good too? That one is unlikely to be built as they presented to us that's kind of a placeholder, but I'm not sure what the location that they need a north one, but the one would go in the middle North neighborhood is what they're contemplating, although I don't know where that location would be. It may be well, there's an absolutely huge median right parallel to where that is. As we all know who know the area like the medium down here. This one is not very large. The median up here where the northern one is placed right now is an enormous median. It's tall, it's huge. It's got a ton of planners on it. Yeah, that's a good point. I can't easily go. There agreed all right if I can just and thank you by the way Jeff. That's both Jeff's. That's really helpful, the one thing and Tam you did a great job on going through it and kind of recapping it. The one thing I would add, and it's only one I don't believe it was a matter of the control houses necessarily having to be within 200 feet or 200 meters, whatever it was, although that's the preferred distance, it was if it gets further away, it needs to be bigger. So if you don't like the size of the building, now it's going to be on 200, but that could be okay. If it's not the building was small yeah. But if it's in the media we don't care. If it's in the middle of West Street, you can, you know it's not at all in the middle of West. Street might actually provide a really interesting, sound absorption barrier for the traffic. Exactly that might not be a bad thing. You know it's really interesting. We should you know you should. Certainly we should certainly make the request, and the one thing, I would add, is again as we're working through this with a wide array of partners, DOT, DEP and Pdc. So far today, I don't want to speak for the Public Design Commission, but our experience to date has been the public design. Commission is keen on keeping a fairly consistent aesthetic for these types of structures, so I think that what they're going to want to do is try and keep them look consistent across all the projects, so, whether it be battery park, city or East, side, coastal resiliency, Et, cetera, I, don't know how much wiggle room there's going to be I, don't want to speak for the Pdc, but I also want to make it clear to the folks in Nepal. It's not just the battery park city authorities call as to what these things look like. We are bound by the constraints that we are given in a number of matters on this project for sure, and we will make sure that we incorporate what we can into our next round of updates to you guys coming up. Nick I want to point out that each location that they do this in is vastly different in its geography. So there is some level of accommodation that needs to be made per location it just you know we speak for CB1 I, don't speak for the other community boards, I speak for CB1, and so we will only advocate for what's best for us and if that helps inform for what other communities do, and they learn a good lesson going there more than better for the others, great all right, Jeff anything that you have on the other two issues about battery place or the lawns which Jeff my hawk anything else. You want to say on the lawns or the front of battery place bike path. Anything along those lines. No I couldn't really see much of a difference between two long proposals. It seems like roughly the same size, they're similar. How do you feel about losing the south lawn back to that side? Yep? We were of the more lawns, better yeah, all right, lawns, better, but I. Also it's also hard to tell in these renderings, because you know when you're really there people buy there a lot. It's really not that much lawn space already if they start cutting it with like a lot of Criss-Crossy paths. I think that's part of the whole idea right. They better elevate it right. They can work with natural plantings and that's a dialogue that is going to be part of the next topic on this or part of the first one as well. All right and the front of the battery place the two side entrances middle entrance. Can we see those slides I? Don't have that memorized yeah I would be helpful to see the slides. It's not quite getting me in service entrance versus the regular entrance, so I wouldn't mind trying to figure that out a little bit compared to me, which was which there are, there is no main entrance. The main entrances are on the north and south. You can not access through the middle. Can we see that slide, I'm not seeing it yeah Lucy. Can you go back solution with us? Still, yes, I mean as we look at these options. We should keep in mind the design constraints that any option has to satisfy. One is that elevation and the other is universal access which constrains the options. I challenge that I completely challenge that because we should not universal access or no, of course you should. But the question is you know what kind of considerations did they do to have a longer tunnel to have you know the surface? I'm not saying that these options explore all the permutations possible for those constraints, but I'm just saying whatever options are chosen, including different ones. That leaves, let me keep going back by those constraints. I want to get to the rendering so like, maybe that one okay. So what is this elevating area like the arch? That's in the bottom right? That's the service interest, that's only accessible at this point in time by hotel restaurant people or whatever correct no, not a restaurant. Yes, it's a service entrance where you say: there's only north and south entrances, I don't see a north entrance. I would consider that right now, I'm looking at not the service, but above it that's that to me is the eastern entrance. So do you see the ramp that goes up on from the left yeah and then the ramp goes down on the right and ends in front of the Jewish Heritage Museum yeah. Those are the two entrances. There's no entrance in the middle affects the options that they presented to us. This was their preferred option in some ways, the least worst of the options, and we wanted a an entrance in the middle there to the park. But to do that because of universal ass access, you need long ramps which takes out a good chunk of that greenery, as was shown in some of these renderings. So what's the middle option so one of them. This is a little frustrating. It's a very steep hill, too. Isn't it I'd be interested to hear what Mariam Breverman has to say if, in regards to the seniors or even Betty, with I, guess to see what it would be like to push a wheelchair of that? Or this story rise? It's a 21-foot rise from ground. It would be designed to yeah. It would be designed at the ADA prescribed grade. That's why that's part of the function of it being as long as it is that you have to have it be very gradual, I'm not sure of the exact degree. Apologies for that, but that's the idea is that it needs to be designed in a way. So it's not too steep for folks to be able to get up Jeff Galloway. Thank you for bringing that up. There were some other slides in the presentation and I know we went through Tammy and thank you for that kind of really explored. It is a little bit of a tough nut to crack because you need to have universal access, meaning for the uninitiated. Anybody in a wheelchair or assistive device needs to be able to enter the building at the same point. The same way that other people would you can't simply put a staircase right next to that service entrance that people go up and down. Somebody asked about an elevator yeah, that's yeah does that is that. Does that qualify as universal access is a good question. I, don't know and I have to check on elevator I, don't know what the feasibility is for an elevator. But again when we come back with our next round of updates, we would have that okay, I would assume- and I'm not an architect so I can't say this, but it's okay. If you can have no ramp on the West Thames Bridge and an elevator that seems to me that an elevator would operate Betty. Do you remember? Betty has her hands up Betty please go yes. I was going to say that elevators are always a problem, they're very expensive. They break down all the time and they're used by people to urinate in at night, so they always smell horrible. Besides that, so in terms of adding things and limited capacity, you put one stroller on with the lines will be huge to even be able to use that if it's a party, that's coming a bunch of people coming around the same time, so I don't see an elevator as positive as other people do, because I have to rely on them and believe me, nobody wants to have to rely on them. Okay, especially with social distancing. You could have one person at a time go up. You know, maybe, if they're with somebody with one other, it would be not useful. For many people I know the long ramps bother people, but I'm kind of used to them. So it's not a big deal. I, wouldn't get dropped off in the middle I would get dropped off on the edge. That's what anybody else is entering this way. I had no problem with the picture if they wanted a staircase in the middle. Those who are hardy enough to do it means splitting some parties, because you'll have some that can't take the stairs I want to use the stairs. That's not that's socially, that great. If you're being dropped off, if you are arriving by foot or by bicycle you're, going to easily come in through the north end of the south end, so it's not a big deal to just use, as is to find here in this photo in this picture. There is no bike lane Betty, there is no accommodation for bikes. All bikes would have to either ride on the sidewalk. There's no bike path, but my point is: if they come to the area by bicycle or if they come to the area on foot, they're gonna have to leave the bicycle wherever they leave it, they're going to have to still they're going to come from the north and they're going to come from the south. So it's not a big deal to start walking on these ramps at the ends, because you're coming from one direction or the other anyway, it's really only the people being dropped by cars, so I would not put the option with the ramps in it to eat up some of the greenery, because it doesn't help the person who needs a ramp can just go to the ends. The way they are in this picture, there would be no advantage to having the other added fbad accessible to have this picture here with stairs added. There's they have one there. It is an option. Yes, yeah. Sorry, there were four options: let's see anything else on the ESCR houses or the lawns. This one is a ramp, keep going. No, that's the one that happened when you just had the one right through that one before that that's a lot of stuff, but that has a ramp built into it as well right, big ramp, but all the green space is gone. No, the one you were just that's what I said: I would not get this one. You would not get right now, go back one place correct. If someone needs a ramp, it doesn't help them because you go up and then you curve back it's the same distance as just coming in from the south of the north end. So can you grasp okay study? Two is with a ramp in embedded into the stairs there. This is pretty horrible too. This is also. This is two study. Three lotion you go to that picture of study three. They did not provide an ele. Oh go back one! Please I apologize! Lucian, yeah, sorry study three. If you stop here and straighten out that ramp, it would be take you right down to where you'd be coming in anyway, if you used regular sidewalk. So that would be what this was designed for. Is you lose a lot of the greenery, but there's a ramp on the left and the stairs to the right? This is where the committee asked whether or not you could have the stair-like things there and also an elevator in the center to provide parity if possible. If that would work, why do you need so much stairs, though right I mean why my kid is on a staircase I couldn't tell you that's their designs, I mean I'm not sure why that's being big either. These are shallow stairs. If you use really shallow stairs. So each one is just a slight lift up. Then you do need this kind of width and depth yeah, but I guess I know your shoes are ready, I get it. But my answer is that people want if people want to walk or need to have this the slow. You know low grade slope. They take the slope if they can walk up steps, they take the steps and it should just be a staircase. Maybe if you want to stagger it, go up a flight and then move it over a little bit, so you get a break and then go by the flight. But this is a crazy waste of grass area, the other one's, a crazy wasted grass area, but I. Don't it's not really grass, it's a green hill greenery, whatever it's going to be, but yeah but I, think Betty alluded to an interesting point, which is what are we trying to accomplish with an entrance at that point, making it easier who wants to enter at that point other than people being dropped off on cars and cars? It also provides additional seating space. It provides something on the streetscape side versus nothing, because right now there is a lot of activity on the streetscape side, both from the building. That's there, the Las and the artwork. There's nothing in the plan that they have. It almost looks. One of the members of the public said it best. It looks like the park has turned its back completely on the city and it is only looking forward, whereas the park as it currently exists faces part of the city has interesting aspects of it on both sides. Interesting but I, don't know if this accomplishes the same thing, all the options: kind of suck. Sorry, okay, all right! Let's let somebody else speak Betty. Are you done? Are you good yeah, no I agree with Justine I. Think adding cement versus green is not a positive. It's the question. I guess becomes. How can they accomplish it with both because that doesn't seem to be a conversation? That's been had yet all right, let's get to Bob Schneck. You had your hand up next, so I think as a place where I can actually say something. Positive is I really like the idea of that big median of using that big medium median in the by the West Thames Bridge, because it's there, it's practical, it's usable and it's way out of the way and it's a place where you could actually without harming anything, make that necessary. Addition. So I see that as a facility that we have to have and that's and if it's something that we have to have, that would do damage in other places, then I think that's a place to put it so I have the odd, at least for me. The I have a bunch of odd biases here, and so I'm going to name them and then I will be quiet forever. I think my natural bias is that I'm really I've really been pleased with the way things are here, just as they are. I'm very pleased with the I think that the gardens we've had for yours are wonderful. I feel like the way Lori created the battery is wonderful. I love Wagner park. The way it is with the structures it has and with the restaurant it has I love the grass as we have it. I love the battery place performance space, that's used, sometimes everything about it, kind of works and so I admit a natural bias here. A I think that the way things are pretty good and I also have a bias about how to protect them and the bias I have about how to protect them is I feel like you're now facing some very difficult economic times, and I've always had a basic fundamental concern with what I'll call economic justice that we here have this very charmed life and other people. Don't now lots of people who actually live here are going to have a less charmed life, because I think some at least from the people I talk to and meet. There are some people who are going to have difficulties that they've never had before. That being said, I think that resiliency as I've thought for years, is a really major issue, and one of the opportunities that, in my opinion, if I were a ruler of this process, would be to drive economical solutions that could work anywhere. That would kind of solve the resiliency problems without building huge restaurants or centers, without tearing up that those wonderful gardens without changing those spaces in front of puree that I'm very comfortable with, without disrupting those existing bike paths that worry had so I would ask that we focus on coming up with the simplest solutions, not spending a lot of money using that money for other things, because there's going to be more other things that people have to worry about than ever before, so I could enter into all of these discussions, about which one of these, what kind of advantages are there are to this entrance or that entrance I? Really don't like those that I like the way it's organized now and those stairs going up from the Hudson river up this huge incline. I've always been very uncomfortable with piling all that dirt up in the East River park. I think piling dirt is at that scale, isn't really a simple solution. It's a massively complex solution, so that being my feeling, I could also enter into the refinements of the difficulties of you know: I think that now we're going to have more and more people on more and more kind of little electric vehicles, we're going to even need to think of new parking spots and imagine new ways to handle those, because if you have one you wouldn't park it on the street, you'd try and get it up to the up to next to the restaurant. So I think lots of new complexities are happening and we have to think about and design for those. So if I took the design that we have near that this resiliency has for those barriers nearer to the near to the jewish Heritage Museum. Those are really simple: I would just take those across toward pure. A I would not build that big hill I would block out whatever I would try and respect whatever sight lines. I could that exist, but if they go away and we simply have to accept them because in the same way, if you necessarily have to have buildings to support some underground operations, then you have to have them. If you, if we break some sight lines, we have to have them. So that's just how it is, and we should be very responsible for being as economic as possible in coming up with solutions. So I hope that's helpful. Thank you very much. Bob and you'll. That's going to make a great segue to the next topic, but I want to make sure that we've, given everybody a chance to opine and say anything if they wanted to so we heard from Jeff Galloway, Jeff, Meyer, Judith or Eric. Do you have anything or oh Sarah's got her hand up I apologize Sarah go for it. I just have a this is a probably a retroactive question, I'm wondering if it was ever discussed. Simply raising you know the way Bob suggested doing something right along the edge, but making a promenade on top of that, so that, yes, you have the park with the usable, workable spaces, but you also have a new Vista up there. So, yes, you have a wall. That is a green wall, maybe or you know a waterfall something on the one side and he well probably not a waterfall, but it could easily be a beautiful green wall with plants on the interior side and then have the promenade just go up. It could even ramp up and or you could just make that the space for the elevator, but I was wondering if that was ever considered, because it does seem to preserve the things that people use and yet give us a place to go to get the vistas and jump in there if it's helpful yeah. So actually- and thank you for that- it's a really thoughtful suggestion. We had gone through this process, I want to say. Maybe it was last March all the presentations are a comprehensive Bpca, resiliency project website last March I believe it was. But to answer your question very briefly: well, it seems to make sense kind of from a philosophical perspective. Very practically. There are two immediate challenges. One is if you were to build some type of intervention, we it's mean to build to block the flood waters. If you were to build it right at the end, it would have to be so. You would block the view of the water from everyone inbound and everyone in the park or on the street, wouldn't have a view of the water anymore. They would just be viewing the back of the wall or slope up, but even more practically is because the Esplanade is cantilever over the water and not actually at the water, not at the bulkhead. It wouldn't be able to bear that wouldn't be able to bear the weight of whatever it is. We were going to build. Ah, okay, so it's engineering, yeah, okay, it's probably predominantly engineering an engineering challenge. Thank you. Okay, of course, I noted in the chat, I cleared everybody's hand raised by accident, but I do remember. Bob Zack had his up next, so we're going to call on Bob and if anybody else does want to put their hands up, Lucian I see your hand up you'll go after Bob Zack. If you don't mind thanks Tammy, I'm I'll be very brief. I wanted to revert to the discussion about the gatehouse, the Southgate House and just make a couple of brief comments. I think the idea of placing it on the street is a very poor choice and the alternatives of placing it, at least in the median planters, is a less worse solution. Placing it on the street does several things. First of all, that will be obstructing the view of the traffic coming up. Little West Street for people, particularly children, who are crossing at first place to have the addition of a building. That's x, number of feet high and x number of feet long that poses a safety hazard. Secondly, it's an aesthetic disaster, certainly for the people who live in the Ritz Carlton and who walk along those that street facing a wall like that looks like Hitler's bunker, is not going to be a very attractive solution or do much to enhance property values in that building or anywhere else on little West Street, and there are alternative places to put that the median solution was probably the best in terms of its aesthetic appeal, whether it can be done from an engineering perspective. I leave to my betters and more wise people on that particular scope, but it that simply can not go where you, for that. One alternative proposes it on the street for a variety of reasons. Thanks. That's really all I want to say at this point Bob thank you can I meet in the promenade? Yes, that's my question: did you meet in the promenade Bob? The other fact is that placing not in the promenade itself, but in the planters that are between the bicycle and the promenade that actually reduces the least amount of greenery and trees, whereas putting it on the street you're removing three or four major trees that provide shade and a great deal of attractiveness to that Vista. Okay, Great Miriam, Braverman you're. Next, let's make sure I'll meet you for you. There you go okay, so I had sent in a few chat, questions and I, don't remember them all, because I was popping them out as we went along. Lucian may have them so, okay, I know. One thing I'm concerned about is any walking spaces have plenty of seating along the edges for people who can walk somewhat but need places to rest catch their birth and spawn I did not see plenty of walking plenty of seating. The diagram that was shown showed seating around the tree near the bottom, but mostly open with a railing and not as much. No, but I will put that note down that, no matter how for access seating is important and then I also did suggest that some of the some of these structures might be able to have plants ivs if you're familiar with that security parking structure at the World Trade Center exactly they have that wall of plants with different colors, and it's beautifully done. I love that really well done yeah. So something like that would help the appearance of things. I think! That's probably it for me. Thank you, Lucian! Do you by any chance, have any of the chats that I was scrolling back through the Tammy and I, don't see anything from Mary and it could be that she, it may have been a private chat or some other, but I'm not seeing them in my chat, log I sent it to all attendees, so I, don't know where that one participants is another option, all right. So for everybody, if you send a chat to all participants, it goes to everyone. If you send it just to attendees, it goes to the people who are not panelists. Oh okay, thank you. We've read. Kayla's standing right here and she could read her questions because she's the attendee is that helpful, all right, I'm gonna, let her speak, go ahead. Marianne wrote at 6:44. Might it be possible to have hanging plants vines a wall also building should not block visibility around the bike lanes. It's bad enough when planning these structures yeah and then she asked is the hotel closing. There should be seating along any walkway for those who need a breather, and she said that okay and then that's it. Okay, perfect. That was it! Thank you. Okay, great do I. Have anybody else, I'm gonna think we're good. I'm gonna turn it over. Justin is gonna run the rest of the meeting. I have a couple questions: Tammy, okay, go for it! Listen so about one. Is the trees on the mid-level? I didn't see a slide for the tree. Selection are those all going to be salt, water, tolerant trees, so, like I'm, depicting, let's see yeah so the trees that are in the area, mid-level that are expected to be flooded in a flooding event say: I might have connectivity difficulties. I see a little spinning wheel of death above his face. I may have shot through the slides too fast and the server's trying to catch up there's a bit of a lag. Let me know, and I can unshare and re-share it. If there's an issue, is it no one seeing this current slide you're on picnic, lawns option too, not on the yeah, so that's what he wanted. I think he wanted a picture of the 13-foot lawn, that's right! So for anything any tree, that's kind of in the expected flood zone. I would hope that a very salt water, tolerant variety is chosen. I have a lot of experience with Harlem River park, Post Sandy. That park was flooded and all the trees died because they were not taller. So it's something! That's I think it's a really important choice to make that you get a really hearty to saltwater species of tree Eric, it looks like Nick might be having technical difficulties. Do you know the answer? Eric Clenson I don't off hand, but I do know that the horticulture practices are of a primary concern. So we can take this back and I can get a firm answer to Lucian's question thanks. The other thing I was curious about is for the Control House for the gates. I may have missed this, but it looks like they're all contemplated to be built at grade with whatever street or Plaza or media, that they're built on. Is there any way to build them a couple feet below grade to tamp down the height issues? What what's preventing it from being somewhat submerged, so to speak, so somebody who wants to enter it would have to step down a couple of steps. I love that question I, don't know if this is like I can get you like some pop I'm having trouble following you. Can you try again? I'm sorry one? Second, let me just go back here to yeah. So, for example, let's see if I can get into here. So if this were to be sunk down a couple of feet or, however much it's possible to sink it down, and you just have someone step down to it, would that do anything to kind of reduce this height? Is it possible to submerge it to you know some degree? Is there something about the water level that prevents that from being submerged or lowered down below grade to some degree, could you still insulate it from water? Is it or is like this height necessary for some reason this, like this height here, my assumption is that it's not an issue with regards to height, so much of it is a consideration with regards to the depth, but again that's something that I would want to confirm before I answered definitively so I'll check with Jenny and Aecom and the folks and get back to you on that yeah. It seems like a lot of the issues here. You know just depend on how submergeable this structure is because the difference between a you know, 11 to 13 foot, head House, Gate, House, Control area and an interesting bench. Is that amount of submersion so also pursuant to that Eric? If you're checking, can you find out if you need to alienate parkland if you're going to put it in the promenade or the planters, I wouldn't sure if they took that space, they would be alienating it there's a process for that. That's right! That's what I want you asking! Okay, I think the answer is yes, but okay, I think all right, I think I'll be good to go on to number two we're good to go. Yep is that space not state got property. I thought that it was I thought the space was owned by state DOT, not parkland. What I want to remember is that government governor Pataki dedicated the promenade Mm-hmm yeah. That's what that's why we call it the Pataki Highway. So that is one of the things that we would want to understand is because it was there's a dedication ceremony and Pataki talks about it being a grand entrance. Can you know connecting the battery to the rest of Manhattan through this beautiful park? So I mean sorry thanks for don't I lost my connection, but I called back in yeah. No, we thought so important. All right. Can you hear me yeah, okay, sorry, so Lucian and I apologize? Let me take the first question. First, I cut out just when I had all these good answers for you all right, we're talking just because can you hear me yes, but Eric may have answered the question for you. Well, no, so popular I don't know the parking alienation applies here simply doing something in the park does not necessarily mean it's parked in the alien nation if it's for an otherwise public purpose, but I am far from an expert in the matter. I'm gonna have to find out if that would apply, but I will have an update for you as part of our next as part of our next presentation. I know that it would apply in this case. I'd imagine if it did or if it didn't my guess is. It would probably be consistent across the resiliency projects. So if it applies in battery park city, my guess is, it might apply on east side and elsewhere. I don't know for sure, but that would be my guess. Well, we'd like to know if it is and if it is whether it would happen as a whole or it happens as in sections, because you're on state land you're, not on city land, in your state authority and what and how that works. I hear what Eric saying that it might be state D.O.T, but it was dedicated to the community by Pataki. So that's what we'd like to understand right. Well, two separate things right. If it's the prominent I think that's one thing: if it's the median, then that's certainly state DOT depends on where we've got correct. We're specifically talking about the promenade and the area and the planter areas. While I have you here, Bob I know you had mentioned it object, so I jotted it down I want to make sure that my notes right, you said you'd like the median option, the best, if it's possible from an engineering perspective, but then secondly, you'd, like the planter option better than you'd, like the promenade option. Is that correct the median in between the bike path and the promenade versus? Because it would be least what he said was? It would be least confusing to people having access crossing the street if it's in that zone at all, right, okay and then Lucian, I'm sorry, you were asking questions about plantings when I left and then something about the control house, I, think flooding. So I just didn't want to miss that no problem Nick. The question was about the trees that are in the flood, the kind of the design flood area. Those are going to be saltwater, resistant species of trees, selected, okay, yes, my understanding is just perfect, I think I kind of know that I'm well confirmed but I think that that's the idea that you'd want to try and happen behind, but I don't want to speak at a turn. I think yeah. I'd love to see that I'd love to see as I saw the slide on other plantings that were saltwater, tolerant, but I would see which trees were kind of in the mix. For that okay and then the question about control houses yeah the question there is: to what degree can those control houses be sunk into the ground? So is there what engineering issues prevent the control houses from essentially being built below grade, not entirely necessarily, but that's what you're saying right yeah. So it's still 11 feet high, let's say, but if it five of those feet are underground and it's really six feet above only six feet above great right for as an example. Okay I don't know the answer to that, but very good question and probably a combination of expertise from DEP, maybe somewhat less than eot and the Public Design Commission. Of course, I think would want to have a pretty consistent, aesthetic but very good question and then that's not considering any kind of subsurface utilities we have to navigate around. But certainly something to ask about. Thank you, sorry about that guys, I'm on the phone now, so you can't see my face, but that might be an improvement and then I'm just gonna go back to the lawns and go back on record, saying that I see no reason that you couldn't take a look at making retaining the south lawn and keeping a north lawn and finding ways to incorporate native plantings within the amphitheater that you're building in other places, to be able to reduce the amount of concrete. If you are I know neither Eric nor you live in the neighborhood, but every square inch for every tiny lawn area has been ha has been filled with people. Since the weather has turned nice. It is one of the heaviest utilized parks and every grassy area has somebody with a picnic blanket on it, no matter how tiny, whether it's over by the sculpted gardens, there's a little lawn area there and there were groups of people on it, the big lawn, obviously, and even the terraced lawns, going down to the water. So one of the questions you know, yeah the one of the overriding themes we've heard from the beginning and learn. Obviously full agreement is that we want to try and maximize green space wherever we can so we'll continue to do that and I know that the addition of hardscape has been something that you've been after for a while. So we'll continue to look at ways that we can minimize that, and that also goes back to the entrance that there's a question about the entrance to the rebellion if there's a way to kind of soften that a bit and try to get at some of the goals, while still trying to have green space I think that's the I think we're an alignment there, which then brings to the point Justine's taking it from here about the fiscal and physical distancing concerns for Wagner Park Resiliency, all right, so thank you, Tammy, and so basically we wanted to bring this topic up for discussion. After looking at the Wagner park, the latest design for the southern Battery park city, in light of, what's going on with coal, the whole Corona virus pandemic and Covid-19, and the New York on paws and physical distancing, and also the shellacking that our economy has taken since February and March because of the virus and really truly not much of an end in sight until a vaccine comes which might be 20, 21, 22, 2022, God forbid. In light of that, one of the things that we were talking about and we've invited Bob Zach to talk about it. But we also want the committee to talk about it and think about this sorry hold on one second, because I think I'm getting a food delivery, but give me I can't mute myself. So sorry, train of thought, part of what we want to do is have this conversation, because one of the issues that we are faced with is southern battery. Park's resiliency is based on the idea that we have to protect our community all of battery park city as well as all of lower Manhattan from flooding. However, the area where Wagner Park is focusing on in terms of the pavilion of the building that never flooded that hundred year storm, never Madden managed to just destroy property or lives in the hundred year storm. Now. Clearly, it's not going to survive a 500-year storm. We're not looking at that. Quite yet. So the question that we're looking at and proposing today is focus on what must be done to protect property, save the money that you've raised and push it towards other things in battery park. City such as resiliency for the individual building, which is also within your purview of protecting and maintaining property and I, want to open this up for discussion for the committee. Let's see if I can find any hands raised, Sarah Cassell was raising her hand Sarah. Oh sorry, I have erased it earlier. I was wondering what, if you specific specifically if Nick and company have looked at, where what the cost would be were they to focus on resiliency for each building? I think well go ahead. Nick I think the answer to that is no, because they haven't looked at it that way, but go ahead. I, don't see Nick, okay, he's not there yeah. Well, he may not hear him at home. I, don't know why, and now we can hear him. Yes, okay, so actually it's a really good question and again what I would say here is that and some people are new to the topic. What we are doing in battery pork city is part of an overall approach that the city of New York is taking called it's lower, Manhattan coastal residency. Overall, it contemplates a continuous. What would be when is all built, a continuous flood barrier from as far as the 23rd from the East side, all the way down through two bridges around the battery up through battery park city and then ultimately, above battery park city up on the West side, it's coastal resiliency to protect vast swath of lower Manhattan, there's a slide that we repeatedly show and Lucian I can throw that I can center it with you now, if you don't mind bringing it up, but it's just the slide. We put in all our presentations that talks about the amount of amounts of land and amount of buildings we're protecting and, if I have it right, our battery park city, residency project, contemplates flood protection, 400 I, want to say 120 buildings and 14,000 residential units. So we're talking here a matter of scale and scope. That is, this. Conversation is effective than it would be to go. Building by the building. I mean it takes the old members to protect themselves, but what you should put in the field and build resiliency here is that you want a layered approach, so you want buildings to take for individual means, but you also want blood-based postal protections checked and getting additional layer protection exactly correct. I'm not what I would suggest I understand. Sarah's question was a little bit different, but the suggestion that I'm saying is not in any way shape or form to change one iota of your plan about resiliency and protecting property. What I'm asking about is whether or not we have to go through the expense of renovating a restaurant and building more space for the battery park city authority. At a time when there's such other urgent needs such as parkland and park, space and open spaces for the people in this community and all of lower Manhattan that are flat flocking to us, and if we can push this off push off some major stuff, that's my concern not in any way shape or form challenging what you're doing every place else, but bringing and putting in temporary measures to like what you've done with the ball feels. We decided the temporary measures we're going to do are cheaper and better than building something out and then tearing it down later on. You know, so it was a really great solution. What I'm asking is to come up with something creative in Wagner Park about the buildings. So the answer there I want to set the expectation. The answer there isn't fully all the components of it is one piece of one system from the South Saturday Park City resiliency project itself, then ties into what will be the west side of the city agency, North battery park city instances and then to the east, we're tied into what the cities and what the rest of Lmc you'll recall. The conversation we had about the ball fields, which is a very productive home of the community board as they all are. We ultimately decided on doing a an interim solution at the field that would then be able to be scaled back once the north and the South Battery Park city unity. Projects were in place because the assumption it was built upon is that the North state, Park, City and south side of the park city projects are permanent projects and once those kind of pain, points or pinch points are sealed off, you would no longer need to have that extra protection at all field. But if you're then going to turn around in your own sound project, temporary itself, then you're losing that projection. You would have at the ball field and they are then again exposed. The idea is to have a continuous flood barrier through the imagery heritage down to lavender park across the area Plaza and across the battery. If you don't fulfill one of those gaps, then the rest of the project is useless, because the water will simply flow around what you've built in the place you have not built. So it has to be one continuous system that blocks up waters and accounts for sea level rise and in the case that we've seen earlier also takes into account that interior drainage issue, which I know was so problematic 100 the interior drainage issue, needs to get addressed. What I'm looking at is not knocking down the building at Wagner Park. Now I'm saying do it in two years or three years once we can actually have open spaces again and we can go back inside restaurants and we can have a lot less of this nonsense of clump. It's what's the reality of right now, but the social distancing that we have to live with right now and not imposing upon or taking away more public open spaces from us now and, in the meantime, come up with a temporary solution that is not expensive. That will pitch kind of fill in the gap just by the Wagner Park area, because a lot of what you're planning to do must be done has to be done totally get it and it's totally structural and it must be done, but does it have to be done now, question and I'm wondering what everybody else is thinks too yeah that the panel should weigh in I would just let you know that that's not an option for us. Okay, we need to move on. This is as quickly as we can in the past. Just to give you some ideas of kind of stats. In the past year, from 2019 alone, there were 14 individual storm events across the country that caused at least one billion dollars worth in damage. So, as we said from the beginning, as much as we wish, we didn't have to do resiliency at all. It's either. We take these measures now to change the park for the better or mother. Nature changes it for us, and then we don't have the option we're releasing against time and we need to list as quickly as we can I don't want to be an alarmist, I'm being fearless. These are the numbers. This is the science. This is the data. So thank you for that. A question for you is what portion of the overall southern battery Park city budget is the cost of Wagner just Wagner itself? Is it like 10:20? More or less? Are you talking in terms of cost, wise or in terms of area, cost wise and then also area, just to see how big it is just the wagon Wagner park itself, because that's the only part, that's in contention, it's a good question, so what I would want to do on that? One, and this isn't the point. This is just because I want to make sure I'm giving you the most kind of the most wholesome and accurate answer is once we have the final design complete and then we're able to bring on the actual boat, the contractors and the work. The folks will be doing the work on the faucet actually breaking around and building it. I would imagine at that point and I would defer to Glennon if she's, not here, but I would imagine at that point we would have to better set some of the particular furniture components and how much they would cost I would say the goal, as we always tried it in battery city. Is that to minimize the impact and fade it in the way that so always want to try to do once the process gets underway. You also need to make sure we're creating in a way get it done as expeditious as possible. So I guess that's a long way of saying the conceivable that the portion and margin spark gets done after some other places. Yes, I don't want to speak about the project, but it's not going to be it's going to be a year right. It may just be that you know we do everything and then you do that, but it's all continuous projects, okay, I, think that Bob Zach wants to say something and then Barbara Ireland I do not have the power and also thank you guys. Thank you. No thank you Nick and speak when you speak Nick in responses go slowly because your connection is bad but I. Don't I'm sorry? No! It's! Okay! I! Don't have the power to unmute anybody, so I don't know if Bob and then Barbara are muted, I. Think I unmuted myself Justine! Thank you, perfect. Nick. The concern that Justine outlined I think is shared by many, that the proportion of costs that to the overall budget that you've got for just the Wagner Park facility seems like pardon the bad comparison but you're putting a rolls Royce in when the rest of us are kind of straggling along in a volkswagen, and there is no. There isn't a tangible plan that we've seen to protect all of battery park. City, in the same time, frame I mean you're moving along very rapidly, with a very expensive, very expansive plan for Wagner Park, but I think as Justine outlined earlier, there's not much there by way of protection of the residential and commercial properties in battery park city. That's part of this budget and that's a big concern for us. We have our own inflatable ring that goes around our building, but I guarantee you. It's not gonna. Last for the three-year storm, never mind the 20-year or 50-year or 100-year storm. So that's the concern. Why spend all that money now on Wagner Park, when you could be doing many more interim steps that would at least alleviate the threat until you get a better sense of the overall need good question. Bobby I would take exception with the idea that we're not protecting commercial properties and residential properties. Because, again, as I said, what the soft battery fluctuations project contemplate is protecting that entire swap of lower Manhattan and the reason why South battery city, the project that we started, design on first or very close timing wise with the ball field, is because the area's most affected by Hurricane Sandy, you recall, was the hinge by Puree Plaza, where the water poured in and then around behind five center high school on the left highway that wiped out our ball field. However, Lisa I'm going to send you something now, if you don't mind doing it up, but one of our prior presentations that we made to the community I think it was south battery park city going to project meeting number two. We had a modeling a coastal model of what would happen when the next hundred year storm kicks. If you can bring that up. It's short, I'm going to take a ton of your time- it's maybe a nice less than 90 seconds, but it shows several iterations of wave explosions and then it shows what happens if nothing is built around your park and it's quite jarring see again, I'm not being an alarmist, but it shows that all of lower Manhattan is essentially like that right now, I want to say now what the end is and Lucian can play these again. I'll. Send you the second one we did in January was that same coastal lobby under the same conditions assuming 30 years, they're 30 inch, 30 inches of heat level rise by 2050, and it shows what happens when our south standard proximity, resiliency alignment is in place and you'll see that it protects all of the areas that we're talking about residences, commercial establishments, subsurface infrastructure, etc. So that's exactly why we're doing it we're not doing it to redo a park. We're redoing the park because we have to have resiliency and I really would emphasize to the committee. That's the frame through which you should see it, because that's the frame, that's the truth. We are doing resiliency because we have to this isn't a vanity project for us. This is definitely necessary. Nick I think we're going at it and kind of dancing around the same thing and yet not reaching the same conclusion. Yes, puree flooded other places within you know, Gateway Plaza had to be evacuated with no elevators and power to the flooding in the building and then there's other things where the underground water came in. Thank goodness you guys are addressing that, and you are what I'm saying is use, whether it's deployables or some something else at the moment to protect and connect the pieces by Wagner Park until such time as we are able to go back to normal life is normal with the after. The virus is no longer such a threat to people because what's happening, what will happen? Is the construction will start? Wagner Park will be closed. There will be we'll lose a big chunk of outdoor open space and what we're saying what I'm saying and I think that Bob would support. Me is again at least present us with the options like you did with the ball fields. How expensive would it be just to put up temporary deployables in the event and have that as the option if there was such a storm plan? That would be a threat once again to buildings and property and lives in the interim, and why am I saying that? Because people in battery park city are hurting, this whole city is hurting I mean you know it's terrifying to me, because I'm still, you know that's what this way. Democracy for battery park city is still saying: 300 million is enough, and I don't see how we're going to do everything that needs to be done and still have the conversation about affordability. As in battery park city, we have no deal on Gateway Plaza, yet we are still looking at ridiculous pilot and there's all sorts of stuff. That's outside of this conversation, however, this conversation is vital because there's money that you guys got for bonding that you can maybe take and help out some of these buildings that can't make their plans remind me is that law, 97 or something local 97 about having the buildings having to be in compliance with retrograde or retrofitting? For that's right, Justine, 97, Climate globalization act. Thank you is an immediate requirement for buildings to start planning for and if they can't afford to do that, they're going to have to face fines. I can't! Imagine anybody not wanting to do that, because it's going to help the rest of the world, the country, everybody is going to help everybody. It's not a bad thing. But, however, if there's no money to get it done, how are we going to function? We have to I guess what I'm saying is. How do we balance this all out and I'd love to have the conversation and I? Don't know what monies of the bonding that money that you've already taken out can be spent to help the buildings, but I'm going to assume the bond is for resiliency but helping the buildings retrofit could be resiliency and that doesn't necessarily only have to be the condos. That could be the commercial buildings too. You know I'm open to any discussion, but I want to call on other people too. So I should give you an answer chance to answer, but and then I should call Bob Schneck. So I think his hand was up. Betty K wrote something in the chat and so did Judith Weinstock, but I did I, think I skipped Barbara Ireland, but I'll come back to you, because committee members are now speaking so Barbara be patient with me. Bob Schneck, please, okay, I just wanted to say to address the question that raised about urgency. I've been fighting about urgency with various committees about this since Sandy, so I have been a decade of experience and worry and in concern about this and I think that my concern has always been about coordinated New, York, City planning for lower Manhattan, and I've always thought about how important it is to straighten out things with the army corps of engineers. How important it is to straighten out things all the way from 23rd street all around to our very expensive economic plans for southern Manhattan on the east side, all the way up, past Tribeca, I've been concerned for that whole thing and now I think agreeing with Justine I'm very concerned about how much money we're spending on this now and, from my point of view, it's a case of very extraneous opulence. We're going to have something very beautiful. The opportunity, in my opinion, again if I were the boss here, is to say we have to figure out how we can do things that are inexpensive and practical and spend money with really excellent engineers to figure out how to do this as inexpensively as possible, so that we can help ourselves up along the up along where Tribeca is, for example, I think that we should pioneer economical solutions, not look at all of these at kind of destroying, what's beautiful, already and replacing it with other beautiful things that might be a bit a little bit more beautiful. But from my point of view are made of tinsel and so I would rather see us focus on there's so many places, there's so many problems here we have this. We've had for years. Another thing I've cared about, which is the leasehold problem to work on, so there's lots of things to spend money on here, resiliency for those buildings, kind of addressing climate change, all this stuff costs fortunes, and so where should we be spending fortunes and how much? What are the timelines of these things like and I think that as a community board, we're all responsible for seeing these things in kind of lined up sheets that show us how much they cost. So we see all the line items and then we get to respond to the line items. It's one thing to respond to beautiful, looking architectural renderings, it's another thing to look at paying for them, and so I can't if I were the person, if I were the executive who for whom they bring these proposals in front of me, I would stall before I would sign them and I. Think a lot of us who sit on this committee, who have a sense of kind of humility, isn't quite the right word, but of kind of appropriate scale will kind of say well. Do we really need this? Do we really need to spend that much isn't what we have already very remarkable and beautiful and special so anyway, that I'm I think it falls in line with the concerns that Justine started this with and I fully agree with her. Thank you Paul. Thank you. Judy. Do you want to say anything Judith or no? Yes, can you hear me Justine? Yes, thank you. I would just echo your comments and Bob's comments as well. I mean you know. We talk about resiliency and we talk about sustainability, but you know, in my view, sustainability is a really important word here, because we're talking number one about the environment, we're talking about also financial sustainability and for those of us that want to live in battery park city for a long time, and we want to make the money last. There are just a lot of reasons why some of this just doesn't make sense. It's really expensive and, as Bob said, we have something beautiful, so I say that in order to sustain us environmentally and financially that maybe we do what Justine said. We put this thing on pause. Okay can I just be, can I answer a couple of those concerns? Would it be helpful to the committee sure it would be helpful and then I'm going to call on Betty K? After you, sorry I was on mute and I couldn't work. The chat, no so first to Bob I would say thank you Bob, as always, you've been I, think to a board meeting or two of ours and they're all streamed, live and online for access after this back, but rest assured that our board always looks at the most cost-effective way of doing this going to make sure things are done in a top-notch fashion to the world-class standards that battery city isn't before, but also obviously done in the most cost effective manner as possible. So what is opulence? One person might not be operating to someone, but these are not things that we're looking to overspend on we're looking to spend exactly as much as we need to make sure that again, hundreds of buildings and thousands of residential units are protected as one continuous integrated system, and there are discussions we directed the committee back to the discussion we had was last launch and we talked about the community wanted to see. Wagner Park be as a result of these changes that need to be made, and one of the options we put out there we can break through the presentation was: maybe we don't want a building at all? Would that be something the community wants and what we heard over what we would know we like the fact we want food service here we want a building, we want a place to be able to go so in every step along the way we've been responsive to community concerns within the constraints and within the realm of knowing that this needs to be done, and it needs to be done as soon as possible. Now Judith made it point about affordability and that's an important one as well. I'd like to bring that up. One of the things that we're seeing in our research is that believe it or not places throughout the country and world, but especially in the country that don't have adequate flood protections and resilience measures in place are actually seeing increases. People who are homeowners might not be able to even get insurance on their homes or flood insurance if they're in an area that doesn't otherwise have flood protection. We're seeing bond rating agencies beginning to downgrade bond issuers like the battery park city authority, who don't have appropriate measures in place so I understand the concern that this is not an insignificant amount of money. But it's money. We are spending to protect, not only lives of the people who live here in countless properties, infrastructure, public parks, public communities, et cetera, but in a very real way. It protects the investment everyone who lives in battery park city, because if we don't do resiliency, then you're not going to be able to get. You may not be able to get insurance on what many cases is, what you put your entire life savings into, which is your home, so we are mindful of that, and it needs to be done and basically done, and the last one I would make for now is we have this conversation a number of times, but it's a little bit of a and it's not a more straightforward thing, but the money we spend on resiliency through the issuance of bonds, which we are in a very lucky position, like necessarily the city of New York, is that we are able to finance these projects ourselves for the issuance of bonds, which allows us the more flexibility that the more kind of aggressiveness they get in. These things done in as timely as fashion is possible, but the money that we spend conditions of bonds or issuance of debt to finance these projects does not one iota affect what you as a battery park city resident, pays in your pilot or pays new ground. They are two entirely separate charges of money. To put it another way, if we didn't do resiliency whatsoever, which, for all the reasons I just went through, I, think we all agree, we want to do that. Money will not go back to battery park city. It would simply be more money that goes through to the city of New York. There would be less money for battery park city and more money for the city of New York, which is the bond money now money which would still then, incidentally, turn around and be building a resiliency project, except probably in 50 years from now, which means five to ten more years of you getting exposed to storms and not having the protection to be able to get insurance potentially and to see the bond rating decrease, which means, when battery park stays working on a project that you really do want you'd be able to borrow money not as cheaply as we do now because of all our sterling bond rating, so it all packed together, but it has absolutely no effect on what you pay environment because, as you guys know right, we get all the money we get. The battery park city collects each year. The first thing you do is pay our debt person and then the next thing we do is pay our operating budget and then everything that's left goes through to the city of New York. If we're paying less in bond service, because we've issued less debt, that simply means more money is going through to the city of New York. If we shrink our operating budget, that means more money's going through to the state of New York and it's less money staying in battery park city for the benefit of Saturday Park City residents, but Nick you've already done the tell me if I'm wrong and then I'm gonna, let Betty speak because she's gonna I think support your position. Yeah you've already you, the butter epoxy authority, has already asked for the bond has already been given the bond to do all this. So the money's you know, they're being said in a bucket someplace being set aside to take care of these projects, is how I understood it number one but number two. The city needs money. Now we've got a budget shortfall there's so many issues that are going on I, don't know what the answer is: I, don't know what the right answer is, but at the end of the day, I fear people are going to look to battery park city and say: oh you're, a cash cow, we'll just keep charging you and charging you. So your idea of it's great to say everything goes back into the battery park city. We pay all this money and it comes back to us who cares if we can't pay it and I you're at the point now, where it's breaking, where we, if you're the people who live here, we are breaking, we can not keep going on the same pace that we're going and yet Copen 19 happens. Our economy is shot to heck. The city needs money. Where is that going to come from? And how is that going to balance out with our need for relief? I'm trying to come up with creative ways to do that and I hear everything that you said and nothing that I'm saying or I think that Bob Schnuck said or that Bob Zack said or Barbara Ireland. Who said she agreed with us in the chat? No one's saying: don't do the resiliency, I'm saying do it, I'm just saying that maybe do something cheaper just to protect us all for a little bit and then maybe yeah. You have some extra money left over what you do with that extra money. If you can help the people in the buildings, do the 97a you know, match up that law and do that and use that money in battery park city for that, if there's a way to make that happen great, if not, maybe the city needs more money, but then they can also not raise our pilot to create and get more money. There's a lot of connections here and I hear what you're saying and we're talking like over each other, but I'm not gonna interrupt I'm gonna, let Betty speak Sorry Betty go ahead for the last couple years, because the reality is. It sounds like what you want to do is: let's save money and build our community on a foundation of sand and then when it washes away we'll all be shocked, but we saved money, I'm afraid it's going to be very much penny wise and pound foolish, as the engineers said over and over again, this is a foundational project, one that they know with time may need to go higher and it needs to be firm enough. They can build on it in the future. So in that sense, I have no belief that they're spending exorbitant amounts of money that they could save. Otherwise they also, if you go back to their presentations, the storms are not way off in the future. They could happen at any time. Sandy was nothing as they said. It doesn't come close because it was a very simple storm in many ways once people lose their homes and I had to change insurance companies because they wouldn't state farm won't ensure in my zip code anymore. So Nick is right that it's going to get harder and harder for people to ensure so, whether it's your building owner or whether you're a condo owner, you can find it harder and harder to find insurance for your property. If something isn't done so I very much agree, the project needs to move forward. Delaying it will only add more and more cost to it. So it's not the savings that people seem to be implying. A look at any project. That's delayed will show that never happens. That prices stay the same. They don't. Unfortunately, thank you, Betty. Thank you for sharing that I can't manage to balance between the chat and the can raises, and everybody else is there. Someone who hasn't spoken, I see nobody in the attendees Bob Schneck is your hand still raised. Yes, okay, Bob I just wanted to comment that, just in response to Nick I think that you know the. It is true that there's been a tremendous amount of planning and thinking about this for a long time and I always have been a little overwhelmed by the scale of it and even the if we actually saw the design budget, for it would be very considerable. But I could live with it until we hit this Covid-19 period and I got to actually I lived through every major disaster that we've had in lower Manhattan, and this is going to be the doozy of the whole bunch of them, because it's going to include a depression-like economic collapse, and so this I always really prefer practicality and simplicity, as opposed to grandeur. I think that if Betty carefully looks at the plan and looks at the way it's designed around the jewish museum and kind of in the yardage between the jewish museum toward that hill and between the hill and battery Park city, it is not as expensive as building a castle on top of a building a mountain, a mound first and then a castle on top of it. And so, if I were going to spend big money, I would spend it on excellent engineering to do something simple, that's repeatable for something they were like the state or city of New York. The next thing is in terms of bond money and saving people. I myself haven't been able to get a to get kind of home equity loans for the past two years because of the leasehold problem we have here, and I've always had problem also with the resiliency part, but it we're able still to buy that kind of insurance. Those are really big issues, but I think we've spent a very long time figuring out what we're doing with this little piece of land. That's a little nailed pairing of the edge of Manhattan and spending tremendous amounts of money on it. So the amount of money per yard that we're spending here is more than almost anywhere else on earth can so I think one thing is rather than talking about what kind of finishes we should have, whether we need more stairs here and there, where or not where a trash container should be, and all those things are really refinements of a big refined plans. They aren't about down and dirty kind of the kind of solutions that are between pure a and the battery are fairly simple ones, whether I like them or not, they're fairly simple, and we don't even know how expensive those are and they've taken years to buy those parts, and it's just I think that what we have here is something that started with a with the controversy over whether or not we needed another restaurant in that park in the first place and it's expanded to this is it expand? Is it expanded into resiliency, so I really again think that there's some real questions, especially given the timing Bob. Anybody else want to speak on this topic. If you can, I'm looking to see about raised hands looking to see Justine, I and Lucian your hand was raised right, I'm sorry, no problem I was just chiming in to say that Nick had right before the meeting. He had sent me a video and he was mentioning it. Oh yes, please, that's Nick, just a question. The video there's two that you sent non-alignment or aligned. Yes, thank you so much Jeff. By the way, if you don't mind and they're both again they're really short I would play the first one first, which is no alignment. Okay, what this shows is if nothing is built in Wagner Park. So if we don't do anything that some people are proposing here, what happens when we get hit with a 20 50,100 year, storm again Nick, just as you're going to play this, I'm not going to do anything. I'm saying put up whether they're tiger barriers put up something temporary, that's cheap, now, I get it and just hold on your batteries are not going to take. Your time is not going to do it Justine. It's just not going to work tiger barriers are fine as far as they grow, but then what happens to all the subsurface infrastructure? No I want you to do that. You're missing the point right: that's not what it is all that has to happen totally, and that has to happen now. What doesn't have to happen is the rebuilding of the knocking down a building and doing something else, because I totally agree with you. I am not I'm trying to say save money where you can bookhead play the video. Sorry yeah! Sorry, I'm just on the phone, so you let me know when it's done it's about a minute and then I'm saying maybe a minute 17 seconds, yeah you'll see a couple of attenuations and then we'll see that you'll see the big one. That's it yup it's going now Nick, while this is playing. What's the difference, whoops, no, the next video to play what's in between alignment and alignment, videos, okay, so that was the first one. You all saw that you all kind of saw the very sobering flooding of most of your Manhattan right. The second link. Now, what that demonstrates chef and thank you very much for driving, but the second thing demonstrates is that modeling updated now with the South Valley Park City residency project alignment, so the same project we've been talking about with that alignment in place. It shows you the level of protection it provides battery park, city and bath swap will attend, including everyone's home, everyone's business, that's on the dry side of the barrier. So if you play that, that's I think one minute 15 seconds, it shows you exactly what it is: we're building and the tremendous lift Nick. Just one question: is this: showing is this just with the South Battery park city improvements, or is this with the complete, but with an emphasis, a focus on that area? Oh, okay, it's the south project because you'll see it zoomed in just to that portion of the battery park city map. We would presumably have updated versions of these once we do the north, but you'll see it's just limited into that area of from this just Justo's museum around Wagner puree and the battery okay, all the other improvements have been put into place as well or exactly yes, it's so it's the Wagner Park portion, the Pra portion, the battery portion. It won't take into account what happens in the west or the north, because it's not going to show us that, but I guess no yeah. The map is only there. The map is only zoomed if it zooms in close enough, but you're only seeing the southern part of the name: okay, basically from the regional jewish heritage to battery park. Okay I just want to get the context right. Okay, I'm going to play now and that's the same wave attenuation. That's a 30 inches of sea level rise by 2050,100 years, slower than hit, which was the protection. So what this is showing is that everything is flooding up. I mean it's being prevented to where your barrier is. Oh I see yeah seed solution, okay, it does go into north battery park city because we haven't that doesn't count for that. But it doesn't come south right and it protects. I'm saying do that, just don't do it by doing the building. Quite yet, that's all do you have a rendering of what it would look like if you managed to do the western resiliency with temporary measures in the battery I mean taking care of puree? Obviously, because that's the low point but focusing on from the jewish Heritage Museum North, and what that would look like he may not be here or is he I, don't see him I wonder if we lost him again? No, and certainly it's a very impactful video, it's a very impactful story, but once again I, don't think I mean and Tammy. Please speak and speak up because I know you have an opinion on this I. Don't think that anybody is saying. Don't do anything, no I think we're all saying we all want resiliency. We want to protect all of Manhattan all the way around. That's a clear, but I'm curious about the costs on for the West side, which is the last project to be done, and yet we need the park right now for social distancing and we need people to be able to have shelter in their homes. So I would hope that we could find a way to stage these projects, so the West side could take precedence and we could maintain the park for a couple years, while the West side is done because the West side didn't flood precipitously, but you do puree because, obviously we all know that means so I just want to make a comment on viewing those two disasters, and that is that the disaster didn't penetrate the space between the jewish Museum and the center of Wagner Park, and it didn't penetrate the space between the battery park and the center of the Wagner Park. So those spaces that were that did not have that huge slug of dirt mountain there held just fine and if you in fact had the same barrier that connected the battery park to the jewish museum, it that goes in front of that hill and then scraped away the hill and had the same picture have the same kind of demonstration happen. The same those same protections would I hope hold the same way without having to make all these decisions about refined changes. You know whether or not we have you know how ramps work and how much we spend on gardens and how much we spend destroying the gardens we love already. Thank you. Bob I mean that would be an interesting conversation to have an interesting information to gather because it may be insanely expensive. It may be just as expensive or close to it, and we may turn around and say that's insane. No just do what you're planning to do, but it'd be nice to know what the options are and I know that this is something that we've always been pushing on and pushing on Nick and Eric. But it's an important thing, especially because Covid-19 changed the whole game. I, don't I! Think Marianne Braberman has a question in the chat saying: could we get data about what buildings our experiences is experiencing as far as collecting maintenance on time are owners defaulting on mortgages or rental units empty? What is the real impact? I'm assuming you mean of Covid-19 on Bpc owners and residents. I, don't know, that's a bpca question and I, don't know, I think that's a board of each building, question and I. Don't imagine! Bob Zach would be answering those questions, but I can ask him I, don't know if he's there still maybe I mute him. Bob you're a music. He may not be there and I, I'm pretty sure he probably could not answer and whatever. But that's a question from Marion that we could talk about offline anybody else. Just Tina I, don't know yeah go ahead. I'm sorry. Somebody said Justine who's that oh, that was Eric. Clenson Eric. Go ahead! Sorry, hey not to the most recent point, but I did just want to emphasize the fact that you know your the conversation that's being had right now. You know, isn't falling on deaf ears and I'll, discuss it with the rest of the team and also just wanted to emphasize. You know. The mandate that we have from our board is to get these projects done as quickly as possible, and you know the ball fields and the south resiliency project came first, and so those are the ones that we've been pushing on as hard as we can to get them done as quickly. You know, we've been hesitant to pause any project. You know, with the exception, of course, of the governor's Covid-19 related pause, but you know the mandate remains to try to provide the protection for the community as quickly as we can and at the greatest value that we can, and so you know the next point. You know the economic conditions are clearly on a worsening trajectory at the same time between sea level rise and climate change and the increased frequency of severe weather events. You know the meteorological trajectory is also worsening and so we're trying to get all these projects done as quickly as we can and as cost efficiently as we can and so I hear Bob's point that you know we spend a lot of time talking about the nitty-gritty details that you know there's a risk of losing the forest through the trees. But you know I want you all to know that the forest isn't lost on us and I. Don't think that it's you know it's not lost on anyone, who's working on the individual projects or you know at the board level or at senior staff level, and you know we're focused on getting these projects done as quickly as we can for as little money as we can and again to the next point. You know we heard loud and clear that you folks, you know, wanted a replacement for the Wagner Park pavilion. We didn't want to put a wall up in front of the pavilion and given the needs of the alignment we needed to, you know to address the pavilion in some form or fashion, and so you know, Aecom I think has done a terrific job in large part, thanks to your input and the input of the community board, all the committees, but particularly yours, and so again we're cautious and conscious of the impact that these discussions have had and we're. You know we're watching the dollars closely, but I again. I just wanted to emphasize the fact that you know the conversation is heard and it'll be reported to the rest of the team. Thank you and in the escape of time it's really 8:24. So I want to move on to the next topic, please, which is applicability of recent changes to city and state law on e-scooters and e-bikes in battery park city, and this will be a discussion and in case anybody you're not aware Lucian I, don't know if you have reference to the law. But what has happened is that the city and the state saying e-scooters are that's not that? Okay, e-scooters are they're, talking about having them be allowed to be on the roads, am I correct. Here we go. The state law that was passed in the budget session this year essentially created a legal pathway to e-scooters and e-bikes in New York city. They were largely legalized in the rest of the state, but for some cases the local municipalities, if they weren't legalized local municipalities, could choose to do so, and so very recently that is what New York City Council has done. So there's three bills that were voted through City Council, I'm dealing with e-scooters one dealing with a certain class of e-bikes that is e-bikes that go between 20 and 25 miles per hour that have a throttle, and the third bill was to authorize a scooter sharing pilot program to be developed by DOT, so I think the relevant portion of this is it. Can everyone see the text of this bill? Int 1250a? That is where? Can these scooters be operated so I think some of the concern is that they there may be people out there who wish to operate them outside of the street. Excuse me yeah. So the part of this I was looking through earlier. Tammy asked me to read through this law and there's a section in here. We go part b here: no person to operate a motorized scooter on streets, torrent parks or another. Okay, let's see make sure, isn't it in the time it seems like not the right section I was scanning through, though that person should operate a motor screen around Street Journal parks and publicly didn't see. New York I have to go. I have to go back through this, because this is operating the bicycles pursuant to the vehicle traffic law. It's saying you can't do it in the parks and then same rights and responsibilities as operators of bikes yeah. But the part here that kind of confuses me is on streets or in parks. I only use the sidewalks that seems crazy, yeah versus parks. I know that that's not the intent of this is to put them on sidewalks, because they're very large I'll have to go back through, but because yeah they're not talking about like what Betty rides. No, these are scooters. These are akin to scooters. You see children kind of pushing but they're much larger and they're, electric yeah they're electric and the motorized bikes too I thought they were bloating them. This is the part that this is the part that really matters is the operational electric scooters. The traffic law will be subject to the same rates and responsibilities attributed to operators of bicycles pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law. This code of the rules of the department shall be subject to any additional applicable provisions of the vehicle, attractive law, so this is saying that they can be operated under the same rules as bikes, meaning they can't be taken on limited access highways. They can't be operated on the sidewalk I just need to look and find specifically motorized. Scooters shall not include an electric scooter, as defined in 114 e I, see so yeah. So this is saying a motorized scooter like a gasoline or something power right like some simple motor, but this is the electric scooter, so it looks like where bikes are permitted in parks. Scooters will also be permitted in parks, but where bicycles are prohibited, snow. Shell, a bicycle, is what my read is on this, but I am not a lawyer now. Let me also pull up you put in a power resolution. No I was just kidding. Do one second, I'm going to bring up the other law chat with everyone. I hear a good Quora is helping us out here too. Yeah, please feel free to chime in Ecora is saying: here's from the city council votes to legalize the use of e-bikes and scooters. Sorry opening it up. Maybe it's the same thing that you got its legislature is going to remove restrictions on three classes of electric bikes with top speeds under 25 miles per hour and electric scooters, with top speeds under 20 miles per hour. E-Bikes and e-scooters will legalize statewide. When the state budget was passed on April 1st, the council is now acting to remove the local law that prohibits them and adds measures to ensure designed to ensure that delivery. Cyclists are not subject to unequal crackdowns and summonses on their bikes of their bikes by the New York City Police Department. So they're, basically trying to give them more free reign to go, allow restaurants to temporarily use okay outdoor space in front of their business. We know that let's go ahead and it eliminates the prohibition, it's just the same one I just did so it's. This looks like this one about e-bikes but e-bikes and the same thing generally. What this does is it allows it legalizes these e-bikes. What this doesn't do and this the New York City Council, could do this per the state law is what this doesn't do is allow for currently prohibited e-bike classes on Hudson River park. It does not allow it does not those the bikes that were prohibited by state law remain prohibited. New, York, City Council has the power to allow them to do so, but none of the bills that were discussed or voted on do that all they did was they allowed for the class of e-bike. That is very typically employed in the delivery of food and sometimes groceries. Excuse me this is Betty really yeah. Please suggest that we limit only to battery park City. The transportation committee is doing this anyway, yes topic. So if you'd limited to just battery park, city yeah and talking about air Park lands is what I want to focus it on and we need to sorry go ahead. So the applicability of that when applied to battery park city is to I, don't know what degree when they say the Hudson River park. You know in the state law, I have to read the state law and in their description of the state park along the Hudson. If that includes battery park city parks, which is it's a state authorities park, it is not it's not synonymous with state parks. In the same way, so I would have to ask Eric or Nick to comment whether that whether or not e-bikes were even though they're currently against the rules to go on the greenway and Battery park city. If that state law applies to the parks within battery park city and then all of a sudden makes them allowable. Is that your plan? But what I'm saying is if the state law prohibits it and Hudson River park, if it also prohibited it in battery park city, because then it would still, there would still need to be legislation. Battery park, city authority couldn't even allow it without city legislation. That's the case, I believe that's only if battery Park City Park authority parks are what's understood to be meant by what was described in the state law so to them is what to Eric and Nick. I'm not clear. Yes, Cora. It's not chinese I thought. Cuomo passed the law. The state was April first, that they passed the law. So it's legal at the state level and at that time the city, the council hasn't passed that law, the state law passed. It was legal at the state level, City council on June 25th, that Thursday they passed a number of bills, and this is one of them and the reason why Como passed the lower part of it is also because of Covid-19 and all these delivery guys become our heroes, delivering food right. So I thought it was legal at the state. Then now is legal at this city, but with the Hudson River Park Trust, Bob Tony can give you a very good synapses of the whole thing because they almost spend I think a year of time. Every time when the Hudson River Park Trust Advisory Council, is community groups of many from the bottom all the way up in the north, all the com, all the organizations, including boathouse. We have a little part of it discuss. They do not want e-bikes on the greenway so that Hudson river punctures is a very particular segment. But the leadership with at that advisory council made it very clear, they've been discussing it, they do not want e-bikes or scooters or anything, but then every park city just ended. I'm not sure, is the official line, but it ended by Stuyvesant high right yeah. So then we need Bpc to clarify. That's right: oh where's, what got it? State law gave cities the ability to legalize e-bikes and e-scooters, which the city Council has done. They also that law also gave I believe gives the city the ability, if it wishes to legalize the use of the Hudson river greenway within Hudson River park, for the same purpose, though City Council did not do that here, so that would still be prohibited use along the greenway. Yes, but what I I'd like to clarify is it was a language specific to just the Hudson River park greenway or was it state parks along the Hudson river, in which case maybe battery park city falls in that's what I'm unclear on who are you asking that, of course, either Eric or Nick, so Erica Nick? Can you answer that? Okay yeah? I'm here? Can you hear me? This is Nick's sport? Yes, thanks Lucian, that's actually really helpful. So a very practical perspective and I say practical because as much as we live and breathe kind of a local government from the regular lay person on the street doesn't care or know. What's the difference between when battery park city starts where such a river park starts, or if the East River reverses its place around as a place they're live so I think it's fair to say that battery park city has no interest in being a separate entity in this respect on whether can be legal or not right. So we are part of New York City. If they are legal on illegal New, York city in certain areas, we want that same model, I think to apply to battery park city as I understand you can't ride them on sidewalks. That would be the same kind of approach in battery Park City. The Esplanade is mapped. Parkland and Lucian makes a good point in that we are we're a state entity with parks, but we're not a state park per se. I'm not sure, though, from a legal perspective, whether that's a distinction was that a difference, I, don't know I, guess what I'm trying to say is we wouldn't want to get into the business of trying to kind of check every bike that comes into battery park, city and say well, you're in battery park city? Now it's a different federal. We wanted to be obviously a consistent, better rules across you know across lower Manhattan, certainly, ultimately, it'll come down to enforcement. If, right now the rule is bicycles that are really human-powered landlord or our schools are allowed on the esplanade, but we have a dismount zone in and around the marina, especially because of such a heavily crowded area. The good News is for delivery purposes. I'm not aware of any building in battery park city that has an entrance on the esplanade, especially down around south coast. Buildings, purposely don't open on the esplanade they open on this one. They open on yeah on South and avenue or battery place, so there wouldn't be a need for a delivery worker to write down the escort unless they were just looking to ride down the estimate or they didn't know the difference. I think in most cases, they'd be going right through the doors the building's entrance, which is not on the astronaut and not on the sidewalk, except for the distance that you're getting from the street into the building. So I think that covers for sidewalks and blessed are not for delivery workers. The people who are not delivery workers who are writing these things, although I think what Lucian said is this bill was specifically aimed at delivery workers, or at least mostly in defense. It's probably going to take a little more research to understand how we fit in, but I think the general thrust is. We are part of New York City and want to make sure that we're coordinating with city and state D.O.T, certainly on how that manifests itself, but in as much as the escalators parkland and these things are not to be written in parks, I think we may be covered, but again I'm not an attorney and have to research it all. Thank you, Nick. That's helpful and I appreciate you looking into it, but I want to remind you that Pj Clark's, the district and everything in Brookfield and even Jugino's in Wagner Park. They all will require access on the park or into the park. So you to have people riding perhaps on the even delivery. People and I think that back in 20, February 26 2019 the battery Park City Committee, we passed a motorized vehicles in battery Park city park lands and we plastered. We passed a resolution asking that CB1 requests the Bpca and Battery Park City Car parks corporation to find the rules to explicitly disallow powered bicycles, scooters and any matter of recreational micro mobility devices to be driven through the parks within its jurisdiction on anything apart from human power and, of course we're not talking about scooters for handicapped people or you know, obviously bicycles for children whatever else. But the request does not include motorized devices that are used by individuals of limited mobility as an accommodation, blah. So I guess glad to hear you're saying you want to do with the Hudson River park. Trust is doing glad to hear Cora said that Bob Townley is on the case to try to keep the e-scooters and e-bikes off the greenway, but I think that, from my perspective, I'd like us to remind you of the resolution back in 2019 in February and to say we'd, like the battery pack city authority, to push to have them off the esplanade and all parts, because we do have businesses that are there. We may not have businesses condos that open up, but we have businesses that are there and then, if there is some a limitation, what is the Bpc parks doing about signage if you're, looking at like by Chamber Street in Wagner, so I just throw that out to you guys- and here you go. Thank you and then I'm loving the fact that transportation committee is picking this up because it is much bigger problem than what we have just about city. Obviously yeah, it's it is it's a significant problem, so I'm glad that transportation is devoted. Sometimes this as well. Just very briefly, just you know, take those internal reverse, so you guys keep hearing about wayfinding. We did the presentation, I, think I said a month ago or so, but that size would be appearing. You know folks, hopefully soon and we would in as much as it's modular or you know, kind of if it can be easily changed in a way. That's not cheap, but you know easily change or it's not like this porcelain tonnage, we'd be able to adapt that, presumably to account for any changes that are made. The second point, I would make is doing note the resolution from the committee. We appreciate it I think here it's probably a fundamental difference now, because in the past, before the new law was passed, these were illegal anyway. So presumably battery Park city authority could amend this rule to match whatever the state law is. But now since that has changed at a state level where they are legal, the environmental authority is not going to go. Couldn't we can go against state law? We can all. We can go above what it allows, but we couldn't be in conflict with it. So it's illegal in the state. They have to be legal here. We have to define and understand kind of how that applies, but what I'm saying is it's not going to be a place where they're legal everywhere, but they're, not legal and battery perks? It doesn't work that way. We can't go opposite or in the we can't go opposite or in conflict to what city and state law says so I think then it's important for some representatives from the Battery Park City Committee, to come to the transportation committee meeting. So we can talk about it in more depth because I know that goes into great detail. I want to get some more clarity on it. I think that would be really helpful. Me too, and so I'm looking forward to Betty and the transportation Committee. So thank you. Nick do all park rules in battery park city exist exactly the same as they are in all other state parks. It's a good question. I haven't done a line by line I haven't done a line by line comparison. I'd probably need an attorney for a few or 20 years to look at it. I think that hey this is Eric. Munson can I just ask a quick question. Setting aside the important legal considerations could I just ask the committee I recognize that the greenway is a thoroughfare for a lot of cyclists, but are there other areas that are of grave concern as it pertains to motorized bikes, because in independent of what the regulations are, I think it's something that we would want to have our eye on, because you know whether it's permitted or not. If somebody is creating an unsafe condition in our parks, it's something that we would want to address. You know and Pat's on the line as well, and so we can address those items just as a you know, human to human perspective. Yes, all parts of the Esplanade are a concern. Yes for any, but I guess it's just. There are some delivery guys who do whip through on the esplanade yeah, because it's faster during the evening times, but it's very dangerous I haven't seen that when I've been walking the esplanade, but that's good to know so something to that. We should be concerned about thank you and the parks guys can't catch them because they're too fast yeah. No, they just go so it's not all right, so Betty, Bob, Cora and then we're gonna wrap this up so Betty. First, please, oh sorry, yeah! No one realized! There are people who have been actually for a couple of years. People who use e-bikes and e-scooters in Barre, Park City, because I see them all the time. There's some children who commute to and back from school and back on e-scooters, because I see them at the hours. That's obviously where they're coming from or going to so I, don't think there is huge, a problem as people are alluding to the fact that they are. But again there are some real fine points, because when you have joggers and people running, when you have people who can cycle quickly, the real issue is how fast are people going? It's not that any one particular method is more dangerous than the others and I think that needs to really be looked at. So you can be fair. All around someone who is careless and crashing into people is doing exactly that and you won't really care what they're using if they crash into you. Yeah very good point: buddy, all right, that's good Bob! You have something to say: Bob, Schneck, yeah I just wanted to say that the class of these kinds of vehicles is a very complex thing and I think we have segways. Now we have electric unicycles I. Think one of the scariest ones from my point of view, is the motorized skateboard. Those things are extremely fast. They operate pretty near everywhere and they actually go as fast as a car, but they have wheels that are about two inches high and those having operated motorcycles for many hundreds of thousands of miles when you go into a pothole and when you operate them at night, you can't see them and something like a pothole is enough to stop these things. So I think that the general operation of that are suddenly allowable are dangerous and that I feel commonly at risk, because I can't hear them, they don't have any there's no way for them to make. Sounds I've never heard any person operating these things ever say with bicycles. Typically, people say: go to your left or they'll have a little sound thing. These things don't have any way to warn anyone, and what we've done is we've completely done away with the difference between operating a motor vehicle and just allowing this laissez-faire thing. I operated motorcycles for years, and you have to follow the rules. You stop at the light. You kind of make a right turn where you're supposed to make a right turn. You wouldn't think of going up a one-way street, but all of these motorized vehicles, regardless what the laws are you can't when I'm crossing the street I can't tell if something's coming I look to the right, because it's a one-way street down the hill, but someone's coming up the hill or several of them are coming up the hill. So I think these are I. Think that they're it's a very complex question and these guys operating on these one wheeled vehicles that also get up to 30 miles an hour, they're kind of dangerous, and also we are going to have to start to think about how to provide secure micro bike and bike storage because having operated bicycles for years in New York, too people tend to steal immersed steel parts off, and so we have, as we kind of bulk up with more people operating more kinds of scooters. A real question is: where do you put them? So someone can't steal them, and you know how do you keep that from being protected yet reasonable, looking and not become kind of a trash heap of broken parts until I? Don't know, I so often see a bicycle over weeks, stripped down to the bone until you still have to just have this little frame, that's still locked to a parking meter or something these things have are I. Think big upcoming problems, besides the dangers of them so I, don't know what I can I certainly think that there are problems on the esplanade and on the greenway and I think there are broader problems, not even in battery park city. Thank you for sharing that Bob and yes, what is this a resolution? Yes, so I'm gonna comment would be at this point to ask if sorry give me a second and go away, I'm so sorry what I would ask is for Nick and for Eric to just get back to us. Let us know where the and battery property falls in under what their understanding is of the rules and if it's possible, to make it a park rule to keep them off in complying in conjunction in accord with what we asked you to ask to be done back in February 2019 to make it a park roll to keep them off of it, but we got eight minutes till nine o'clock. Can we finish Nick your report and Patrick's in eight minutes? Is that possible I loaded for bear I'm ready to go? Thank you. Go ahead all right! Okay, I, like that sun. Do you have those brought up? Europe Nick, you just tell me where to scroll all right very good, so let me bring it up here. First of all, thanks everyone. So the first things first is I wanted to go through, as promised with the committee, which we said we would do last week come back with updates on the reopening of battery park city and its various facilities. So thank you all for that. At the outset, you'll see I have some information up top about statewide openings, but very briefly for us and for the committee I think that we began reopening in the middle of June as promised. So the first thing we did on June, 15th and 16th in that area was we opened up the restrooms now what we discussed last meeting was potentially having them opened up from 8:30 and then scaling up which we were able to do so. We opened them up on the 16th from 8:30 to 3:30, and then we were able to fairly quickly direct it. Thanks to Bruno and the entire great parks operations team, we were able to open them up fairly thereafter and extend the hours out to 8 no yeah. It's the second slide. Sorry about that. I'm trying to download this here. It's 9:30, 6 30, my mistake: it's been a long day. It was 3:30 at first and then we were able to extend the hours out to 8 to 6:30. That's still a plus right, so that's the three hours more and we were able to get that I. Have it up here? That's not the second page, my mistake, apologies, okay! Then we're able to do the same thing: Rockefeller, Handball Court. We put some signs there to be clear that we wanted to make sure we opened that for folks to use but very clear that it was for single, slash, voluntary recreational use only because as much as contact sports building those shouldn't be happening to any great degree. We want to be mindful of that, but while also giving again people some additional extra space to get some exercise. Okay dog runs, which I know, is a very hot topic of interest. I called Jeff get away that very day personally, so let him know I had some good news, but we were able to reopen those. Of course. Thank you guys for the patience while we what we did, are we there our way through this those reopened on June 22nd. We originally had thought that we might try and scale those up similarly to what we did with the restrooms, but after talking it over with the team and operation would be decided and with what the community had told us, we decided we were just going to open those up outright, so they now are back open up, as they regularly are with around the clock. Availability. We're asking owners, obviously to continue to be diligent on the overnight and evening hours as we continue to scale up with staff, so they'll still be clean all once daily, but we want to make sure that we are trying to keep them to the same standards that everyone is used to, as we continue to scale up that and are able to clean them more frequently as needed. The question go ahead: a quick question, Marion Bravoman, saying that she did not know about the park public restrooms being opened as of June 16th was. Is it on your website or you know more real time? Okay, it is right. If you go to yeah, that's the blog post. There I think I put it out last time, I tweeted about it as well, but yeah in the report that I'm going to post Lucian. If you actually want to click on that link in the report, it's a live link. So if you click on restrooms you'll see the blog post there with an update that, as of the 25th, the hours were extended to 6:30. So sorry about that Mary. But yes, it's all there. Thank you. Of course, the dog runs opened up like I said, and what we opened up also reactivated when they opened up was the hose and the drinking fountain for the pups to use. Obviously so the puffs can get some refreshment and folks can use a hose to clean it and then what we scaled up just recently as of yesterday I believe it was. We reactivated the water features in those parts as well so kind of the water play areas for the dogs as well were reactivated in serious dogland and North End West Hemsworth not having water play features, but the waterproof features of Sirius and that north end were activated yesterday. Thank you. Of course, playgrounds were reopened at the last Monday June 22nd that was aligned with when the city of New York parks were opening or reopening their playgrounds. I should say: I was there for our dog to dusk daily, as also dust daily as the as a handball quarters. Okay, the water features there were reactivated yesterday, like the water plate, features that the dog ones were so water play features at the Kelsey, Plaza and teardrop plot playgrounds were reactivated. Yesterday, West 10th Street playground. As luck would have it there's a bit of a technical issue, so we're going to have to order a new part to get that water play feature fixed. But, aside from that, all the water play features are back on playgrounds, Dog runs, Rockefeller, Park, Handle court and the restrooms are real. So thank you. Everyone for bearing with us on that very briefly, construction updates. Of course, construction updates, Dpsa construction projects are now in the process of either physically restarting construction, I.e at Rockefeller, Park you'll see some Rockefeller playground. I should say we're doing some work there and are tracking, ideally still for an early fall completion with any luck, don't hold me to it. Any luck maybe come in a little bit earlier, but we are tracking, hopefully for at least Volca stations. A lot of our playground ball field service link remediation is also restarted and we are re-mobilizing on some of our other projects, including the glass benches, which we have been talking about for some time. Okay, very briefly, Vpc pride 2020 and thank you to the community board for helping spread the word as well. You saw it as a bench by and by merchant River house. I should say that is especially themed for pride. There are also life along the Esplanade, especially themed for pride right along the same area, so see some great pictures there of yeah. It was very lovely who knows that there's a puck there and there's vj and there's a great video which I was going to have the issue played, but the interest of time I won't it's on our YouTube and it's linked in this report as well, but it's a short little like 40. Second video that shows a life in action. So thank you all for the support and it was as many things already. They failed back in the age of Covid-19, but certainly something we wanted to take a moment to recognize and be proud of a quick question if we can go back to the parks, so maybe Nick should go back a slide because I was trying to read, as you were talking so I saw fun. No, it's! Okay! Sorry! I'll go to the parks! One we were doing. The so I saw that you talked about page two that no yeah, okay, no go back one backwards! Sorry, no one! Okay! I'm gonna, get the parks all wrong! I didn't see. West Thames Park to see if you were gonna open, the walkway, that's! Okay! I'm sorry! It's just slow, but I wanted. Oh, yes, very good question, I'm so glad you brought that up, because I specifically called the EDC today and I have a call I have a pause, you'll recall, Justin, I, don't know if you were at that meeting, but EDC and I think the mayor's office was going to brief. The Environmental Protection Committee I want to say yes ago or so on. You remember that right when they talked about a lot of their projects, now kind of being momentarily quote-unquote pause because of Covid-19 as I understand it like I, don't want to speak for EDC, so please I will reach out to them and ask them to get you guys an update, but as I understand it, some of their projects are now slowly coming back online. That presumably includes the reconstruction of the West Penn's lawn and that area that sidewalk area between 225 rector and the walkway between 225 and the lawn so I will ask them to reach out to you directly with an update on when that might be completed, or even maybe to come to you guys next month. I, don't want to commit them to it, but I will ask you. That would be great if you can give us some timeline for that. To get that open and then I see, let's see, wait so I saw something I, just I can't see it on the screen here, but the water features on what are our parks that we have now for the kids park is open up. Those claims is the water closet. Playground is on Teardrop Sudra Park playground is on western playground, has an issue. We have to replace the parts that will be on and what about Rockefeller Park I haven't been up. I'm sad to say: I haven't been running that way. Lately I, don't know. What's going on right now is under construction anyway. So I'm not counting and there's no timeline on that opening yet or is there I mean I know that it was on pause, so yeah I know we're looking at that construction again has actually restarted those as well daily. The workers are on saturdays today, guys they're working and we are hopefully shooting for our early fall early. So, okay, with any luck, maybe a little earlier, but I don't want to commit to it. I'd rather tell you early fall and maybe we're able to exceed some expectations. Early fall and the ball fields are open or not. Open ball field is the left in the highest. Actually, yes, it gets over that sorry, no. We committed to you all last month that we would take it back based on the considerations, the feedback you had given and kind of give some thought about how we might open them up. I'm pleased to report now why they don't have a full detail on exactly how that real thing will happen. I can tell you that we're actively working on preparations to reopen the field in the coming days, in accordance with the recently issued state guidelines for sports and recreation. So what that means is I, don't have an exact date, but I would hope. Is that within the next you know two days or a week, or so we would have those fields back opened up and we want to try to make sure that we have as much as we can and it's an open play time for folks who aren't otherwise affiliated with league leagues, that imagine themselves are kind of starting to get back ramped up. We want to try and make sure we're keeping those field as accessible as we can for as many people as we can so more detail to come there, but we want to get those open, it's as big as we can too, and that would obviously include the wrestlers on the ball fields or if the ball feels reopened. The restrooms would then reopen like when we open that makes sense, and then, when you say the leagues you're talking about the little kids right leagues right, not the grown-ups, yeah I, like downtown soccer, downtown giants, people like that all right, yep, it's 904 it took longer. So let's go quick, I'm going to wrote that Dpc blood drive. Thank you all. So much I'm going to embarrass her now but she's on the phone. This long so she's going to get it. Tanya Meltzer showed up and donated blood you'll, see on page 4. If you scroll down, there's a little kick stitch that I did and in the upper right corner. Sure enough. There's Tammy, Meltzer, Knee wearing her masks donating book, I didn't donate I just showed up nominated, so kudos to her okay, Deborah Glick also came by to show her sport helped her support, help spread the word. So thank you assembly, member. I'm pleased to report that to the two blood drives done so far. Last month we announced we had one on June 8. Since then we booked another one on June 25th. Yes, it was almost 200 units collected over those two drives 76 the first time in 106 last Thursday. So absolutely thank you to all our donors. Thank you to the Bpc Seniors Marianne and Ann I helped spread the word Fran Dixon, who works. The group is really kind of instrumental in this. So thank you. It's been so successful. We're planning a part three on Thursday July 23rd, that hyperlink is old, but as soon as I have new hyperlink. I will share that with the group as well. If people want to make their appointment, they should do so now and we want to try to continue to meet this need. So thank you to everyone, who's donated! It's wonderful! All right! Thank you and, of course, go ahead. Oh we're done yeah we'll have! No! Please tell me no almost done yes, since it's 20 continue to embarrass folks about it and make sure that you're doing it I know you guys hang on every month, as of yesterday, New York City is at 52.9 response rate against New York state at 57.3 and a 61.8 percent nationally I looked at some of the other states Alabama. It has a high response that reads: you guys, which means right: Alabama, get more resources by all means: don't respond to the census, nothing against Alabama but make sure you're responding to defenses, well, okay, virtual programming, some really fun programs on commemoration of Juneteenth, which, as you know, the governor has made a holiday statement this year and is proposing legislation to make it statewide holiday kudos to you, governor Cuomo and everyone else. Thank you for that, but you'll feel they was a big hit. People submitted videos of their own. The last thing I wanted to hit on very briefly, and that there are questions is there was a note that I know went across Justine, you may have been on it, but I know Tammy and Lucian I think were the Hoboken Ferry to Brookfield. Place is now back in service beginning yesterday, beginning Monday, June 29th. All the bullets are there from the email that Donald will boy had said that Donald has come to the committee before he's, usually very responsive, it's abbreviated, meaning it's not as many votes going, but it is still nonetheless running every 20 minutes from 6:10 a.m. To about 7:10 P.M Monday to Friday and they're, using the quieter boats, the non-stinky boats and whatever else it is that they're supposed to oh, you know what that's a good question, I believe so I believe that was the plan once they had them all online talking from Mcdonald's yeah, but everyone should continue to know that they're, taking all necessary precautions to ensure that folks are staying in a safe distance, doing deep, cleanings they're screening their own employee daily to make sure that no one's sick so a lot of the same measures you're seeing employed elsewhere. It's happening there as well, with safety being top priority, resiliency that we've done to death tonight, but thank you solution and candy for helping us try to identify a date, hopefully for the next north meeting more to come there. We see what also has sustainability plan. Oh very briefly, I know exactly left a while ago, but one of the things I neglected to mention in my answer before was as Eric had alluded to. We certainly hear you all on concerns about affordability. Generally, it's in our strategic plan. Obviously, but it's not just words on paper, we have been actively meeting with condor boards and with residential building managers on upcoming local 197 requirements, part of our sustainable sustainability plan we'll contemplate that as part of the implementation plan, which will soon be coming later this month, we would hope to be able to continue to work with buildings and help them identify resources and they are available whether they are grants or other types of programs available to, for instance, Nyserda or the New York state near the city mayor's office, see their own grants and other types of inducements available to buildings to help them get more green battery park city lucky in that in the main, Europeans and other neighborhoods, but they are certainly within that pool building that are better off and that is as well. So we want to make sure that buildings are being connected to the resources that they need and we are committed to that Nick. Thank you for that. That's a really important thing, and no- and I'm sorry, I forgot to mention it before, but I want to make sure folks know that we feel it, and we want to make sure that they're part of having a community is making sure that we have people who live here. That's just that beautiful buildings and beautiful resiliency people live here. We part of the conversation in me. Bringing up that whole discussion earlier is I. Want you guys to help think outside the box and I think that we want to do whatever support. We can give to think outside the box to make this and make it a sustainable as well as a beautiful community, but hurry up. It's 909. all right, that's it beautiful! Thank you to our staff continue to do great work. Al Rice is one of our maintenance technicians was recently featured with the downtown line. So thank you to them and that's it. The rest of this you've seen I'm obviously here for questions. Otherwise, I'm going to segue at the bottom of page 9 of my report, upload page 10, to pat to go through some of the numbers. Thank you and thank you. Everyone and it's Eric can I just say as Pat's gearing up that the allied team has really been tremendous throughout Covid-19 they've been showing up to work and doing a great job, not just with their normal duties, but also enforcing social distancing and some of those other elements that are so important to keeping our neighborhood safe. So I wanted to publicly acknowledge him and his team for their important work these past few months. Thank you for that. Eric I appreciate it. As everybody can see on the chart, you know compared to 2019 and now for June graffiti. We only had two in 2019 2020. We had seven. Most of those were chalk. Thankfully, the homeless situation in 2019 was 27. This year was 25, but the question to be honest this year we're seeing more and more of emotionally disturbed homeless people on site. Sorry question a few about homeless people is that 27 homeless people, or is it 27 interactions with because of the problem? You know, 70, it's 27 interactions with homeless people. Okay, thank you. Okay, lost and found property last year was 16. This year was six park. Rules last year was 44. this year. 37 was really a bit of a surprise on my part, vendor solicitation 24. Last year, nine this year we're basically dealing with the ice cream truck coming back and dogs last year was 81 and this year we're at 68. so good trends, almost all the way around. So that's nice right. The numbers are all down pretty much except for graffiti. How are your allied people feeling with the co with Covid-19 and have you heard any responses from them about people with masks? No masks enforcement? Okay, pretty much, thankfully knock wood. My staff has been healthy and nobody, you know either off duty was in contact. So that's good. Basically, with the social distancing, people are pretty much adhering to it, the mass when they're outside in the park and they're with their group. They feel a good number of them that, because they're over six feet away, they don't have to wear a mask. So that's the push back and that's pretty much anyway on what the rule is. If you're six feet away, you know and you're with your own group. You don't have to wear it. So that's the way it's been really. We haven't seen the park normalized the overcrowded until the weekend is, where we're seeing more people out on the launch- and you know, and using the playground facilities, which is nice because now they're open question for you, smoking I've seen this morning, I think it was on the neighborhood chat that people were complaining. Oh at least one person was complaining about people smoking on the esplanade and they're not supposed to. Is that correct? That's correct you! We have one person that comes out smoking, a cigar, but really the smoking issue. Let me see the smoking issue. Pretty much also has gone down. Like I said we had one or two cigar smokers that came out during the pandemic and they're slowly getting discouraged right now from smoking. Okay, like I, said I noticed well, I noticed I personally, didn't notice it, but I did notice that people were talking about groups of people as well. So that would be something maybe to ask your folks about just to kind of keep an eye out and remind people gently that they're not supposed to be smoking out there, because it's with the public space being limited as it is, and crowds and you're trying to avoid people. It's annoying and I know it's annoying all the way around. So it's like, where am I, do this and yeah I'm here, seeing Cora type in here about regular smokers in rector park and smoking while resting on the lawn you all of it they're doing and all of that's park land, and they should not be doing it. So if this, if the Allied universal folks can remind them of that I guess they get frustrated. Where are they supposed to go? Stand in the street and smoke? Is that okay? Actually that's true? This must be out of the park yeah, so this must be outside and there's no smoking inside. So no, absolutely so we'll just see if you compare it to yeah, see if you can help them pay attention and understand and carefully all right. Anybody have anything else. Anybody have any questions about anything else or no can we wrap it up and call it a night? Oh Justine, I'm sorry, I had one thing, I know it's late, but Eric very kindly emailed me and I wrote him back during the meeting, but we do indeed have that application into D.O.T for open streets. We're hopefully going to be in the next tranche of announcements that the mayor makes. This is about the river terrorist idea. Yes, so we'll let you know where we have that set with any luck. We may be able to coordinate with the first precinct slightly in advance to kind of kick the tires on it a little bit, but once we have it up and running, we will certainly let the community board know and we welcome your feedback. We want to see how people like it but I, think the theme of the evening has been the more open public space the better, and we want to try and deliver that to you. Yeah I, think that was a very important thing. I think that maybe, if you can find out and you bring it up in, you know, bring it up and put keep Betty K in the chat. So it might be something that you'll want to be interested in. Even if it's a transportation committee that it gets discussed quickly, it'd be a place to have a quest so yeah Betty we can keep on talking. But anyhow, if that's it, I think I can call the meeting yeah anybody have anything to say: woohoo, I, think we're done and I think that calls I, don't believe we're scheduled to meet in August. So I think that we will see what the full board mean and then see you guys back in September yeah. There will be one north battery park, resiliency meeting I believe scheduled towards the end of the month. If people want to take a look for that, okay cool, so Lucian Lucy send it around. So we know about it, but otherwise exactly thank you everybody. This is, you want to say something. I see you popped up one lesson from the board office when you're filling out the sign in sheet. If you're, not a member, if you're a member of the public- and you want to join the email list, if you mark please add me- I'll, definitely start giving you the weekly agendas, which also contains lots of really great community newsletter items. A lot of things are shared from the battery park city authority and around the district as well, especially during Covid-19. We put a lot of good updates in there. You can also sign up for the email list right from the Live.Mcb1 live.mcb1.nyc website when you log into the meeting, there's a way for you to do that as well. So if you want to know as soon as we put that on the schedule, please sign up for that list and you will be informed: okay, Betty, anything or you're. Just saying goodbye, yeah I was just gonna wave goodbye, all right, cool, well Patrick. Thank you for being on here: Nick Eric everybody and Bob Zach who's gone already and Cora everybody who signed on. Thank you so much. Thank you and take care of July. Thank you. Everyone happy birthday solution. Still there.
