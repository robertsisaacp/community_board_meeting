The November meeting of the Community Board one transportation and street activity, Permit Committee, I'm Betty Kay, the committee chair, I'm joined by Michael Franco who's, the co-chair of the committee and also lucian reynolds who's, a district manager, Force Community District one and we'll be playing the host for those of you who are signed in online. If you wonder the Michael, we have a rather full agenda, but there are also some changes in it. So I want to point that out. For instance, if you came here to listen to the about rebel mopeds that is postponed until next month, could you go to the next one? Excellent thanks and I also want to let you know this item. The first one has also been postponed. I do not have a date for you at this time. We're waiting to get some answers to move forward on this so just know it's postponed and I'm going to go to item number two, which is CitiBike infill, and for this I'm going to actually introduce Manhattan deputy director Jennifer Santinos to introduce her team in the topic. Thanks Betty and hi everyone good evening, I'm Jennifer Santenez, Dot's Manhattan deputy borough. Commissioner, thank you to Community Board, one Tammy Lucian Betty, Michael and committee members for having us on tonight. I'm joined by my colleagues, Brian Peret and janae molloy from Dot's bike share program as well as Jennifer Liam from the Manhattan office, who many of you also have the pleasure of working with Greg Haas and mollier yoon from Dot's traffic engineering and planning team are also on tonight to speak to the Edgar Street Trinity Place school update, which is next up on the agenda. But for now I'm going to get back to bike share. So last year, D.O.T embarked on our five-year phase. Three CitiBike expansion alongside our partner lifts, and this will double the size of the bike, share system, service area and triple the number of available bikes. Since the program launched in 2013, new yorkers and visitors have turned time and again to CitiBike as a healthy, safe, fast and affordable transportation alternative and, as the city continues to reopen now in a covered world. We believe that bike share will play a critical role in getting people around the city and back to work. Our phase three expansion in Manhattan started this spring when we expanded into new neighborhoods uptown, but we're also focusing on adding new stations and more dock capacity in the existing service area, including here in CB1, to help support the demands of a larger system, and so I wanted to thank the board again for giving us the opportunity to present and at this time, I'd like to hand it off to Brian from the bike share program to walk us through tonight's slide hi good evening. Thank you for your time tonight. I think I'm here to share my screen. That's working! Okay! We are in business. Okay! Thank you again here to discuss seed bike infill in Manhattan CB1. Just a brief overview here of CitiBike CitiBike is near the bike share system as you're all familiar. It's a network of shared bikes intended for point-to-point trips, just another one of the many transportation options that we offer. New yorkers system operates 24 hours a day and offers new yorkers the convenience of a bike for quick trips without the inconvenience of storage and maintenance, and the program is a public partnership. City DOT is responsible for planning and Outreach Lyft. Our partner organization is responsible for day-to-day operations and equipment maintenance go to date. Citibike has been around New York for seven years, we've launched 2013 in Manhattan and Brooklyn with about 330 stations and 6,000 bikes 2015. We undertook our phase 2 expansion, which brought the program into further into Brooklyn and Queens, and it gave us 750 stations and 12,000 bikes. Currently we're undergoing our largest expansion between 2019 24, we'll take the program into the rest of Manhattan Brooklyn Queens and into the Bronx, adding 35 square miles to the program and an additional 16,000 bicycles. Citibike has been a hugely successful program. We've seen 107 million trips to date, bikes average about five and a half trips per day. On busy days, we see about seventy thousand trips during the peak riding months and on our absolute peak days, ninety thousand trips getting close to a hundred thousand a day and really all the success is built on the backs of our 170,000 annual members just want to briefly touch on Covid-19 and CitiBike and the city's response, as well as Lyft's response. Really, it was focused on ensuring rider and employee safety that involved cleaning high contact areas on the bikes when they came to the depots. Bikes were regularly disinfected when at high use stations, especially those near hospitals and lift workers, practice social distancing, while in the field and while handling bikes. Another key part of the city's response and list response was the critical workforce membership program. We signed up 20,000 critical workers to this program earlier this spring, so a huge success for us moving on talking about phase three expansion and our infill program as a whole, so phase three expansion, infill as I mentioned, is a two-part program. I think this map here illustrates really well where the program is going. The dark blue is our phase three expansion zone and that's bringing city back to brand new parts of city of New, York City, and it will approximately double the geographic size of the system, that's going to add 32,000 docks or about 16,000 bikes in an approximate like 35 square mile area. What we're here to discuss tonight is our info program, that's kind of more illustrated by the gray on this map. That's adding an additional 16,000 docks and 8,000 bikes into a 33 square mile area that already contains 29,000 docs. So why are we undertaking this infill program? It's really to support the system as a whole, similar to buses. Transit gravity pulls bikes to the center of the program, as this demand shifts. Infill is built to help support that so adding to the core of the of the service area helps support. Increased demand from expanding to new parts of the city helps meet demand and helps riders, find bikes or docks in the existing service area and overall is geared towards improving our rebalancing and system operations. Infill is going to be a rolling program out. The excuse me, the roll out, began earlier this year. We're focusing our initial push on areas with highest demand. That's probably best illustrated by the light blue here and installations are going to be rolling. This planning process is really going to be iterative. We, our goal, is to try to like add bikes to an area and see how system demand responds as it expands we're, using a unique toolbox to achieve these goals. Two you're, probably most familiar with the most obvious, would be adding new stations and expanding these existing stations, but we're also looking into creative solutions such as this one picture. This is a 3D bridging pilot, where we can kind of bridge the curb and occupy both Street Street space and sidewalk space. As I mentioned. This is a rolling program. We'll have rolling outreach and installations. This kind of starts with community feedback and gathering feedback from our online portal. We'll take that data as well as ridership data and our technical criteria and identify feasible locations following we'll notify property owners, community boards and key stakeholders before installation and post installation will continue to monitor how these stations respond and how system demand responds as well just want to touch briefly on our plan as it exists right now for community Board, one we're looking at four new stations in CB1. They are listed here and I'll go into detail on subsequent slides, starting with these three looking at a station on the East road bed of spruce at gold, the West sidewalk of Fulton and Pearl Street. This is on a pops plaza and there's a pilot station and third station here on water and John Street in the West Road Bed final station. We're looking at in CB1 will be on the north road bed of Albany street at Greenwich Street that wraps it up. For me, I'm happy to turn this back over and stop my screen sharing and take any questions you might have. Thank you. How do you muted I know? Sorry, my mouse was not working so I could not unmute. So sorry, for the delay, also not letting me scan the hands, but now I do see them, and let me start with thank you for the presentation that was very informative and helpful. I know that I got the link today and I'm going to share it with people for making for the feedback I'm having trouble, attaching that as well, it's not working I could drop. Oh I can drop that to Lucian. Thank you. It does not allow me to paste or do anything with my chat, but anyway. Thank you are these different? Is the notification of people in the community done before the final decision is made about DOT placement or movement? I guess is my real question right. So our notification process, Community Board prior to install, will notify individual property owners about a plan installation, okay, so they do have an opportunity. Everybody can feel they have an opportunity to respond when they get notification and it's not a final decision. There could be some movement from their input correct, typically when a property owner response to the notification, whether it comes from DOT or lyft, we'll take that into consideration and address any major operational issues we feel they might have great. Thank you and I will let pat moore if you'd like to meet yourself and speak Hi Brian thanks for the presentation, did I hear Albany and Greenwich Street. Yes, that's correct, specifically, where, like that was the North road bed, the northwest corner of Albany and Greenwich Street. Do you mean where number five, the World trade center number five is proposed? I'm lost no! That I'd have to double check. We I will say about this site. We've worked with his office and port authority to and have been in discussions with them about this location. So you happen to pull that up on Google's map for pat, so you can actually show her exactly where you're talking all when you pull right up and brian if you're having a hard time. Just let me know, I can always take over lose control and show that, because, first of all, Granite Street is you know over here. In our little neck of the woods, we have very little access in terms of cars. The streets are narrow, Granite Street is already just impacted with all kinds of issues, thanks Brian for pulling that up now, I'm on my iphone, so I can't really see. Can we get any clothes which corner so that would actually be it's actually going to be on me on the Albany street frontage. I'm sorry I apologize greenwich. So this is the north side. That's correct in front of that pocket park there right it's in the park or it's on the sidewalk or it's in the street. It's on the street. That's a terrible location, and you said, you've been in con. You've been in discussions with port authority. Yes, that's correct, so the world trade center I mean is, for obvious reasons of a big network gap and an area that we certainly feel like. We need to address with CitiBike. Given the numerous security concerns the port authority recommends. This is a as a potential good location that would be outside of world trade center. I would love to discuss this further I live on Cedar street right on the corner. You see cedar and Greenwich, and there is not a lot of you know: space room we have. You know we have issues with cars already. There is not a lot of access into this little area below the World, Trade Center and I'm not sure, that's a great location for a bike station, but we do not need to take up the entire meeting with me. Can we discuss this offline I'd like to know who you were discussing it with? You know port authority, pat and I. You know I would welcome Betty to see if you know the committee or the board would like to consolidate some comments on our larger plan, and we can respond to some of the concerns that you're raising now or later. I do want to point out that you know whether the station is installed on the road bed or on the sidewalk there's. You know very strict fighting criteria that the bikeshare team takes into account. So this particular station would be installed on the parking lane on the north side of Albany, and so we can further discuss some of your concerns. You know offline and kind of clarify that so those points with you, okay, but just whenever you want to talk whenever you want to discuss it, just you know you'll you can get either you get my information from the board or whatever it's fine and we can discuss it. Thank you yes, Pat and I'll get to you too, as CB1 puts together something about the three new sites. Four new sites, and most of you know you know what Albany street looks like at Greenwich, so you know how narrow it is, but we can discuss it again offline. Thank you. Yes. Well, thanks for your input and what about Taylor's had her hand up first so and then Anthony sorry, I skipped you that's! Okay, Taylor! Are you muted, I'm sorry I, I'm screen sharing, which kind of oh I'm going to take over say. Otherwise, why do not? We have Anthony go first and I'll come back to Taylor. Oh sure, thank you Betty and thanks everybody from dlc, good presentation and for Brian or anyone else on that team. I have two questions. First, one have maybe two parts with the three new locations and also with expansion of some of our existing citizens. Will you have a sense or can use any numbers as to how many parking spots may be lost? So if you do not have that now, I'm sure that will come up and briefly discussions with our full board. All right sure I do not have that off the top of my head. But again we can. We can get back to you with those numbers yeah, but that there will be a question that we'll have because I think some of your face locations may actually lose some parking spots and at least we'll be prepared to know that engage the the reaction. We're going to have. The second question. I have is I, understand your concept or philosophy of gravity to the core, but my concern would be at what point do you feel you have saturation? In other words, I think there was a number and one of your thoughts about adding, maybe 16,000 new bytes or softening stations and does I do not know those eight thousand give us a satisfactory result. Ten thousand twelve I mean why sixteen that will be asked at some point where, if you want to do this phase three, why not do that in phases? And do you have a plan for that? Or is it just dropping all sixteen thousand, although I think you said you're going to do over a period of a couple of years, but I think we would be interested in warning? Is there a point where you say? Ah, we've done enough now, that's a great question about the saturation I mean CitiBike. The data that we're using for planning purposes really does point, even though it I know it might look like CD bike is on every. You know every street corner or something, but as I mentioned, it's a hugely popular program and even at certain points of the day, especially during rush hour users feel like, and the data supports that they're not able to find a bike or a dock understand that these 16,000 docks take up space, which is why we're looking into innovative solutions as to how to how to best place them. The third thing, I might add, is that, as I mentioned, this is going to be an iterative process. You know we do not anticipate. You know, dropping all 16,000 docs into community board one we're going to come in with this round and see how see how the system responds and really go from there. It's going to take time and we're going to have to see how the data flashes out to really understand its impact, but and that's reasonable, and I'm sure we want to work with that, but having all the information will be important for both of us to make decisions more informed decisions about it. Thank you thank you and Pat. Do you want your hands still up that Michael? If you'd like to speak, yeah sure I just had I'm off me right yeah. What's the question for Brian, you mentioned the location at Fulton and Pearl was a pilot. Is that correct? What is what does that mean sure that is it's actually going to be on the pumps plaza there if you're familiar with the building, I think it's a Dwayne reed on the ground floor under I I'll get back to you about the exact executive order. The mayor has temporarily during the course of the pandemic crisis allowed for CitiBike and other bike parking on pops plazas. We engaged the building owner here. It's rock rose, I believe who was interested in temporarily hosting a station on the cops plaza, and that would be for the duration of the executive order that allows for bike parking on the pops plaza. Okay got it thanks for clarifying I, think and mitch. I think your last cute and then after that has to go back to Taylor. Sorry she's been waiting. You want to do Taylor first benny. If you do not mind, then, but Taylor speak, I'm here, I'm not going anywhere yeah, I'm on muted. Now, thank you lucian and thank you. Betty as a resident of CB1, I agree with Pat and Anthony's points about locations, so I do hope. We get to hear more and it's communities involved about where these bikes are located going forward. I had a question about free rides on voting days and I did not hear about it in your presentation, I was just wondering about CitiBike and Lift's commitment to getting people to the polls on both major election cycles, but then on off ones as well. I think that could, if they are not already, is that something you guys have thought about doing. I think it could bring more engagement for people to get out the vote and make people able to get to pole sites. Thank you sure. Thanks for your question, I'm not too familiar with Lyft's decision to operate or to offer free rides on election days, but I can certainly take that back and ask that question of them. Thank you. Thank you. I think it was something done in 2018 and I have not seen it since. If that helps reference, I thought I saw something two days ago that it's all been quite a blur, but I'd be happy to clarify with Lyft and ask them. Thank you. Then, let's have mitch go and then, after that, Marianne, okay, Brian I, just have a question. I want to piggyback on something that Anthony had kind of said when you're like scouting locations, and do you take into consideration if there's multiple locations, and maybe one location is, you know no parking, 7 Am to P.M Monday through Friday and then there's other locations that are being considered where there might be some alternate side or immediate parking where residents or family members could visit could use? Are you trying to like take the more? Would it would not to be prudent to try to take the more restrictive parking that residents could not use anyway, if you're not already doing that, because that would seem to be like a win-win situation as J as opposed to just picking a location, I would recommend to try to pick the most restrictive parking locations that would affect the community, the least, and it's probably more important for the outer boroughs, where you know there's more of that is necessary. Sure. Of course we do take parking considerations and loading into account when we're choosing station sites. Obviously, like your example, is seven to seven no parking. We do need to coordinate with city borough engineers to determine what exactly that parking is used for or what exactly that regulation is used for, so those agencies will say: well, we need it, then that's it. You know because I I'm dealing with that with some other situations like that, so it's a matter of you just to recommend of you guys being a little stronger, because that's what they are going to say so I would just support like to try to you know at least get some of those like balanced. You know sure I appreciate and of course like we, you know, CitiBike does not CitiBike intends to maintain as much parking as possible. Thank you and Mary Ann, then Carrie so hi. Thank you. First of all, I want to highly support what Pat Moore said about the Albany and greenwich location. There's a very wide sidewalk there where that small park is that is maintained by the downtown alliance, but the roadways there are ridiculously narrow, partly because of construction and scaffolding. So it would make a lot more sense to have it on the sidewalk area. For the time being, I became a annual CitiBike user this year, partly to Rehab my injured, knee, and so I've become so much more aware of what the options are and the gaps downtown. I'm a little concerned about the port authority and their opinion about where things could be, because I am sure it is totally from a what could I say, a law enforcement viewpoint or a building aesthetics viewpoint. There is so much space, I'm also a volunteer at the 911 museum. So I'm in that area a lot and there's so much space open space that could be used within the World Trade center, complex, wide sidewalks streets that are not used actively at all and there's definitely room in that area to put CitiBikes. So the reasoning for not putting there I do not know what it could be, but I would question it, and that is all I have to say. Thank you, hi Betty. If I could I could respond to a little bit of Ann's question. The port authority is very sensitive to bringing any kind of vehicle into the World Trade center complex, to find any kind of any metal thing that can hide an explosive is essentially an opportunity or an attack. So that's why they are pushing bike infrastructure to the periphery of their of their complex and I. Think that explains probably the city aversion just having CitiBike within that complex area as well. Yeah I will say, though, that they do allow bicycles to ride through there and I love it, because there's so little other traffic, I'm in and out of that area. Constantly so I mean if somebody wants to ride in with a bomb and toss it that vulnerability is there well yeah, they do not want. They do not want anything stationed. I hear you the entrances, that's what I'm saying it was. It would probably be a law enforcement issue rather than anything else, but thank you yes, because I know that's been one of the issues for getting any bikeway even on Bc Street. You know sorry again, if I could add one more thing: Fulton Street as it comes from church down into the complex, maybe they would allow something to be up but up at the end by church street, where it's within that area. So there's not it's not crowded by anything else, but it's not in the center of everything. So there may be some edges that could be used. Even liberty street has a big wide street by number four world trade, and maybe it could be used there, but I mean any big building could be vulnerable to attack and I. Guess that's why they do not have any of these on their doorsteps. So thank you. Thank you, Marianne and let's hear from Tammy, because I see your hand and then Cora after that. Please I'm sorry, but did I miss the slide that was very targeted towards the number of bikes that were in community board one and what their estimation was for community Board. One specific I saw a general slide from outlay, but I did not see one targeted to our neighborhood to understand whether the three stations that we're talking about now are three out of twelve three out of thirty three out of 50 kind of adding on to understand what the saturation level is looking for our community board. That's I'd like to see that and I'd also like to understand how you determine what your metrics are for saturation and then I have one last but I'll stop at those two tell me what you want. No sure right! I can get back to you about the number of stations already in community board. One I do not have those numbers offhand and to your question about saturation as I mentioned. This is an iterative process and is really going to depend on how the system responds as to how much CitiBike we feel is warranted in the area. So can we see, then some documentation on which are you know, on usage of the CitiBike stations in CB1? In terms of how you know I understand, postcode is an unusual thing, but you could take, for example, October, 2019 and October 2000. You know 2020 and use those two as a comparative, so we'd like to see and understand, because when we're talking about adding what do you do about stations that are not very popular, do you remove them, or do you move them and how does that work into the saturation and planning of overall stations? So that's something that we can certainly take a closer look at and share our you know our evaluation back with the board. I do want to say that you know we do not just look at ridership at one station to kind of determine whether or not it's successful, because we look at the bike share system as what it is right. It's a network of stations and bikes that are dynamic and they move around. But that I hear your point at the knees point about saturation and Brian I wanted to see if you'd be able to kind of just talk a little bit more about the infill kind of toolbox and just what general criteria we took into account when we were, you know, selecting locations of where to add capacity, yeah. Absolutely, as I mentioned we, you know this was a data-driven approach into the community report. I mean the feedback focus we're looking at where users told us that they felt like they wanted to see more docs from bikes. The data part really came from an analysis on dockability metrics, so a user's ability to find a dock or a bike, particularly during the rush hours, and you know we evaluated these stations and determined how much additional docs or bikes we felt like they could support, but I will say it was. It was. Data driven and data focused that we looked at this and it was pre-Covid data. I'd like to clarify that as well. So I'd really like to understand what that looks like now, simply because, if we're going to base all decisions in lower Manhattan on Pre Covid-19, you miss the fact that the way the business world works and the residential life in lower Manhattan has been drastically affected. We have some companies who are saying that they will not be going back to 100. Even in 2021. We have a lot of companies that are using less employees on site in lower Manhattan and some that have moved entirely so I. Think of the thousands of people who are not here right now and we see it and feel it by a small business that can't maintain and close downtown alliance, says numbers and things like that and we'd really like to make sure that the CitiBike expansion is both relevant and successful, and we do not have a situation where we have. You know 160,000, bikes out and them sitting at full docks half the time, which is an unthinkable thing right. We know that would not be in a normal time, but we are no longer in normal times and then, as a follow-up to that when choosing sighting of locations, we've had issues in Community board, one with restaurants who have locations, as you well know, outside them and in the options for open streets and trying to make them successful. It was a well so sorry, too bad approach that if it was there, it could not be closed or moved or any other thing and you they did not get an opportunity to have a sidewalk cafe. We've lost a couple restaurants because of it specifically because there were CitiBike stations. That really is not something that we should be penalizing the restaurants, so at all the locations that you're looking at. What kind of look are you having at the sidewalk structure and the ability, if it's a retail location, for them to be able to use the sidewalk or use the street bed? Considering that the new restaurant program will be in fact eligible to be used all next year, spring summer fall as well, so the proposed stations or do not conflict with open restaurants and just to add a little bit more to that. I know that or we all know that last month you know the mayor announced that the open restaurant program would turn into a year-round permanent program and not just a Covid-19 recovery initiative. Those guidelines for what a permanent kind of open restaurant outdoor dining program looks like are still very much under discussion or in discussion and under development. You know what a permanent open restaurant program could look like. May not look like what it you know what exists on the street today and so tammy and lucian. You know we're planning to go back to all of the community boards when we have a little bit more information to share on just what exactly the permanent guidelines- and you know, rules and regulations are for a permanent or program, looks like soon Jennifer I appreciate that I will say that I think it's being done without community board involvement in any way which I find extraordinarily frustrating, because we are the people who hear the complaints. We are the people who the community goes to for liquor, licenses, sidewalk, cafes and everything else. So without having your finger on the pulse of the community to understand why one location works or one does not or a holistic look at it, including community board participation, point taken and understood. You know this is not just solely a D.O.T initiative. It certainly is a city-wide and you know administration, a choice to move forward and try to move forward with the successful permanent, open restaurants program. So the comments that you just shared and future ones about you know how we develop the open restaurants program guidelines that I certainly will take back and I just want to ensure that you know our borough, commissioner, as well as our commissioner, is up to speed on your points that you just shared I appreciate that it's been something that's been raised at every borough board meeting since the program started. So I I'd like to say that I'm novel- and it's me but I- am one of numerous CB chairs screaming the same thing. Thank you and cora. If you'd like to, if people in general, if you're done speaking, put your hands down because I'm not seeing that happening but Cora please, on Newton hey, can you hear me? Yes? Thank you, oh good. Thank you. Hi. Everyone earlier duty mentioned the ridership. Your data is based on wide issue, I wonder if the data set actually identify who they are if they are actually tourists because along those locations, obviously they want more dogs, because that's the access to all those touristy places or if they are actually residents or if they identify themselves of new yorkers using CitiBikes, because Albany at Greenwich is an access to battery Pack city, prominent also to West, Street and other locations. So I can understand why the riders want more dogs in those proposed location, but again, like Pat Moore, said, and the other ones mentioned that we do need to care about the residents who live there and about the street locations in terms of the proposed into stations. I echo to pet Mars concerns about Albany and Greenwich station. The sidewalk is grating along the perimeter of the Albany plaza on the north side of Albany, and at Greenwich is an abandoned construction site right now of that high rise, then cedar is a one-way going west turning south at Greenwich and a lot of times once the car came comes through. It's kind of trying to hurry up to catch that red light at Albany and then along Greenwich, really is kind of a congested area all the way down to rector and do not forget fdm why the fire truck is over there and right now, they're using cedar. So it's actually, it seems like a quiet place, but actually in terms of pedestrian traffic and vehicle traffic is quite busy and also the bar over there. They actually are doing pretty good and all the outside seating is actually across to the Marriott Hotel right over there and then with fulton and Pearl I want to bring it up, fulton and pearl. That's where St Margaret's, House senior housing is, and the selfridge Tower seniors also a lot of times together with some parents that have the children play at the. What do you call that park, the children's playground over there right on the north side of Fulton and pearl and water? Actually, there were parents before they asked for a crosswalk, because if you notice actually for a long time, this fatigue truck and the truck making deliveries they've been double parking, even though the parking spots over there are commercial parkings, but there are also fedex trucks packing over their double park, so it's kind of dangerous for the children and the parents and the stroller trying to cross from the park back to the south side across Fulton Street, so I want to bring that up. Just want to be more mindful, then, in terms of screws and gold. On the east side, the southwest corner of New York presbyterian, lower Manhattan hospital is actually their loading and unloading dog so especially early in the morning they're quite busy over there, then on the east side of gold at Frankfurt, I think there's already a bike station over there as well. So I want to raise these concerns and then, when you discuss with the community board members again, I would suggest that you look at it more holistically from that perspective from the residence point of view. Thank you. Thank you. Patty, yes and Corey. Do look. We've have put down the portal for DOT to enter any concerns or complaints or about this infill. So everybody please pay attention to that too. It's a second item under chat, yep I found it yes and everyone. Thank you use that as well, and we help circulate that as well. Thank you thanks and Michael. Oh yeah I was just going to give you a quick time check. Betty we've been on this discussion for about a half hour. Okay, well, I want to get to Kerry because she's been waiting, hi, everybody. Thank you to D.O.T for the presentation. It was really helpful. I do not want to repeat some of the things that Tammy said, but it just strikes me that I have not really heard yet a comprehensive plan for CB1. There have been a lot of docs that have been added recently, but that was all done without a public engagement process or a holistic overview of what DOT intends to accomplish. I spent quite a bit of time going through the portal and the feedback for stations earlier this week in preparation for the meeting and I did not see anything in there. That suggested that we needed a whole lot of additional hardware in CB1. There were no comments that suggested that we needed additional hardware, so I do not understand, and I'd like to learn more, I'm not trying to just be you know. Debbie Downer just want to understand more why we would need 16,000 docks and only 8,000 bikes. Those numbers do not seem to fit quite with CB1 and then in terms of figuring out how many bikes and docks and hardware etc. You talked about rebalancing and I wonder whether or not there's a way or a method to be more efficient with our space in rebalancing bikes without adding hardware you know, can we have a more robust valet program? Can we have a bike angel program? What can we do to rebalance so that we're not taking pedestrian space with these 3d bridging proposals or space outside of restaurants, which you know is I, do not want to go too far into that? So is there a different way to do this rebalancing without adding hardware? So that would be another question for me and then finally, I would just like to suggest that the community board, as this is the beginning, I, think of public engagement. As far as I know, D.O.T has not made a comprehensive plan to CB1 presentations since the program launched in we had a lot of forums in 2012 and I was active in that it seems to me that we should have some community preferences. You know that we do not block restaurants, which Tammy mentioned that we that we prioritize pedestrian space over you know parking space for city agencies. Perhaps you know whatever those things are, but I think this community board, and this committee should have a clear set of preferences for how we'd, like D.O.T, to address their infill and expansion in our district, so that they can work with clear preferences and come back with some clear proposals that meet those preferences. I think and then there's one other piece that I have to mention and I know. This is about expansion and infill, but we really need to talk about relocation as well. There was a comment that one of the proposed locations is in a pops and that you know it would be temporary, but we know that nothing is temporary and every time we try to get a doc move because it's blocking a restaurant, for example. You know we have not. We have not had dots enthusiastic, oh, yes, we can move that. We designed these to be movable. We can do that so before we allow things to go in pops and take up precious sidewalk space like in front of 16 Hudson, which is another proposed 3d sidewalk, bridging over blue Stone, historic sidewalks, or expand the dock in front of the Hideaway and Duane Park Patisserie. Those docks can be moved. The Dwayne, Park Dock can be moved and anyway, I'm happy to work on that. I do not want to take up other people's time, but Brian, I'm a worker, I'm happy to walk this neighborhood with you, I'm happy to help you find locations that do not jeopardize small businesses and that you know sort of keep those community preferences in mind. With that. That's all I have thank you. Carrie and I want us. Marianne. Are your hands still up or I want to speak I'd like to speak just quickly on the pops that location was made very unwelcoming by the building not so long ago when they removed all the seating. So it is a big open, barren space and would be perfect, for you know, bicycles to be put there. My one other comment will be that Tammy reminded me that we used to have three stations in Battery Park City, but the one on West Ham's has been gone for a few weeks while they repaved they finished the paving five to seven days ago. They have not painted the lines and so on and I'm sure that's the reason why the station has not been returned to us. But if anybody Jennifer O'brien, if you know the right people and can get that painting done, then we can get our bikes back and we won't have to walk three or four blocks in other directions to even get to a bicycle. Thank you. Thank you. Marianne Michael is your hand still up for I. Just had one quick comment: what's going on, a few people had mentioned, the pops I just wanted to mention to Brian I, understand that this is temporary and that every you know open space is different, but in general we're very sensitive to impeding existing public spaces in our district, particularly because you know it is I mean it's like the rest of the city. You know we're all we're all looking for additional open space and space for pedestrians, so I just wanted to make that comment. If I could just ask a clarifying question to DOT, please do Jennifer. What's the what's the timeline, how much time does CUNY board? One have to you know: keep talking with your agency on this listening to the community and and ultimately submitting a resolution. Is this something that we only have time to do this month? How long is DOT in listening mode before the in-field plan is set in stone and then acted upon? Absolutely thanks! Lucian for the question as Brian had mentioned, this is an iterative rolling process and so, as you've all seen we're already working on expanding the existing CitiBike stations on that type of infill Brian. Could you share a little bit more about timeline on new stations? Not just here, but you know across the busiest parts of the system as well sure I mean we're rolling out two neighboring boards. We've done a few of these in and four and five we're talking to community board too I mean we're looking to get this first tranche kind of going before the winter. That said, I mean, of course we want to hear your comments and your concerns and incorporate those prior to install solution. If the board could get us comments, you know as soon as possible within the month. That's something we can certainly take into consideration. We've heard loud and clear. Some you know concerns about the Albany site or the Albany site, as well as the pops location. So that's the fact that we're going to take back and regroup as a team as well as you know, look to answer any other questions that the board may have after the presentation. You know I wonder if the two of you I apologize for interrupting out of turn, but I wonder if we could get the metrics that we've asked for and understand. You know I do not like really making decisions in vacuums and having anything that you know, you have the data you have all of the CB1 specific statistics. In order for us to make really informed decisions, we would need that so without having that today, I'm not really sure how this committee could actually vote on something to send to you this month to be ready for full board, because we do not have the statistics and some of the other information that we're asking for. As some of the people have mentioned, you know taking a look at the rebalance and all of the other things you've heard about the two specific sites, but we really want to see what the whole picture looks like it's sometimes death by a thousand cuts. If we do not have all the information yeah and that's something that will you know we'll start to work on tomorrow, I feel like the city as well as the community boards have been working night and day on. Not you know on all of the recovery programs, as well as our other street improvement projects, and that includes CitiBike, infill and expansion. As well so we'll be regrouping with the team tomorrow, thank you and I want. One person has been called on yet on your stock. If you'd like to unmute yourself, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yes, okay, sorry I had some trouble with the audio earlier. Thank you. Thanks for hosting this too I am a the Vp at vice president, at 16 Hudson street. So I speak on behalf of all the board members and the shareholders in the building. We have. We love CitiBikes, okay, great. We love it and I ride it. On CitiBike, too, however, we have the dock in front of our building and in front of restaurants there that actually are not open, also because of covered, but the problem is CitiBikes. You guys are saying that you're now going to put them onto the pavement and the sidewalk where we walk where older people come into our historic building. I do not understand why, with all the space out there, why you would put it on the sidewalk or the pavement. That's to ask ludicrous, because this is a historic building. There are bulkheads there, it's very dangerous to begin with and yet you're going to even move one part of the dock onto another area of the siding compartment and there's so much space out there. Why is that? Please answer me on that question: Sonia thanks! So much for sharing your feedback on that information. This is a you know, a 3d breeding, bridging location, but I think Brian. If you want to just expound a little bit more about that I just wanted to you know let Sonya and the committee know that we're taking a closer look at some of the concerns that we've heard. But if you want to talk a little bit more about the 3 G 3D bridging pilot that'd, be great. No I saw what you said about the 3D bridging pilot, but that still takes up the pavement of the sidewalk. So that's not helping us in any way. That's only making the sidewalk smaller for the pedestrians that come by it's in front of a historic building, and you know you do not go. You have to go around the bike to get the bike, so that takes up more space. It's not just you know your bridge and you're over you're, putting it onto a bulkhead sidewalk, where people pass by and I think that that's asking for trouble. We have to pay. Our building has to pay for the sidewalk. Are you going to compensate if somebody falls on that sidewalk because of the loading dock? So on the liability point, buildings are not liable for accidents caused by the CitiBike equipment. I will say that this look as we mentioned. This is a pilot location. This is like our innovative approach to like try to preserve street space. We heard other comments tonight that we parking is and street space as well as a precious asset. You know we felt that this location met the criteria for either a sidewalk station or a road bed station and wanted to perform this here and see how see how this went. Well, you could extend it all the way down to the bottom of the street or you could ex you could extend it across the street because there's commercial buildings there all the way along from 16 Hudson street, so I do not see the need to put a new loading dock further back up onto the pavement where there was one in front of it. So I see plenty of space out there, there's empty commercial spaces or extending the same dockage down to the end of the street between duane and reed, but not moving it onto the sidewalk or the pavement. That's all we're really asking so sorry about that. So that's what I do not understand. Yeah I, think if you could get back to us about why the sidewalk why the street is not suitable and part is being put on the sidewalk, the yeah, the sidewalk, exactly the sidewalk and the pavement. Not it's now on the street, the loading dock right and yeah, but we did not feel it at the street, but it's in it's already on the street. So why won't it remain on the street? Why would you extend it onto the pavement and sidewalk so as I mentioned? This is this is a pilot program and it's an innovative approach to trying to maintain parking. The street is certainly viable and it's that we were looking to maintain street space as well as extend the capacity of the bike share talk. Well, actually, thank you for clarifying that Brian, because that was what I was going to bring up since we were invited to please and I know, there's a time crunch to do this, develop some sort of report. I think we have to not only address the four new ones since we've been invited and I invite everyone here to take a look at dot's own website for giving feedback, but we need to set some priorities and what people want, because there is the push pull with. Are we saving parking? Are we saving sidewalk space for pedestrians and I? Think some of that has to be done actually within the community board, because D.O.T can only do their best with juggling it and it's a juggle for everybody, so I guess we need to kind of deal with that. So thanks for bringing up this case and Betty can I weigh in I, have my hand raised I just want to weigh in on this one second sure mitch and then we'll thank you. I agree with what you just said: Betty, but there's one extra thing about weighing things in Brian. Besides that you had four I think four bike stations that you had put up before it seems that there are two of the stations, particularly the one that this, the the person was just talking about on Hudson and then before what pat was saying on Albany, that a lot of people had some problems with. Why for a pilot pro, why not start with two? Why does it have to be four? It seems that would also be you want to do things incremental incrementally, so that would seem to be the most logical solution to start with the two that have the least resistance to see how that goes. Why does it have to be four? So the four that we just presented are outright new brand new stations right I know, but there are two that have a lot of opposition. So why can't we start with two sure we can take those comments back and circle up with the commissioner's office and evaluate a path forward with those. Thank you, I'm looking a lot of hands are back up again, so I'm going to ask Tammy I assume you want to speak again. Yes, I bring it down. No, it's me I, think I mean I'm a little concerned and I'm just putting it out there that we're rolling out expansion as we're recovering from a pandemic without looking at the metrics, without looking at the statistics, without comparing it back to how many people we know are not here in an effort to rush it in before it gets too cold for an install, I'm less worried about the weather on the install and happy to welcome whatever stations we can in the spring. When we've looked at this and we said wow yeah, these two stations are fantastic and g. Maybe you can move x station instead of this install here, or can you expand this station instead of an install here and having that kind of dialogue and with the open streets and everything else taken into consideration as a balance versus we have to answer you today by the end of the month, because the weather's getting cold? That is a concern and I'm just raising it. The committee needs to figure out what they want to do and whether or not they feel they have enough information to pass a resolution either in support or not well tammy eyes. Definitely, second, that, because resolution would really have to come with a report as to what are our priorities and how? What do we think of these four locations being proposed waiting to get some information we only meet once a month. The time frame would be very tight. Realistically, if that's the case Betty, then the question really is not D.O.T. Taking our comments back for consideration, but whether or not you end up having to figure out whether or not we do a resolution asking them to put a pause on installing any of those. Four stations and to work with us for a holistic review: well, I! Guess I'm going to get back to Jennifer and say: is that going to be necessary or is there going to be a pause? We are looking to move forward with our infill installations and our expansion as planned. So we're really looking for you know just like the feedback on some of the stations where we can take a closer look, and so we can continue to you know, discuss locations that are coming to the board today, as well as Brian mentioned. This rolling iterative process that will have to you know, have further dialogue with the board for other sites that we are considering into the future as well. Okay, so focus on these four to get done by the end of the month, but that really that's unfair. That's flat out you're! Not if you come to us in November and you brought statistics and you brought all the information we asked. We could certainly have a really good discussion on it, but you now have to go and get us the information that we asked for in order to make a decision. So how do we make a decision tonight to be able to give you a resolution by the end of the month and how does this qualify as public engagement? If you, if you're basically saying we'll, take we'll take what you've said back, but there's no opportunity for the board to do the business as the board functions, which is by resolution? That's not actually public engagement, that's basically listening to a dialogue, but not allowing us to do our business as we are bound as a community board. I understand Tammy, and this is something that you know ever since the system launched back in 2013. This was a mandate from the administration to move forward in launching and expanding the bike share system across. You know its service area and we're here to present our new our four new locations, and you know, take back the questions and further discuss if there's any particular site. That really, you know, needs to have a quote that have us take a closer look. You did not answer Tommy's question. No. That was a great political answer and you sound like a very nice person, but you did not answer Tammy's question. We are planning to move forward with our CitiBike expansion and infill installations, and so you know we've been presenting to other community boards. At least you know. The Manhattan office I can only speak for Manhattan boards with the bike share team to discuss our plans for infill, and this is just us kicking off. You know what we're looking to do in terms of station expansions and new stations dialogue really. Is it it's a nice con civil dialogue, but it's really pointless so then Betty I would I would propose to. If there's any resolution we have to do, I would vote against it based on the facts that we're just finding out right now on Tammy's concern. I will say this mitch and tammy that you know when we do our draft plan presentations to you know, community boards, where we're looking to expand the bike share network. We do make adjustments where we find feasible, and you know we're hearing loud and clear that there are some outstanding concerns on some of these new stations that we're proposing tonight. So you know these stations are not getting installed tomorrow or next week. You know we need to regroup and discuss as a team to see you know what makes the most sense and also you know, look to answer the questions that you brought to the DOT team here today, particularly about a more comprehensive like district kind of holistic. Look at you know, bike share expansion here, quite frankly, I have requests that I'm sure people are sending us I do know of one from school, I'm almost afraid to say anything, because T.O.T is not willing to actually have a back and forth dialogue. Based on your answer, which is frustrating for the community. This is not the same situation. We were in seven months ago, eight months ago or 12 months ago, so I'm very disconcerted by that answer that basically we're rolling out and enjoy it. We know how long it takes to move a CitiBike station. There is a misplaced one. That's the best description I can give you in battery park city I, think it took four years to get it moved to the original location that the Community board suggested. That was then all of a sudden. Yes, this is a much better place. Much better. You know it could be expanded. It's so much better, so I have concerns by this whole new, I'm so sorry, but this mayor is leaving in 13 months and we need to fill phil as much as possible for what purpose without community engagement, I'm not sure, stand, and because we've been on this topic for a long time. Sonia is your hand back up again or no my hand is down. I just want to add, though our building first learned about this with a note to the management company saying they were going to install and they did not ask us anything about it until we received the letter, basically saying we're going to install this, and thank you very much so yes, there was no dialogue done and I agree with Tammy. It's very disappointing that nobody really wants to hear our voice and yet they're going ahead with the installations anyway. So you know thank you. Thank you. I have not even seen anybody actually come to the dockage, that is on 16 Hudson street, and take a look at the pavement there. The sidewalk there, whatever you may call it where pedestrians walk I, have not seen anybody there. Has anybody been out there from CitiBikes I know I've had no discussion. None of our board members have had any discussion with anyone from CitiBikes Jennifer, I'm not quite sure, I'm understanding the question. Are you speaking about a building notification, yeah speaking about a building notification? What that was mailed to our management company? That was then given to the board members saying that this is the first we knew about it. We were simply going to install a new bike, the bridge bike, whatever that may be onto the pavement onto the sidewalk, where we already have the street right so and so the current process, for you know you know, notifying adjacent properties about a CitiBike expansion. Is you know we sent a letter to Community Board one and then, like you mentioned, someone had reached out or sent a letter to building management to. Let them know that existing station outside of their property will be increasing in dock capacity, and so that was the notification, and you know I also heard your comments earlier about. You know pedestrian clearance on the sidewalk here and, as Brian had mentioned, we're you know just going to take a closer look to see if any adjustments can be made. But this is a you know: temporary 3D, bridging pilot and we'll you know, get back to the board with further updates on this location. Okay, thank you. Thank you and carrie. Unless, because we've been on this for almost an hour and a half is your hand up again, are you yes, my hand is up again and I promise it'll be short. So what Sonia's talking about at 16 Hudson was also the case for Dwayne Park Patisserie. There are several and other infill projects, so let's be clear. The four things that Brian presented on are about expansion, but what Sonia is talking about is infill well, I, guess it's both, but there's been a lot of infill. That's happened in Tribeca over the last six months without any data supporting the need for further infill or expansion in Tribeca. Downtown alliance had a different thing, but in Tribeca there's been no data supporting infill or expansion that has been shared. So the fata complete aspect of what's happened at 16 Hudson and what happened on Dwayne Street is why the community is very upset with the lack of representation from or public engagement as Tammy phrased. It there's been no public engagement. There's just been the you know. The feta complete the pushing down the pushing in residential and business faces some expansion plan that we have no data to support. So that's it I promise I won't put my hand up again. Buddy, that's fine, no and I do want to change thank Jennifer and the team for coming to tammy. What I was going to say is I. Do not think it's a point to go after resolution tonight. I do think we should go after one gathering information two, so we can have some kind of report or feedback by the end of the month, which will be somewhat limited. But there is the portal that we'll try to encourage people to please put information into. Thank you for looking into the ones you heard about tonight to give them a second look and tammy I'll. Look at putting together some kind of resolution about the process, since that seems to be what people are mostly concerned about. But I'd also like to look at the four sites two to see. So we can put something together and that can't be done tonight. No, and if they can send the data, we can certainly discuss it at executive for you betty. No. That would be fine, because that will work within their time frame and yeah every time to look at everything. So if we can get if we can get, the information can certainly tell the lucian and we can work on the timing, the best that we can with whatever we're given great. Thank you. So here's the portal- and please use it thanks. Everyone and we'll move on to the next topic, but they have some time cause. I know this awaited to Edgar, Street, Trinity, School, update and Malia I know she's loosely ready to unmute her or, if she's, a colon, hey everyone. Thank you. Can you hear me? Yes, be a little bit louder. Okay, can you hear me nothing you're hushed, but I can hear you. Okay, bear with me. One second I was just logged out of my remote desktop. So let me get back in sure. That's fine, and will you have some slides to present? Yes, I will so I believe they're going to give me the screen share capability, yeah lucian, if you want to take over my my superpowers and give it to go to molly, that'd be great and it's trish here I do not see her. Can everyone see my screen? Yes, okay, I'm going to go ahead and begin if that's all right sure, okay, so hi everyone. My name is Malia I work with the grt traffic engineering and planning group, I'm here with Grey Coss and we will be presenting the Edgar Street School study findings. Let me start off by giving you some background information about the area and then we'll go into detail about the analysis and findings. So our mission DOT provides for the safe, efficient and environmentally responsible movement of people and goods in the city of New York and maintains and enhances the transportation infrastructure crucial to the economic, vitality and quality of life of our primary customers. You all city residents. So this is the outline for the presentation. First, we'll go through the background, Refresh everyone's memory, because it's been a while since we last met, then we'll go into the details of the study we undertook here at got and we'll share with you all our analysis, assumptions and results and then we'll wrap up with the conclusions. So to start, the area that we're looking at is near the Elizabeth Berger Plaza bounded by Rector Street in the North Moore Street in the south, there's an exit ramp from the Hugh Carey Tunnel that diverges into Greenwich, Street Northbound and previously a slip ramp to Trinity Plaza northbound. A previous study was conducted to assess the operational feasibility of closing the slip in order to combine the two plazas and, as a result of that study, it was determined that the slip would be closed to create a unified, plaza buses. Currently using the slip ramp to access trinity, place, northbound would be rerouted to northbound, Greenwich Street and then turn right onto Edgar Street. Additionally, the as part of that study, the northwest corner of the plaza, was redesigned to accommodate the larger training radii of the buses and groundbreaking for that project occurred in August of 2019 and construction is currently underway. Funding for the project was provided by Council member Margaret Chin, so that brings us to that was a previous project, and that brings us to our current study, which involves the analysis of potential pedestrian improvements along Edgar Street and at adjacent intersections. There will be a new mixed-use development located at 42 trinity place, which will include a school. So the primary objective is to evaluate potential safety improvements in this area and again the study objective, Enhanced, Pedestrian safety for a new mixed-use development along the north side of Edgar Street at 42 trinity place. The development is anticipated to consist of a 40-story mixed-use building, including school retail and residential uses, and our study scope is to present and evaluate alternatives that would improve safety for pedestrians within the vicinity of the proposed project, while maintaining thoroughfare to trinity place and vehicular access to the parking garage at Edgar, Street and Greenwich Street. So we developed five alternatives for analysis, with the general focus being to improve safety for pedestrians, minimize impacts to bus operations and maintain access to the garage on Edgar Street, and here are the five alternatives. Alternative one is essentially our no action alternative, which means keeping everything as is Edgar Street operates as two-way and the stop sign at Greenwich and Edgar remains alternatives. 2 through 5, look at combinations of closing, either Edgar, Street, Westbound or eastbound, or both and putting a signal at Greenwich and Edgar. So, let's take a closer look at each alternative individually alternative one maintain existing conditions, so, like I said this is this alternative? Is the no action condition and it basically provides the basis for comparison. Edgar Street will remain two-way and the intersection of Greenwich and Edgar Street would remain. Stop controlled alternative to this signalized Edgar Street and Greenwich Street. So this alternative proposes a new signal at Greenwich and Edgar streets to facilitate vehicle progression onto trinity place northbound from the hct exit ramp. The downstream signal at Edgar, Street and trinity place would be maintained as a three-phase signal. However, the phasing would be adjusted to provide exclusive to provide an exclusive pedestrian phase. So basically, what that means is current previously, when the slip ramp was open. The signal at Trinity and Edgar had three phases: a phase that allowed vehicles at trinity to progress forward with the green and then a phase, four vehicles at the slip ramp and then a third phase for vehicles at Edgar Street. Now, with the closure of the slip ramp that one of the phases that second phase that was going to the flip ramp vehicles would be an exclusive pedestrian phase. That fashions could cross the two signals. The one at Edgar and Trinity and Greenwich would be coordinated so that there would be progression between the northbound right turn from Greenwich Street to Edgar Street and the eastbound left turn from Edgar Street to trinity place, providing clearance time so that vehicles do not get trapped on Edgar Street. So, as you can see, at Greer Street is a an extremely short block. So the goal would be to have the signal at Greenwich and Edgar turn red and then a few seconds later. The signal at Trinity and Edgar to turn red so allowing those vehicles that are on this short block to clear out so that we do not have any locked intersections. One element of this alternative and also alternatives. Three and four- is to provide a new north crosswalk at the intersection of trinity place and Edgar street, which is not shown. This crosswalk would serve the desires of the future development, but it does have some feasibility issues. The sidewalk on the east side of trinity is completely covered by celebrate grates and the crosswalk would lead into the driveway for one exchange plaza, so it may not be feasible to install a receiving ramp. Our traffic analysis conservatively assumes that the North crosswalk is provided and thus the need for the exclusive pedestrian phase. However, if the North crosswalk is not provided, the signal can operate as two phase and the exclusive pedestrian phase can be re-allocated to traffic movements. Okay, so that brings us to alternative three, which is to close Edgar Street Westbound and maintain stop control at Edgar, Street and Granite. Street alternative three proposes to permanently close Edgar Street westbound, to provide additional space on the north side of the street for anticipated growth in pedestrian activity, and especially children in the area because of the new school with Edgar Street Westbound closed to vehicular traffic. It's anticipated that traffic headed north on trinity place that currently turns left at Edgar Street to access. The parking garage would instead continue straight on trinity turn left at cedar and then left on Greenwich essentially going around the block. But this conservatively assumes this is the only route taken to enter the garage, but there are other entrances to the brush on Washington Street, as well as Moore Street. So this concept improves safety by eliminating a lane on Edgar Street and converting it to Pedestrian. Space, Greenwich and Edgar remains stop controlled. So, in the absence of a signal, vehicular cues may extend beyond the limited storage space provided by Edgar Street eastbound. Remember because it's such a short block and it and could potentially spill back onto the exit ramp. Finally, we have alternative four, which is to close Edgar Street Westbound and implement signalization at Edgar, Street and Greenwich Street, similar to alternative three alternative four proposes to permanently close Edgar Street westbound to provide additional space on the north side of the street professions. Unlike alternative three alternative four proposes to signalize the intersection of Edgar and Greenwich streets, and this is good. Like we previously explained. The downstream signal at Edgar, Street and trinity place could be maintained as a three-phase signal providing an exclusive pedestrian phase, and the two signals would be coordinated like we previously discussed, so that there would be no vehicles getting trapped on Edgar street. Between the two signals there would be significant traffic turning right from the hct exit onto Edgar, Street eastbound during the midday and pm peak hours in the morning due to the ramp closure, the majority of vehicles traveling along Edgar, Street Eastbound, would originate from the north traveling along Greenwich and turning either right into the parking garage or left onto Edgar Street Eastbound, and while there will be an increase in traffic along Edgar Street eastbound during the midday npm peak hours. This alternative provides additional pedestrian space near the school along the north side of Edgar Street and maintains access to the parking garage and to trinity place northbound from the hct exit. A fifth alternative to permanently close Edgar street in both directions was considered. However, after further examination and discussion with the community board, this option was removed as a viable alternative due to restricted access for vehicles and buses in terms of bus operations with the permanent closure of Edgar street. In both directions, buses would be forced to continue north onto Greenwich Street and execute a right turn onto Rector Street Eastbound, and this maneuver is not feasible without redesigning the intersection to accommodate the bus's larger turning radii and closing the slip all to the flip ramp. All together would eliminate bus traffic in this area, actually not I, said I said slip around, but I meant closing the the ramp. All together would eliminate bus traffic in this area. However, MTA strongly opposes the permanent closure of the HCC exit ramp because of the high demand for this route and also another reason eliminating Edgar street as a link in the roadway network, converts Greenwich into a dead end with no outlet vehicles, traveling along Greenwich Street in the southbound direction would be forced to turn right into the parking garage, whether they intended to or not. So after determining our for analysis scenarios which we, which were just described, we developed traffic analysis models. Synchro software was used to create models of existing and future conditions and to test various improvement alternatives to develop these models. We first collected data to determine existing conditions and based on data collected by Us Nycdot and data provided by two other traffic studies conducted in our study area. The following peak hours were identified for analysis. The weekday Am Peak hour of 8:30 to 9:30 am midday peak hour of 11:30 to 12:30 P.M and the Weekday Pm Peak hour of 5:15 to 6:15 pm. So the following scenarios were evaluated, the 2019 existing conditions, which are not is not really pictured here and then the 2021 of future conditions. Without improvements, which is alternative, one and the 2021 future conditions with improvements which is shown here as alternative two three and four, so the 2019 existing traffic models were calibrated to reflect field observations and in 2019 Greenwich Street operated as one-way southbound due to construction and the hct slip. Ramp was fully operational, however, since then construction of the Elizabeth H Berger Plaza has begun and the hct slip ramp is now permanently closed. The Hct exit ramp and you can see here the closure. The Hdt exit rounds, which is closed, 6 to 10, am, is not accessible during the Am Peak hour and therefore experienced no volume. The mid day and pm peak hours experienced 146 and 116 vehicles respectively. Most of the traffic in the network originates from battery place and travels northbound along trinity place. Existing signal, timings used in the syncro model were obtained from our signals. Database existing traffic and pedestrian volumes were provided by two traffic studies, as previously mentioned as well as collected in-house hold on. Let me take a sip of water. Real quick and accounts done in house include vehicle turning movement counts at five intersections and pedestrian council. Two intersections curbside parking activity, bus, stop activity was included in the model where applicable and existing peak hour. Factors and heavy vehicle percentages were determined for each peak hour. Using the traffic count, data future conditions were modeled for Am, Midday and pm peak hours. Existing 2019 traffic volumes were grown using background growth rates and supplemented with traffic generated by background projects. Nearby signal, timings and Geometry were changed to reflect future conditions. Granite Street was converted back to two-way between edgar and rector streets. The Hdt slip Ramp was demapped and signal signalization at trinity place and Edgar Street was converted to three-phase signal with an exclusive pedestrian phase. The future condition with improvements were compared to the future condition without improvements and any significant impact to individual traffic movements were identified according to criteria outlined in the 2014 Speaker Technical Manual, and for those of you that are not familiar with the secret Technical manual guidelines. An acceptable level of service, otherwise known as Los, is defined as operating at a Mid Los d or better, which is 45 seconds of delay or less for signalized intersections and 30 seconds or less for unsignalized intersections. So, basically, what that means is intersections, get graded a through f and much like the conventional letter. Grading systems, a is a good grade and F is a not so good grade and the grade is based on how long cars are waiting at an intersection, and we measure that waiting time in terms of seconds of delay. So the results of the capacity analysis indicate that the following lane groups operated at unacceptable levels of service, and that is at trinity place and Erector Street Eastbound Approach, which operates at a Los F, with delays of 112 seconds and 107 seconds during the weekday Am and midday peak hours respectively and during the Weekday Pm Peak Hour. The eastbound approach operates at Los E, with a delay of 65 seconds, also Greenwich Street and Rector Street in the eastbound approach with operates at osf with 95 seconds of delay during the midday peak hour, and also the 95th percentile Q length at Edgar. Street and trinity place extend for 119 feet and 82 feet along the edger street in the eastbound direction during the midday and the pm peak hours respectively, exceeding the block length, which is about 60 feet and what that means is 95 percent of the time. During our peak hours, you're seeing q lengths that extend as such and keep in mind. This is alternative one. So this is essentially our future condition, as is with without improvements, no action and now, let's go into the results for alternative 3 and alternative for alternative 2 and alternative 3. So for alternative two, which is to signalize Edgar Street and Greenwich Street Edgar, Street and Greenwich. Street Northbound and Southbound approaches deteriorate to losd, with delays of 51 seconds and 47 seconds, respectively, during the weekday Mid-day peak hour and for alternative 3, which is to close Edgar Street Westbound and maintain a stop control at Edgar, Street and Greenwich Street. We saw that trinity place and Rupture Street Eastbound approach deteriorated to an Ls e, with a delay of 70 seconds during the Weekday Pm Peak hour and 95th percentile queue length at Edgar, Street and trinity, place extended for 119 feet and 82 feet along Edgar Street during the midday npm peak hours. Okay and now, let's look at our last alternative. Four and remember this alternative was to close Edgar Street Westbound and implement signalization at Edgar, Street and Greenwich Street. So the results of the capacity analysis indicated that at Edgar Street and Greenwich Street Southbound Approach deteriorated to losd, with delays of 50 seconds and 51 seconds during the Am and midday peak hours. During the midday peak hour, the northbound approach deteriorated to the level of service d, with let's go back with a delay of 51.4 seconds, so under the with action condition, it might be helpful for me to go back to remind you guys, under the with action condition, which is our future condition with improvements. Alternatives to three and four. The loss at the four intersections would remain fairly similar to that of the no action which is alternative one, otherwise, the future condition without improvements, without doing anything during the am and midday peak hours, approaches at Edgar and Greenwich deteriorate from an Los, a an alternative one, which is our remember, our no action to an Los D in alternatives to N4 due to signalization. However, signalization at these intersections, improve upstream coordination and prevent spill back at Edgar Street headed in the eastbound direction and adds an extra layer of protection for pedestrians and, furthermore, the 95th percentile of Hue lengths associated with the Upstream signal decrease when implementing a signal at Edgar and Greenwich Street such that the cars as you saw, would not extend through to the next intersection. So, let's go back. Are you all seeing the safety page? Yes, okay, so crash data for Greenwich Street from the Hct exit director, Street trinity, place from Edgar director Edgar Street from granite to trinity and Rector Street from Greenwich to rector from Greenwich to Washington were obtained for the three years, including 2015, 2016 and 2017, and this table summarizes the total number of reportable and non-reportable pedestrian involved, bicyclists involved and vehicle-only crashes, and based on this information, there were no high crash locations identified and a high crash location is one where there were 48 or more total crashes, reportable and non-reportable, or five or more pedestrian or bicycle injury crashes. In any consecutive 12 months of the most recent three year period, for which the data is available, so overall alternative for proposing to close Edgar, Street Westbound and implement signalization at Edgar, Street and Granite Street was concluded to be the best alternative when considering both traffic operations and pedestrian safety. The existing stop control at Edgar, Street and granted street results in 95th percentile queue lengths exceeding the available storage capacity at Edgar, Street eastbound. The implementation of a signal at this intersection will ensure that vehicles do not get trapped at the eastbound left turn at Edgar, Street and, furthermore, signalization at this intersection improves safety by providing designated crossing time to pedestrians and regulating vehicular movement. Permanent closure of Edgar Street Westbound provides additional pedestrian space while maintaining eastbound access to the trinity place and I. That is all we have and thank you thank you Malia for the presentation and I'm glad to see that your conclusion ended up being what our resolution covered in December of 2019. When we asked yeah where we asked to have the westbound lanes closed and also to have signalization on Greenwich. The other concerns were because it the concerns in the school and this meets them, are one the walkway to the park was of concern. We also the gathering space room, which this would create by closing the Westbound Edgar Street and also concerned about access to where the school bus stops were, which, of course not knowing where the school bus stops are going to be. I'm going to assume across front at trinity that the children will be safe enough to get across the street to and from the school bus from the school, so those have to be factored in, and I'd like to get some kind of response about we hearing about traffic, but in terms of pedestrians, do we need some kind of signalization, or is it going to be just fine to cross trinity from the school to probably where the bus stops are going to be ready? They have to pull a bus, stop up to the curb at the school. They won't cross the kids because it's planned to be a k to five, so they won't. You know you understand what I mean yeah, what street they have to use then, because of directions, so they'd have to come on pick them up at Edgar or pick them up on Greenwich. Well. This is greg, unfortunately, whether it's on trinity place or if the bus goes Southbound on Greenwich or if it goes eastbound on Edgar, no matter where it is because of the way the one ways are, the kids are going to have to cross the street, it's impossible to drop them off on the correct size unless they're coming in from Brooklyn yeah. Do you have any answers to how that can be handled with some safety involved, because I was looking at the one ways and coming to that same conclusion, like what do we do? You muted greg you muted, did you go back to alternative four sure? Okay, and can you okay now, and can you with your cursor? Can you show the questionable north side crosswalk that we I'm not sure that we can okay now it would we want to provide a crosswalk there. We want to do it and, as Malie explained, it'll mess up traffic a little bit more, but for the pedestrian safety. We're willing to deal with that. Unfortunately, on the east side of trinity place, there's vaults, there's a driveway and it's looking to be infeasible to put a crosswalk there. We want to do it, but it might not be feasible to put the foundation that's needed for the signal poles for the Pedestrian signal Pulse. So again, it would be great if we could put a crosswalk there, but it may be infeasible. Okay, now can you can you put your cursor on the proposed crosswalk, the North crosswalk on Greenwich, so that one we are proposing? So if the buses come down Greenwich, let the kids off on the wrong side, which is the West side at least they have a crosswalk. They have they'll, have a signalized crosswalk there. But if you, if you look at the circulation, there's just no way to drop for the bus to drop the kids off on the correct side unless it's coming from Brooklyn correct, so, okay, you're suggesting alternative four is the best one and then at least with the signalization for crossing correct. That's too much you can do given the one-way directions that exist right. Let me see what Betty I'm sorry. Yes, I have to jump in here because again this is my neighborhood I. Do not understand. First of all, we're talking I heard something earlier, because I my head is reeling from this presentation. I heard something earlier about. Turning from trinity left onto Cedar street, that number one is no, then I hear about buses coming down Greenwich Street to the school where the bus is coming from down. Granite Street. The only way to go down, Granite Street is to either go up trinity and again turn left onto cedar and then turn left onto Greenwich or to come from the highway and turn onto rector and then turn right onto Greenwich. So I I'm. You know this is a very tiny little area and we are. We have a lot of congestion with traffic, so I'm thoroughly abused. Let's go back to this. Turning on to Cedar Street Cedar Street I live on, we did not say anything about cedar street I heard I. Think Alt Alternative three was something about turning onto Cedar Street from trinity director. Well, I did I mean theater turn left onto rector, and that was yes for because of the closure. Edgar Street Westbound being closed, assuming that those vehicles making that turn were looking to get into the parking garage right. That was the re-routed option to go up and then turn on theater, then back down on Greenwich and then back into the garage exactly and Theater Street. No. First of all, we have the 1010 firehouse, already uses Cedar street to go in the wrong direction to access trinity. Cedar Street is a one Lane street and those of us who live on Cedar street or the bar across the street. We have deliveries. We have to stop in front of our house. We can't have more cars coming down cedar street. That's number one again back to the buses coming down Greenwich street, how the bus is going to access Greenwich Street, where are they coming from I? Do not know this. The school is already a done deal and I do not know how the buses are going to get there. Yeah I know exactly how if they're coming from the south, they could use better. If they, if they're coming from the south, they could use battery place and come up trinity place, that's probably the way they'll do it, but then there would be no crosswalk exactly and if you call close the west, if you close Edgar Street going west, they can not turn left onto Edgar and then right on to Greenwich so I, I'm not understanding how you can close edgar going west at all. If we close that, if that that's your point is well taken, if we leave Westbound Edgar Street Open, then it would be possible for the school buses to drop kids off on the correct side. Exactly so that so the downside, the downside of closing edgar is just what you're bringing up right now. That's true and the other downside is vehicles that enter the parking garage. The battery place parking garage yeah they have to use, they have to use cedar instead of westbound. So that's the downside. The upside is we're providing more space pedestrian space, not only for the kids, but for everybody. The downside is just what we're talking about so there you have the trade-offs and, as a person, who's lived there 44 years through everything through hell and high water. That is a big downside for all of us who live on cedar and on Greenwich from cedar to rector and all the businesses that have to have deliveries and everything else. It's a tiny street. We all since 9:11. We have construction, we have congestion, they're, not talking about a bike. Rack I mean you know how small it is. Yes, we do so and that's definitely true. That's a that's the that's what we have to decide which do we want do we want to provide more pedestrian space and then yes, we do mess up cedar street a little bit. No a lot, and we and like you said it would make it tougher to for the school buses to drop off and pick up kids exactly so there you have it. That's we're open to either way. We understand, there's downsides either way, yeah! No we're going to need to talk to that in-house, because again, Trisha was very insistent on this because of having to place like 600 family members for school and needed more sidewalk space, it's just nowhere around the school. It probably was not a great choice of location right exactly because those of us who live in that little tiny area called Granite South. We need to have access and sidewalk space. So no, it's not a great and again, we can discuss that, but the issue was even if the parks Department would let it let the school use, Elizabeth Berger for the children to gather there rather than on the way the westbound lanes are the reality. Is they then have to cross the wider road? Because now the both directions be open, which youth and education also did not want as an option they can't cross by themselves their parents have to be with them. That's why I'm saying it's a problem anyway? You look. This is kind of an unsolvable problem. What decisions are going to be made we're open to either way? We understand the pros and cons we're open to either way right. No I was just saying this is more of a community board decision than it is DOT at this point, so I appreciate the option and Tammy. Would you like to I may have missed that part or I? Think I'm confused at this point? Was there an option where you have the sidewalk extension and Edgar went eastbound only talking about it because he's bound only yes Tammy if Edgar Street is eastbound only yeah. The good thing about that is it's added pedestrian space. The downside is, there's two downsides number one vehicles that want to get into the battery that parking garage on battery place. Instead of turning left on Edgar, you got to go up to cedar and overload Cedar street. That's one downside, I'm sorry I misspoke the map, that's up in front of me. His face is eastbound. Is there a reason that Edgar can't be westbound with the sidewalk extension right? But if it was westbound only then bust, the and then buses that come in from the battery tunnel they would not be able to get to they'd, have to go up Greenwich, Street and turn right onto rector. They can't handle that term. I'm sorry I thought that the I thought that the access lane from the Brooklyn battery tunnel was going to be closed, am I wrong. The slip that the exit is open. It's just that the slip Lane in the diagram we're looking at here, there's a slip. Lane Malia. Can you put your cursor where the slip lane used to be there used to be a lane that which is in the middle of the park? Right now that's closed. The exit itself is not closed, so there are cars exiting from the battery pack as we speak, yes, and so, instead of taking that slip Lane in the middle of the park, they go up. Greenwich turn right on that you're left on trinity. That's why we can't that's why we can not close eastbound Edgar Truman did not the MTA also said they would not break not negotiable greg. You said that that's not possible because the buses can't take the right turn on rector right. Well, first of all, going up narrow, Greenwich street would be a small problem and turning right on record, yet rector yeah. That would be a small problem and also just regular traffic, all going up Granite street and turning right on rector. That would be a problem and especially a side highway onto rector. So you have all of these track. You know all of these cars converging at rector and rector is already a problem yeah. But is this a problem simply because the trade center campus is locked so tight if cars could continue up Greenwich and take a right on liberty, for example? Right then we'd have no issues like we used to be able to right. We used to be able to personally exactly and there's actually no reason that we can think of from a community basis. That needs to be continually locked right exactly. Why is liberty closed? Yes, but the transit authority? They have buses that come up, and it's going to the bus that the we asked the transit authority to look at that and they, when their buses come in just before the pm rush hour, and they looked at it hard and they said it would really mess up their operations when the buses they come in mostly empty to satisfy the pm rush for them to go up greenwich and turn on any other street. Besides Edgar would be a problem. Can you explain why? Because they're turning on Edgar to get to trinity? That's the only reason why they're turning so we're putting them on trinity three blocks up. What's the three block difference, quite frankly, I'm a little confused. No I'm confused the turning radius for one on Liberty street. It's here. Turning returning from right now, when they turn from Greenwich on to edgar, we had to make that radius bigger so that the buses could turn they're going to have a hard time. Turning from Greenwich onto either rector or liberty, exactly liberty. Is it a huge street right, it's bigger than edgar it's twice as big as Edgar. It used to be four lanes and also those buses they their pickups are on lower trinity place anyway, so they need to be on trinity place near Edgar. You know close further down. No I'm sorry! Everybody hold on a second greg. Are you talking about cars having to go up trinity and buses and buses and buses and buses, and have to turn onto Cedar street and then turn left onto cedar and then left onto Greenwich? So what we're saying now is that liberty should be opened and buses can go up. One block above Cedar street and turn left on liberty and then left on Greenwich, which I hate everybody being on Greenwich, but at least they would not be coming down cedar wait a minute. Why would they be coming down? Wait a minute we're talking about we're talking about closing eastbound Edgar Street. Is that what we're talking about and making them go up? Greenwich I thought we were talking. Okay, Tammy I do not know. Maybe you interjected something, because if what we're saying is it's okay? Well, there are disadvantages to closing westbound edgar, but closing eastbound Edgar is kind of out of the question. Well, I was actually talking about a one lane only on Edgar eastbound. So if cars are looking to get to the garage, they go up trinity, they take a left on Edgar. They go into the garage. The exit for the garage can be over on West Street, but that's what they exit and go up greenwich because they're smaller vehicles. It's not that big of a deal, but your you know the thought was. If that was possible, then the bus, when it drops for the school comes up. Trinity, takes a left on edgar and can drop off on the sidewalk. Yes, that's if we leave Westbound Edgar Street open correct, just like if we close, but if we close eastbound Edgar Street, then the MTA buses they would. They would not be able to turn right onto Edgar. They'd have to go all the way up to either rector or liberty and that's the problem for MTA buses. Okay, so the MTA bus is the only problem, so truthfully the empty. The MTA buses is the problem with closing westbound edgar. Excuse me it's closing eastbound, but you mean the MTA buses that are exiting out of the Brooklyn battery tunnel. Correct yes right- and this was this was done. We knew this when making the decision about the December resolution. In my opinion, you can't close edgar either direction, eastbound or westbound. Betty can I say something: oh yes, if Tammy's done. Oh sure, of course, I'm happy to be done. Okay, then mitch I just wanted to say, like I'm, going to defer to more to Tommy and pat for the people that live down there. The only thing as somebody that lives farther up in Tribeca and greg the only thing that should be non-negotiable. It should start from the safety of the children that the bus has to drop them off in front of on the right side of the street, and every other decision has to be made around that and if MTA or anything else is inconvenience, so be it because in over the next few years, God forbid a parent with a child. You know just tries to run across the street, even if it's their fault, because they're late for school, even if there's a light or something and somebody gets killed, then it'll be changed, but it should start from the proposition that it's non-negotiable, that the bus drops in front of the school, so the kids do not have to cross the street for an elementary school, and everything else should follow after that. That's just my humble opinion. Okay, so if we go by that dictum, all I was going to say is: if we go by that dictum, yes Sir, then Westbound Edgar street must be open. Okay, well, like I, said the other choices I'm going to leave to the people that are from like immediately from that area. I just feel as well, not my children are grown now, but as a parent that had children in public school that to have to have the children cross the street like it should start from that's the only thing that should not be yes I, we understand. So the only way for that to be possible is for westbound edgar to be open to traffic. How does tammy and vape pat feel about that and the only and what I'm saying about eastbound Edgar is that closing eastbound edgar that the MTA won't stand for that? Well, you know something. My concern is for the safety of the kids going to school before the MTA and that's why I said that one thing should be non-negotiable. Let the MTA go another couple of blocks, but you know you can't put we're a reactive society. We need to be proactive now and there's going to be a death in the next five years. If that happens, they're not mutually exclusive, we can keep both of them happy. We can do what you just said, which is which is making sure kids are dropped off on the correct side and we could also not disrupt MTA operations, but to do that Edgar street would have to remain open in both directions. The problem with that is, you lose the sidewalk space that the school needs to be able to do arrival. Dismissal, fire, drills, emergency exits without closing half of edgar. You lose all of that, because there is not enough sidewalk space on Greenwich or trinity to facilitate that. So are you saying it's going to be it'll be dangerous, either way like if we do one or the other. If you do not close half of Edgar Street, yes, and what that is saying is when you close it, you have to make one decision or the other without inconveniencing MTA yeah, I'm just like I'm going to teach you one minute, keep in mind youth and education with Trisha liked this plan. They were aware of the directions they were aware of, well that they wanted this space for gathering. Okay, I'm just thinking about the safety of you know the kids getting off the bus, that's all because they were two, as was the school construction Authority. Okay, I'm sorry, but as I have been saying from day, one and I said this to Trisha. Also. You also have to think about the people who live in this very tight little area of our community granite South is a very tight little area. We have very little vehicle access. We have very little sidewalk. We have very little of everything: we're not financial district, we're not battery park city and you can not close Edgar street in either direction. I'm sorry it says it does not work talk to talk to the port authority, get Liberty street reopened. That would help I agree with Pat liberty. I think that the only real great answer greg, unfortunately, is to put some pressure with the MTA in port authority to open liberty, exactly: okay, hey Betty I have a quick question for D.O.T in this scenario, where you do have one side of Edgar Street closed to create additional sidewalk space. That would I mean there's a temporary treatment to do that. But I assume that you know you would have a timeline, for you know, changing the storm drains and extending the curve and doing all the things you have to do to make it. Yes, if we did, if we did that we'd, do it first in temporary materials and then as a capital project. We you know we if it worked and everybody was happy. If we made it, then the next step would be making it permanent. That would be a capital project that would be a big deal, but yes, that would be next. Yes, so I guess you know just kind of keeping my eye on different projects that are happening. I, believe the trinity place, reconstruction for DDC will go down to more to Mars. Street I believe that that's the scope and I know that they'll be doing you know water infrastructure steam. You know all the all kind of all the things underneath the trinity, and so my my request to you all is try your best to. If you know when you do put your capital plans together, if this is the if it ends up being a sidewalk extension just to prevent having DDC rebuild the sidewalk one time, and then you all build it again. Okay, that's all okay and greg I just want to say just so. You know just to be on record, because I am somebody who has a lot of concern. This example of the work that goes T has done with the community was probably some of the finest examples of public engagement and working with us in terms of a dialogue that I've seen. So let me first say that before everything else, I apologize for not saying it off the top I really appreciate this. Okay, thank you, Betty I might end up. Can I go please? Yes, no! You you're next I just want a second thanks greg. Thank you, I. I'm opposed to anything being permanently closed. It's all great and maybe come up with creative designs to make things safer, but the argument of that things have to be safe by permanently closing streets short. Technically, that's the case. If you just have no cars there, then it's obviously it's safer, but that's not the reality of life and how the city works and operates so I am and have been opposed to the permanent closure and their need, and then the people that live down there, like pat, was saying they have very little access, some maneuverability in in the neighborhood and for having other street closed, you know as an issue. I think plan two had some good ideas with it: a temporary closure during certain hours, this kind of thing, but what just you know using cones orange cones and things like this, not a complete restructure of the street so some day down the road they can permanently close it. So that I think the takeaway from here is: if I'm understanding it right and pat you can. If I'm correct me, if I'm wrong, is that I think most people do not want a permanent closure to the street and to work our way up from there. Thank you thanks and anyone else with a question or comment, because I'm not seeing any odetta, please speak. Yes, I can hear you now so just so I can understand. You said Betty in the beginning that the committee already voted to ask the center to that they wanted to close down a figure and wanted to signalize the interception. So this was already a committee resolution in favor of this and then the DOT landed on option four, as the destruction which coincides with what committee you already supported correct. That's why Tammy was congratulating them with for listening to the community and acting on it. Thank you, yeah sure this is an agreement. Tim is your hand still up or just not down yet well. I. Do not hear her so well. Thank you very much. Good presentation and I think we need to work as a community board to see you know these conflicts you're right, they're, not with D.O.T they're, really what the priorities are within the Community board. Okay, so just let us know! Thank you very much. Thank you. It's pat! Thank you emilia too. Thank you all. Thank you. Yes, thank you so betty. Where do we go from here with this particular issue? How do I strongly oppose closing edgar in both directions? Listening to Tammy, there was the comment of one putting some pressure, which I think is probably not going to go very well, very tough, the MTA to change what they're doing as well as to ask the port authority to make changes to what they're doing to open up liberty. The reality is otherwise it's going to be with a fight with youth and education, because this is what they asked for, and this was the resolution that was passed and it was done last December, okay, so I'm you know, I'll be there to fight about my community thanks, oh yeah I know it'll be proceeding, but it's really in-house. That has to be done. Sorry, Betty I stepped away for a quick Sec to answer the door. The end answer was in the working group reflected some of Pat's concerns as well, so I agree with everybody. Thank you, pressure being put would be great because D.O.T did really spectacular work. Yeah thanks, yes, well, thank you and we'll move on then to the next item, which will go much more quickly excessive ride, given how late it is. What I'll probably do is just warn people kind of what the issue is. We had a presentation last month and I just want a little bit of quick feedback. The only discussion I really heard was about people. Thinking there should be same-day rides available. Do people feel strongly about that? Of course, okay. Anyone besides mitch, of course, I agree with him and I see your handle at my mic. It's cruel not to be able to you know. Sometimes you have to go to the doctor that day agreed, Patrick, I, agree. I, have family members who use accessories and sometimes there's an emergency, and you have to call them that day. We're lucky enough to be able to afford car service in an emergency, but some people can't I thought I will start to put something together. Realizing it is a moving target. I mean MTA is cut, Sir Betty I did not know, I'm told now. I did not know that you had to make plans a day in advance. To do that. I mean if that's the state of health system for disabled people. That's cruel, I live with it. I know it. You know that I can't believe it yeah. So there's the issues, but there are multiple issues that fall together, such as when we talked about congestion pricing, the law only talks about disabled people being exempt, but they're not defined. The issue is, there is a congestion price on taxis and others so to sweep it in with. If someone has to go same day right now, they have to they rely on a taxi or something because they can't get access a ride. They're going to be multiple layers that make it kind of confusing, as well as the MTA is canceling more and more and it's a there is a group that has Ehale it's only 2,400 people, but nevertheless it looks like that's probably going to be cut completely. I think people waiting to hear the fallout from who wins the president and is there any hope of any money to the MTA, so I think it's been unfolding over a little bit of time. So I will work on this. I just want to confirm that there is interest to move forward with. At least this part, the bigger picture of excessive ride is going to take even longer to put arms around, because that's a cascading financial issue. So it's hard to even know what to talk about with the bigger picture, but at least same day would be something we could opine on. Daddy have something about this I agree with every what everyone said about this particular subject. I just want to get this on the record, and they come before us some years ago, as well. For someone who drives all the time. I can tell you that the accessorized drivers are among the most aggressive and dangerous drivers that are out there. They are absolutely horrible. That's all I'll say I wanted like 30 seconds to mention it on the record, something we might need to address, but they are just they're, the worst, the worst they're worse than taxi driver. Thank you and I believe I, see it from the other side, but again part of what's complicating that in the very short term, is that the MTA just announced they signed a contract with three or five other vendors to provide service. So again, there's a little bit of a disconnect with the past with the present to the future and that's a little bit of a mismatch, but otherwise, two days ago, I see them on the road you better just get away from them. They're awful dangerous. It's not doing the subject, but I'm just telling you yeah, no I, know I understand, and there are lots of issues, because I can tell you they can't tie down my scooter either so I just slide around and they yell at me. But yes, there are many issues, so we will get to them. I'm just glad to hear there is interest so then I will pursue it and you can realize it's really complicated in the moment, because so many things are changing. Yeah I was also just going to add, mark that actually came up at the meeting last month and I was really surprised, they're actually very we're talking about accessories right. Yes, the woman who was presenting for accessorize said all you really need to do to like deliver a complaint is tell them what intersection and what time you saw. So, even if you do not touch the the number of the Van, they have tracking and they're able to find out who was driving the Van, and she said they have a very like rigorous. If there's a complaint, the driver has to go through retraining. So that's thank you yeah. So, by all means you know, do complain. I can tell you they're, not real, responsive to the people who ride it, but maybe you'll have good luck and it's good to be on the record yeah. Anyone else I see a couple of hands up, but I think they're, probably still up that mark okay, otherwise, we'll move on to the next topic and I will work on that. Get back to you, Michael thanks, because again, this is postponed till December, some of the same issues. We still need some information, and this has to do with how specific the location of the of the scooter actually is. So the pings that they're getting. Are they really detecting the right thing? The wrong thing is it's sensitive, yeah, betty, I, just read something in the paper. I know we're going to discuss this next month, but just for you to I mean you might know, or you might not know, I forget which person in the Department of Transportation was saying this, but they were saying because of the budget crisis and everything that the group that's going to be monitoring like the safety of the bicycles of the E-bicycles and the Revel electric moped, it's going to be cut they're not going to be able to do what the representatives came and said that there's always people I think they replied to mark a while ago that they're going to be able to with GPS like monitor everything it from what I read. It just seems that they're not going to have the personnel to do that. So just to be aware of that, when we talk about it next month, yeah, no, that's the problem. There's this cascading loss and lots of departments and divisions are being closed with lots of agencies what she was referring to was their system and what they get in their offices. The question, then, is: it looks like what she said was the DOT got reports from them about what they're picking up the question is how sensitive what they're picking up is right by all means if there are complaints, file them by the location and the basic time and as she said, she can identify who the renter was. That would have been there at that time, but that's Revel's capacity, not city of New York capacity, so it's not hit by the budget problems. Okay. So, but thank you next item. Michael is on. Oh my god. It's my turn. So I just wanted to introduce well Betty and I really just wanted to introduce this topic tonight. I know it's getting late, so this will just be a quick introduction to a series of discussions that we'd like to have in the transportation committee and probably in the community board as whole. If you recall what Jennifer from DOT said earlier today, she had mentioned that the the street, the open streets program has been extended and but they have not figured out the plans for the what the final project. What the final sorry excuse me I do not know why, as soon as I talk, I'm getting used to just listening to everybody, so yeah they're still finalizing that program and we've seen over the past few months like a rapid change in how our street space is used with the open streets program, and it's happened very quickly and it's happened without community board input. So we wanted to bring up this topic and say what I'm going to do. Is I'm going to circulate like a Google drive sheet at the end of this meeting for people to add some issues, some priorities that we as a community feel like DOT, should be taking into consideration when they're finalizing this program and potentially coming to us with any other program, because as we can, as we know, there's limited space in the city and anything that we prioritize, there's going to be trade-offs between decisions and it's helpful for us as a community board to get our priorities out there. So I mean some example. Priorities could be hey. Do we want to advocate, for you know, continued use of space for businesses we want to advocate for additional space for pedestrians. Do we want to advocate for additional space for cyclists or what are some specific issues specific to our district? For example, we have a lot of double parked delivery vans like how do we have a discussion about that and come to a conclusion as to what our priorities are as a community board district I'll pause there and I'll? Let betty chime in for a second as well thanks, it was muted, no I think Michael really covered it all I think even getting together the beginning part of what are I do not know. How do we even view things? Are we pedestrian? First? Are we? Are there any basic underlying principles that can be achieved and agreed to would be a good starting point to even start with, because you see how often it came up even tonight with juggling priorities and that's the issue the agencies have to make and the more guidance we can give them. At least we told them what we believe in, but we have to kind of put it together ourselves with what we think is important, and then they have to filter it through all the pressures they have, but nevertheless, at least we can inform in general and then worry about specifics as they come up yeah exactly so I do not know if anyone has any immediate thoughts on this, but it's okay, if you do not because I do yeah, you have you mentioned about double it kind of relates into this about double park, trucks and things like that and what can help a little bit of that is a revamping of curbside parking regulations in certain areas and before the virus. I know I call for a committee vote that that this subject should be an agenda item. I have not pushed it, because every everything that's going on more priorities than that at the moment, but that we review and submit like community Board 2. Does this all the time changes the curbside regulations were appropriate and in truck zones where they're double parked, maybe that area can have trucking parkings of trucks? You know eight to seven or whatever. The case is maybe it's eight to six now, whatever you know things like that, just now, with the Citibank building at Greenwich between Greenwich and West Street, they finally finished the construction on the right highway side and they put up no parking anytime. So it's ridiculous. That's a perfect place for alternate side, parking or half truck parking. Half a part. Taxi stand alternate side whatever, but the non wisdom into just throwing up no parking anytime between northmoor and I. Guess, that's your street. It just makes no sense, there's no reason for it, so we have to be proactive in this particular area. Like I said CB2 has it almost on the agenda every day that they want to have something fixed and change, and that could help that's just one little cog in the wheel. I do not know Pun intended that. Can that can help with some of this stuff, so we so we need to start getting the ball rolling on that I know it's not a huge priority when we're doing these. You know non-face-to-face meetings, but we've got to keep it in mind to start start get going on at some point. Yeah no 100 I completely agree because we know it's a problem in our district and even though it's maybe a minor problem, it's something! That's nice for us to as a community discuss so that whenever critique comes to us, we can say hey as a community board. This is a problem and what are we doing to like? How does this issue help us address that so I think that's a great idea. Yeah I agree, you know come up with a list of maybe three or four specific locations that you think should be should be fixed and then we can, you know spitball it for sure. I have something to add. Also betty you and I think Tammy's hand is up too. Did you see it Michael? Yes, I did sorry Tam. If you want to go, and then pat me go ahead, placards and poor, and on top of that, we really need to have city agency parking, looked at and State Agency and federal agency and courthouse, but I mean we really kind of need to take a look at that, and that needs to be a holistic real. Look because we can't we have so many competitive uses and such a narrow street grid in so many places that it would be great to be able to. Quite I'm not usually somebody who says hey, you know garages need business too. However, garages may need some business these days. I have not seen any sold out signs and we really need to kind of take a look where: how can we do more outdoor dining? How can the trucks arrive and go? You know we need Betty and I sat at a meeting which seems like it was a century ago about curbside. You know garbage going into the curb lane, garbage containers and a pilot program with the department of sanitation. That's got to be something that we. You know that we need to what happened to that. Where is that going? It was part of the initiatives in Fidei I mean Michael I. Remember, you went looked at intersections. You know we really. If we're going to make progress on our streets, let's try and get some of the biggest offenders off them. First, and one of them to me is the sanitation issues and the other is the placard and the agency parking. If we can make any kinds of dents in those, then we can really have a great look and then find ways that we can have beautiful, open, dining, find places for cargo bikes, find places for people to leave their cars and really transform lower Manhattan, which would be just delightful, but it all starts with placards and sanitation. Yeah. That's on my to-do list and it'll probably be on next month: okay, Betty! Actually so that I'll put my hand back down because lucian and you had said that we're going to do that next month. So, just to let you know, Tammy there's a specific situation that falls exactly into what you're talking about with the placard and the agency taking up without community involvement that I'm going to bring up next month. That will directly show you guys what's happening behind the scenes, so I'll wait till next month, Betty yeah, because there are a lot of issues have to be put together for that one so I understand and then there's a specific one that I wanted to bring to everybody's attention that could crystallize it of what they just did. But thank you thank you and I'm turning this back. This Michael's show oh sure, yeah I'll go back to Pat. I know you got something to say: well, I, I'm not sure this overlaps with what mark had brought up, but we talked about this years ago, delivery times for businesses so that we could get those trucks in you know at specific times like they do in Europe, they're only allowed to deliver during specific times so that they're off the streets, that's number one number two. This is something betty and I were talking about the other day. You know that there's a big problem with like fedex and the other delivery services of boxes, where they're dumping boxes on the sidewalk and sorting it out, and this may be a topic that we need to address it with D.O.T that they need to have some place DOT and those businesses, because they need to pay to be some place and not just take up our city streets and our and our public sidewalks, oh 100, or like a delivery, they've, basically taken over our streets. For that, like a delivery zone, it's nuts, it's you know yeah and Michael. So those are examples of the kinds of things for priority of sidewalk and street use right, but pat remind you back to the meeting that Tammy was referring to. It was with polly trottenberg, and it was talking about that very issue and she was very much working on not only the cargo bikes as part of the solution for because fedex would be one of the groups to get them to not stage in neighborhoods exactly but other alternatives for staging locations such as on the waterfront or somewhere, where they were not on a street I know there are multiple things going on, and hopefully we'll hear more about that. But that's partly why Michael is doing this initiative is to get kind of a sense of where are the concerns and priorities, so they can be communicated directly with the D.O.T, because I know they're sort of undergoing the same thing. They have so many demands on them, yeah, 100 and so everybody wants to stream. Do you did not want to say something? In addition, are you good I see your hand up, I'm assuming he's okay, great, I'm taking mine down. Sorry, okay, no worries, oh and I was asked. I was also. This is just something: I was looking at vision. Zero, like New York City, has a vision, zero map of crashes and like incidents in lower Manhattan. So perhaps this factors in somehow into our priorities. Maybe we can identify some priority streets or areas where we're like hey. If dot's working on a new plan, we want to make sure that they're, including safety precautions like I, know like West Street, is a perennial conversation, but you can see that you know. West. Street is always put that on your list too, but safety is one of the hey Betty. Have we ever talked about one of the things that always worries me on West Street D.O.T worked with us. We got the turn lanes on West Street, but the one thing that is confusing you know at an intersection: do bicyclists have to stop at a red light the same as cars I think they do well on West Street. They have their own red light. They have a bicycle red light right, so they're supposed to follow that, but I mean they do not, of course yeah, but no, that is the law, is they are supposed to follow traffic signals when they're on the roads, no kidding really I did not know that yeah well, cars do not always follow it either. So you know you know betty every time we just do not drive down the street the wrong way. Oh yeah, they do. No, they do not buddy. Somebody says something about a bicycle: you have to qualify for a car. There are cars that are very dangerous, but we just mentioned something. It does not have to be qualified with something else and 99 of the cars do not drive down the wrong side of the street. They do other bad things, but they do not drive down the wrong side of the street. We I mean we just know that sidewalk Mike Michael can I. Just have you add one thing: it's kind of loosely in the placard parking, but if you can also add specifically the agencies requesting without community involvement from the D.O.T, the changing of signage, to get the placard parking, especially after the construction project and then like once, the construction practice is over signage is supposed to go back to how it was. But some of the agencies are using that as leverage to change the signs, and so I just wanted to put that and thank you yep it's. So it's really actually the agency process for getting their signage right, but so what I'm saying is that might be the process now, but I would like to see if we can change it, because the analogy that I would like to make is that would be like a restaurant coming to the community Board to do stipulations after they've gotten the the liquor license till 4 pm at the liquor authority and then coming here say: listen, let me I'll tell you we'll tell you what stipulations will agree with. We already have a license, so I'm saying that just like the bike share and all these other people come to us before they implement something. I would like to see if we can put some pressure to see if the agencies could at least come to us before they implement something without our knowledge, which has been happening yeah. No, you just agreed with me. Oh I'm sorry, then better all I was saying was adding on and saying it's not just the signage they have, but the process by which they occur. A change whatever was something you were pointing out. I know, I heard it somewhere, you're right Betty. Thank you, yeah! No, thank you. No, these are all great and again, like I know it's getting late, so I'll. We can end the discussion now, but I'll start one more one: oh go ahead: Pat! Oh yeah! We never got to you, I'm sorry. This is bad again and we can either I was going to do this in quality of life, and maybe it should be with you guys or it could be joint. But this is something we've discussed for 20 years and now that bikes are, you know really a part of the fabric of New York City. They need to enforce the ruling that bikes are not allowed to be ridden on the sidewalk and I see cops standing there when bikes are on the sidewalk and they never say a thing, and so I really want to approach the cops that you know the police that they need to enforce that rule, especially the e-bikes. Well, to address that I'll. Let you know pat because I put together a resolution for the CitiBikes, not specifically for the infill. So this was more generous, but it's the priorities again and I've heard of the community boards complaining about the same thing and truthfully or if it's pedestrian our priority and certainly on the sidewalk they'd, ask. For instance, the docks not be put on the sidewalk that there may be bike lanes where there are docks, so that it's clear to cyclists, where they're supposed to be. We have so many tourists and I really do not know where to go. You know when the new commissioner for lower Manhattan, the D.O.T which came in and he came to the life meeting and you may have been there and I specifically said to him that when the bikes are on the sidewalk riders mount the bike and ride the bike along the sidewalk to get down into the street, that's number one but number two, even if it is not a CitiBike, you know a CitiBike dock in the area. Just people ride their bikes, delivery, people, regular people ride their bikes on the sidewalk and many times I've gone. You know come to go around the corner. A bike almost narrowly misses me and we need to have the police enforce the rule and make it clear somehow I do not know how they make it clear to writers. The commissioner said: oh, you know it's on the CitiBike docks. Well, they do not read that it needs to be clear to riders that it is illegal to ride your bike on the sidewalk. No well, as we put things together, which Tammy had spoken about potentially for executive committee this month, since our time frame is that for CitiBikes, a lot of these things actually will come up in that resolution, because I wrote down things that came up from other community boards dealing with this infill okay, which is why I have a heads up. I know what I've heard from other places with recommendations, things that I think some of them were very clever. That's going to bring up to see what people thought, but it's these very issues they were addressing and Betty and just to be fair, I, actually find it less with CitiBikes. As far as the bikes on the street and the e-bikes on the street and more with the delivery people, especially in the night time when the streets are a little less crowded and people that do work at night are like pets. Pat knows because we brought this up many years ago with the quality of life committee and you're. Rounding the corner and pat also knows that I specifically brought it up to the precinct and I brought it up to I. Forget the other gentleman that used to come to our meetings. Pat, they basically said if the cops are not going to do anything unless like unless somebody gets killed and then they'll do something for a short period of time, but to be fair to the CitiBikes I find it more of a problem with the delivery people, because it's like the taxis where you're working like time is money well, and that is the problem I when talking about Citibank I, do not want to confuse them with other right populations. So thank you for pointing that out, because that is very true and the complaints fall. That way too, tell me is Tammy still here, I am dear, so I just wanted to bring this up. Actually we spoke about it another issue before the virus that you were we're going to bring up an executive committee with regards to having resolutions written beforehand and presented to us doing it organically again, at some point, of course, Mark. Let's keep going with this list, please we can address that. We can address that at exactly apologize. I apologize, it's okay, so Eddie I wanted to add to the topic here. One of the things that we talked about that you know was finding locations to be able to do cargo bike right. So that really means that we need to also look at distribution locations. So that's a tougher topic, but it's something that we need to have, whether it's with small business working group quality of life land use, but we need to figure out solutions. The last time we you know, there's one location in Tribeca that whole foods not whole foods that fresh direct uses as a distribution center on the sidewalk and in a no standing zone. But that's a user. That's not going away. You know the freshdirect and Amazon user ups and others. So it's a dialogue. I do not know the solution to, but it's a dialogue we need to have, and it is a major impact on both the street in terms of the sidewalk as well as the parking. So no I think freight definitely is an issue that's be put on here to deal with, and also people have to separate those that are corporate partners with the DOT regarding deliveries, because they're in a whole different program, moving in a different direction and all of those that have not yet agreed to or been I do not know or maybe not approached, who are not corporate partners. I absolutely have to be done with right, but I want to prioritize a corporate partner. Who has the money to outfit them? Their own spaces is one thing, but prioritizing somewhat of a residential view on it and a small business view is kind of where I want to go on that. You know what I mean it's it's a very complicated and tough thing, and you know each and quite frankly, each area of CB1 is so structurally different that they need different solutions and different conversations, but it does not matter. I was dealing with boy the solutions of the standards that you could hold different groups too. Not the needs were because yep gotcha that's taken yeah and Michael. Let you wind it up. Oh sure so I think we can I'm happy to end the conversation now because again, this is kind of just the start of this, and we just want to introduce this to get people thinking about it and we'll take these up. We'll take a look at what people people add and we'll discuss it in our next committee meeting and like I, think tammy. As you said, some of these are going to turn into larger conversations where we're talking with a small business group or talking with quality of life, but we just want to get the ball rolling on this, because this is an opportunity for like there's. A lot of changes happening right now with how streets are being used, and we want to make sure that the community's voices are heard in our part of that discussion and then you're going to have to put back on the list congestion, pricing yeah, because we have to have the topic and it's not going away. We have to make our CB1 requests and that has to be done sooner versus later for sure, tanaka. Just a comment on that. Maybe it came up. This came up just to press I, guess a few months ago and I think in quality of life committee. If I remember, pat and I, it's something I think we need to readdress as a full board in that considering what's happened with the virus that this becomes even more of a burden on on residents, citizens and small businesses, when you know I mean you know, you do not have to go through the whole litany of what's wrong going wrong with the city, and we should rethink our taking more of a firm position about how good or bad idea this is economically. So, that's what I'd like to see as a topic I know there are others that agree with that. Okay is that everyone done yeah. Thank you, Buddy, yes, well! Thank everyone and I guess I'll see you online can I, say thanks great meeting, I'm glad and Tammy I'll get back to you. I'll put together some things for the executive again waiting to get some of the data. That's fine! If you, if you can just add I, mean you you're here you listen to it summarize. You know some of the feedback and comments that everybody gave public and the board, so we can have that captured. That would be fine, okay because we can annotate it. You know back to the meeting. That's awesome, I appreciate the work thanks yeah, that's fine I, always listen to these tapes. I love them! Oh, my god, you're torturing, yourself.
