Thank you to Community Board, one Tammy Lucian Betty, Michael and committee members for having us on tonight.
I'm joined by my colleagues, Brian Peret and janae molloy from Dot's bike share program as well as Jennifer Liam from the Manhattan office, who many of you also have the pleasure of working with Greg Haas and mollier yoon from Dot's traffic engineering and planning team are also on tonight to speak to the Edgar Street Trinity Place school update, which is next up on the agenda.
Three expansion in Manhattan started this spring when we expanded into new neighborhoods uptown, but we're also focusing on adding new stations and more dock capacity in the existing service area, including here in CB1, to help support the demands of a larger system, and so I wanted to thank the board again for giving us the opportunity to present and at this time, I'd like to hand it off to Brian from the bike share program to walk us through tonight's slide.
Ninety thousand trips, getting close to a hundred thousand a day and really all the success is built on the backs of our 170,000 annual members just want to briefly touch on Covid-19 and CitiBike, and the city's response, as well as Lyft's response.
That's going to add, 32,000 docks or about 16,000 bikes in an approximate like 35 square mile, area.
Increased demand from expanding to new parts of the city helps meet demand and helps riders, find bikes or docks in the existing service area and overall is geared towards improving our rebalancing and system operations.
Take that data, as well as ridership data and our technical criteria and identify feasible locations following we'll notify property, owners, community boards and key stakeholders before installation and post installation will continue to monitor how these stations respond and how system demand responds as well just want to touch briefly on our plan as it exists right now for community Board.
They are listed here and I'll go into detail on subsequent slides, starting with these three looking at a station on the East road bed of spruce at gold, the West sidewalk of Fulton and Pearl Street.
That's correct, specifically, where, like that was the North road bed, the northwest corner of Albany and Greenwich Street.
Yes, that's correct, so the world trade center I mean is, for obvious reasons of a big network gap and an area that we certainly feel like.
You know I would welcome Betty to see if you know the committee or the board would like to consolidate some comments on our larger plan, and we can respond to some of the concerns that you're raising now or later.
I do want to point out that you know whether the station is installed on the road bed or on the sidewalk there's.
You know what Albany street looks like at Greenwich.
In other words, I think there was a number and one of your thoughts about adding, maybe 16,000 new bytes or softening stations and does I do not know those eight thousand give us a satisfactory result.
Does point, even though it I know it might look like CD bike is on every.
You, know every street corner or something, but as I mentioned, it's a hugely popular program and even at certain points of the day, especially during rush hour, users feel like, and the data supports that they're not able to find.
I want to piggyback on something that Anthony had kind of said when you're like scouting locations, and do you take into consideration if there's multiple locations, and maybe one location is, you know no parking.
It would not to be prudent to try to take the more restrictive parking that residents could not use anyway, if you're not already doing that, because that would seem to be like a win-win situation as J as opposed to just picking a location, I would recommend to try to pick the most restrictive parking locations that would affect the community, the least, and it's probably more important for the outer boroughs, where you know there's more of that is necessary.
I do want to say that you know we do not just look at ridership at one station to kind of determine whether or not it's successful, because we look at the bike share system as what it is.
I mean the feedback focus we're looking at where users told us that they felt like they wanted to see more docs from bikes.
The data part really came from an analysis on dockability metrics, so a user's ability to find a dock or a bike, particularly during the rush hours, and you know, we evaluated these stations and determined how much additional docs or bikes.
When choosing sighting of locations, we've had issues in Community board, one with restaurants, who have locations, as you well know, outside them, and in the options for open streets and trying to make them successful.
Those guidelines for what a permanent kind of open restaurant outdoor dining program looks like are still very much under discussion or in discussion and under development.
You know what a permanent open restaurant program could look.
And, you know, rules and regulations are for a permanent or program, looks like soon Jennifer.
Your data is based on wide issue, I, wonder if the data set actually identify who they are if they are actually tourists, because along those locations, obviously they want more dogs, because that's the access to all those touristy places or if they are actually residents or if they identify themselves of new yorkers using CitiBikes, because Albany at Greenwich is an access to battery Pack, city, prominent also to West, Street and other locations.
So I can understand why the riders want more dogs in those proposed location, but again, like Pat Moore, said, and the other ones mentioned that we do need to care about the residents who live there and about the street locations in terms of the proposed into stations.
The sidewalk is grating along the perimeter of the Albany plaza on the north side of Albany, and at Greenwich is an abandoned construction site right now of that high rise, then cedar is a one-way going west turning south at Greenwich and a lot of times once the car came, comes through.
So it's kind of dangerous for the children and the parents and the stroller trying to cross from the park back to the south side across Fulton Street, so I want to bring that up.
There were no comments that suggested that we needed additional hardware, so I do not understand, and I'd like to learn more, I'm, not trying to just be you know.
That would be another question for me and then finally, I would just like to suggest that the community board, as this is the beginning, I- think of public engagement.
You know that we do not block restaurants, which Tammy mentioned that we that we prioritize pedestrian space over.
You know parking space for city, agencies.
You know whatever those things are, but I, think this community board, and this committee should have a clear set of preferences for how we'd, like D.O.T, to address their infill and expansion in our district, so that they can work with clear preferences and come back with some clear proposals that meet those preferences.
If anybody Jennifer O'brien, if you know the right people and can get that painting done, then we can get our bikes back and we won't have to walk three or four blocks in other directions to even get to a bicycle.
Just had one quick comment: What's going on, a few people had mentioned, the pops I just wanted to mention to Brian I, understand that this is temporary and that every you know open space is different, but in general, we're very sensitive to impeding existing public spaces in our district, particularly because you know it.
We would need that so without having that today, I'm, not really sure how this committee could actually vote on something to send to you this month to be ready for full board, because we do not have the statistics and some of the other information that we're asking for.
You know taking a look at the rebalance and all of the other things you've heard about the two specific sites, but we really want to see what the whole picture looks like it's sometimes death by a thousand cuts.
I feel like the city as well as the community boards have been working night and day, on.
Not, you know on all of the recovery programs, as well as our other street improvement projects, and that includes CitiBike, infill and expansion.
You guys are saying that you're now going to put them onto the pavement and the sidewalk where we walk where older people come into our historic building.
I just wanted to you know let Sonya and the committee know that we're taking a closer look at some of the concerns that we've heard.
Or can you expand this station instead of an install here and having that kind of dialogue and with the open streets and everything else taken into consideration as a balance versus we have to answer you today by the end of the month, because the weather's getting cold.
We are planning to move forward with our CitiBike expansion and infill installations, and so you know, we've been presenting to other community boards.
I will say this mitch and tammy that you know when we do our draft plan presentations to you, know, community boards, where we're looking to expand the bike share.
Also you know, look to answer the questions that you brought to the DOT team here, today, particularly about a more comprehensive like district kind of holistic.
Look at you, know, bike share expansion, here, quite frankly, I have requests that I'm sure people are sending us.
The best description I can give you in battery park city I, think it took four years to get it moved to the original location that the Community board, suggested.
We were simply going to install a new bike, the bridge bike, whatever that may be onto the pavement onto the sidewalk, where we already have the street right.
I know this awaited to Edgar, Street, Trinity, School, update and Malia.
My name is Malia I work with the grt traffic engineering and planning group, I'm here with Grey Coss, and we will be presenting the Edgar Street School study.
Currently, using the slip ramp to access trinity, place, northbound would be rerouted to northbound, Greenwich Street and then turn right onto Edgar, Street.
The primary objective is to evaluate potential safety improvements in this area and again the study objective, Enhanced, Pedestrian safety for a new mixed-use development along the north side of Edgar Street at 42 trinity, place.
The development is anticipated to consist of a 40-story mixed-use building, including school retail and residential uses, and our study scope is to present and evaluate alternatives that would improve safety for pedestrians within the vicinity of the proposed project, while maintaining thoroughfare to trinity place and vehicular access to the parking garage at Edgar, Street and Greenwich Street.
So, we developed five alternatives for analysis, with the general focus being to improve safety for pedestrians, minimize impacts to bus operations and maintain access to the garage on Edgar Street, and here are the five alternatives.
This alternative proposes a new signal at Greenwich and Edgar streets to facilitate vehicle progression onto trinity place, northbound from the hct exit, ramp.
Three and four- is to provide a new north crosswalk at the intersection of trinity place and Edgar street, which is not shown.
Street alternative three proposes to permanently close Edgar Street westbound, to provide additional space on the north side of the street for anticipated growth in pedestrian activity, and especially children in the area because of the new school with Edgar Street Westbound closed to vehicular traffic.
It's anticipated that traffic headed north on trinity place that currently turns left at Edgar Street to access.
The parking garage would instead continue straight on trinity turn left at cedar and then left on Greenwich, essentially going around the block.
Place could be maintained as a three-phase signal providing an exclusive pedestrian phase, and the two signals would be coordinated like we previously discussed, so that there would be no vehicles getting trapped on Edgar street.
This alternative provides additional pedestrian space near the school along the north side of Edgar Street and maintains access to the parking garage and to trinity place northbound from the hct exit.
After further examination and discussion with the community board, this option was removed as a viable alternative due to restricted access for vehicles and buses in terms of bus operations with the permanent closure of Edgar street.
In, both directions, buses would be forced to continue north onto Greenwich Street and execute a right turn onto Rector Street Eastbound, and this maneuver is not feasible without redesigning the intersection to accommodate the bus's larger turning radii and closing the slip all to the flip.
However, MTA strongly opposes the permanent closure of the HCC exit ramp because of the high demand for this route and also another reason eliminating Edgar street as a link in the roadway network, converts Greenwich into a dead end with no outlet vehicles, traveling along Greenwich Street in the southbound direction would be forced to turn right into the parking garage, whether they intended to or not.
The implementation of a signal at this intersection will ensure that vehicles do not get trapped at the eastbound left turn at Edgar, Street and, furthermore, signalization at this intersection improves safety by providing designated crossing time to pedestrians and regulating vehicular movement.
Permanent closure of Edgar Street Westbound provides additional pedestrian space while maintaining eastbound access to the trinity place and I.
We, also the gathering space room, which this would create by closing the Westbound Edgar Street and also concerned about access to where the school bus stops.
Were, which, of course not knowing where the school bus stops are going to be.
So those have to be factored in, and I'd like to get some kind of response about we hearing about traffic, but in terms of pedestrians, do we need some kind of signalization, or is it going to be just fine to cross trinity from the school to probably where the bus stops are going to be ready.
The one ways are, the kids are going to have to cross the street, it's impossible to drop them off on the correct size unless they're coming in from Brooklyn.
Edgar Street Westbound being closed, assuming that those vehicles making that turn were looking to get into the parking garage.
How: the bus is going to access Greenwich Street.
If you call close the west, if you close Edgar Street going west, they can not turn left onto Edgar and then right on to Greenwich.
If we leave Westbound Edgar Street Open, then it would be possible for the school buses to drop kids off on the correct side.
No we're going to need to talk to that in-house, because again, Trisha was very insistent on this because of having to place like 600 family members for school and needed more sidewalk, space.
That's if we leave Westbound Edgar Street open correct, just like if we close, but.
I just wanted to say, like I'm, going to defer to more to Tommy and pat for the people that live down.
Not my children are grown now, but as a parent that had children in public school that to have to have the children cross the street like it should start from that's the only thing that should not be yes.
We can do what you just said, which is which is making sure kids are dropped off on the correct side, and we could also not disrupt MTA operations, but to do that Edgar street would have to remain open in both directions.
Just thinking about the safety of you know the kids getting off the bus, that's all because they were two, as was the school construction, Authority.
I have a quick question for D.O.T in this scenario, where you do have one side of Edgar Street closed to create additional sidewalk space.
And then the people that live down there, like pat, was saying they have very little access, some maneuverability in in the neighborhood and for having other street closed.
But what just you know using cones orange cones and things like this, not a complete restructure of the street so some day down the road they can permanently close it.
If I'm wrong, is that I think most people do not want a permanent closure to the street and to work our way up from there.
I think we need to work as a community board to see you know these conflicts.
I know it's getting late, so this will just be a quick introduction to a series of discussions that we'd like to have in the transportation committee and probably in the community board as whole.
Is I'm going to circulate like a Google drive sheet at the end of this meeting for people to add some issues, some priorities that we as a community feel like DOT, should be taking into consideration when they're finalizing this program and potentially coming to us with any other program.
We want to advocate, for you, know, continued use of space for businesses.
We have a lot of double parked delivery vans like how do we have a discussion about that and come to a conclusion as to what our priorities are as a community board, district.
Yeah I agree, you know come up with a list of maybe three or four specific locations that you think should be should be fixed.
So, just to let you know, Tammy, there's a specific situation that falls exactly into what you're talking about with the placard and the agency taking up without community involvement that I'm going to bring up next month.
We got the turn lanes on West Street, but the one thing that is confusing you know at an intersection: do bicyclists have to stop at a red light, the same as cars.
I'm saying that just like the bike share and all these other people come to us before they implement something.
So I really want to approach the cops that you know the police that they need to enforce that rule, especially the e-bikes.
This month, since our time frame, is that for CitiBikes, a lot of these things actually will come up in that resolution, because I wrote down things that came up from other community boards dealing with this infill okay, which is why I have a heads, up.
One of the things that we talked about, that you know was finding locations to be able to do cargo bike, right.
We need to have, and it is a major impact on both the street in terms of the sidewalk, as well as the parking.
