We know governor's island is an extraordinarily special place for New York City, and this is an opportunity for us to really expand access to the island and enhance and celebrate everything that is unique and fantastic about the island.
So everybody who may be needed to answer questions about the eis, the zoning proposal and the financial analysis before diving into that and just to frame tonight's conversation, we wanted to rECAB the vision that we've been presenting to the Community board over the course of the past months.
Out, is not thinking through how we can make governors island an extraordinary public place for new Yorkers, and.
We just wanted to remind folks that the idea of having mixed-use development on the island, both in the northern historic district, but also ground up on the southern island, has always been part of the vision for Governors island, even back when the federal government transferred the property to local control.
Somebody summed it up very well at our last meeting, which is Governors island can be as fantastic on a Tuesday as it is on a saturday and as wonderful place to visit in February as it is in July, and we want to see that life on the island that we all know and love during the summer time on a year-round basis for the island.
It can also support us, do more access and more things for New York, City residents, as I said, we'd love to get to year round more open, hours, we'd love to increase ferry frequency so that people do not have to plan their trip to governor's.
This idea around climate solutions that can really help drive some of the development on the island going forward, and you know the thing about these three pillars- is that they're responsive to what has grown on the island organically and that what the community out there has fostered over the years.
We're really our first tenants on the island and are very much focused on these issues of climate and environment and education, and then our newest tenant, which should open sometime next year, is the Qc term a spa and resorts in the sort of bucket of public amenities.
In September of this year, we and the mayor's office announced a vision to establish a leading center for climate solutions on governor's island as a way to really anchor future use in the island in an educational use and create a cross-sector community around it and focused on one of the pressing issues of the 21st century.
You know that starts with bringing in this research or educational anchor, but it is going to create a diverse cross-sector community that surrounds it, including dorm and faculty housing, small scale convening and hospitality, commercial operations and innovation.
We can support more small businesses on the island, and then all of that which is really a huge part of the unique opportunity on governor's island is nesting that in a public space amongst cultural uses and people who are visiting the island and can really engage in hands-on education.
This is an image of a potential educational user right at the foot of Yankee Pier, showing here how the island could be activated, year-round and adaptive, reuse of the old theater property adjacent to future construction.
This western promenade image seems to have something wrong with it, but we will correct that in the file that's sent around later tonight, and then here is the living laboratory along the southern part of the island and then finally, hammock grove here shown as fully grown over the years and framed by East the Eastern Development Zone.
We are here before you about the rezoning of the south island that would enable this vision to come to life, but at the same time we are working on public, strategic planning and public engagement.
We'll talk more about that at the very end of the presentation, but really trying to engage folks in what that RFP says and what we're looking for from future users and then third outreach and marketing to prospective respondents to ensure that this is a successful proposition that will play out, as I said, over the course of the next seven months, gearing up to a solicitation.
Today, really creates the envelope it expands upon the allowable uses and sets up restrictions in terms of height in terms of lot coverage in terms of where development can be located and then.
Finally, as I said, sometime next year, we'll put out a solicitation, and in that we can address things like specifics, around design, around resiliency, criteria, sustainability and say more about what we're looking for from a partner.
The park when it was created, was really given what was thought of as the best part of the island the center and then the whole southwestern side of things to make sure that there was continued access to the water and fantastic views of the statue of liberty in terms of open, space.
The passive house is about 300 feet but obviously way below the sort of densities that you're seeing in Manhattanville or battery Park City Hudson yards we put on here just because it's come up in the past, but it's on a different order of magnitude of development than obviously what would be appropriate for the island, and so with that we.
One of the points I might want to make really clear is that we are including future income rental income from both the North Island historic buildings and the South Island new construction buildings and is from the rezoning we're talking about tonight and on the North island.
So we've put together a very kind of mission based distribution of uses across the islands, which is consistent with us having a large academic anchor on the South island as well as continued academic uses like the Harbor School on the North Island having dormitory uses to support those academic institutions, including office research and development space, hopefully, to support spin-off businesses from an academic, institution, amenity, retail, small amounts of hospitality and convening on both the South and North Island, really a large amount of cultural space on both the South Island 500,000 square feet and continuing to lease up no one park: cultural campus and having other cultural users across the North island and.
Then we have space leases on the North island that we're projecting in the future, where that the trust does redevelopment of a building and then actually leases small portions of the building to to Cultural or not-for-profit or for-profit users, and that's like what we're doing now in our in Nolan Park, and we issued an RFP for space there in March.
We went out and looked at a huge range of comps of ground leases that are in other public private developments, similarly situated waterfront sites across the city, so that meant Brooklyn, bridge park, Battery, Park city, the Brooklyn, Navy yard, lots of other long-term ground leases in the South Street South, Street, Seaport and others, and then really, of course, try to adjust those for market conditions and things.
We want to continue to fundraise working with the friends of governors, island and going after other grants.
We can cover all of our capital expenses ourselves, so that when the period when there's a hole in the seawall or a peer needs repair going out into the future that we're self-sufficient and can fund those things and so need to set aside a certain amount a year on average to cover those I think the best source of information here was really looking at both.
What the long term useful life of those assets, is and then also looking at our pure Brooklyn bridge park across the buttermilk channel, who has very similar infrastructure, similar buildings in a similar park, to maintain an infrastructure to maintain and has reserves about 10 million dollars a year in today's dollars.
The office of the deputy mayor for economic development issued a generic eis in connection with the construction of the park and open spaces that we all now enjoy.
The study did find significant adverse impacts, which we will detail on the upcoming slides, but just for some more background, context, Governors Island is unique in that you could only get to it on a ferry, so the study areas were kind of developed based on two elements.
That's, the battery maritime building and Manhattan, and pier 6 in Brooklyn, and then the other of the elements we looked at was how freight would arrive at the island to support the south on development, and so in that we looked at four potential freight terminals along the Brooklyn waterfront and.
The zoning proposal is one to expand the list of allowable uses on the South island to actually mirror what is allowed by the deed.
The, North island today, the whole open space center of the island will be protected and expanded and then, lastly, as we've covered it hard caps, the amount of developable square footage at 4.27 million square feet, which is an effective fire 3.
We worked over the past couple of years to establish design guidelines to really help frame what the rezoning proposal would look like, and since then, we've been working with Fx collaborative to come up with a proposed zoning envelope and they have taken these.
The South Island was built out in a very different way: integration of buildings and opening open space.
Some addition of some playing fields, the buildings I, will say, maybe not of as quality and character as those on the on the North island or the next, and then came the master plan and the and the creation of the park and the development zones, and really creating an incredible destination for new yorkers and for those from far beyond New York Governors Island.
So development is not something new for the South Island and then this fantastic master plan that West 8 did with this incredible park and these two development zones on either side and from the very beginning.
This vision for the South Island was about integrating park and open space with the with the development zones and presents this.
You know incredible once in a lifetime opportunity to set a new standard for how to do that, for sustainability and for integrating green space and buildings for the next.
One of the absolute key principles was to connect the two major assets of the island, this incredible park and the waterfront and the incredible views and experience of the New York harbor.
So that that's kind of one continuous experience for the next one of the models that we look to for that kind of integration of open space and development is something I'm sure this community boards are familiar with in battery Park city.
We'll have significantly more open space, not just in numbers, but in percentage than factory park city, but I think it provides a good model for how green spaces can kind of coexist and weave.
We have widened the esplanades on both sides of the island, both for to create sort of generous public spaces, also to allow states for dealing with resiliency issues, buildings or maybe even grade level, are going to need to be elevated to deal with flood elevations, and we want to make for smooth transitions within that zone, not create kind of walls along the along the waterfront, but allow those to be nice.
The West eight master plan introduced these curving paths brought them into the courtyards of Liggett Hall, and we have sort of built upon this series of kind of courtyard spaces that in this zone that divides the two, the North Island South Island again, is that sort of integration between building and open space.
I think this road, which is right, here, I, do not know if you can see my pointer, but it connects to one of the roads that will connect the North island to the southbound.
We feel that we have created a set of zoning controls that will enable and development and enable kind of flexibility, but at the same time, really preserve all of those fantastic, unique qualities that Governors Island has today next.
There are the ground control regulations which control where connect where rights of ways are where key nodes are positioned in general, open space regulations that are within the development sub-areas.
You know within the RFP, in addition to the primary connections, there is a requirement for a public open space which is in the zoning, will be called Yankee, Pier Plaza, which is a 25, a minimum 25,000 square feet of gateway at the foot of Yankee Pier, acting as an entry to the island.
In addition to the primary connections in Yankee, pure Plaza and the wide esplanades, there will be open space within the development parcels themselves, and that's shown here with the green hatch again with the green arrows.
One of those rules is a regulation that requires any building portion that is set back from a parcel boundary that space between a public access, area, the best land, primary connections or the Park Yankee pure Plaza, as well, must become open.
These areas, where you see and highlighted with the neon green, are building footprints which are set back from that parcel edge and then that neon green would then have to become part of the public open space of the development, zone.
If we look at you know the percentages of open space on the North island there, the total lot area of the North island subtracted by the building footprints, there's about 85 of that North Island, is publicly accessible open space within the South island.
The controls in terms of the size of buildings are controlled really by lock coverage where we're permitting up to 80 lot coverage to allow large low floor plate buildings, but we're establishing a regulation that limits the length of the building to not be more than 400 feet, and this is really to ensure kind of this porosity through the development parcels.
If a upper portion is within that first 200 feet within the Yankee Pier Plaza, it can not be perpendicular to the waterfront, and the reason here is that division road, which we see as this kind of straight line, that cuts across the island here is coming in at an acute angle from the waterfront, and so we do not want to pinch the space like interior Plaza.
If you think of the FDR as being the beginning of the development that gives you a sense of what that space is like in the next just some images for anyone, who's, not familiar with those or to refresh people's memories.
It is a bit of an art form and not an exact science, but based on these precedents, we think we're in the right at the right number, a similar kind of question about Yankee, Peer Plaza, and what that space is like next.
You know a reference point that I'm sure you'll be familiar with this area that we've set aside for Yankee Pier Plaza is pretty much the same area as Ducati park, again, something that provides a really wonderful kind of gathering space, a bit of green space in lower Manhattan.
Is, that each parcel has a bunch of rules for the area above 125 feet which include lot coverage and then capping a floor, flake floor, plate sizes and finally minimum distance between buildings and then a question about whether a developer in the future could turn the whole island.
If somebody in the future 40 years hence wanted to come and turn the whole island into you know, private residential.
Then, at some point next year, we'll be releasing a solicitation looking for that anchor tenant for climate solution center and to help you know.
And we're going to be creating three sort of working groups within that larger group specifically focused around the areas of public Engagement, equitable education and job pipelines, and then third design, guidelines.
We wanted to make sure to answer all the questions put all the information forward, so the Community board and the public have a full transparency and are able to comment and ask questions through the course of the evening.
For 15 years now, I feel, like the development of this island, would far off any climate can do any efforts you have for classrooms, for climate kind of brilliancy alone would cause tremendous problems for Ireland and construction gas team that confused all of it contributes greatly to the climate, crisis.
Pavers are paved, but we count that as open space as well, we're not calling it park, obviously, but you know non non-building, footprinted, areas, yep.
Think the real thrust of what we're going to have to do is through the RFP process, describe to potential partners exactly what we're expecting in terms of performance criteria, because we're not going to be the ones designing the buildings, but then they can respond to that in terms of their proposed development.
You know in 2010, I guess the city spent I think 350 million dollars on water and electricity infrastructure after the state right left to the funding to the city.
We've spent on building the park and doing the kind of some first phase, bringing electricity to the park or sorry to the island, we're currently building out water, sewer and other infrastructure, but that's not going to cover everything, even in this next 10 years, we're going to have to continue to work and work with the city to get additional capital dollars, allocated, which is incredibly difficult.
Then this, although it gets a little hard to predict, because this is sort of a special, a different place in and of itself in terms of the amount of open, space, the I think the point Ben was really trying to highlight.
If I can just I just want one data point on the on open space: again, looking at Battery Park City.
Just saying if you look at other developments, Battery Park City is at the one end of the of the spectrum in terms of how much open space there is, and this more than doubles that.
The second thing was that I noticed that the maximum base height of the buildings along the South Island Park, are higher than they are along.
I think that would be incredibly helpful and engage the part in sort of through these spaces to activate the primary and the secondary walkways that you're, creating and sorry.
So, oh and the last thing, sorry to go with the residential, far you're talking about it as if you are reducing the residential far, but given that all of the zoning calculations are going to start with a lot size which is 1.4 whatever square feet, your application still lists the far for residential as 0.5.
If you're going at point five of the far right so either that needs to be adjusted or I think to address Tammy's concern which she's brought up several times.
So on residential, the it's a little bit hard to compare, because today the entire southern half of the island generates far including the park space and that's the sort of status quo.
You know a typical narrow street in New. York City is 60 feet wide, and so that's the same width that we're showing for the primary connections and the esplanade width on the eastern side.
You know the views there there's a differentiation between the western esplanade and the eastern Europe, and we want to create a hierarchy of kind of a more promoting of a public space in the views out to the west, whereas the Eastern Esplanade is, you know a little bit more narrow, but still sufficient to allow for the mixed modal transportation, and also some you know, promenading along the waterfront.
Great, thanks, vicki I, think you know we heard loud and clear from the community board a couple years, ago.
Really, the past or many months, is coming up with a defining idea that we believe could be really exciting for the island in the city, and that is the idea of a center for climate solutions, and we think that would happen.
You know whether they be the Wxy ones, which we really worked very hard on to try and connote this idea of a sustainable and resilient urban environment or the ones that fx Collaborative put together, which appeared in a little bit of the presentation today as a way to hopefully show just more of what the building massing could look like are not the designs and what we're going to say in the RFP is that we want the architecture on this island to be inspiring, and if we accept an architecture that looks like Anywheresville, then we've failed at the job, but the zoning can't define the architecture, and so we would really.
It's, just we're not yet at the point of designing the buildings where we can do that in terms of showing what they're going to look like, but we hope that the idea of the center for climate solutions is something that is defining and will hope, be a real point of inspiration for the architects who respond as part of the RFP to do something.
How can this development support that, like what is the magic of a day on governor's island and how do those ground floor uses and the building walls that face the park.
And you know some real cultural anchors there that just add to this like climate, this green immersive experience I agree with a lot of rose's points.
And I think that we want to you, know, save as much of the open space for really like immersive green biodiverse space as possible as landscape architects.
It's, probably been stated repeatedly and aggressively that New York City Park should not be dependent upon revenues coming from commercial activity and, while I think every person that's been involved would agree with that.
I. Think the unfortunate reality is that asking for the city and state to continue to fund in full is just not going to be the solution to this problem and again I know.
And I would just underscore the one point: Andrew alluded to, which is that you know, as we move forward, whether it be with this rezoning or you know the addition of recreational fields or play spaces wherever we're absolutely committed to working with this community board and other members of the public on how those are configured and what are the uses that best sort of meet the needs of our use group.
Thinking I again just want to make sure that that's clear, because the amount of residential zoning being asked for in this is 1 6 of the total far and is really what we thought was the bare minimum necessary to realize the climate solutions vision and that anyone who wanted to go above and beyond that would, as I said, have to come and pursue another rezoning.
I mean I misspoke when I was speaking to Rosa Chang that she is correct, that we do, we are permitting a 90-foot base height along the Eastern Development Zone adjacent to your plaza in the park open space, and this really was intended in order to kind of frame the park.
What I'm looking at is the overall perspective of what the change could look like in 40 years, based on the zoning that you're asking for based on the deed restrictions, going away and understanding how that fits into an overall vision for what governors, island, is.
Other question is the community as a whole has an experience with other development sites where people have said to us that paths and esplanades are open.
It does seem to me that, based on the fiscal modeling and the development plans that it actually would be and more beneficial to the island to have commercial versus educational, because you would have greater tax revenue for the city and things like that.
You know again, tonight, I think the purpose of tonight is really to take all the comments and concerns I hear that actually the deed does require a certain acreage to be used as educational, just as it requires that a certain acreage be used as park, but that is you know, a different answer than the zoning one which I hear you asking and then in race.
I think we really have paid attention to the dimensions here and the Precedence Battery Park city was only brought up as a precedent about how the buildings in the open space, interact.
I would note that there's a few things that are in there that are sort of not connector spaces, there's two big parts of of actual new park space and then there's Yankee Pier Plaza, but we can certainly rerun the calcs without those things you know.
Think one of the beautiful things about Governors Island is the expanse of real grass, but I totally hear you on making better use of the space.
That's there today and there are also areas of the park that existing park that we think could be put to good use as additional field space.
We're, the fundraising partner of the trust for Governors Island and our mission is to steward the green spaces, enhance the visitor experience and build a community dedicated to the island's future.
You know the folks in the governor's island alliance, including community boardwalk at the time, really saw the abandoned the military base as being a great civic resource for the city.
Governors island is one of the pearls of New York Harbor and its ongoing transformation into a public space has been critical for restoring new yorkers connection with their waterfront, and we recognize that a proposed development is needed to support the ongoing maintenance of the park, public spaces and historic buildings on the North island.
Both development zones are in a portion of the island that was created with film material and within the 100 year, flood plain and in the trust, presentations.
We look forward to connecting with the trust and the community Board to ensure the ongoing success of Governors island and a viable future for this project.
But we've been working on this for many years and put a lot of hard work into coming up with a proposal that we think will help ensure the future of governors island as a public resource.
Yeah governor's island's been a one of a kind open space experience for visitors, thanks mostly to the really thoughtful development.
I mean comparisons to the of future public Spaces, Cicada Park and the resulting building, shadows or cases in point.
This plan is for an obtrusive massive buildings to be placed in the only public space of its kind in New York City.
I, know people sort of address this a bit, but I mean open, space.
Any case, not putting buildings in the West Development zone would go a long ways in preserving the south islands.
Thank you very much, roger I, think we've heard loud and clear about people looking for more open space and more sports claire.
Thanks, Tiffany, so hard can't really speak to the 2062 scenario, just given that it is 40 years away, but I do want to just clarify the number which we're not trying to make murky the maximum square footage that would be allowed on the South island of residential affairs about 700,000, which is 17 or 18 of the total, far being requested.
This vision aligns with our school's mission in educating our diverse city about climate change, while continuing our restoration work around the New York harbor, with our students and staff.
It is our hope that the New York City Department of Education can recognize this as an opportunity to engage in conversations with the governor's island trust and our school community to grow and align our work with the city's need to increase our maritime education and climate restoration.
We hope that community board one can assist in bringing representatives from the New York City Department of Education School, Construction, Authority, Governors, Island Trust and our school community together to plan on how the space is used on the island and how this climate center can possibly impact our New York City, public schools and our city.
In addition, you know, I think there was a question about the historic character of the island.
I. Think what we're really looking to do here is honor the history and the character of governor's island while creating a financial revenue stream to help support it.
This idea of supporting a diverse community, ensuring that access remain affordable at all, turns fostering public engagement and making sure that we're thinking about how to utilize the island in the spirit of its location in the center of Harbor and unique ecology.
The proposal would increase public connections between the park and weber, foreign esplanade and add an additional layer of protection for all open space on the South Island.
Finally, I want to speak to in support of counting the promenades as open space as someone who can not walk and use parklands the way able-bodied, people.
As you know, we've invested substantially on the island and created space at the art center at Governors, Island for working artists and generative public dialogues on sustainability and creativity.
We strongly believe that a global climate center will create pipelines for jobs, educational opportunities, all while expanding the island's public, park, land and building upon its existing framework of cultural, environmental, programming.
I think we have Daniel Reynolds who's from the board of the friends of governors island who still would like to speak.
Well I just wanted to voice his support as a CB1 board member and a excuse me CB1 resident and a member of the front of the Board of Governors Island and just say that you know I think we're at a pivotal point in the island.
That's, going to allow for year-round ferry, service, other crucial services that will help the island realize its full potential and we support the proposed Reserve.
You know the width of the esplanade, because if we're planning for 150 cars to be able to park on site, then that also the vehicles will be taking up a significant amount of space.
Sorry, I know that that's my little pet thing, but then I wanted to also end by saying we love the park.
