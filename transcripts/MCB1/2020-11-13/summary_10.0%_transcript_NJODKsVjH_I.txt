It is about being granted, a certificate of appropriateness by the New York City, Landmark, Preservation, Commission.
If you are not specifically here for the South Street seaport, historic district.
Of, our districts, which are like, the elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history.
Such as affordable housing in general, environmental concerns, and environmental impact, social equity proposed community benefits and things like that.
Let's be clear, there are not a lot of federal style buildings like this, in our neighborhood.
I'm facing skylight, but we also want to restore and bring back the canopy that hung over the street, for our building.
Existing elevation, where we, we established the, slope of the north, facing skylight based on the site line on the street.
We're, bringing the living space up to the top of the building, because the light in the building, so small minded so much, and I go around the table and see what other people think.
The view from the greater street sightline, and I also, prior to our full board meeting would like us, those who are close to confirm.
That LPC, look to lowering somewhat the, what is viewed from me, at least from the Greenwich Street.
This, I was the 1 who filed the landmark plans for the 3 buildings and J street behind.
That I think I would like you to reconsider until you saw a mockup of it and found out what the setbacks were in relation to building that relationship to the backyard, because the truth is, it's going to create a big as they go up that high all the people who have windows in light, and that backorder would depend on that.
And I think the landmarks commission should be should be aware of that, because those backyards that is unique to New York City.
You're, going to see that building from everywhere, except for across the street.
We're, also going to ask our pc to consider to work with the applicant to try to lower it, especially from the view.
Thank you very much trinity, church, Wall, Street, Application installation of 2 Digital.
Not mortified by a digital sign adjustment to the most historic graveyard in New York City.
This quickly, I did want to say that a lot of churches historically would have what are called poster boxes, which is basically what our static sign is that just had the time of worship and such, and especially in the last few years, a lot of churches and synagogues have been moving to the digital signage.
That looks more like the old church sciences we're talking about that are on the outside of the building.
In this past year, and in fact, the sign that you're seeing on the screen right, now, I, think it's a very basic.
Some of my issues, I just wanted to make sure that the elimination and the digital sign is going to be soft and not garish.
Last thing, I think the issue of illumination and the, the contextual, and the lighting should be put in our resolution.
So you're, looking at the historic photos of the art deco building the upper right shows.
The 2nd is for the South Street Seaport museum and 173,169, John Street Lot. I know that sounds a little confusing.
You care deeply about the history of the museum, the Seaport district and others.
And present our proposals, so just in summary, our proposal, we believe, provides support for the South Street Seaport Museum.
The building, we're proposing, I know, is taller than other historic buildings in the district.
It's been carefully designed from input from all of us, as well as the concept of a podium that we believe fits in with the historic street escape and the adjoining buildings.
There's going to propose a 50 m dollars would be dedicated to the museum, providing it with a secure revenue source, allowing our volunteers, volunteers.
I think you talked about a historic district earlier and the impacts.
I'm, just checking his forcing the proposal that seems going to be presenting on the 1 come to 369 John Street in South, Street, Seaport, museum.
Beware, President, South, Street, seaport, museum, chair, meltzer, chairman members of the committee.
I am here as a applicant for the proposed changes to term horn row, as well as to the proposed building on the John Street, Lot. That, 1st, phase of which would result in changes to the facade of row, a reconfiguration of galleries and the.
As soon as possible, really construction, timelines, limiting reopening of the museums galleries for the 1st, time in any material, way.
The 2nd, phase of which would represent the construction of a new building on the John Street Lot. Needless to say, the reasons that these 2 applications are being put forth at the same time is because they represent a holistic approach and because the funding necessary.
To visit context, historically, with respect to the district and its museum.
Empty site in any historic district in New, York City by 2 fold, at least.
It is a full city block with no historic structures on that block, which makes it a very unique condition in our landmark districts.
Buildings, with historic street front.
What is critical to this presentation and, and the point that we want to make in this narrative is the relationship of the museum to the district.
There are benefits to the district and benefits to the museum and we won't talk about these specifically, but we are presenting this to landmarks for context.
Again, historic legacy of transfer of rights within the district, and so our proposal is literally to transfer the unused development.
So, whereas the front door to this incredibly important institution, it's in the center of road and those historic buildings in the district.
repetitive rhythmic scale of openings and the facades of the adjacent historic buildings.
Expansion building for the Museum of Glass and metal proposal approved by LPC in 1998.
The museum currently occupies 21 individual, nearly identical, small scale galleries and on the right we have the proposed phase: 1 condition.
At, the bottom of the ground, with the entrance of the corner of Bolton and South, and the historic gallery footprint consolidated towards the east towards the water.
We're proposing, I hand, painted sign much like a historic hand painted science once we're found in the district on the brick.
That's a South, Street Seaport museum, a single banner sign at the corner.
From the historic restored buildings on the right side of your screen.
We think this will create an even more special presence for the museum, while still being.
Here is that small separation between the new building on the left and the historic building is 91 south street in particular on the right.
I think it was probably 13 different applications, including 3 for new, but we're aware that.
I, you know, for me, we're going to take public comments at the end, but the question is really for the committee.
If they have questions about the historic buildings and the new structure.
250 water street, and not certainly not the 1st proposal that LPC has reviewed and taken action.
That is thinking beyond the immediate site of 250 water.
The block was largely demolished in the period of the widening of Pearl Street and it was essentially an empty site when it was designated with the exception of parking, garage.
And so as we go down water street, you see the buildings reside between about 45500 feet.
Our 1st step is really to try to dramatically reduce the height of the street wall, to really build a podium.
That is much more appropriate to the immediate context of its neighbors, and to then think about the designing of that street bar, that contextual base, as barring clues from the dna of the block.
So the elevation across the top is the historic elevation on Water street.
The parking lot, with a building that data rooms and scale resonant with its neighbors and the scale and texture of the facades resonates with the scale and texture of the facade that we think of.
So we have put, we've divided them into 2 towers, to keep the height in context with other water street buildings to the south.
We set those towers back as far as we can on the north and south side, with the new sheds from within the district.
The expansion of the street is rooms to the outside and the ability for building on this site, to.
We have the opportunity to pedestrian eyes more formally, this strip of peck slip, which is now used as the Pexip school play area and, and also create strengthen the boundary of the district along Pearl Street.
And, and then another view, again, stepping back, further on street, looking West, we see the, the scale and texture of the exquisite facades and the district.
What we associate with the district now, as we move further east and then the continuation of the facade, and the towers set back, 40 feet, and then moving around to Pearl Street.
This idea of now completing the boundaries of the district with this contextual podium, and you see the towers relating more in scale to what you see further south on water, 199, water.
We believe to the district and to build as much depth and texture into the facade of the tower as possible, particularly with these outdoor spaces, facing the waterfront.
Maintaining low hype at the waterfront is, is paramount, and that the district has historically been seen in the context of, of taller, buildings, adjacent and beyond.
And. That will continue to be the case with our proposal on 250 water, street.
The South Street Seaport museum, galleries, unscramble horn row and the ultimate completion of the block.
Are you talking about the museum building.
Right, so the community likes their historic, seaboard.
Notwithstanding, the ability for them to build the buildings is high, is because of the air rights from the South Street seaport.
Currently there you can see the exposed historic party wall of 91, South street, and it's quite beautiful.
I take issue with that, because what makes this district historic is not just the museum, but all the residents.
A district, not just a museum thank you.
If you notice that there were these previous proposals presented to the Landmarks Preservation Commission over the last 40 years, for this site.
Okay, I'm moving to Paul gold's team, because I think, if it's not just for the record, his name was Yon. And, I and I lived through every 1 of those buildings, and I thought there were really 9 that they rejected.
What is before the Community board is whether 2,470 foot tall buildings fit in this 11 block historic district, where the advertised building is 4 to 5 stories and the zoning is limited.
The downtown alliances include the Economic Development Corporation and include the South Street Seaport museum.
Other Seaport developers have created new beautiful buildings in this historic area over these years and they do fit into the low scale district, including award winning buildings on historic front.
I think this committee and needs to make a clear statement also that we value our historic districts that appear to be under attack here and elsewhere.
And I remind the Cb. We've recommended not shrinking this district by 10%, which is what, in essence, is before you, but enlarging it to include the new market building and that's been the position of community board 1 for over a decade.
Like our historic district.
Like our historic district.
Proposal and conclusion, the job of Cp 1 is now is to continue to protect and preserve the special South Street seaport, historic district.
Just notes they just wanted, empowers LPC to delineate a historic district.
Insignificant buildings are a typical feature of any urban landscape and are that's likely to be and have been included in historic district boundaries.
Do we want to shrink the historic district.
But I know, you'd have that you have 1 from Water Street.
What does the look like from water street.
So we only had a view from water street on a block north.
What did the towers look like for when you're on water, street.
Then, what is being referred to as a historic district, turning itself into a parking lot, and that question can be, you know.
So, I was 1 of the save the museum as well as they do not build a tower at the C4 years.
I'd like to see a lot more black and or indigenous history, both at the museum and throughout the support, as well as more businesses and offers offerings.
We go straight out to the public, because I think everybody from the board has spoken, we're going to start.
The museum, whether there was some programming back and forth between the 2 project, and in terms of like, building or space.
Within the, the new, the 250 water street.
Okay, then I, I think that the preservation of a museum in a historic district, that it is the that is the seeding and press precedent, condition precedent to the whole.
And, the South Street Seaport museum, we already know has spoken.
Waterfront Alliance believes that the howard jeez corporations, proposals for the redevelopment of 215 water and John Street are worthy of proceeding through landmarks review.
This could bring, including a revitalized new market, restoration of a public market, and, most importantly, that the South Street Seaport museum receives sustainable funding and a new resilient building to fulfill its potential as a landmark steward and reopen all of horn rose uniquely preserved interior accounting house galleries, which are just as significant as the historic district.
Howard, he's corporations outreach to the local community through stakeholder, planning, workshops and commitment to making the redevelopment of 250 water part of an overall plan for the historic district.
It would be very unfortunate if the project at 250 water simply results and then, as of right development out any of the proposed improvements for the historic district.
A thoughtful design can produce new buildings that will strengthen not detract from the historic district.
We already know that the South Street Seaport museum is in support of this.
Former for volunteer for the last 25 years, and I just want to express our support for any idea to keep the museum.
If you have something that you'd like to opine on, from the land marking perspective of the construction of the buildings that are on John Street or the buildings on 250 water, please, let me know otherwise the other part about it will be involved in the alert, process.
I have been the chair or coach here of the landmarks and Preservation Committee of the Community Board for 21 years.
Work for retail, we need to make its boundaries more appealing and these parking lot sort of flights to break the historical feel of the neighborhood.
And I believe that the museum building, which will connect the imagination, playground and make it feel like, part of the district, is also very beautifully done, while saving the museum, I, as a retailer.
It creates a new future for the South Street Seaport museum vessels and collections education mission, including maritime history and the print shop 7.
I'm speaking today in opposition to development plans by this Texas based developer, Howard Hughes Corporation in historic, Seaport district, the birth place of not only New York City, but of this country.
Coalitions, community based proposal, which will protect the Seaport district, save the museum and allow us to create much needed, affordable, housing.
I've been a resident of south Street Seaport for over 20 years.
This building a 250 water, street.
The point I'm bringing out is, is that I'm not an architect, but I do think I'll add a lot of value, not just having that 1 building, but to the whole neighborhood as a whole.
You know, as the presentation to 250 water started, when we talked about textures and things like that.
I think it did start to look like glassed hours at the top of that thing.
The South Street seaport, historic district is 1 of those places.
Keep the low scale in historic nature of the district.
I do not think that's the appropriate way to handle being in a historic district.
There should not be in line with the existing historic buildings.
I think what enables us to fund the museum with 50 M dollars to start to finish the drawings and also to proceed with it is that money.
I do not think the museum has money to fund plans or anything like that.
It is correct to say that the construction of the John Street building and indeed the completion of phase 1.
I'm, testifying and support long term preservation of the South Street Seaport museum.
And I just wanted to express my support for the project that would provide financial stability for the museum and its needs.
It could set precedent and what would that mean for other historic districts.
There is not a building in the historic district, or even across the street.
I'd like to understand the height differential between the new building on John Street to the rest of the area and what the views look like around that building as well.
So I think that right, so we will show that within 2 blocks, there are other buildings over 400 feet, and we can show the heights and buildings in context Water Street.
The west, I think that's going to 2 points.
The buildings that you're referring to are outside of the historic district, correct that are similar in height.
There and what we call 100, but buildings inside the historic district.
There is no building across the street or next door, or even Caddy.
area that we have already said was fine for building as of right for towers.
Outside of historic district.
Yes, 1 block sounds over the historic district, which is 3 blocks south from your building or 4 correct.
Our commitment is to give the South Street Seaport Museum.
If you are not involved with the construction, or purchase of John Street, no, we would at that time, give up our right of 1st, refusal on the jobs to lot and transfer that right over to the museum.
We would not be involved in the development or the construction, unless the museum were to want our help in developing it, implementing it or anything like that.
You know, at the next meeting, I will leave some time for the museum to talk about that.
I. Think the current plan that we've worked with the museum, and it's is that they would like to put in Jonathan.
You should jump in here if I'm saying anything beyond, but they would like to put 40 M dollars in endowment, which would allow them to keep the doors open without having to have a new building, and then have to come back and say.
Where you are, but we're also reviewing plans for a John Street building that, if I understand correctly, is not funded.
I'm, just trying to understand about the construction aspect of the John Street building.
Allow us to reopen the museum into the historic galleries and we'll provide a forward compatible link, building.
I mean, I think that for bruce and for the committee, it's important to understand, and the public is.
It's, not the construction and the community kind of needs to understand that, because I do not think that is really clear.
Is the glass house, getting the museum back open and we opine in landmarks on that aspect for the historic building.
Have, an understanding of why we're appointing on John Street at all, but that's a question for the city.
