oh, we're ready. okay. hit the hit the button. let's start recording. sorry to recording. hey, welcome to the November presentation meeting. we have a very full. our board Chair Academy will also. make some remarks we're going to start. easily then, would you like to speak now? or later? I want, let's do it now because we've got a lot of people on if you do not mind. okay. all right. good evening. everybody welcome to Community Board. 1. before we get started, I want to make sure that everyone understands what tonight's discussions are about. this is the Landmark Committee. of Community Board 1, and when we talk about. any presentation and anything that surrounds the applicants who come to us. it is about being granted, a certificate of appropriateness by the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission. that is a very different type of a topic than many other things that we're doing. I know some of you may be here for I hope, at least for some of the 1st, 3 topics. but if you are not specifically here for the South Street seaport, historic district. please understand how this works. the policy of the landmarks preservation condition is to. affect the protection advancement for innovation. of our districts, which are like, the elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history. they safe for the historic aesthetic and cultural heritage. and they fall specific pride and the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past. and promote the use of historic districts for education, pleasure and welfare of the people, the city. it's important that everyone understands this because should this project proceed to you or any of them. that that's kind of a contract, the Community Board, we'll have public meetings that we'll discuss land issues. such as affordable housing in general, environmental concerns, and environmental impact, social equity proposed community benefits and things like that. those will all be reviewed and you will have a chance all time in the meetings when they are discussed. which will be at the landing zone Economic development meeting. the Environmental Protection Committee and quality of 1. the discussion tonight should 14 only to the items that are included in the mandate for. leads if you're on the call and you want to have an opportunity to listen and ask questions about the proposal in. regard to how it will affect the street. see for historic district, in terms of its urban design, it's architecture, it's landscape architecture. announcing the scale, the location, the materials. fantastic. but in the interest of time, we ask everyone. who was going to speak it to be between 1 and 2 minutes. board members usually will always speak 1st, members of the committee, and then the board and then we open it for the public. I apologize in advance, but I have to be very critical if speakers are going to go over the time limit. you may be subject to the mute button if you're not talking about the topics. they're not going to be addressed on the landmarks application. I ask you to submit the written testimony and come back when we are talking about those topics. so, if you have any questions. you can put it in the Q and A, and we will try and answer it. but until then we are really excited to have such robust engagement. we really appreciate everyone coming. we hope you can learn a lot from this committee because it's a fascinating topic. and with that, i'm having it back to our landmarks chair. 1St, take it away. hello again. so we're going to eventually i, I do not know why this feedback, but I'll try to. well, we'll start with the 13 word street abide the way. it's 1 of note that. I received it must have been a package for 1 of the presentations tonight. from Lucian, and for some reason, I could not get into the dropbox. I imagine. but I assume we will see it again in presentation tonight. so, we'll start with 13 Harrison Street, which is an application. proposition to an existing townhouse and Jason, I'll do this 1. so, are the applicants here or. Workflow here they are, we have 1 of them here tonight. Marcus, i'm if you're here with, can you hear us? hi, Jennifer. it's to speak. yeah, it's William. who's going to present? he should be 1 of the attendees. I do not see him on here is. he might be under bill. let me take it might be billed by a laskey. and it's B. A. L. O. Y. B. I. A. L. O. S. K. Y. he's in bill by. okay. gotcha. thank you welcome and he, he is the architect or the owner she is the architect, and he will be sharing his screen for the presentation. thank you. hello everyone thank you. i'm here. can you hear me now? I can hear you. I do not see you, but that may not be. so, do you see my screen it says Build Bio upstate? oh, i'm trying to share my screen. i'm sorry. okay so you can see the presentation. we're seeing it. yeah, Jen, you're going to have a few panelists. there you go. are we seeing this now? yes. hello everyone. thank you for your time. this evening. i'm the architect for 13 Harris Green Street Harrison Street. this is a. 1887 vintage building that was built by the holiday family as part of there. liquor enterprise, they had built 15 and 17. Person Street the 2 little ones you see to the right? 1st we are proposing a rooftop addition. a 1 story addition, plus all behind a sloping north facing artist skylight, we know which you see rendered. the building the site is outlined here and pink. it's on the south side of the street. excuse me? that's between Greenwich and Hudson. it's between, yes, that's correct. thank you. here we have more photos of this in context. i'm curious. and i, this, the only presentation that you're seeing, or do you folks have the pdf as well for you to study? unfortunately, if I did receive it, it was locked in a dropbox that I did not have an interesting. these are the images of the site that we will be showing you certainly our mockup, how it fits in the site. here are the historic photos of the building. it was originally built simply as the utilitarian loft. building very small windows of course, which are the like the aisles. i'm walking aisles for. starring things in the building in this case, it was. and, it was part of the 2 buildings that are alongside of it in their enterprise as well as 1 behind it. and hold on for a minute, the photo on the right on the screen is looking. west to Hudson is that correct? if you're on the right side. correct. okay. got it. i'm just think that's a really, really old 1 that 1. this is to give you a St scape of the street. we are, this 1 here. 52 right in the middle, the juicy. why i'm sorry? and these are precedents of previously approved root competitions by the Landmark resolution. commission for North, essentially. artist skylights as the device to add to the billing, it's been the technique for. well, over 100 years, for adding to these buildings that were being repurposed, could you go back please. sure, i'm looking for try Becca precedence and i'm not sure i've just lost the 377 which is. and now, okay, so that's the only 1 on this page. this page yes. yeah. these are all LPC approved. we tried to get recent ones. okay, for. I can see the addresses thank you. okay, so predominantly of the village, no offense, but just for clarification out of the. 12 or so precedents only 1 is in tribeca, and it's in print designated. well, let's be clear there are not a lot of federal style buildings like this, in our neighborhood. if I was doing a percentage comparison of this type of utilitarian law building that hit a federal style building, built the village, the vast majority were there a great many of them burn down the fire of 1864 in lower Manhattan, and were replaced with bigger loss since the enterprise at the time was on the works just to our last. okay, here is a rendering we are proposing really 2 things here not only the rooftop addition with this. i'm facing skylight, but we also want to restore and bring back the canopy that hung over the street, for our building. at 1 time, it went on all the buildings and the cables are still hanging. on the building, the existing cables and I know even though landmark. this is essentially a 3 d mockup of of. our building edition, plus the bulk. and there were mechanicals on top of our call. existing elevation where we, we established the, slope of the north facing skylight based on the site line on the street. so that we could keep the addition out of view. from everywhere, within reason on Harrison Street. this is our proposal, the existing and proposed prepare. I do not know if i'm going too fast for and i'm on. hold on. no, I'll go back. I appreciate your speed and usually people are slow, but. since I do not have a deck in front of me, it's, it's just necessary to work for me. happy to take the finances. so, there is a, there is a bulk head end a. little, yeah, a little skylight that opens up to the greenhouse, it opens sort of open underneath it through the stair below. okay, thanks Justin. okay. this is the rear of the building and the rear of the building. you can see how the addition shows up though. it's not really visible from anywhere. and part of our application is to take this 1 window on the 2nd floor and make 2 for 1. this is a proposal together. materials we are proposing a matching red brick to the existing building for the party walls and the rear. and I think metal panel for the okay. is the rear elevation visible from anywhere? only the neighboring buildings, it's completely trapped where we are. okay, so the rear elevation is not that. it's just to our next. that's just to our next door neighbor. correct existing section just to give some heights. this is our proposal and see us pulling the skylight back and in and talking away to charter. make it not visible to anybody and at the same time, I should point out that. been in close contact with our neighbor. at 11, Harrison Street, where there are some lot line window so that we could coordinate actually this shape. with the neighbor whose windows. that will overlook this area. we just added a lot lot. and now we can get some images of what that mock up looks like, and sit you, you can see from on the lower images you can't see it from down on the street or number 3 nearby. we have to walk really all the way over to independence class on Greenwich Street. before we begin to see just a little bit of the, the. okay show up here and as we get a little further back, you know, there's that pause in front of into independence process. it gives us a little more space. we begin to see, the Saturday addition. identify their in orange that's the autocad. you would be seeing. yeah, could you leave that for a minute? please happily. so, we're on Greenwich, correct? but not we are on granite, just actually west of. the, the new Plaza at. Goldman Sachs is that that? yeah is that correct? no, this is this is independence classic. okay. and again as plus. okay. got it got it. and this is us rendering over at all. so you can see that. we're really looking through the, the mover that we would be. that were proposing to obscure and the mechanical equipment that's on. hospitable. that's the mock up stepping further back. the previous photo had us buy this trash can now where we've stepped all the way up against the building, the independence. so you can see you're going to see at this point part of the party wall. it will separate our property from the 1 next door. area is rendered. and, these are the beginning of our details, which i'm happy to run through if that's what we'd like to see. now. but if we want to go back to our materials. the materials are masonry and then you have a. and the metal movements are aluminum colored and all right the other material details last. less glass yeah, just class. that's all right. I'll go back to the material sheet other than getting into fine grained detail. i'm happy to. start to take questions i'm going to i'm going to open it to the committee. I have 3 questions 1st of all. how many stories are being added from what we're adding 1 story reading this story here. this story exists, which story already we're adding this 1 here. and then, what is the pop up above that? that's just the bulk to get onto our onto the roof and to our mechanical but it's just. access up there to the room, so from the current. roof to the top of the bulk and how many people are being. we're adding a 20. 226, including the louver on the. okay, right bill, but there was 1 there's an existing a penthouse I want to point out on the. 5th floor, so they're, we're, we're expanding the floor, but there is existing. at 61 9 yes. at from what I can see, and correct me if i'm wrong the existing. pop up yeah, that's not visible. what? we used to call a pop up extension or greenhouse. is not visible currently from the street at all? am I correct? it's mid building, correct? yeah, but neither is this 1 from the street we have to go all the way up the street and in view carters forget it. okay. that's correct. we can I have it. I have defined opinion myself, but i'd like to on, virtual table and let me chime in. so, shall we go around Jason? i, I. I would like to say, i've tried this technique at a community board, meeting a time or to. we used to talk about how. you know, old buildings used to have like the, the landlords would do a roof. and so a lot of those, those kind of like, pitch troops that you see were done over like Bill said, 100 years. or more, some better than others, I think that they're, they're being sensitive to the sidelines of the building. they're not doing a huge like, land grab on, on building on top of this building. and to me, I do not think these guys gave them did themselves justice by saying you're adding 21 feet because it, it reads more to me. like, you're adding. a 1 story, and you're, you're making the absolute smallest bulk add above that to be able to enlarge the building. I just wanted to ask is it? so, this building was previously enlarged. on when it was a landmark, and that's why you're coming back here or, I mean, it was not my question. yeah, it was in large with that smaller bulkhead. while it was a landmark, I think that was done in the last 20 years. i'm coming back to get a little bit more correct? yes, it's changed ownership. a different owner. we're organizing the space differently. we're bringing the living space up to the top of the building, because the light in the building, so small minded so much, and I go around the table and see what other people think. you know, and if the visibility lines are true as you have represented them. I do not have a huge problem about it, but I want to hear what everybody else has to say. yes, I was just going to say the same given the visibility lines. I really do not have any issues. Megan, hi, I came in a little bit late, but what I have seen I agree. I do not have a problem with disability. Susan, well, I do not love it, but I'll go along with the committee. i, there's something about it. it's so out of context for me and relationships, everything else and to the other building next to it. and but I won't be abstract risk. how's that? good i'm with you though. I do not, you know, but I know this is not what I have to carry. my brittle stay on. all right, i'm going to well, I do not like all this. i'm going to chime in before Vierra and Vicki. you know, if it's not feasible, it's not visible, but as far as i'm concerned. the new card from independence Plaza. reminds me dangerously of the view. Carter. that we had such a difficult time with north more. so, I would like to see the mock up. and make sure that the representation is, as, you know, as presented. I still think it's too high from that view. Carter. and 1 of the 1 of 1 of the contextual representations that were shown was actually a very difficult to approve Mars edition. and it was only approved because that. particular building was a sawtooth it was much lower than the rest of the block. so, the glass extension only went as high as the rest of the block whereas this is. 26 feet out of here, then the neighbors, but. that's my you know, we should continue Vera and Vicki. i, I like how you're restoring the chorus. great and. you know, I do not, i'm not i'm not going to make any objection to this. maybe take down the both had a little bit. that's possible but i'm fine with the way the application is. and Vicky, thank you. can I just ask where the setback how high is the, you know, the, the glass set back where you start to setback how high is that? is that the height of a person? so they yes, it's yes it's just kind of a person. that's correct. I mean, what can I say i, I tend, I tend to think that this is a typical modern glass extension to an old building. you know, we've seen this before. but you are very sensitive, you know, if the setback is true. it's hard to object, but, i'm sure there is client issues budget issues. we should put some more details here. thank you. thank you Vicki did I miss anyone on the committee? because we're not sitting in. is alice on this committee? no, but i'm always, i'm always please what else contributes in our care. Alice. do you want to chime in. unit. maybe she's not here right now. you guess right? i'm so sorry, I was otherwise on a call, so forgive me, but I'll be back. i'm so sorry I can't chime in. i'm sorry thank you. from the, from the sense that i'm getting from the committee, it's the committee more or less approves of it. correct me? if i'm wrong. I would like to add that. I would like the Landmark Preservation Commission. to work with the applicant to try to lower the. the view from the greater street sightline, and I also, prior to our full board meeting would like us those who are close to confirm. the sightline as representative, it's easy for me to do. and if anyone else is nearby, i'd appreciate it if you can walk over to. so if that's acceptable and I think that's clear we can take a vote excuse me one second first we need just a little bit of time we took it down some of the netting. for inclement weather, we'd like to put it back up. so if I can just have a couple days before you go out there. so that I do not, I do not want you to think that it's not there supposed to be. 1 other question, i'm sorry, I forgot to ask you are enlarging the middle window, the Middle Bay window on the parlor floor, right? only in the back of the building, not in. yeah, they can yes. sorry, 3Rd. this window here. okay. yeah, yeah. back yes, thank you. okay. so, we're essentially approving this with the request that. that LPC look to lowering somewhat the, what is viewed from me, at least from the Greenwich Street. new card, and then we confirm the setbacks are as claim. right. so who will conduct the vote and my or is Jen. Jennifer Bruce, I will go ahead. there seems to be some of them, they attendees andrew just confirming if he wants to speak regarding this application. sorry? Andrew, yes. can you hear me? yes. yeah. i'm the neighbor and i'm on 15 harrison, so i'm the 1 most affected by this edition and the, the mock up from the back of the building. and the side of the building is enormous and it's completely out of character with the neighborhood. and additional to that, and we've gone through this, I was the 1 who filed the landmark plans for the 3 buildings and J street behind I did the work, and all the buildings in 1992, and went from storage to the building that exists now. so I know a lot about this, and 1 of the big issues that they're not dealing with is the amount of the air and the back of that and someone might say it's not about landmarks. but the back of the building is a close space. and the Landmarks Commission has been going back and forth about whether, or not the internal courtyards are landmark and the air rights, the air in those corridors is rather than rather difficult than the extent the height of this building that they're going up 26 feet is huge. 6 feet is 3 stories just so everybody knows it's not 26 feet is not like, 10 feet and they're not showing how far off my building. their building from it looks like they're building right on our common goal and they have not, they have not contacted they have not reached out to us to talk about that. the last owners with these big steel columns on the wall without filing for them or asking permission. so, there's a lot of procedural problems with this addition that have not been addressed and certainly not been addressed. and the fact that those 3 buildings are to a certain extent. pristine in relation to what they were, and where they're coming from. and this addition is just so, so grossly out of out of character with the neighborhood, and the size of the other buildings on those 3 buildings that I think I would like you to reconsider until you saw a mockup of it and found out what the setbacks were in relation to building that relationship to the backyard because the truth is, it's going to create a big as they go up that high all the people who have windows in light, and that backorder would depend on that stuff. and there's a lot of restaurants around there. so there's a lot of reasons to be worried about that. and I think the landmarks commission should be should be aware of that because those backyards that is unique to New York City. and it has been so decided by the landmark, as far as an environment is active environment as the front of the building set. thirdly, you can see that thing from independence pause and man, I do not care what he says, man, they put that mockup up. you can see that red you're going to see that building from everywhere, except for across the street and they're building a 30 foot wall next to me, which is kind of outrageous without talk with anybody. like, literally, I rely conversation and I got my 2 minutes in. i'm sorry, I got my 2 minutes. I had to talk fast. sorry? yes, Jennifer, I know how complicated this is with so many different elements on the webinar, but if you could interrupt us, like you did earlier so that when the board is making a final decision, we have the input from the community. 1St, this is insightful. I am surprised that the applicants did not have i'd like to apply for something. go ahead. 1St as it's a party wall. so, we have a party wall agreement between the 2 buildings that gives us the, they have the reviewing, right? but we have the as of right? to build on to that wall. so there will be a time when Andrew will and his architect will get to review the structural implications of this project to him. that 2006 feet is not being all added alongside his building. this is where Andrew is it 15? we are here. we are only building this portion. the bulk had does not come next to him. so, he's getting like, 16 feet I believe. it's the, 12, plus the perfect it's about. 15 feet is going to be added to the wall next to him and by code we have to be 30 feet. from our lot line to the back of the building so we are not changing 1 bit the, the alley, the property line, the air space that has been all for 100 years that has been in the back of this building that 30 foot set back. this is the new construction here not here. this is all existing. and where, where is it that you said, you consulted with the neighbor. the guy who overlooks our bill Andrew is below us so, unless he's walking up monitors building this building here to the west? yes. to the east of us on 11. Harrison? yes. so, 11 harrison at 11 Harrison Street. there are a lot line. let me see the list. the last friend, the aerial please, I know we have a long agenda and this is not. but let's see the aerial that you just put on. okay, so, and this is yeah, so this is the building then gets the impact from us, because these folks have over the years, decided to add lot line windows at their own discretion in risk to look over the neighboring property Andrew's building is below us and his properties follow us and his roof deck is at this level. and you did, you did just out of courtesy contact yesterday? I think everybody in this building and now I understand who was calling about our mockup and you contacted Andrew? no, I did. i've not contacted Andrew, because we do not have a, a visible effect to his property yet we will when we get to a structural review, you're handling the physical load on the party wall. it's a part of my allowed to speak. I mean, you could just hear the arrogance. i'm sorry. that's irrelevant. i'm sorry. it's just like it's like they're supposed to talk to me. I do not understand what i'm not going to be affected by that wall. I think that's fine, but that's not a landmark criteria. however, I do take your other comments about visibility into consideration, and i'm in i'm in the minority by feeling that the extension is too visible. yes, it's true that the glass is completely out of contact for the historic district completely. and there very few just not 1 example that was pointed out within the tribe that West historic district, all the others were either out of our district, or out of our neighborhood. so, I agree with that that's been brought up. however, if it's not visible that glass from the street, and I would have to see from Greenwich. I can't argue the point. however, I think it's too big for the view card from Greenwich, but I seem to be a rule. i'm not going to press my will. so I have my hand up. i'm sorry, Vicki, i'm not calling because I do not see the are you, are you watching the hands and so on. I am thank you. okay. so, I wanted to ask, so essentially the reason that the bulk had, it's as high as it is, is because you're really utilizing that area as a rooftop. yes, we're both using the rooftop. we, we are putting our mechanical equipment on top of the bulk and we have some solar panel criteria that we now have to comply with also. so we have to find a home for all that stuff. so, it's sitting up on top of the ball here, right? but there's a garden up there. accommodate, you know, at least 8 or 10 feet. okay, correct. okay, so let's take the boat. i'm, i've done this. yes, I see some, there's a hand up in the public area. I do not know if it's a public person wants to speak about this. can Jen just have a 2nd to check with them? sure, Jen, you do not have to do it with us on the line. if you can just reach to. Jason cast with to see if he's talking about this location and stacy. if they are not then they could, but there are questions then. does the while we're waiting for Jen and the passable speaker. does anyone want to and then I want to say something so I think just for form i'm disappointed that if the mock up is not up. because we like to ask that it stays up and I do actually also know what bill's talking about the weather and the winds up there get absolutely crazy. that's what I want to find us in a place where. we are proving something that the mock up is not still up for everybody around the neighborhood to see and love. and so, I think bill, you got to promise to put it back up and then we can, we can absolutely I will give you a notice when it's up. and then we can. and then I'll then I'll vote in favor of this visible addition that i'd like to see lowered, but i'm not going to be the guy that makes. turns the committee to say that. okay. that's what I wanted to say. thank you and also is there a canopy is during awning that you're adding to this they showed us the picture. it's huge, but that's not what I want to talk about at the moment. I agree with Jason, and i'd like to see the canopy again and I think that we have a board meeting. in 2 weeks. okay. all right. I just have to get it in perspective. can I see it can be quickly. thank you. I have an inspection. would you like it in the elevation elevation? both ways? i'd like it. it's here. it's the size of the original canopy on the historic. and do you have a section? yes, we do. well, there's this physical section in relationships with all building. and I have the detail if you'd like to see the detail. how much does it tribute into the it goes to the curb, like the original 1. I do not know how I use that sidewalk 20 feet. so, but no, it's like 10 feet. I think of a dimension down here. 10 feet yes. i'm sorry. I just found a human curiosity. is this a single family dwelling and? no, it's a 2 family dwelling. so why? this big canopy. to restore the appearance of it, that's not the appearance of it. it's not the exact, it's not what it looked like, but we're, we're bringing glass on top. the rest of that is what? it looked like the face of it. no, i'm good. i'm getting nervous about. where we were at, i'm hearing the neighbor, the mock up is down, which I understand where no section we have not seen the mock up the, regardless of the historic nature of the canopy. there's nothing else like it currently on the street and that big a canopy. on that street now all the way to the current. i, I would, I would be against, although I like the simplicity of the design. so, i, i'm against the, i'm against the canopy right now. actually, it's out of context that attend a 12 foot canopy. yes, that would allow me to put it back. this was great for the relax. yeah. so, i'm going to vote against the resolution, but, or abstained for now, until I get more information, but we can take the vote and fine. if everyone. as you voted for it. did you send you that person want to speak? that person was here for Tuesday Water Street. that is just to clarify so this resolution will be and. against this application resolution, as it was discussed, okay is for him to approve the application, but it is pending a site visit and and. we're also going to ask our pc to consider to work with the applicant to try to lower it, especially from the view. Carter along Grant. got it noted I do want to add for the committee. that's most likely. there was no storefront per se, these canopies during the butter egg days. we're essentially open. yes. can you qualify what the resolutions going to say and call the question. yes, the resolution is going to improve the application. but there will be a whereas asking LPC to try to work with the applicant to, or. lower than top extension so that it's less visible from branch. that's perfect call the question. can I remember from the floor? 2nd that? please 2nd. I'll go ahead without a roll call vote. so, Bruce Jason. yes, Mark, it's not here. Vicky? yes. Susan Abstain. Eric, Eric Yazzy. yes. Megan. Megan are here? yes. can you hear me.

I think the important thing to. to know about signage for the church, is it? it really is mission driven. it's conveying a message about. you know what the church is there for and there to do. and in this case, we're, we're seeking to legalize. 4 banners of 8 that were not that were installed without approval some years ago. and then to. seek approval for along Broadway for. 2 monitors and 2 signs a, along the fence. and I think that the gist of those last 4 items. is really to help reorganize. the signage and consolidate it along broadway. so it's just, it's it's. it's, it's less than what's there. what's been there in the past? and it's, it's intended really to organize it and be much more deferential to the architecture of the church. so, I'll take you through. these slides, so basically, what you're seeing upper left in the plan are the 2 areas where. where the signs are, and the upper right is just showing the banners allowed with trinity place. what you're seeing in the bottom 2 images is is. just the fence onto which we want to fix these 2 monitors and. to signs and you can see right now, sort of lower left. that it's sort of a mishmash in over years they've sort of, you know. kind of put signs up and again, this is an attempt to be more organized about it and try to make the signage. smaller and more differential to the church next please. this is the type of mission driven sign that basically talks about the services and. the programs as many of, you know, trinity has a wealth of. of concerts and programs and other things that the public. they want the public to know about and, you know, a lot of people actually spend time respond to these programs and spend a lot of time during the course of the day. and in the evenings. at Trinity Church next, these are previously approved signs and you can see that. there are a number of them actually, we've removed. a number of signs, some of these are plaques. go to the next please, but what we're focused on today are these 4. banners that match the existing approved banners. and they're shown lower right in the plan with a rectangle around them. next place along Broadway, there are 2 types of signs. 1 is a standard frame sign that links the entry gate into the church and describes the worships services. and the other flanking those 2 in front of the church are 2 monitors digital signs that again, speak to the programming and. activities that are going on at trinity church. next place, so, this shows what these signs will look like in context on the left, you're seeing the standard frame sites sign that, that links the entry and then. and then further up and down. broadway closer to sort of in front of the, the north and south entry vested bills are, are these monitors. next place, and this is just an elevation showing the size of these relative to the fence. and the scale of the church, and so just to go if you go back, just to be clear right now. or, over time, there have been other signs that have been put up. and this is this is an attempt to really consolidate all of this signage. you know, we're actually able to eliminate quite a bit of. other information signage by using the digital displays, which, which actually scroll through. different kinds of kinds of messages. during the day next, please. this is a mounting detail basically, just showing that we're holding off from the existing historic fence. and we're attaching to that fence using ties and not. not bolting into it. next place, and this is for the previous was for the monitor and this is for the actual. static sign next place and this shows, it's kind of a real trick to wire the monitors, but we're doing our best to to. take all of that conduit underneath existing paving. and then trying to in a very discrete way, bring the conduit up and wire the, the monitor. next place, this shows the frame for the static sign, which is basically just powder coated aluminum and then this is the same. for the monitor, it's just black patter coat. and it matches the fence and that's it. Bass may answer any questions. for you. okay, so i'm going to jump right in and say. that I find it, totally fine. of course, you should have some signage and I do not think that it. in relative to the perimeter of your property is. so, out of control, and it sounds like everything is reversible. so we will put that in the, in the resolution. and so I do not have a problem and so next committee member. it's bruce, I'll chime in. I actually like the banners. i'm in trinity place. but i'm mortified at the, i, maybe that's the wrong word for a church. so, let me find another 1 discern. not mortified by a digital sign adjustment to the most historic graveyard in New York City. so, i'm against the digital side as I am in general on street front levels that are not retail. so, I want to vote for the static signage. I will vote against the digital side for the Senator. can you put up the digital sign information again? Sir. yeah yeah, Katherine can you while we're talking about it and then whoever wants to go next about the 2 issues. well, I'll go and 60 camera we have the digital. sorry that's what Jason asked for. right. Jason, and I donuts there you go for it. okay, thank you. the banners on the backup say every, like, the, the shadows and the whole image sort of work for me. I have to say that, as you were speaking, Jeff, i've heard your presentations before and I think you guys do terrific work and. it's, it was sort of unfortunate that we have to have signs as a colleague of mine just said well, people do not go to church enough so maybe we need signed but, you know, I can't imagine St Peters putting have signs, especially light boxes. so, i'm sorry that we have to do that in our country. and, I can see why Bruce has this adverse reaction. because when you walk on Broadway and you look through the fencing and there's your church sitting there and that incredible space around that, whether it's. baby to the grass, i'm sorry that we have. embrace more. we'd like to speak. go ahead. sorry. hi, it's pat. I also, i'm not on the committee, but I. joined you tonight and this is I feel it's unfortunate also to have a digital sign in front of the church number 1. how slowly does it scroll through each item when people read slowly and if they mess it, they have to stand there and wait. x amount of time for it to get back to the. item that they're interested in and, I mean, I kind of I like the bad and I like the signs. so that's just me, but how wants to take to scroll through the entire. information that would be on the digital. like, this is more yes, it is. I know. I do not know. I do not know what the answer to that. the idea would not be for it to be this sort of. you know, kind of like a video I think the idea is to. they have a lot of information to convey. they've got so much stuff going on and. and I think what we struggled with this, and i, you know, I know you all love this church as much as we all do. and I think we saw this, we saw the monitor as really a way to minimize the clutter. you know, I think I think they would have come to with this application. yeah, if you look at if you look at this. you know, with an ask for. 8 more signs, because they've got so much information to convey and. and in having the monitor, it's a way of really getting rid of, you know. 6 or 8 other signs. by just being able to scroll and have that information and. you know, I think I think that was that was the, the extension, the calculus here that you could have this monitor, we could eliminate all the other signs that we need. I do understand it, but I know if I need to come back to us. so just let us know how quickly it scrolls through this information. i'd be interested. Patrick, did you have something to Tan. yes, this quickly, I did want to say that a lot of churches historically would have what are called poster boxes, which is basically what our static sign is that just had the time of worship and such and especially in the last few years a lot of churches and synagogues have been moving to the digital signage just at the last LPC meeting. there was 2 synagogues on the Upper East side. so, I think it's, it's just a way, I think, as you sort of indicated before to get more bodies in the space and to make sure it's just more engaging. so, this is a trend we're seeing throughout the city as well for context. and we, we installed at St Patrick's cathedral we install, monitors that actually are in the but. this is a different kind of animal because we're, we're basically trying to tell. tell people workers from the neighborhood. hey, there's a. there's a lunchtime concert today or there there's a, this is, this is. what these are the plans for Christmas holidays and so forth so. so, again, it's so the monitor is really an attempt to. actually eliminates signs. and not and not have them proliferate. like, you see in this image on the right. Bruce Tammy would like to speak. she has her hand up. I can not see the hand. so, Jen, Jennifer, if there's someone with the hand up on the committee, please just follow on them. okay, so Tammy go ahead. hi, so I. just, I do not in general, I am supportive of this if it cuts down on the clutter and provides an opportunity for people to be able to see. I received the church and things like that, and sometimes a little bit less signage make people look a little harder. what is really important to me is kind of what he's been alluded to. in terms of what the sign. the content is the content is the content that trinity me, but. how the content was presented really would make a difference between something that looks like a disco sign and something that's really relevant. that looks more like the old church sciences we're talking about that are on the outside of the building. so, my question is whether or not there is a place in here that we can. have a guarantee that it's not flashy. that it's contextual to the style of the church. everything that happens. that's the branding. of the church is consistent with the electronics. and so it does not become another electronic sign that you'd see anywhere that feels very contextual as if it was. if you walked by, you would not know. necessarily when we looked at it, but it was a digital sign. it looks like it's appropriate with the branding and the lettering and the. and the colors that we are used yes. I think that's a great point. I think the, you may, you may be aware that, that there's a new lighting scheme for the church. and the idea is that i'm at night. basically, we, the architecture is high highlighted and some of the. the monuments inside the yard are highlighted and I think it really. you know, it really does justice to the architecture of the building. and the whole idea of this monitor is not to have. some times Square, like a flashing thing that calls us attention to itself. and I think the idea would be to even. we have the ability to sort of control the, the intensity of the light as well. so I. you know, I do not actually have the, the programmed signs to show you, but I can, I can, I can promise you that they're going to be nice signs. there's a whole graphic standard that trinity's employed since. in this past year, and in fact, the sign that you're seeing on the screen right now, I think it's a very basic. I think Helvetica. Type and they actually have really good graphics that trinity so I do not think this is going to be something that's garish that you're you see and you're just appalled when you see it. I think it's going to be. you know, tastefully done signage and. can I also get 1 follow up to that? Bruce? yes, this is I just want to. confirm this is not intended for. we'll never be used for. advertising for any organization or anything that is outside of what trinity church. right, no, no I do not want I do not want to walk by and see Amazon and Google Ads. you know, this is stuff like, you know, we're giving out bag lunches at noon on the South terrace. this is, you know, we have a. you know, it might, it basically is there to advertise the multitude of programs that trinity church has and where to go to, to access them. when is your here? I think now it's in December. Catherine. can you confirm that? sorry, I did not hear that last bit. Mr. Herman asked when the hearing was the LPC here yes, it'll be December 8, so it will be for our next meeting. I am tempted to ask you to hold it over so we can see the dissolve rate of the sign because you do not seem to know what it is. it also seems that we won't get a chance to hold it. all right unless you hold it over another month. where else we see. I will say that LPC tends to approve. trinity applications, because it's almost like asking Columbia University to move to. oddly, otherwise. but while we're while any of the other board members might want to speak, could you just hold up and leave the actual sign and the proposed sign in relationship to the. well, the elevation on elevation yeah, catherine where the graveyard is. yeah. here you go. no, it was the, it was almost like a snow. it was an actual 1. yes. there I do want to point out in regards to the digital sign. that perhaps the most, historically, the art in New York City, outside of the portuguese jewish. graveyard in the teens. is right there after the game so, to me, the issue is not the quantity of temporary sign that you currently have, but the permanence of the digital side always and forever on, you can remove. you can remove temporal signs. you can't remove this unless you remove the entire armature. so, that's my point. but other people should speak quickly. we have a few more other people to speak. I'll call on Elizabeth Samir, followed by Susan Cole as well, as a member of the community by the name of Tom Spec. whenever you're ready. I guess thank you. and tammy address, some of my issues, I just wanted to make sure that the elimination and the digital sign is going to be soft and not garish obviously the content as well and the slower moving images, obviously better. when is the lighting scheme? I did read about that the highlighting the architecture and the monuments and Alexander Hamilton Scrape hopefully, and the light, because it is very dark on Broadway down there. so for 1 or 2, that. yes, if you actually, we just got we just I have not seen it myself in person, but I just got pictures of it and they just they just put it on. so it should it should actually be right now and. what's so neat about it? was that the old the old. Lighting just lit the tower so you, you almost had no sense that there was a church behind that tower. and what's right about what's happening now is they're lighting the yeah. there you go. the nave elements, the buses, and then a couple of the monuments. I forget who that is Katherine. who is that? we've got a judge, but I do not remember which 1 this came before us and I think it was approved by LPC the lighting and the new, the new. last class window on the front, but all the more reason, this looks so elegant to make sure that the digital signage is contextual with this and keeps that same. think we have another, we have another application and then the big 1 so I just have my turn quickly. no, I want the board to go around. yes. Bob, I to have some trouble, but I think, as Tammy said, if we and Liz and everybody, if we keep the elimination controlled and that, it is not going to be a signage for anything, but church stuff. I do not love it, but I will support it. and I think 1, last thing, I think the issue of illumination and the, the contextual, and the lighting should be put in our resolution Jason in some way, that's all. Megan. yeah. are you you're saying that this time is going to consolidate all the signs along the fences that go along with? and I do also think the resolution. should know that it should not be used advertisement or for any sort of sale of that. stay on that on the. no worries and slowly. that's. hello Vicky Tom can you hear us? I can I can I you said, i'm a member of the community. i'm also a member of the Community Board. so I do not know if i'm on the right side of the fence here, but. of whatever the digital fencing exists but. so, i'm looking at the sign in, you know, i, I think I echo everyone else's. concerns that it'd be really contextual and maybe even. you know, i, i'm not sure how you keep it from getting evangelized cause it looks like it's, it's sort of high technology. and, and then I had a question, which is, is it interactive or is it a. or is it not interactive? it just runs on its own periodic cycle. I do not think gets Interactive Katherine, do you know differently? is it? yeah, it is not interactive. okay. all right. okay. yeah that was my major question if you're asking people to scroll or touch things in code that I was concerned about that. so. and, and that's my only yeah, that was my only edition here. so, I guess if correct me, if i'm wrong is Vera, the only 1 on the committee, who has not spoken. do you have any comments. yeah, I just I mean, i, I agree with what everyone has said I just wanted to know Jeffrey, is there a reason why you need to have 2 of these digital displays? what was the reason for that? I think the idea was that you would. you know, it, it's. such a, intense, you know, when New York is in full swing I mean, believe me, you, would not you if you took a picture of the fence, you would not even see the fence because there's so many people in front of trinity church, and so many people now. and now with the security, in that front vestibule, people are queuing out the front of the building. so, I think the feeling was that just to get visibility, they needed this many signs. 1st, can we move along just for timing purposes? Jason is Jason is this piece okay. yeah, so if that we've heard from all the board members, and there's no 1 else in the public, it wants to speak on it. it sounds like we're okay with there's more of us okay with the digital signs than not. and if that's the case, i'm going to write a resolution in favor of the approval. all the question. okay, someone 2nd. I2Nd Vicky. no, Jason yes. Mark, no. yes. season. Eric's not here Elizabeth? yes. and again, Megan. yes, Clara Stain. child here Roger's not here. okay, and this resolution process. okay, thank you. 271 church replacing install appointment with a store from a new. okay. the brackets and I'll do that. Jason. so, Bruce, are you planning on me? doing 250. 250 is not going to get a resolution time. okay. great. so yeah, that's fine. great. we have that work for she's 71 church street. whenever you're ready. and who was the presenter toxic word? doing our todd's week. are you? okay thanks. hi, everyone, thank you for having me tonight on Todd's regard. and i'd like to know if you can see my screen on. on yours, I see you. the Presenter rolls over to you. 1 moment. how's my volume by the way? okay. so, I am the architect for the representing the applicant, who is the owner of the commercial space at 271 church. also known as 90 franklin. are you seeing my screen yet? no, okay. the, the application before you was a request to replace the windows in 1 of the base of the round floor on Franklin Street, and to. install I actually only a partial removal of the windows. well, no, the decorative village, and replace that with, 2 side lights in the door. Jennifer, can you work with Todd to get a screen share? so we can see what he's talking about. yeah, Presenter role. can you see the shares share Tab on the top of your screen? oh, i'm sorry, i, this is why I wanted to speak to you before. we got on because i'm a little bit of a dinosaur here, so. oh, do I have to show something out if anything I can share my screen. Jen, and in earnest for time, can you help him out either share it if you have the presentation. I think it's working. can let me know when you can see my screen. okay. okay, great. so, in the upper right hand corner, you can see the floor plan of the and can you see my cursor when I move it? yes, we're seeing a bullet point presentation right now. okay. i'm sharing my screen so I'll move along the presentation with you. you can just direct me along the way. so, you can see the Red Circle area. this is the, the, that we do not we do not see that. we only see a printing. can you try another slide now and see if it's to where he is talking. okay, continue please. okay, so are you looking at the floor plan on the upper right? in a photograph? yes the corner will up. good. so you can see the Red circled area, which is the. they that we are proposing to change from a window into an entrance on Franklin Street at the center of the building. the reason for the request is because the ground floor of this. building, which used to be a bank now, has been divided into 3 separate tenant spaces and all 3 of these spaces currently enter from a single door. on church Street at the center i, i'm not sure if you see my cursor moving around, but so there's a very small vestibule that you enter off of a single door and then each tenant goes into their space from there and it is congested. and does not really work very well. so, we're suggesting that we can change this window into a doorway. and then the, the most land locked tenant. we'll have direct access from Franklin Street and more visibility, which he's lacking and in the lower right hand corner, you can see the red circle around that particular window. thank you, let's go to the next screen an image. and then the other thing was mentioned that we previously have approval. are you, is it on me to click? can you now see the historic photos? yes. okay. so you're looking at the historic photos of the art deco building the upper right shows. the Franklin Street side. you can see that there is a symmetrical treatment on, on both facades with ornamental work, highlighting, highlighting the central Bay. and that also happens on Franklin Street, which is why. we believe that this particular window, it only happened that way is a natural through the only natural place for a new entrance. because you have the ornamental burke work above, and the 2 blank panels on each side, separating that from other windows that are just repetitive windows. so, this is the special bay and it's very similar to the entrance on the front. so we're proposing so, let me go to the next. here you can see a side by side in the, in the middle is the entrance on church. of course, it's more ornamental, which is fine and then you have a slightly simplified version of that on. Franklin, and where we'd like to make the door. I thought the door is right on frankly. so you're proposing the door where the post the advertising poster is that yes, that okay mentioned the woman? yes. okay. so, i'm now taking you through the elevation drawings, you're seeing the side view of the brackets sign. it's the same sign that was approved. it's the, it's the compliant dimension and it would go. to the right of the new entrance as it as it should. see, that bracket proposal all I see is the sign and the. the current entrance. okay. well, there here's here is where it was before. yeah, it was never installed. there was approved here and now we're moving it. 2 here. well, unfortunately, I do not see your cursor, but what can you do okay on the right of the lower image. okay, and the circle above on the upper image where there's no brackets on what is the, why are you showing us that? because we're required to show existing and propose okay yes. each in each image. so, I want to explain what we want to do the changes we're making, which are simplified, or too there's a granite base, which we would be cutting. and we would be reusing that stone to create the return pieces on the corners. as it goes back to the facade, to the to the store fun. above, which is very important, is the decorative bronze privilege that we're proposing to keep. and only i'm filling in from there down with new bronze, anodizer, aluminum store front in the narrowest profile possible, which is inch and 3 quarter, commercially extreme. please. and then a single yeah, let me we're not we're not in sync with the narration. so okay. so do you have the larger elevation side by side existing on the left and. proposed on the right now what we have now is above. okay, i'm Jennifer will have to speak to each other to coordinate these now because okay, Jennifer can I have sheet 8? please we have it in front of us. okay, so on the left, you can see hatch the granite stone that would be cut and removed and saved. to recreate the new corner pete returns that you can see on the right. they taught the decorative village above you can see is retained. and then below that, we would have 5 fixed panels of last and 1. 36 inch wide door, just an hour store allowed by code at the center. it would swing out and by Code Jennifer, if you can go to the. plan view. i'm sorry, where is the plan. oh, it's right there you just below the elevation. i'm sorry you can see the door has to swing out and by cody can only. swing 18 inches on to the sidewalk so we have to recess. the new store front about 6 inches further than it currently is. and which is fine, I do not think that can be done quite easily. there's a, there's a small amount of the sidewalk is on a slope. so we have we have about a foot and a half to work with to re, level. and up to the storefront, which we can do transitioning from slope to level and not exceed the Handicap code. so that works as well and, that's pretty much it. if we go to the, the details are showing you the. the aluminum commercial, Aluminum star front, which would be in a matching bronze, finishing the narrow profile. and then the last image is the before, and after the window. and then on the right lower, right? you can see next to the that's awesome. Todd, can you give me a favor and call the page that you're talking about? okay. issue 11. thank you. that would be most helpful. and Tom, do you have a head on a rendering. on each, not diagonal like this, not going from West to east, but rather head on. we have, no. we do not okay. that's my only rendering. thank you very much and I appreciate the fact that you are saving your proposal saves the beautiful. I am work, i'm sorry that you're eliminating. the lower and it looks to me like the. molly, and let's call it molly and mountain detail and for lack of a better word. is being simplified, but this is what I want to say, and I'll go to the board. this, this building means a lot to me that was the original corn exchange headquarters. it's an art deco masterpiece designed by. Cross and cross the chair of this committee from whom I learned how to chair this committee. Great late architect John. who was the architect converting this building for the sponsor? from the corn exchange bank to a residential condominium, even though he was in the employ of the developer, he would not even allow. assign a temporary sign to be installed that would put Screw holes. tiny screw holes in the granite to temporarily support the sign. so an elaborate system had to be rigged up to allow the giant temporary sign to the attached by ties from within the building. I did say that. I purchased when the interior, which is not designated was being. somewhat demolished, although the lobby is still pretty much in tack. I purchased. Crossing cross his chandelier which hung in the lobby. so, this building is fantastic. it's freestanding above the 7th floor and while I think this is an extremely respectable job. I have trepidation about cutting away the ground. it. but when we could not even put screw holes for a temporary sign, i'm done. could we have the proposed elevation and existing elevation back up? yeah, it, Jennifer, I'll tell you what sheet that would be. the, the large scale, or the seeing more of the building. I do not know, I do not know. we'll see. go to 7 please. yeah, are you seeing that. not back yeah, that's it. yeah, this one's good. thank you. okay, i'm happy to answer. any questions so I'll start. 1St, i'm sorry. I know I was paying attention, but. so, the volumes you're using are as thin as possible to match the existing, right? yes, I have to say, you did a very nice job and i'm glad you're keeping like, if this, as Bruce says this has to happen. if you can keep as much, if you're not absolutely reproduce. the existing vertical and horizontal readings and details. they stick to as much as possible, some retail store, you know, who may, or may not be here. 20 years down the road should not. gauche a building up this, stature. I have to say, are you, sir? i'm good. architect and I appreciate this proposal. thank you, Bruce, I see some hands raised, but even for a while, i'm doing soon pass application more or Susan. cool. do you wish to speak. I take my hand down. okay. I do not see anyone to have their hands up. double check in once more and bruce, if you want to call a question. you're muted. sorry, although we have not really heard from a committee members. i'm going to. assume that this is a. this is an approval i'm going to say that because it involves because this building is so intact and because he was so extremely strict. in the conversion, whereby even an entrance store could not be moved and because. a substantial chunk of original. fabric is being moved, i'm going to have to vote against it and I do not know why this is the 1st time. i've. voted against the will of the committee on every application in memory i'm going to have to vote against it. even though I appreciate the detail work above the granite that's being. call the call i'm actually I wanted to just ask a question the fabric that's being removed the metal window. that's not original. correct? the window parts are not original. the window the windows are original yes. oh. and the granite is the ground and the granite so those are actually the original windows, the original windows. okay so i'm against i'm against the smooth too. I would not even write a resolution in favor of it, but i'm against it as well. I want to spin this to. okay, so i'm sorry, I just did not hear from the committee so I changed the resolution to her rejection. I do not know how to. I do not know how to parse this. I respect what has been done, but I can't suggest nor is that. place to suggest what can be done. alternatively, under the circumstance. I agree. i'm with you to bruce Elizabeth. so this is then a resolution to reject the proposal. for the reasons discussed got it okay can someone a I'll call the question someone second. thank you yes. to the rejection. Jason, yes, to the rejection. Mark? yes, Susan. Eric's not here Elizabeth? yes. Megan, yes, not here. okay, so this resolution passes to reject the application. thank you, thank you very much. so now we're moving on to 250, 50 water and i, i'm going to describe the way we're going to handle it. we're going to hear the presentation limited to. it's relation to landmark preservation. we're going to go around the table and get an opinion or a comment from the committee and then Tammy will take over and field whatever other. questions or comments or out there is that correct? I mean. and yep, networks, 1 of the things I do want to point out, this is a double application. so this is 2 applications. 1 is for 250 water straight. the 2nd is for the South Street Seaport museum and 173,169, John Street Lot. and so they are separate applications being filed together. I know that sounds a little confusing. but they will present again. we will recognize members of the public, but we are not voting as a committee tonight. our goal is to ask all the questions that you have, and any questions that you need. it can certainly be discussed, but it's going to be the senior members of the public. specific, contextually to what LPC reviews again. this is not about. to get the remediation this is not about affordable housing. this is not about. many land use things. this is about the contextual appropriateness as landmarks. is it. and with that, 1st, I think we're going to introduce the team who is presenting tonight. who needs control. for our presentation is that Mark or Adam Hooper? please that Chris. okay. caught it passing Presenter rules to him right now? okay, so we're going to welcome Chris Cooper and Frank. i'm sorry if I put your names from as well as. and then after work, I believe it's Jonathan full work and Brendan from the museum. just so Tammy, you have the roster because right? so I do not have to. review that right? yeah. it starts with soft. good evening thank you, Bruce thank you. Tammy. and thanks to Community Board 1, and the. Landmarks Committee for making time this evening to meet with us. about this project as most, if not all of, you know, i'm sure our president and how we use corporation. for the Tri state region here in New York, as, you know, I came into this role after. abandoned, it's project to build on the waterfront site. that clearly, we know it's not well received by the local community. it was clear to me when I joined that we had a lot of work to do ahead of us as an organization. to rebuild the trust and to make sure that our projects. benefited in the future from input from our neighbors in, as well as the expertise. and then we can learn from community groups so. I personally over the time have committed. to engage in with our community and I believe a transparent. forthright manner for the past 5 years. it's what i've been doing and i, and i've charged our team to do. and I hope that i've done each and every day since joining. so together this evening, with our planners that we've developed, what we think is neat. think is a collaborative community planning process. in our proposal has been significantly shaped by many of the ideas concepts comments. thoughts that we received for neighbors, community members, and those that took place in some of the. workshops and met you care deeply about the history of the museum, the Seaport district and others. and as I discussed in the 3rd workshop, which was literally, I think, the day before the city went in a lockdown. the last workshop we would come back and to the community board in the fall. and present our proposals, so just in summary, our proposal, we believe provides support for the South Street Seaport Museum. which has been since 19, 767, a significant, significant cultural anchor in this community and the heart of the historic district. and it's what makes this a historic district in my opinion. while the building we're proposing, I know is taller than other historic buildings in the district. it's been carefully designed from input from all of us as well as the concept of a podium that we believe fits in with the historic street escape and the adjoining buildings. and you'll see. and it's, you know, it's base is appropriate. we have given the historic. condition in edge condition of the block. well, that sounds good. let's get to it. we're all excited to see it. i'm going to finish up, just give me 3rd, so, and then i'm going to introduce Jonathan so, through the proposal, there's going to propose a 50 m dollars would be dedicated to the museum, providing it with a secure revenue source, allowing our volunteers volunteers. i'm going to ask you and, you know, we get from many different contexts, ask you to please put aside the pr factor and show the landmark is perceptive because there's no fear factor here. I was asked to present what we're going to present to the landmarks. that's what I want to see. yes and that's and this is why we're going to introduce it. so I thought I would do the same here, but if you're funding the museum has to do with the landmarks and preservation committee. I think it has to do with the overall social aspects. I think you talked about a historic district earlier and the impacts. of the historic community, and I think that there are people. that i'm not suggesting we go into it in detail, but an overview I think is appropriate. i'm not suggesting details. i'm just giving the overview of where we are today. so our proposal looks at the district, I believe. holistically combining a plan and i'm going to hand it over at this point. point to captain where to provide some insight into his portion of the proposal. i'm just checking his forcing the proposal that seems going to be presenting on the 1 come to 369 John Street in South Street Seaport museum, correct? yeah. well, that's what that's his application correct right so, he's presenting the slides for. the look and the no would be presenting that. the architect, why do not we start with the architects and start with the communication? and it's and it's full. I mean, I know Jonathan would like to speak as the owner's Rep for those spaces. but we want to get some of the presentation as quick as we can please. so, Jonathan, it could be short Jonathan. yep, I am. now, unmuted, thank you, Jonathan. Beware, President, South Street, seaport, museum, chair, meltzer, chairman members of the committee. thank you for the opportunity to speak. I am here as a applicant for the proposed changes to term horn row as well as to the proposed building on the John Street Lot. this represents a 2 phase plan that has been designed by and Meryl. that 1st, phase of which would result in changes to the facade of row, a reconfiguration of galleries and the. as soon as possible, really construction timelines, limiting reopening of the museums galleries for the 1st, time in any material way. since Hurricane Sandy. the 2nd, phase of which would represent the construction of a new building on the John Street Lot. now, needless to say, the reasons that these 2 applications are being put forth at the same time is because they represent a holistic approach and because the funding necessary. to perform phase 1 and move toward phase. 2 is dependent on the other applicants project, moving forward. I think it is worthwhile taking just a moment. to visit context historically, with respect to the district and its museum. and the intended symbiosis between. the museums roll as interpreter and programmer. elevator of the district and the general broader districts. obligation as it was conceived to provide support for the museum those of you who've been around for a long time know that has never been realized. the proposal before you this evening seeks to do exactly that. and with that, I will turn over to the presenters and i, thank you for this opportunity to speak before you. thank you very much Jonathan and welcome to the team from Nasa and. great thank you very much. and again, I also appreciate this opportunity. my name's Chris Cooper. I am an architect from i'm joined by my colleague Frank, my hand will also be presenting tonight and we have made our application. submission to LPC and along with that, our presentation has been submitted to LPC and what we intend to share tonight is essentially that presentation. we have taken a few slides out just for the sake of some gravity, but you will see many new images. some of you have seen some images in the public but there is a great deal of material here. a great deal of new material here. it will be shared for the 1st time. we have just a preview we have about 120 slides to share with you tonight and so we thought. we would just get started and jump right in. and, and but it is essentially the presentation as submitted to LPC with a few details removed just for gravity. so, we're here tonight to talk about 2 sites as just described. 250 Water Street and the Johns Street and. 2 open sites today. both are parking lots today. so, John Street lot empty for decades and 250 Water street. open essentially, to the sky essentially, since the district was designated. and we. but both of them also share the fact that they are neither contributing to the context. and the, and the, the fabric of the district. so, we share we show them today in their connection, because we think that there are a unique. set of circumstances that provide us a very unique opportunity by considering them together. and 1st, there is the museum, the museum that was chartered before there was a historic district museum that was chartered with the expressed mission of preserving the district. and of interpreting and educating the public on the history of that district. i'm going to interrupt you for 1 minute. you said there are 100 something slides so I imagine it's a 40 to 45 minute presentation. there are 8 or 9 can the board members and interactive. public who want to speak i'm going to ask you to decouple. the economic portion of this presentation from the architecture. we have heard the coupling of the museum and its funding in relation to rouse and you for a quarter of a century now so let's just see the architecture. okay. okay, so do you want to see the, the, the presentation that we're sharing with landmarks? yes, but okay, so this pursuant to pursue until what bruce was saying with some remedy. on that are not yeah. I respect that and I understood and so we, we had anticipated that you would want to hear exactly the same narrative that has been discussed and is being shared with landmarks and. and so, to that point, I will speak about the 1st part briefly unique circumstances 1St Museum Foreign before the district. secondly, the district, which is uniquely overlaid with a transferred district and, and has a history of. the development of tall buildings in the spirit of preservation. and very specifically, we have 250 water street, which is the largest. empty site in any historic district in New York City by 2 fold, at least. and so it has and it has been vacant. for since the district was designated in 77. and it is a full city block with no historic structures on that block, which makes it a very unique condition in our landmark districts. and the unique opportunity briefly is that there is the opportunity for private development to support the museum. and to better the entire districts. so, we were going to speak about this in 3 chapters the 1st chapter. I will keep brief, which is the evolution of the museum as relevant to this. specific site, and this specific proposal the 2nd chapter is very specifically our vision for the New museum. and the 3rd chapter is very specifically our proposal for. development on 250 water street, so. as we just heard the museum chartered in 1967 with the. specific purpose of preserving the district. and to that point, it developed a master plan. a master plan is the page from that master plan that conceived of a museum as a campus, not a museum as a specific building but a campus that included the historic ships. included printing included artifacts. and that is very much how the museum exist today. and that master plan also envisioned. the preservation of low density on the waterfront. with an active waterfront with historic ships. and it envisioned the transfer of development rights to the perimeter of the district. to benefit the district, it was the inception of the museum, this concept and also formally, it was the conception that. the context would be and the development would be low. buildings with historic street front. that face the district and set back towers above. and even in the master plan, there was the proposal for 250 water. which also demonstrates high a tall architecture in the spirit of preserving the core. of the district as a pedestrian district around Fulton Street, and on the waterfront. and that concept was formalized by the city in 72. with the creation of the transfer district, the C port transfer district, and that Seaport transfer district was created in 72 looks very much the same today as a series of granting and receiving sites. and marked in a red, you see some of the buildings, the tall buildings that have been built within that district. from the transfer of development rights from the low. entity of the core of the district and also here is an article from the New York Times. that demonstrates that the 1st transfer was with direct benefit to the museum to the beginning of the history. and this was the 1st time that there was direct benefit. and the last. so, half a century ago, if I may just interject, if a century ago, Carter harshly was still writing about. transfer rights and generation to save the museum. correct? that was 50 years ago. just. noting thank you. and. we know that since that transfer there have been and in the last 2 decades, there have been a number of financial blows to the museum. and the important 1 for this conversation, let's say, is that in 2012 with the flooding of superstorm Sandy. the museum closed its galleries and has not been able to reopen the galleries. and so that becomes relevant as we talk about the John Street Lot. and the, the, the transformation of the museum that we are proposing. and the museum is not just 1 building, it's not just the galleries on Grammar horn row as we all know it is also the historic ships bound printers. it still exists as a campus as it was originally conceived. but what is critical to this presentation and, and the point that we want to make in this narrative is the relationship of the museum to the district. that the museum defines the district, and there is a symbiotic relationship between the district. and the museum, and so when we talk about the 2 sites together, it is, it is about completing the district and improving the broader district. and so our proposal is to instill 2 empty sites. complete the grain and structure of the of the district. and to do that in a way, that is completely in line with the historic legacy of. the district and of the side itself, and that is originally envisioned by the museum in its own master plan. and there are benefits to the district and benefits to the museum and we won't talk about these specifically, but we are presenting this to landmarks for context. in that there are benefits beyond just the museum. including affordable housing and that, but the main marks, i'm sorry say that. affordable housing is not in their purview and is not part of the landmarks application in terms of what they find. so. that part we definitely do not have to talk about. thank you. great. so I'll move quickly past that and and, and only make the point that all of this and based on. again, historic legacy of transfer of rights within the district and so our proposal is literally to transfer the unused development rights. which exists on the waterfront to maintain low development on the waterfront and because there is low development at peer 17 and 10 building, there is available rights and transferring those to. 250 water street and that is what unlocks the value for thinking about the district comprehensively. so, with that, we will jump in very quickly to the 2 chapters about the specific architecture of our proposals. and I'll pass this over to Frank to speak about museum. so we just heard about how the museum really is a campus completely integrated throughout the entire district. so, whereas the front door to this incredibly important institution, it's in the center of road and those historic buildings in the district. but, in fact, it's also flaked by retail, shouting for your attention and the museum has suffered for identity because of that ever sentence. and you can see they've tried to rectify that issue with. a huge flagpole and with a canopy and various types of way finding elements. and so, 1st, principle of this proposal is to move their entrance from its mid block location on Fulton Street to the corner of South Street and Fulton. much more prominent, much more appropriate for them closer to the water and to complete the block. with a new building at the currently empty John Street lot next. for that new building, we are applying a series of architectural principals, and I will describe these in more detail. we are 1st. pulling that new contemporary building, respectful distance away from the historic buildings immediately to its north, creating a bit of separation next. we're matching the massing of the entire block by matching the chorus line of the adjacent buildings next. we are sitting in the mass of the building on top of a distinctive storefront much like we find. in other Jason historic properties, and we are, and we are creating a sympathetic relationship with the. repetitive rhythmic scale of openings and the facades of the adjacent historic buildings. it's important context perhaps to. identify and recognize that the museum has long contemplated. an expansion onto the Johns Street lot there's a lot of good, solid, logical reasons to do. so, and that history includes and improved. expansion building for the Museum of Glass and metal proposal approved by LPC in 1998. next that approval included a phased approach. so the 1st, phase of that was a kind of circulation component. that accommodated stairs and elevators and so forth. that particular proposal was scaled back a couple of years after its initial proposal. and is the source of the contemporary insertion that we see. comedy set that vertical circulation at the rear corner, the northwestern corner of the empty street lot. and we too are proposing it phased approach for the museum's expansion and revitalization. and we are doing that in order to open the museum as soon as possible it's galleries have not been open any meaningful way since 2012. so there are significant, mechanical, infrastructural, like, safety work that we aim to do as quickly as possible. and we will take the opportunity to move the entrance to the more prominent corner. as well, as consolidate the historic gallery footprint of the museum towards the water, towards the East. so, on the left side, we have the existing plans, the ground floor on the bottom typical upper gallery floor plan. the museum currently occupies 21 individual, nearly identical, small scale galleries and on the right we have the proposed phase 1 condition. at the bottom of the ground with the entrance of the corner of Bolton and South, and the historic gallery footprint consolidated towards the east towards the water. the ships and appears next place in addition to reorganizing the interior circulation and gallery layout of the museum. we will use this opportunity to restore the exterior of 91, South Street, 92 and 93. those are the full temporary hotel building, a corner building and for Fulton Street, all the exterior of the future footprint of the museum next. please. there is a robust suite of restoration and repair work for all of those exterior facades. I won't go through it in great detail to spare you the time. but we will be proposing repairs to all of the various types of masonry. great Granted, Brownstone we will be repairing of course, the slate roofs and many other repair and restoration elements for at least facades next. additionally, we will be proposing a new pain scheme for these buildings. this Pan scheme is historically appropriate derived from historical sources. we do not believe that there are any. extent historic paint samples actually to be taken. so we'll be repainting all the window frames as we repair all the historic frames as well. we'll be repainting the storefront. you can see a light warm gray and so the brown providing increased improved identity for the museum. we're proposing, I hand, painted sign much like a historic hand painted science once we're found in the district on the brick that's a South Street Seaport museum, a single banner sign at the corner you can see in red there and then a storefront sign above the corner entrance to the museum as well next. just repeat again where that corner is the south and what. and Fulton, it is the northeast corner. execute the facing northeast this is the Fulton Street elevation. of course, the same menu of restoration repair will be applied here. you also see a hand painted sign up this elevation, including the wood cut finger icon, indicating the new prominent entrance for the museum at that corner. okay, and finally we are reconfiguring that circulation piece that dates from 2002. we saw a bit earlier. we will, and is there a new circulation core? in exactly the same footprint, I'll be a bit taller. this is to provide accessibility via an elevator to all floors of the gallery spaces, which currently does not exist. they are not accessible as well as proper ingress to all floors the gallery, which currently does not exist. either. next please shifting gears to look at the phase 2 portions. so, the full build out of the John Street a lot. we thought deeply about the C port and, you know, it's characterize on its exterior as a kind of masonry district but in fact. you've done inside those buildings are actually structured by would next please. this is 1 of the typical historic galleries in the museum and the wood structure of the floors and the ceilings is a significant and important protagonist in one's experience of these intimate, wonderful, historic spaces. and we use that as inspiration. for the new galleries, the contemporary galleries in New John Street Lock building. so this is a truly would structure. something that is truly resilient and sustainability. we're aiming for a net, carbon 0 t building or a carbon neutral building, because of the use of wood as a structure. so, heavy timber columns, blue, laminated, beams and Cross laminated, timber floor and stealing structures. so, the presence of wood is a primary protagonist as it is historic galleries, but these by contrast are larger scale, flexible, contemporary galleries that will allow the museum to do programming in a way that it currently can not. this is an elevation looking at the South St Elevation. if we peel off the facade, you see the historic galleries on the right side of the screen and the presence of the structure and the contemporary galleries on the left with the presence of the contemporary wood structures. there and there is a space in between, but bridges connecting to so that 1 moves back and forth between intimate historic galleries. kind of larger and more flexible contemporary ones on this image. can does your cursor work on this image? yes, so put the cursor on the proposed the corner entrance please. because the Northeast corner quote in South is actually across the West side highway, I want to see where that proposed entrances. it's the south southwest corner I missed. okay. got it perfect. currently where the Sarah Jessica Parker stores would be the. moving to the exterior we thought, how might we clad this timber box and we looked to historic memberships. which sometimes work, clad and copper in order to make them actually faster next. please. it's a historic technique that really has not changed over the course of 200 years. so, here you see the application of this copper planning to the Us Constitution. more than 200 years ago, and the revival of that same technique and it. results in a really wonderful, kind of hand crafted. artisanal texture across the surface of the holes of these ships next. of course, this is a material not foreign to significant architecture as well. even on the waterfront, there are many, metal buildings, especially. quite special and unique ones and so we thought. what more special building than the museum to apply a copper exterior skin next. so, here, we see that copper exterior clouding the wood structured, contemporary building, separated with a glass enclosed circulation piece. from the historic restored buildings on the right side of your screen. as 1 approaches this copper, it would have a hand crafted texture. reminiscent of the texture we saw in the photo of the Us Constitution next. and we are proposing to allow this copper to naturally patina over time. so, it will dark and quite quickly at 1st, over the 1st, couple of years, and then over a much longer timeframe 15 to 20 years gradually turn a deep and rich green. we think this will create an even more special presence for the museum while still being. a compatible on tonality and a compatible material with real integrity within the context of the historic district. to further detail and live in the sides. we again look to the history of the historic district, particularly the use of shutters, many windows throughout the entire district. awesome still existence as well as the use of arches at the ground floor entrances of the more unique buildings in the district next. and we applied those to the museum building here in order to provide depth light, shade and shadow to the side as well as to allow the museum to control natural light on the interior for different galleries and different positions and to connote a welcoming and open. ground floor for the public here is that small separation between the new building on the left and the historic building is 91 south street in particular on the right is a glass enclosed on connection piece with bridges connecting the 2 galleries. and as 1 moves from 1 to the other 1, would have used the natural life from, above orient orienting you out to the ships and tears in water beyond. because this is such a long presentation I just want to ask. so you're breaking the street wall on the last slide is that what i'm saying? can we go back? it is continuous interior space, but the facade here is pushed back. in the center yes, no, not in the center to the left. it does not reach out to the street. well, why is that? to create a plaza or something? no, it does reach out to the street wall. there's a bit of a angle of the. property line, but it is, in fact, the lines. okay, thank you for the clarifying question. I think we can go on. so, putting all those pieces together, this is that Tom entrance that you were asking about was german. quite a clear view of the south western corner. so that is the new entrance. you see the restored facades here with the newly proposed signage indicate entrance the enlightenment storefront and the completion of the block would be contextually consistent amassing of the new building. at the southern corner next just taking a look from the opposite view. so we are looking northwestern here. again. we see the completion of the block and the rhythm of the openings and scale matching the jason to buildings as well. and we get our 1st glimpse in this particular view of the towers of 250 water street in the distance. as I kind of backdrop for the low scale foreground much has 199, Water Street, which we see on the left part of this image is a backdrop for the low scale foreground. next, and we won't speak about this in any depth, but really, these 2 projects of course, are linked in that development is what enables the future Revitalization museum. so, Chris will tell us about. 250 water street in much greater detail. thank you for your attention. thanks, Frank, because now we will Chris before you start my final chapter. yes, please, how do you want to take a want to do it straight on this section? 1st because it's a separate application before we go to water. we will take guidance from you. we have so that is a museum and its totality as we're presenting it and the next chapter really is 250 and so we can work our way through the whole thing and then take questions at the end. unless you prefer to. great quick question. well, we'll look to your guidance. I was curious as to whether or not to eat. the focus on the application in terms of the conventional and the architecture and this is pointing out. whether or not, there's and Jason, I'll take it from. you want to do it now or do you want to wait. go ahead. go ahead. Jason. is not it are they going to are we going for a certificate of appropriateness? this is, this is the whole thing. it's both part parcels. right? correct so then we should keep going. let's keep going. let's keep. I just want to clarify and i, i've done it before. this is 1 single application. so LPC is being asked to. approve Modify or 1 application. yeah, that's a question for the applicant yes that i'm asking the. this is salary gamble. this is 2 applications. 1 is for 250 water street. the other is for the new building and the changes to the museum building on the museum block. at once again, 1 application is 4, 250 and 1 is for the presentation we just saw. is that correct? well, there's a single presentation for both applications. yes, and you're looking for 1 single resolution or 2 separate resolutions from Lp city. 1 way or another we are looking, I think, for. healthy will be issuing. 2 decisions 1, for each, the patient is linked, because they are, these applications are linked. so, I think the community board can. do separate resolutions, or it can do a single resolution, but the presentation as that, we're presenting both the community Board into landmarks is a single presentation. so your. anticipation i'm sorry it, there's still there's still. air in this, if the answer no offense. your expectation is that lemmerz presidents in, but. a duplicate application, and then the other, they will not have an interstitial link between the 2 resolutions. is that correct? i'm not sure what you mean by an official link so you keep saying their link, are they linked in your mind or in the sense that 2 separate applications are being. put forth simultaneously or do you think this will be good? that's 1, let me share a. share the same architects, they have different owners on these 2 parcels. they are part of a sort of unified approach to the district. I think the community boards. so, an application similar to this when Rick. Cup came forward with I think it was probably 13 different applications, including 3 for new, but we're aware that. yes, but my question, I remember it before that John Petracca had that project. Rick wound up getting it. my question is. my question is, do you and I think it's a clear question. do you accept the LPC to adjudicate each application separately? that is to say, approve deny or modify or do you think they will. create an end result regarding both applications as 1 decision. I think that's a clear question. is it confusing to the. Board? no answer. oh, i'm sorry. I think that the them, at the end of the day, landmarks will be issuing 2 determinations. because each decision is. okay, each parcel. okay. right. so, in that case, I think we should have a very quick. very quick not overly detailed. regard of this present application. so that's my suggestion, but can you can make the final. decision. i, you know, for me, we're going to take public comments at the end, but the question is really for the committee if they have questions about the historic buildings and the new structure. and the paints and the brick and everything that you would normally do, whether you want to do that now. or wait until, after you hear 250, they are separate. well, maybe we can hear and see how they relate. what's here at the end of it? let's see how they make this connection between 1 can't happen without the other. am I correct? yes. so why do not we just deal with that and move on Bruce? okay. then, let's jump back in, i'm going to jump back in and thanks. thank you. important clarification. 1St, we recognize that we are not the 1st proposal for. 250 water street and not certainly not the 1st proposal that LPC has reviewed and taken action on. and we do think though we are the 1st proposal. that is thinking beyond the immediate site of 250 water. and so the link of the 2 sites, actually. puts us in a unique position relative to prior proposals. and that the benefit of the whole district comes from this single site. additionally, we believe that we can learn and evolve from prior proposals and take the benefits and the, the distractions towards finding a positive solution today. we also acknowledge that there is. an existing zoning envelope as revised 2003. with a cap to the building at 120. plus 40 feet of mechanical and this envelope for the volume, or the area that's on this site essentially guarantees that the, the building will bulk out at this envelope, which. arguably is not the most appropriate for the context of the district, and that it provides still vocally bulky building. in relation to its immediate context and so by unlocking the zoning, there is also opportunity. to build a more contextual podium in the district. so our site. full block on the side of the district. a transition site within the district. as a reminder empty today empty for decades, it is flagged by very different conditions on all 4 sides. to the north, the broadest building in the district to the south, the tallest building in the district. unique buildings in the context of the C port district. and to our east, we have more of the fine grain that we typically associate with the district. of course, with the exception of what is today, new school, but, but the, the aggregation of several buildings and expansion onto the center, make it a large building block. and, of course, to our west, we have the, south bridge towers outside of the district. and the photographs of the site also demonstrate it as a. transition site at the edge of the district. with the views to the south and the upper left hand corner here. we see the tallest building in the district in the context of lower Manhattan. the stockbridge towers to our west peck slip to our north. and then to our east, we do see the more regular rhythm. of the smaller articulated facades that we associate with the district. and the block was largely demolished in the period of the widening of Pearl Street and it was essentially an empty site when it was designated with the exception of parking garage. built in the. or a garage building built in the fifties, but the site today is not. a contributing site to the fabric of the district. meaning it is an empty gap currently in the district as it has been. and, and each of these views seen from within the district, or seeing from outside of the district. demonstrate the kind of gap in the fabric of the district. and so, how do we build, a large building here? how do we build a full block building here that is contextual? and part of that, we believe is just thinking about the perception of the district historically. and the district, as we see it from the waterfront, we think of it as a waterfront district obviously. and, i've seen from the waterfront we think of the district as. low masonry buildings. in the context of tall buildings beyond. and that's the perception from the waterfront historically. and it was the perception within the district historically. low masonry buildings with the context of taller buildings. beyond and. this district is unique in that it can be seen from afar. it is not just a district that you only experience from inside the district, because we have great views of it from the Brooklyn bridge. we have great views of it from across the river from Brooklyn heights. we see the district historically, the district has always read even from a far as. fronting the Waterfront, a series of low buildings. on that waterfront and tall buildings, directly adjacent and beyond. and that is very much the case today. still facing the waterfront, low masonry buildings. in a context of tall buildings and our site. shifts upland from the water and is in this transitional zone. between the consistently low masonry buildings of the district and the tall buildings of the context. and so this is really the premise that we have started from to develop what we believe is a strategy. it is appropriate to the district in that. it is filling the gap of the district. with a low contextual base. that bars its cues from a direct context. with a step back. towers broken into 2 towers to break down the bulky. that respond to the height and context of. the neighbors directly adjacent on Water street. and then, sit lower than the buildings of lower Manhattan. and seen another way in elevation the, the. the premise of our diagram, the kind of the. the scheme, if you will is a low contextual base, it really bars its cues from its immediate context. and a top that contextual base are towers that borrow its are set its height data. from the, the neighbors on water street and so as we go down water street, you see the buildings reside between about 45500 feet. and we are setting our tower heights at 470 feet. and so. you know, we believe that the perception of the district from within the district. and the perception district from afar is a series of low masonry buildings, low corners lines, heavy texture on the facades. that is sitting in the context of directly adjacent taller buildings. and that was historically the, the reading of the district. and it remains very much the reading of the district. that from within the district, we have low masonry buildings in a context tall buildings. and that is what you perceive from within the district, and it's what you perceive from, from outside of the district looking in the long these towards the district. and that is the case today and we believe that can be the case. in our proposed configuration of the site, and that, we can continue the legacy of low contextual Masonry Street fronts. with tall buildings in the distance that respond to the meet more broader context of lower and have. so, i'm going to walk to a little bit, just the thinking of the development of the architecture and, and the specifics of our architecture and I'll show a series of views from within and around the district. so, starting with the site with the as of right envelope that as we just described and I think everyone is very familiar is a 120 foot cap plus mechanical. and, an 85 foot street wall on all 4 sides of the block. so, our 1st step is really to try to dramatically reduce the height of the street wall to really build a podium. that is much more appropriate to the immediate context of its neighbors, and to then think about the designing of that street bar, that contextual base as barring clues from the dna of the block. and so the elevation across the top is the historic elevation on Water street. and we borrow the of the historic facades kind of proportion of the historic facades and, and. and articulate that scale module on the facade and we articulate that mostly in a moment with different color brick. and with slight undulation and the facade from 1 to the next, and then within that structure of module, we can vary the height of the podium to respond much more directly to the context at the corners and also respond to the difference of context on Pearl Street versus Water Street. and so we bring down the corners line and then we introduce. fenestrations and window patterns that borrow from the, the very consistent scale and proportion of windows and the masonry buildings and the district, and also borrow the very consistent datum of storefront. that is also. very dominant in the district and then we borrow the specific pallet of masonry and tone on tone masonry within the district. and, and also the notion of a pressed masonry, not a wire cut, not a modern masonry. and, and so we are trying to again borrow the techtronics of the district. and propose a podium and, an, an architecture that resonates with. that context, but does not do that in a way that is simply applying the historic to the new, but to build a building that. appears to be built today, but that is respectful and resonates with the buildings in its context from yesterday. and so you see that in the post and Lentil Storefront. you see that in the masonry facade. you see that in the masonry Lentil expression, and just zooming in a bit. you see also attention to detail attention to depth. of the windows from the masonry, and you see that there's a slight separation of 1 facade to the next. so it does not read as 1 consistent facade from 1 end of the block to the other. and then at the, at the storefront, we also try to borrow clues from our context of dividing the larger lights from bringing in a transom with screen texture, a raised base. and post and lentil architecture. and so that starts to come together. at a street skate, and we have now the opportunity to fill the gap. of the parking lot with a building that data rooms and scale resonant with its neighbors and the scale and texture of the facades resonates with the scale and texture of the facade that we think of. in the historic C port district. and so we now have a completed room again on Water Street. and then the towers are place to top that contextual grow out of that contextual base. but we do that in a way that tries to have the most modest impact of this area in the district. and so we have put, we've divided them into 2 towers to keep the height in context with other water street buildings to the south. we set those towers back as far as we can on the north and south side with the new sheds from within the district. to the outside of the district, or have less impact from the tower. we also set back 20 feet on the narrow street of Water Street and then 10 feet to Pearl. and then we put the narrow faces. towards the district as visible from afar from across the, and from the river. and so, then we can take a quick tour around the base of the building and understand that. we've set varying datum for the, for the corners line, a consistent data for the store front. and that, that varying data then allows us to address the step and change. and scale from Pearl Street to Water Street, and also the stepping of the store front from and elevation as we have an incline towards the water from pearl towards water, and then onward to the river. and the same step and data on, as we see the elevation using the kind of smaller module that we described, that came from the historic structure of the block and lot size of the block. and then we can step the profile down to respond more directly with the context. then the full large, 85, but existing street wall. and so now we'll walk through a bunch of use of the, of, of the site from, or various points within the district and outside of the district. and 1st, looking at the view today North. on Water Street and so we see club school in the distance empty parking lot on the left. and the opportunity to create a street skate here, rather than a single sided facade. and it's street skate that responds to the. to the scale and the material and the, and, pallet of the existing grains. and that thing now, view from. looking West out of the district. and we see the infill of the, of the blocks the corner now is held with architecture of the tower step back, 40 feet from. rising in the in the top of this few, and now moving north to peck slip and we see that today with empty parking lot. the peck slip is not contained as it was historically. and this is the district. and sight lines are out of the district. to beyond, and so actually by filling the site, we now have the ability to rECABture the space of peck slip. and, and we have pushed the tower south in this case so that it aligns with the broader space and space of slip. and that same effect of creating the rooms of, from, within. now, we see that. it also the, the expansion of the street is rooms to the outside and the ability for building on this site to. provide a proper edge and complete the, the boundaries of the district. and so, in our proposal, we, we complete a room here again on peck slip. we have the opportunity to pedestrian eyes more formally this strip of peck slip, which is now used as the Pexip school play area and, and also create strengthen the boundary of the district along Pearl Street. and so we'll look at, a couple of views now, trying to get further away. correct? we're back on water street, looking south and you see. the, very much the same context. yes. the closing of the street is not included in the landmarks. per view correct the closing, the street is not of the application. that that's what street is being closed. they were looking at the pictures, they just showed was text Lip Street, being closed. but they can't, I should see, that's not part of the landmark application. is that part of some other plan on the table right? there is discussion with and with the ot, for the pedestrian of that piece of block, which that 1 a segment, which is now closed during the days for peck slip. to school to use as a outdoor play area and so there's interest in and formalizing that. and, that is that may be so, the discussion is, should that just be a more temporary continue to be a temporary solution, which is right now police barricades or should it be a more permanent solution that actually. they have not, they have not come to the community Board to talk about it. so that should not be a part of this. we'll on that, I mean, that's completely out of the purview of this discussion all. Tammy, can we at least send an inquiry about this to the city since we're just 1st hearing about it as usual please. is that okay? yeah, he's muted. i'm taking notes keep going Chris. thank you so much. sorry about that. Jeremy. did you hear me? absolutely. I mean, this is a sharing a lot. I keep it. I do not think Chris is proposing accounting is reacting to the proposed closing. I believe that was the school, the, I think that there was some school and other stakeholders who are interested in that idea. right, correct, correct. you know, as, I saw mentioned at the beginning, there was a, there was a, there were a series of stakeholder. meetings that were inviting input from, from various stakeholders in the district. and that was. that was part of that conversation. yeah. can I just clarify this? because I think it's there is no current proposal to close the street and it's not as, as I think Tammy said, it's not part of this proposal. it was discussed. I guess from Pexip School has asked for a more permanent barricade. so, God forbid someone drives to. and those are temporary barricades as we currently consider it. if we were to do it, that would pull out. but if there was a permanent request by Pexip to close a school, that would have to come as part of this process, if they were interested in doing it down the road. but that is not part of this discussion. I agree. thank you how many people, how many people wish to speak Jennifer outside of the committee. 1St, let's how much longer do you have, Chris? that's really the main question because of, let's say, 3, 4 minutes. I just okay. more. okay. that'd be great. we got this. thank you very much. I'll wrap it up. I'll wrap it up quickly. so, just a few more views as we start to distance ourselves further away, and we start to see the towers more prominently. so, this is the view now for the north on water, looking south and so we see that the scale and texture of the immediate context. and the, and the aspiration here is to stitch together the street skate of the district with this contextual podium in the tower, a step back and take on a lighter tone than the contextual podium. same palette, but a lighter tone to engage them visually from the podium. and, and then another view, again, stepping back, further on street, looking West, we see the, the scale and texture of the exquisite facades and the district. really? you see much more of the, what we associate with the district now, as we move further east and then the continuation of the facade, and the towers set back, 40 feet, and then moving around to Pearl Street. this idea of now completing the boundaries of the district with this contextual podium, and you see the towers relating more in scale to what you see further south on water 199 water. and I'll talk very briefly about the architecture of the towers we have, lightened the tone from the base so that there is a visual separation so that your eye is not pulled up to the towers necessarily from the podium so that you can have the space of the street and. we have tried to put a lot of depth in the facades so that they do not read as. as in as glass towers, and we have done that with outdoor space primarily is our device. and so we have deep terraces or logo so that the buildings. face the water in face with outdoor space, and even the typical facade is thought of as a kind of post and lentil expression and, and also trying to introduce depth in the facades that we do not have the tight. field appearance of modern glass towers very quickly. programmatically. just to let everybody know that is. proposed as office in the podium of the buildings. and a residential in the tower of the building. I know that program is not part of this conversation, so I'll just go quickly. 2 appearances of the of now a little bit further away and so you can see the 2 towers, which we had taken some, some attempt to not have them be identical twin towers, but to have them have some variation between towers more appropriately. we believe to the district and to build as much depth and texture into the facade of the tower as possible, particularly with these outdoor spaces, facing the waterfront. and so you can see the low contextual podium, and then a zone that responds more to the collection of rooftop structures. and then the 2 towers nestled here in the context of lower Manhattan. and then the view from a far as we are now in Brooklyn, looking back and see still the low context of the district facing the waterfront and the 2 towers, upland the back of the district. and so, in conclusion, really, we believe that this is the context of the district that the district has a front, and it is to the water. and maintaining low hype at the waterfront is, is paramount, and that the district has historically been seen in the context of, of taller buildings, adjacent and beyond. and that will continue to be the case with our proposal on 250 water street. and that we think that there is opportunity to think comprehensively about the district and for private development to benefit the district at large. and for us to use planning, use that planning concept, to support the district and complete the district. and to benefit the, and the opening of the, the South Street Seaport museum galleries, unscramble horn row and the ultimate completion of the block. and the completion of the street skate. of the district, and the perception of the street scape as it as it exists today but to the betterment of as it is read today. and stitching together of the streets, and the premise of doing that with a contextual low base and towers that rides out of that. that our. Akin to the base, but separate from the base. and so to to, to bring this together, we had 2 views of the 2 empty sites that are currently detracting. from the district and the opportunity to complete the district and fill those 2 empty sites. the last 2 real empty sites within the district today. thank you. so, we're going to we're going to go around the table with the committee and then. Tammy is going to navigate the. community speakers, it is almost 9 pm so I hope everyone in their comments. I'll start 1st, all I want to say is that. as regards the architecture of the of the 1st, see, port infilled, John Street I actually think it's quite good, except it seems to me that the actual. got it's inspiration from drafts if you look at the old traps restaurants, I mean, it's not a terrible inspiration auto kit, the arches and what looks like fabricating. but the upper portion, I think is. surprisingly, good as for 250 water street. all I can say is that, we're just hang on, we've got a lot of time to say, ask the questions that you need clarify. it's I think it's, I think the presentation to self evident, I do not have any questions then. yeah, so any questions from the committee. yeah, Vicky Camera has your hand up. yeah, if you have members as have your hands up. I wanted to get a clarification if you're using copper on the facade and you said he was going to green. naturally I do not think that happens anymore because we do not have enough acid in the air. and that is not going to green on its own. it can you confirm that. you have you spoken to your consultant from that? yes. and that will occur. that process is sped by. my acid brain, but not created by us. i'm sorry, i'm going to have to ask if we've had in writing, because we're in the same industry and I heard the exact opposite saying that there is no such thing as being anymore. naturally. like, if you. okay, i'm talking about the corner of 5Th Avenue and 67, so it's not exactly a small insignificant building. I also hear you, you know, constantly. using language, like, contextual may severity details and yet you do not use any of that in your new proposal. everything has to be new and different. what do you mean? maybe a party clarify what you mean is there a question. yeah, we're using this language you continuously set a precedent. for details and contextual look of the historic town Seaport yet your solution has nothing to do with the contextual architecture. the details, the materials nothing is contextual. so i'm just wondering how you see that relating. well, I think what we saw was that in the district, there is post and mental storefront. is what we saw in the district there is molded Rick. that has a flush mortar then there are lentils. okay, are you talking about the museum building? yeah, okay so, with the bit with the museum building, the Landmarks Commission will often entertain new materials in a building. that's contemporary. it's a an institutional building. that has been hopes to have a. presence in the district and the materials and forms shape and, proportional relationships are very much in keeping with the block that it's being set in, and the permission often embraces a new architectural expression in that kind of situation. and we think that we've really hit a good note with this in the materials that are being used. right. that's all terrific. except that the Landmark Commission is not New York City residents. we are at a community board, and i'm here representing the community. right so the community likes their historic seaboard, they like the look of it and like the scale they like the details, the humanity part of it and yet you're changing to a completely different program because landmarks will approve it, or you like it. i'm just pointing out, no explanation is required. i'm going to say this lastly, and I want to be heard. both the fill in of these 2 blocks, and no matter what language we use is creating an unbelievable congestion. and that's what I think my fellow community residents are extremely concerned about. it is a Goliath landing on us and I know we'll have lots of opportunities to discuss this later on, but simple things like garbage pickup. it's going to be an issue for a 50 story building of this many units. so that's my comment for tonight. representing my fellow. thank you vickie let's go next to the next New board member. remember we're trying to keep it down. we give the community board members or a couple more minutes, but we do want to get to the public and it's quite late. so, keep going. we have Paul gold thing. we're doing Landmarks Committee 1st, and then board members. so. Nicole yeah, Susan yes, i'm coming. I just want to ask 1 thing preservation. notwithstanding the ability for them to build the buildings is high is because of the air rights from the South Street seaport. potentially our credit fund the museum i'm sorry. am I correct? i'm appears from the peer 17 and the 10 builder. okay, thank you. I do not it's all self, but. you can see what you're getting goodbye. okay, who else from the committee? I see. can I speak? this is Elizabeth yes, I just want to raise my objection to the scale as i'm sure we will be hearing time. and again, not the architecture is fine, but the scale is going to be a big problem. okay, Alice. wait wait, did I get everybody who's on the committee? Tammy? it's 0. so, I had a question on the court museum application. I just did not understand that glass. separation between the buildings, the 2 buildings I needed to understand the rationale of that. that sliver blast. right, sure I mean, currently there you can see the exposed historic party wall of 91 South street, and it's quite beautiful and we thought that it might be appropriate to pull the. contemporary building away from that a bit. and that he might still be able to see it and experience it when you cross across these bridges between the 2 buildings. creates a nice separation and kind of point counterpoint between the historical and contemporary structures. okay, and thank you for that explanation. and then, Tammy, just another thing I just been hearing about how. you know, i, I heard some comment, I do not know who what who made it, but saying that the museum is what really is what makes this. the historic district, but I like, I take issue with that because what makes this district historic is not just the museum, but all the residents who've lived here for quite some time who actually pay our taxes lived here through Sandy prior. Sandy. and continue to contribute by being a part of it and also the fact that. the buildings and the, the area, the way it is zoned and the way it is structured currently, that's what makes it. a district, not just a museum thank you. anybody else on the committee, then I am going to say my 1 sentence since everyone else has all I want to say is that. in terms of the linkage of the 2 pieces of architecture. this board has dealt with that subject in terms of catastrophe catastrophes for the last 50 years and I think it should be off the table. the linkage between the catastrophes that occur in this district, and the support museum we approved reluctantly in tower after 911. specifically, because the, the analysis was that it would save downtown at a time of disaster. and now we're talking about disaster again this time with a new developer. that's my piece, thank you. okay. all right, Susan, you've gone if you can take her hands down alice. your questions can we have? thanks very much for the presentation. can you to go up to page 93, Chris or 1 of the presenters or is that too late? your previous not at all. not at all. okay. we'll go. so that just I just want to take a look at those previous proposals. 93, I think it well, I think it's page 93 on, like your document. so it's basically the, you chose the previous proposal. the historic previous proposals got it. okay. you know, let me get back to that. yeah, I will I'll get back to that. i'm reticent on the architecture. you know, there's a lot of. terrific moves and maybe less terrific ones in terms of the, the build the team certainly seems like it would help to have. a plan, maybe I missed it, but, you know, sort of a scale plan of seeing. the, the base of 250 water, just because I have no understanding it looks like a very massive, long, monotonous suicide. they could not really see it and understand where these breaks are. but anyway, that aside, I think what i'm talking to. it's always interesting to me, if you notice that there were these previous proposals presented to the Landmarks Preservation Commission over the last 40 years for this site. and in fact, there was 7 proposals, and 6 of them were rejected in 83. there was a proposal for Tower by France in 2003 stories, which was half the size of 1 of the 2 current because towers here. which was rejected by the commission has stayed at the time the project would quote, dominate and overwhelm the neighboring building. so, the district. by teacher of a cheer size and messing and 3 years later in 1986. forgive me if I mispronounce that who's a firm has provided restoration plans for who currently force? part of your team proposed to residential towers? at 12 and 30 stores, which is the 3rd picture here, which in front of you, and this was over a 5 and 6 story podium and it's very similar. the approach that you're taking to let today. yeah. that lesson has much less than half the proposed scale. and again, the proposal was rejected by the Landmarks Preservation commission who stated the Sat times that the proposed scale. size mass and volume of 230 star story tower we dominate and overwhelm the neighboring building. so, my question is, I guess the designers and to Chris that we seem to be the lead here. you know, how does occurred proposed project with 247 story towers. on a similar podium, which is much larger than any of the previous proposals, which will be said in arguably much more crowded, urban scape here in 2020. will be considered a viable alternative to the commission is compared to the proposals that we're at a smaller scale that the commission rejected previously on the basis of the size scale in mapping. so, I think, well, 2, 2 parts to that question that we do believe that we are borrowing some of the better attributes of the last 2 schemes of, and hopefully improving upon them. with our proposal, and that there is actually the benefit of good architecture that, that can. that we can present and discuss with, with with, with the, and that. so, I think that there is barring some of the positive attributes of these improving upon them and. this is distinct in that and this is the question that, that has been raised by this board. but, but. none of these proposals considered. the district beyond the, their own property line. and so this is the 1st time that anybody has come in front of LPC in front of the commission with a proposal. that is thinking about the district at large and not just. the site itself, i'm not sure I quite by that. i'm sure that, you know, these early architects we're looking at the whole district, and of course, they were looking at it in terms of the lot, and how it fits into its overall context. it'll be an interesting meeting, but it is interesting that this. that our commission over for 40 years over 7 proposed 6 proposals rejected them all because of the size. so it's just, it does not seem like you're doing anything different systems quite a bit bigger. so it's a question that remains unanswered. I appreciate where you're going. i'm not sure it's clear to me how building and another lot has anything to do this 1, but I appreciate the effort and time. thank you. just to clarify 1 thing. I just it's actually not 47 floors. it's 37 floors. I just want to do another. but it's 47 stories. 170 feet tall it's 37 floors. you're not counting the stores. Nevermind. okay. well. how does it? well, let me clarify on the on the poking way. i'm sorry my pronouncing that correctly Chris working with proposal of 1986. 1 of those was 30 stories. so, is that is similar scale to what you're proposing. or is it is not a smaller I would think that's to Chris. I guess. yeah, so i, I have to admit to not knowing the exact height. of the 86 proposal. well, anyway, I can, I can identify that 30. 30 stories, it's not the same as 37 so anyway, it was 1 tower, but whatever. okay. thanks. so, all that is an important clarification. thanks. I appreciate it. okay, i'm moving to Paul gold's team, because I think if it's not just for the record, his name was Yon. and I and I lived through every 1 of those buildings, and I thought there were really 9 that they rejected. okay. so clearly, what is before the Community board is whether 2,470 foot tall buildings fit in this 11 block historic district, where the advertised building is 4 to 5 stories and the zoning is limited. to 120 feet, but it is important that this committee understand the history of this site time. after time the owners have tried to put up inappropriate buildings and it was. the landmark condition that turned them back. and those buildings range from 14 to 43 stories, and I'll just cite 1 more bit of language from their testimony. the landmarks saying that the new building would cause an abrupt change and scale within the district, which would be disruptive of the districts, homogeneous quality. following those 9 rejections, the community and city officials all came together and we put together this new zoning in 2003, after everyone concluded together that this was ridiculous. and I should point out that this included. the downtown alliances include the Economic Development Corporation and include the South Street Seaport museum. every entity in the district was unified in this. they did a study that showed that buildings can. be make a fair return on investment based on the zoning. so, anyway, that was adopted in 2003, the only reason that 250 quarter remains vacant. it's because the stubborn owners starting with the mill stains, and now Howard Hughes refused to abide by the zoning and the landmarks. provisions again, remember other Seaport developers have created new beautiful buildings in this historic area over these years and they do fit into the low scale district, including award winning buildings on historic front street. this community board a welcome such a building at 250 board history that respects. both the historic character and the low scale. I think this committee and needs to make a clear statement also that we value our historic districts that appear to be under attack here and elsewhere. I strongly believe there are better ways to create affordable housing. and what you've seen tonight. and I remind the Cb. that we've recommended not shrinking this district by 10%, which is what, in essence is before you, but enlarging it to include the new market building and that's been the position of community board 1 for over a decade. yes, the city country and worlds is going through a difficult pandemic, but that does not mean we need to forsake important features of our cities like our historic district. and listen to this, the Cp has been the leader in the fight to save and create historic districts. successfully resisting inappropriate buildings at 250 war industry, leading the effort to downs of this area or to 2 of the most significant achievements ever accomplished by Cb. 1, urged newer members to keep this proud history in mind as you consider this. proposal and conclusion the job of Cp 1 is now is to continue to protect and preserve the special South Street seaport, historic district. Cp 1 is on record, supporting the transfer of development rights and the other things I won't get into that because, as we said, it's not germane to before the Community Board or Lpc. what's Jeremy is whether we have an appropriate bill. and I believe cv, 1, based on that must recommend not to approve these inappropriate things at 250 border. thank you Paul. Mark i'm, er, so I see i'm going to go Mark. Michael. David Sheldon, Mary, Alma, and then to the public. right I. just concur what we paul just said. so, I agree. put it a. perfectly, thank you. remember guys, if you have questions, this is the science also ask Michael Kramer and then David Sheldon. the Seaport coalition would like to state, or for the record, our opposition to this proposal it foresee ties approval for an appropriate tower. and the new building at a distant John Street lot, and effectively tries to shrink. the historic district as articulated in section 25, 3, and 2 of the administrative code. historic district is defined as any area, which contains improvements, which have a special character or special historical aesthetic interest, or value. and represent 1 or more period to a styles of architecture, typical 1 or more areas in their history of the city. and cause such area, by reason of such factors, constitute a distinct section of the city, and it's been designated as and start district pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. the historic district was designated in 77 extended in 89. it's a special historic, 11, black, low rise area. but we reject the implication that the press in parking lot. is anything, but an integral part of the district, the same administrative code just notes they just wanted empowers LPC to delineate a historic district boundary. that embodies a distinct section of the city. they can lots parking lots and no style. insignificant buildings are a typical feature of any urban landscape and are that's likely to be and have been included in historic district boundaries. in recent years, real estate interests have heightened the rhetoric regarding historic preservation as an impediment to development. the inclusion of parsoes such as 250 does not include their development. and see, indeed, LPC has a history of approvals related to appropriate new construction. most of the instructive example for us is historic front street is called pointed out. developed in 5 by the tourist organization, 24 pack, slip 254, friend, speed, perfect examples of new construction that replaced a series of ruins parking and vacant lot between front and water streets with new modern elements that mounted into their older surroundings rabbit and undermine them. even in the absence of specific economic studies, focus, focusing on heritage, tourism and dollars in New York City, it's clear that the vast number of local residents tours. documented interest and cultural activities, such as landmarks, historic sites, guided tours and citing and their impact on the economy in transfer jobs from that historic prep properties. not only have civic value, but also economic value almost finished. further the preservation and protection of these places. that's how pc's role. so, contrary to the contention that the historic designation has the capacity to certain. adverse effects impacts on the economy and the economic activity in the South Street seaport. we say that it indicates that the ongoing preservation and protection of these places is fundamentally. is vital to New York City's economy. why do we want to shrink the historic district? Nike Tammy. hi, everyone please note that because of timing purposes, we're going to have time crunch right now I'll be timing. so each person moving forward we'll have 2 minutes to speak. thank you. okay, Community Board members David Show, shelving your next. David, give yourself this move from David if you can come back later. do you want to got it. David, you're on. go ahead. okay. I have a short statement, but I will not read it. I will submit it by email as requested comments, but i'm going to save some time. i'm going to keep down to 3 brief questions. you mentioned the Brooklyn bridge Chris I believe these 2 towers are about 200 feet taller. am I wrong? to notice that you segregated the discussion of the podium. so called from the towers, and yet in the long view of the structure, they are very evidently 1 in the same building despite the fact that the height of them is cut off in many of the pictures. however, you can see it. in the long view, despite that i've noticed, do you have. a long view of this alon rendering of the long view from Water Street. as opposed to from Brooklyn heights. I think we did have long views from Brooklyn heights as well. but I know you'd have that you have 1 from Water Street. is asking just to understand conceptually for the neighborhood what it would feel like. so, what does the look like from water street? because the building is 20 stories taller, both to powers than anything in the back. that's way across the street. what is this? what's blank from? water? all right, so we only had a view from water street on a block north. and so, maybe are you asking from a blocks out or 2 blocks out. you have you have the render the architectural rendering. from the block north, but not from the blocks out. do you want to see the block north if you do not mind coming that? and it'd be great. so, in your in your comment so we're certainly not trying to. preclude any views, so. we can. can you. is a block nor. on water street I see that takes up about maybe 5% of the image. do you have anything that looks directly across towards east? and do you have anything that actually shows. what it would look like, so, if you were standing there, what did the towers look like for when you're on water street? because you've only showed the banks, right? so, I guess we right we do not have wide angle lens views if that's what you're asking. so, we've tried to keep it to the scope of the suggestion. if I can make a suggestion, why do not we put a list together? the viewers you'd like to see and then we can send them to the next Community Board. okay. we'll do that. thank you. David, you got everything else. that's it. thank you very much. so i'd like to see this view, but looking options, there's nothing blocking in front. so I would not see the top of the tower. correct to Mariam and your next. okay. very short. in my original comment that we planned on making. I have I have your submission so do not worry. I submitted. so it's a little confusing. like, I did hear people talk about the affordable housing and all that stuff, those components but I'll leave mine in an email and leave that in a short comment, any longer comments. and a question that I'll go with now, so, for from the perspective of quality of life, I know that the parking industry potential street closure is not part of LPC but from perspective, consideration of also losing a parking lot. but what had been a parking lot? is there a potential for. then what is being referred to as a historic district, turning itself into a parking lot and that question can be, you know, maybe it's rhetorical, but. that's the question with regard to the building on John. i'm a huge fan of metal and particularly copper so I loved it. no architects or artists in the lease. but I loved it. and my comment going to my, what was going to be my longer comment, i'm going to shorten and only include these the 1st paragraph, which may not be relative to. and the application, but introduces me and my. perspective and i'm going to read that and along with another paragraph. so, I was 1 of the save the museum as well as they do not build a tower at the C4 years ago. and i'm also a resident miss average towers on the gold street side. so, I will long lost my views to make way for the Gary building under somewhat similar circumstances. the neighbor then was encouraged to support the project in large part, because of this Boot Street school, which was supposed to be slated to be the most amazing school of its time for many reasons. and then, when my view. but what had once been a view of the twin towers on which my grandfather was 1 of only 3 black workers by the way. and then became my former view of the freedom power. so also being a board member, in addition to, in the South Bridge, who's been neutral? I think i'm. about as much in the mix yet unbiased as 1 can possibly be and have managed to remain neutral and to not officially join any groups without actually seeing or genuinely considering agencies take presentation. so this is the 1st, my 1st time's really seeing it and it's totality. somehow, i'd like to 2 minutes fast. okay, you can't keep going you'd like to see what, and then i'd like to see the support and particularly the museum saved and if not by the city itself by a corporation, that does not support racist or home, all the policies and we do not all have the luxury of not. having to 1st, look into companies in order to determine whether or not we're comfortable spending our money with them. i'd like to see a lot more black and or indigenous history, both at the museum and throughout the support as well as more businesses and offers offerings. be fitting of a Seaport and a Seaport district there, but is 1 of those corporations that offers black and, or a plus specific programming and support even houses. 1 of the few black on businesses alarmed Manhattan at the. okay, gotcha. all right next, we go straight out to the public, because I think everybody from the board has spoken, we're going to start. we have a lot of people in the public. Jan, is, you. after 2 minutes, because that's going to be the fastest that we can do this. this is Tom. I hope to say a quick. sorry, Tom, I missed you. apologies. no worries I had a couple questions 1 was on the transfer, the original sort of concept of transferring error rights and how it was supposed to part of the historic sort of mandate. is this would this be like the final transfer of air rights? are there other error rights left? to for development, or with this sort of end. that and be the, the sort of the, you know. it does not look like, just had the development sites on on, in the district any longer can somebody speak to that? because my hope would be that, you know. that this might be it if, in fact, there's a way to. to look at it from that standpoint. and then I wondered if there was contextual, sort of. the museum, whether there was some programming back and forth between the 2 project, and in terms of like, building or space. within the, the new, the 250 water street that would also have some museum. programming or be part of the museum to make it into more of a district. review, so that was those were 2 questions that I had. okay, I know the 2nd, 1, they can answer the 1st 1. i'm going to say. the mechanism for the transfer, the error, supposed to be outside the district. not inside of this, and some of this depends on how much they use or do not use. so it might not be the end. and soluble to talk about, can I just sent a letter from the state that lays out the right 7? so we could share that with. exactly. so, can you talk about the museum would have any space in the commercial outline that you did for the podium base? in 250 water podium based. the 250 water told me that was, I think, Jonathan's really the better person to answer this. I think they're looking to combine their spaces from an operational and a cost perspective into they would be taking over what's now the space what's next to, which is still a market and the bicycle store those 3, retail stores would be giving to the museum and moving them, or at least from to theirs, but I do not believe there's any intent for them to have any space and 250 water as to the era. Joanna thing I wanted to say, I think as part of that, we would be giving up any right said Howard Hughes Corporation would have to andrea rights or any other transfers. and we're not aware of any other sites that are eligible, or could be moved inside or developable inside the historic district for the district. okay move and then I then thank you. and then, you know, as a. as, as Mary said, i'm. it's almost 30 year residents of South Bridge. i, on the community board I also. was a tenant pier 17 with my business and, and so. i, i'm concerned that. we, even though I know it's perhaps outside the purview of this. this current review that if the museum. is not able to survive and it's not able to I understand the do not talk about this sort of warning but how can you not talk about it? if because it's not something that we talk about here that'll be talked about with the air, right? okay, then i, I think that the preservation of a museum in a historic district, that it is the that is the seeding and press precedent condition precedent to the whole the beginning of this Seaport district is something that should not be left out of a LPC conversation. all right, we're going to go to the public and. Jen, I need you to time. we're going to start Gosh, my connection that sounds so back to me, we're going to go. oh, Tammy there is like this. it's true. and i'm on. okay. all right not sure where it's coming from. okay, we're going to do. we're going this way we're going to start with and so Jen can. on oh, my gosh. okay. we're going to start with. excellent. okay. we're going to do catherine from. Excellent. 1St. and the South Street Seaport museum, we already know has spoken. so we're going to do the Waterfront alliance. after that from Margaret plan again, then. all right, and then we are going to go to. we'll start with those 2 and then we'll keep moving. i'm trying to. okay. Mark people off Catherine, Ivan muted, you want everybody to speak and go ahead. like, 1 is catherine. and back to the Waterfront alliance, we'll come back to our texture. and often muted. Margaret on again, are you there? yes. can you hear me. I can hear you. oh, great. thank you so much. just 1 moment. so I can switch this to the. my notes document please is here. sorry? I apologize for the. again, thank you on Margaret Flanagan Waterfront Alliance, sharing the testimony of our CEO and President Courtney. Waterfront Alliance believes that the howard jeez corporations proposals for the redevelopment of 215 water and John Street are worthy of proceeding through landmarks review process. it's important to acknowledge related historic district improvements. this could bring, including a revitalized new market restoration of a public market, and most importantly that the South Street Seaport museum receives sustainable funding and a new resilient building to fulfill its potential as a landmark steward and reopen all of horn rose uniquely preserved interior accounting house galleries, which are just as significant as the historic district outside. we appreciate howard, he's corporations outreach to the local community through stakeholder, planning workshops and commitment to making the redevelopment of 250 water part of an overall plan for the historic district improvements. it would be very unfortunate if the project at 250 water simply results and then as of right development out any of the proposed improvements for the historic district. a thoughtful design can produce new buildings that will strengthen not detract from the historic district. and success successfully address, issues of size and scale. if these projects can indeed deliver many of the improvements in the planning framework for the historic district. this opportunity is compelling. thank you very much. thank you very much. and. we're going to see if Katherine is, is there. okay, and meeting her. hi, catherine. so, are you there with us? Catherine is so, are you there with us? all right well, we'll come back. you know, 1 would expect at this hour. I feel bad for her. okay, so let's go to. Samira Glazer in the public and then we're going to go to. okay, got it. okay. America laser whenever you're ready to speak. hi. can you hear me. we can great. okay. I just wanted to say that has a resident of this district for. my entire life, which may not be too long, but. 17 years is it? I think it's so. a good amount. I feel that the proposed development at. to 50 water street just does not reflect the character of this community. and then nothing should be built above the limit of 120 feet. and I would personally miss the. low scale building block that has survived here this, all along and then I hope to show to my children some day. thank you, thank you so much. and thank you for your breath. I very much appreciate it moving on. Jen, you got Linda Russia, got her whenever you're ready to speak thank you guys. good evening. my name is Linda Russia, and i've been a resident of the area for 42 years. i've lived through many requests and rejections. the organization went through the zoning was. put down to 120 feet for a reason, and we fully expected to stay that way. 1 thing I did not want to mention. as far as is concerned, they have, of course, rejected all of the other applications. and 1 of the things that they mentioned in their rejection is that. the scale of these buildings that are within the district will disrupt. disrupt i'm sorry, the districts homogeneous little scale quality and would visually confuse the clear boundary of this historic district seaport. i'm going to put in my, my submission via email to Jennifer, but I did have a question and that is, did anybody. i'm sorry, did anybody do a, a shade study? these toll buildings going to create shade. in all different in different directions. so i'm just wondering where the shade study is. Chris, do you have 1 that you can bring for the next meeting? share it with us, and we can post it on the site. sure. we have done shade status so that. and the news is not is not negative. that's the positive part. we will be. the judge understood. so you can stick with us and we'll have it for the next meeting. if we can get it in advance, we'll put it on the website. thank you very much. anything else wanted to. nope, that's it. thank you so much. I'll submit mine to Jennifer. my state perfect. all right and there goes your timers. so that was even better. okay, Catherine is, is back. I bet catherine. hi. thank you so much for taking the time. so i'm co, president of the, and just wanted to put in the 2 cents about what this construction site would do to our school community. I can not even imagine. what it would do to the kids in terms of their wellbeing while they're in school. and obviously also the surrounding communities. aside from that, there is so many people have pointed out, there is legal. there's a law that says that this can't be above 120 feet. I look to try becca we go to the ball fields all day long. we go to along the, the West side highway, and they like, every in tribeca. everything is low and so everything is low and it's all kept that way because the landmarks. so, I would hope that in the support, they keep everything. according to the law, the same way they do in northern Tribeca and so. thank you very much Katherine. any questions that you want to ask. oh, you're good. that was just a statement. okay. all right. the next, we're going to go to. Catherine Mcvey, Hughes now, hold on catherine before we on mute you we already know that the South Street Seaport museum is in support of this. so, you can do me a favor check with the other members board members of the museum who are here and without the chair if they'd like, 2 minutes, the board chair, i'm happy to give 1 of you, but not all of you. so. I apologize about that, but based on how much time we have, if it's at all possible for you to check in with him, i'd appreciate that. and then just send me a note. I think it should speak. okay. right you are good. all right, so then let's go to. trying to balance this out here. Aaron thing. K. everybody great, thank you. my name is Aaron Sangam, the Waterfront director at the New York Harbor School. former for volunteer for the last 25 years, and I just want to express our support for any idea to keep the museum going. museums was a founding partner and Harvard School. they started Harvard School back up in 2003, and for many years say this is not about the fiscal determination of the museum. it's about the landmark preservation. so, if you have something that you'd like to opine on, from the land marking perspective of the construction of the buildings that are on John Street or the buildings on 250 water, please, let me know otherwise the other part about it will be involved in the alert process and we welcome you to come and discuss it about that. okay. great. yes, so we'll submitting comments and not to take up any more time. thank you. okay, awesome. so that puts me to Elizabeth. same conversation and question Elizabeth, is this about the landmark application and everything that comes with? that. thank you this is Elizabeth car long time support museum volunteer. I just wanted to say, thank you everybody for the presentation. and then, I think that has presented an elegant, thoughtful and respectful proposition here. the 4 grounds, the role of the museum and contextualizing interpreting and embodying the historic nature of this historic district. otherwise I will submit comments in writing as requested. thank you all for your time. okay, thank you very much. we're going to go to Amy? Nope to Joanne Gorman. plan I submitted my testimony. thank you. i'm passing. okay, thank you. we love that. all right. constituent that David Sheldon you went correct? you are you're a public number? I think you've already gone. all right Warren Green. in the public sorry, Tammy could you spell the 1st thing? Warren W. A. R. E. N. last name Green and after Warren Greene, we're going to go to Brandon. who's the. chair for the support museum, perhaps I'll check with him whether he, he wants to be the 1 for the museum or not. we'll unmute him and ask. I do not see Warren green on turned on tony slips. and he was the next, individual. Mr. Section Brendan section is the chair of the board for the South. exam figure, we'll start at the top. sorry, catherine. I am, but I could say that catherine phase, you should go. okay, then we'll, we'll take catherine. but there are many people here from, or where they are supporting the museum. are they not going to speak to speak. I can't do that. well, i'd like i'd like to Limited. then we know that you support. know that you. part of this, we understand that. the question is instead of having 20 people all saying we were on. the museum, I have all of the notes that have been given. i'm trying to recognize other people who are also in who are not the applicants. yes, but there are. there are at least 2 board members who are what one's a 3rd party a resident, the community. and they can speak whatever they have to say, I am going to interject. I have been the chair or coach here of the landmarks and Preservation Committee of the Community Board for 21 years. this hearing, as opposed to land use as our dealer is about text to reality and architecture. yeah, oh, that's all I want to say. okay, so. let's speak and then earnest. if there are going to be board members, these people have been here for decades. okay, I can't speak and be told that I am thereby doing the other board members participation. i'm hoping to get every member of the public that we can able to speak. so, what we normally do is group people by organization if you'd like to seed your time to catherine or to earnest. I have no issues with that. it was Katherine, who was cut off when you said that the choice was her or me. so, are you to her. now, but I can't believe that we have only 1 speaker because they're associated with the museum. you are also the applicant and we have over a 100 people. you must understand i'm trying to group them all by group. okay, Catherine, thank you. catherine. I do not see her name on here. she should be there. all right let's keep going then again the contextual holiday. do you see Sarah mcnally? I do yeah. meeting her. yeah, I can. can you hear me. I can Sarah. thank you very much. hello. good evening. my name's Sarah. mcnally i'm the owner. think Natalie Jackson Books on Fulton Street. i'm very much in favor of these developments. both of them as a shopkeeper in the neighborhood. i've been troubled, long troubled by the 2 parking lot center consideration. I think that for the neighborhood to really properly. work for retail, we need to make its boundaries more appealing and these parking lot sort of flights to break the historical feel of the neighborhood. I do believe that the. proposal by Howard Hughes solves this very elegantly. I believe that the stepped back towers, make a lovely transition between the financial district, and the C port district and I believe that the museum building, which will connect the imagination playground and make it feel like, part of the district is also very beautifully done while saving the museum, i, as a retailer, it is hard to get the foot traffic needed to make us for work in that neighborhood. and I think that a large part of that is because the neighborhood does not transition elegantly from the financial district. thank you very much. I appreciate that. and Catherine just said, please. please mute her. she's ready catherine. is her name her full name it's appearing on attorney's list, or? I do not see chat around here besides Katherine unless she's going by another name. she goes by hughes, she's missing just the middle there you go. hi, catherine, whenever you're ready. oh, great. thank you. very much. I also want to make sure that ernest or 40 year resident is opportunity to speak with 1. for a very long time, as, you know, I served on community board 1 for 220 years, have a attackers chair, which are downtown since 1980 and all that time. we'd never take any Importer street sites. see, that change at last someone who cares about our community and fit into his picture. there are 7 points that I would like to make about this proposal. 1, it replaces an eyesore with a beautiful building, a world renowned and architect to eliminate 2nd Avenue to threaten the neighborhood that essentially it restores affordable housing costs, which sandwich hours? 1, or it brings in residential customers to the restaurant. business Neighborhood, 5, it provides new facilities for schools such as the center. 6, it creates a new future for the South Street Seaport museum vessels and collections education mission, including maritime history and the print shop 7, it demonstrates a 1b dollar commitment to our men had postal code and posting the transformation. transformative it reminds me of how the neighborhood turned the corner after 3 questions will be contextual. architectural that a parking lot. will it increase? congestion replaces car and truck traffic. what? traffic? 3 what will it mean for local services? it provides amenities that we have plot for decades at a time of significant budgetary constraints. thank you. as I am a proud board member of the South Street seaport. Healthy will support the proposal plans to save the South Street seaport. the heart of our. thank you Catherine. thank you thank can you better. she's muted. okay. great. thank you. we're going to go to. I am Harris Brown. and then after Diane Harris bomb, we're going to do grace Lee and pete davies Diane Brown whenever you're ready to speak. Diana are you there. come back to her. okay. basically, are you there? yes, i'm here. can you hear me. yes, grace. hi, my name is gracie. i'm a co, founder of children. 1St, the Grassroots organization led by concerned. parents opposed to uncheck development at 250 water street. i'm also a founding member of the support coalition. and another of 3, elementary school children, and a resident of the financial district, just down the street from 250 water street. i'm speaking today in opposition to development plans by this Texas based developer, Howard Hughes Corporation in historic Seaport district, the birth place of not only New York City, but of this country. while today, we see it as a parking lot the site is an actual site of incredible historical significance going back to the 16 hundreds. and then again, as a key part of the Seaport district in the 18 hundreds, and beyond. as recent as the late 19 seventies, the buildings on the site were still in the character of the other historic buildings in the area. this completely out of scale development does not preserve the historic historical legacy of this district as a developer suggests it will forever destroy it and set a dangerous precedent for historic districts across the city. the community waiting on this historic district in 2003 with a sensible cb. 1 led resigning. and today, I asked the Landmarks Committee for this neighborhood that you will all please champion the preservation of these special places while supporting the support coalitions, community based proposal, which will protect the Seaport district, save the museum and allow us to create much needed affordable housing. thank you. perfect all righty. let's go to. I do not know if pete davies is areas from the Broadway residents coalition. no, I do not see him on the list. okay, I do not know if he was pete fever and it did not. type him incorrectly. okay. no problem. let's keep going. let's i'm trying to recognize people from different groups across the city as well as. as well, as people who live downtown, so. let's go to Todd Hayman. Todd are you here? yes, can you hear me now? I can awesome. Tony's Todd Hayman. i've been a resident of south Street Seaport for over 20 years. professionally, i'm a landscape designer, but i'm also 1 of the owners of the captain rose house has started building, which was constructed originally construction, 70 and 73 I mentioned is because I bought into the into the neighborhood. I bought my home and so many others. buildings and Water Street fronts, treat Sas, feature on row. they're architecturally significant contextual to the start page of the neighborhood. they have a certain height, mass, low density and scale. you know, and they also have a sense of history in the sense of place. constructing this building a 250 water street. while the base of it looks great. the towers bar, rights structures, surprise, soaking rates a door. they clip the character of the neighborhood. and, I do not know, I tend to think that we slowly disconnect ourselves. well, what makes the ci, port part of history ends up becoming a remnant. and it fades away over generations. Imagine rises. it loses uniqueness and eventually will be on the website forgotten New York. okay, thank you. my pleasure. thank you very much. we're going to go to. messy from the hub and then stacey show and then i'm going to butcher this name and i'm really sorry it's shy. so, in that order is still with us. it's like, yeah, let me share. hey, Nikki for E. R. okay, I see that. thank you, Tim. you're welcome you, Tammy. are you there? yes, i'm here. i'm with you. thank you. okay, I may have on the neighborhood run the jewish learning experience. how about? i'm also I live her with my wife. and 3 children, I completely understand why people would be opposed to the development that 250 water. you know, my kids go to the park and focus straight all the time. at the same time, that's what the brownfield project's all about the remediation that should be done in a safe. and transparent way, and that kind of puts us at is. the question that I ask myself and this is, I think, food for thought for everyone. is in 10 years from now I walked down water street with my kids. what are we going to see a building with. affordable housing, retail, more place for the kids to play. Rabbi do you have anything to add about the structures that they're building themselves that they're looking to construct anything about the John Street Location? the museum location the buildings themselves this is about historic preservation landmarks only so, this is. parts, so, the point i'm bringing out is, is that i'm not an architect, but I do think I'll add a lot of value, not just having that 1 building, but to the whole neighborhood as a whole. and the question is quite simple to me a parking lot versus that. I think I prefer the latter. I just wanted to check again. everyone will have a chance in the proper forum land, use to discuss peripheral, not peripheral, but adjunct elements to this discussion. we're here for a landmarks 1 way or not right? okay, thank you. thank you. Bruce. so, Pete's looking to get back. I just I got a text from him. he, he's having, you're having trouble finding him. it seems like i'm just wanting to tell you that. pete davies that pete. yes, that guy, I do not see him. his last name is Deavere. D. R. okay, gotcha. I found them there you go. thank you Tom. Jason, did you find him Jen? okay, and you did not him i, it's deborah, but it happens all the time. always has no problem. thank you. Tammy, they could use you in the bates, doing a great job. I appreciate it. yeah, I have some confusion. how many how many floors is each building? so, Chris can answer that, but I believe the total height that they're looking at if correct me if i'm wrong for 250 is 2 towers at 470 feet. total, you can argue whether that's 40 floors or 37, but the total height is 470 feet. okay, and the new that's correct. building the, thank. and the new building on John 170 feet, and the number of stories is 30. 8, but that does not the, the difference in 380 and 4, 7 day has to do with. I got the yeah, yeah. okay. and the building on Johns Street. Chris, how tall it that? contextually I do not think anybody has a problem with that. 1. do not just check in you never know. all right go ahead. you know, i, I piped in because a couple of weeks ago I was on the soccer field on the West side, and I actually disagree with catherine. I think she does a great job. excellent. but I feel like if you look downtown and you have to create in your neck to find something, that's not. a glass tower, you can hardly see any stone and that's. a different kind of lower Manhattan I think we're better than that and I think we could probably fix it on the east side, but I feel like we're getting there to, making the same mistakes. you know, I will say that overall, I was incredibly impressed by the presentation, you know, the museum looks great. I hope that you guys have the responsibility to. go with that and create it while we continue to fight about 250 water. you know, as the presentation to 250 water started, when we talked about textures and things like that. you had all the right reference in there, but then the podium starts looking a lot like the base of the gear building, which looks fake. and does not really jive, it's fine where it is, because nothing really jobs there, but where this would be is, it's important. to maintain those window frames and those things in those. Mortar as opposed to just a pre fabric, look so. I do not really think that representation of or the renderings we're consistent with the reference. i'm. I think it did start to look like glassed hours at the top of that thing and, you know, just that the lighter colors the towers are going to disengage them visually from the environment of the neighborhood. I mean, that's 80 floors of building. that roughly 80 floors that a lighter color is not going to disengage. I think Chris overall you did a good job presenting it, but. that's you know, that's back end. i'm done. awesome thank you for coming back. and thank you. I apologize. I put your name there. no, it happens all the time. so I hear what you're saying. the concerns are the height and the colors and the density. it's a, it's a density for sure. okay. who's next? you're welcome. I think stacy was not no stacy. yeah. do you see me? right? so many years ago I lived on the upper west side. I would on occasion travel down to the South Street Seaport basically to get away from it. all. I enjoy the truly unique and special place so much that 20 years ago I decided to move here. and when I moved, it was a sleepy little area I knew that downtown would not stay exactly the same. and Lo, and behold, others have found a little jewel of a neighbourhood decide to call this place home to. and what you moved in file by shops and restaurants, and then the tall building started springing up. and even if we do not love them, we have never opposed them. but just as changed the part of New York City, so is our commitment to preservation. codes are written to protect those areas, deemed to be special and irreplaceable. the South Street seaport, historic district is 1 of those places. the 1 area in our neighborhood that has been immune to the large scale development that has always been the seaport. we fought and won numerous times over the years. to keep the low scale in historic nature of the district. green open space is what makes central park, Central Park and neon and skyscrapers are what? make times where times Square. it's the low scale reinforce story building that really defined the port area. there is a place for the types of development that how we choose posing. it's just not it's 50 water street. I urge the members of this board to respect the history and character. the tiny 10 block district by respecting the hard thought. and longstanding zoning, so that you only look at proposals that are under 120 feet. okay, thank you. Jen. do we have the next to ready if not we're going to do catherine. wild. and Spencer. Spencer, if you're going to talk about the building and not cars, i'm okay with that. so it's not catherine. wild neal. and then Amy greenhouse. I do not see catherine wald on the list. she may she may have dropped off and you mentioned is a w, while day. a, Y. Nope, she may have jumped off. okay. keep going and i'm sorry, what? those other. followed by her Spencer Wolf. again, spencer, it's not about cars. okay, I want to talk about cars, but we should ban cars and lower Manhattan. I want to support the project. I think it looks great. in fact, I think it could be a lot bigger and have a lot more floors and more homes. this lower Manhattan, we built big buildings and we're going to see in the world because we do stuff like that. so, I want to support the project thing looks great. I lived in the Seaport for 3 years. I could not afford to stay there, so I did not wish I could be your neighbors, but i'm not rich enough. everyone who owns a home and seaboard is very wealthy. and you should welcome more neighbors. thank you. okay. I just have to correct that. i'm sorry that is. factually erroneous the people who live adjacent to what we're talking about South Bridge, they are not specifically not all wealthy and it's an outrageous claim to make. do not worry about it. we're good. we're moving on. I mean, lots of people say lots of things, you know, that let's do Diane Brown. Meghan Melbourne. and then Margaret flying again, but Margaret, somebody from the waterfront alliances already spoken. so, let me keep going. I apologize, we'll do an, after that. got those names yeah. Diane Bound whenever you're ready. Diane. she muted herself. okay, go on go to Megan Melbourne. it's hard because I know we offered people the option because it was so late to jump off. hi, can you hear me? yes, I can. hi. thanks for. letting me speak. my name is Megan. Malvern. I wanted to start my comments with something that I believe someone from the said it was the least clots worth when she was asked about what the choices were being made about how some of the things seemed a little bit incongruous. and her response was, we want to have a presence in the district. I do not think that's the appropriate way to handle being in a historic district. from what i've seen. the only thing that that's appropriate with is the character of the Howard Hughes flashy and awkward presence in the salty slice of the city. but I also think it's important to point out that much of the testimony being offered and supported the towers, have financial strings that already tie back to Howard Hughes. so that should be kept in mind. I call the support home since 2009, and i've raised my children on the cobblestones of this neighborhood. i'm testifying and opposition to the development proposals being put forward by the Hughes corporation as the plans are far from appropriate in bulk or scale. and as a result, the buildings are visually insulting. to the low rise nature and the very fabric of the historic district. this project will complete this project will compete rather than defer to the visual provenance. that is the birthplace of New York City. this project simply does not meet the legal standards set out in landmark's law. additionally, complicating the process is the coupling of many projects across this unique and continually threatened district. for these, and many other reasons stated by the multitudes of opponents have already spoken before me against this. I urged the community board, not only to reject monstrous proposal. but also to admonish the constant on slot, other grotesquely inappropriate projects inside this tiny and space. thanks for your time. thank you. I have a thank you. very much for coming. I have a question is jared brown. who's hand up actually, Diane Brown. can you check that? are you there with us? is this diane brown? or jared Brown. no, they're muted again, you know, who we did not get shy. going to really kill this 1. Shy up there with us. I have immediate. you, it's okay. it's my name is shy. volunteer, because it's a tie name. they're not pronounced the way they're spelled. i'm sorry it's fine. it's the tie people's revenge for the king and I speaking of which. when I would come here as a child with my mother, she. i'm from Pennsylvania originally she always made a point of bringing me. to the South Street seaport, and I loved it as a child as if it's a piece of history yesterday, there was always the tall buildings and the fast paced life of New York, but I loved to walk in the top of stones. I loved seeing the tall ships as I cross to. front in South Street. this is a joel of the city, and it would be a shame to bury that. Joel. in tall grasses and instant. it seems to me that this developers presenting this community with a false economy. the choice is not between a 470 foot. Glass tower and parking lot the choice is not even between 120 foot. a building, which I believe was in the original quote, unquote compromise that so called compromise seems to be a bit of a bait and switch really. any development there should not be in line with the existing historic buildings. and the arguments to the contrary. seem opportunistic quite frankly, you know, who, who does not cut down the forest. to preserve the zoo, a library does not burn the books to preserve the library. the 1st, goal of a super museum should be to preserve the support. and that's, that's all I really had to say. do not kill the arbitrage. the Brian, the ancient Mariner does not speak, you know. the sailor coming home to see sports center. okay, thanks. I appreciate that. thank you very much. Michelle. Coopersmith. can you hear Dianne Harris Brown? I can are you still with me. is Michelle Coopersmith still here? hi, yes. hi, Michelle. hi, thank you for calling me. my name is Michelle Coopersmith. I am a resident of CD 3, which borders? CD 1, but I work at 85 broadstreet, which is almost at the tip of the island and pre covered times. i'd walk past the site nearly every day, when I would walk to work. and what I have to say is as an american history major in college. my understanding is that there were no cars in the 16 hundreds when the Seaport was rising from the original part of the city and so I wonder how a parking lot can be called contextual as it currently stands. I believe that the development is respectful, given the constraints in the neighborhood. and overall, this is a city. not a museum, which is why we have the support museum and many, many blocks of preserved buildings. and I think the developers have done a good job of creating what would be a development that fits in with the character the neighborhood while bringing additional people in the neighborhood. because land marketing is traditionally exclusionary, which I believe is why the district is probably 72% white, which is not the makeup of the city. so, in some asian, I am in support of this project, and I hope that the committee would consider passing resolution and support of it. thank you. thank you very much and moving on Lucas Miller. no, if he's still here and let me just check. all right working through. Tom, you already spoke, I think you're a board member, Thomas so can you put your hand down Jason Cast? Jason, are you there with us? and still try, you can turn off the. okay, let's move on Chris White. it's been everybody, thank you. thanks for letting me speak for a minute. I thought the John Tree Lot. Presentation was very strong. i'm not sure why they are being presented together. though, because John Street seems less contentious and respectful, and it's something that I would be in support of. but 250 water is completely different. and the idea of towers. in a historic district, obviously extremely contentious and difficult to accept. not only that I wanted to ask why. why, if towers were obviously against the. they just did the districts heights. why? why put 2 of them there rather than propose. 1, iconic tower, if you're going to try to propose towers at all, why? why 2? and not 1. and, have you considered any proposal without any towers? is that, or is that something that you are looking at? in addition to. a Tower proposal. Chris, do you want to go to the 2 tower versus 1 time, or you want me to speak to it? just speak to it. yes, I'll start with the tower versus 1 and that is, you know, we have looked at options. which was a single tower, which makes it a taller tower. and the thought from community feedback with the. the actual number of hype was important and so we took the height of the of the buildings along water Street to set the set of data for the tallest building. and that's why we ended up coming to. 2 buildings that would hit that height versus 1 that broke above that. and so it was really it was a way of bringing the overall. hi, Sam. and to get the, and that was that was the logic for that. and to answer the 2nd question yeah. I mean, obviously, if this were not to move forward, then we would come back with the right and who landmarks for that I should say the 120 feet maximum at that point. and the 2 are some are connected only because without 1, you do not really have the other. so that's the answer to the 1st, part of a comment. oh, you were saying that if 250 orders it's not accepted as is, you will not go ahead with. go ahead. i'm sorry I did not hear that. no, go ahead with. why are you saying that? 250 won't have to be amended towers do not go ahead. Jones Street Cold yeah. I think what enables us to fund the museum with 50 M dollars to start to finish the drawings and also to proceed with it is that money. I do not think the museum has money to fund plans or anything like that. let alone long term, but I'll let Jonathan speak to that. I mean, yes, it is correct to say that the construction of the John Street building and indeed the completion of phase 1. and the funding of the reliable recurring revenue stream is reliant on a building at 250 water in the way that this is being proposed. that's correct. i'm here and nothing. is it can you hear me. knocking girlfriend, I was me I apologize. that was me, my kids came to say goodnight. sorry. did you did you folks here? my comment. yeah, I think the answer was, yes, unless Howard Hughes gets to build the powers that they want. that they will not pay for the funding for the museum. that was quite clear. Saul said it. okay, Maggie, the law. Tommy, I believe we skipped Neil clarity. oh, sorry. go for go for Neil. and then Maggie sure. whenever you raise it themselves, you hear me? yes. okay. thank you. my name is neal. Flirty. i'm testifying and support long term preservation of the South Street Seaport museum. I worked in the financial district for 20 years, and see him volunteer for almost 40 alongside the funding founding chairman of the museum Jaco, his branson, restoring the ship waiver tree things from him most importantly value. that brings to our community and city. this museum is more than just about ships, it can access to our cities history and the people who built it incredible as far city to the collections, the maps and the historic artifacts not to mention all the by got bygone skills and culture that it helps keep alive I myself have learned old skills, such as hot, riveting, which i've been able to pass along to another generation of volunteers and demonstrate to the public showing them what it took to build, not only ships, but the buildings and bridges around them. these are resources that should be available for all. the museum is faced trying times with 911, hurricane Sandy, the 2008 crash and now covert. we're told the museum has about 18 months to write the ship. that's not much time. we're at a crossroads and choose to support this crucial culture, Jim or not. I say we must there are people who my respect that say that they support the museum, but not this mechanism. Neil yes. please. this is not about we need to stick to topic. this is landmarks. this is not about funding the museum. all right I understand. that's the byproduct of it, but this is about the buildings. can you stick them? you have anything questions to ask about the buildings? no, I appreciate your time. and I just wanted to express my support for the project that would provide financial stability for the museum and its needs. and I will submit the rest of my comments in writing. thank you. perfect, thank you. Maggie, the wall and then rebecca at all. Maggie, whenever you're ready, i'm here. hi everybody I just wanted to 1st of all like, i'm a resident of the downtown area, and I just wanted to echo what Paul gold soon was saying that. you know, this, these buildings that they're proposing are. so much higher than what the law calls for I mean, and on top of it, there are 2 of them. so when we wrote those stakeholder meetings that how would you put together. a lot of the people there were opposed to. building above 120 foot restriction and they're proposing 470 feet that's 300% increase in height restriction, which is a lot higher. the 2nd thing I wanted to point out is. in the proposal tonight, you guys were Chris was talking about how, when you look at the Seaport along the waters in front of the district, and this 250 water street is at the back of the district. so, I do not know what that means that maybe this area does not necessarily count. it's at the back. it does not have to fall under the same rules and laws that the rest of the district falls under, but it's a pretty substantial part of the area. it's almost 10% of the residential area. it's a whole block. so I think to look away from that is. it could set precedent and what would that mean for other historic districts? down the road, so i'm in opposition and thank you. okay next it's almost 1030. i'm just curious how many more speakers are there i'm going to have to go over to Greenwich meantime at 11? yeah, I hear you. so, I want to make sure we're trying to get us through as many as we can. so, i'm okay, Bruce, if the public is okay, and you can text the host, we will have another session on this because it is 1022 in December, which we will hopefully have shared the shade. studies we'll have other views and other things that are significant for the landmarks application and. I had Maggie Dole, I called her name, so I can say we would take 2 more people, and then end it or 3 and end it there. if that works. do you want to do that? 1st or just I leave it up to you. I think it's a good idea. we have. actually, been here. oh, going on. well, our end, it you are losing people right? and left at least perfect. so here's what here's what Jen's going to do Jen's going to put into the chat how you can submit written testimony please know that there will be another. meeting in December on this, and we will do the business of the board at that point. we'll reverse it a little bit. if you've come. if you came this time, we would not ask that you speak again in December, we're going to try and recognize anybody who has not spoken organizations who have not had a chance to send anybody to speak because they are on both sides of the fence here. so, we really want to make sure that we get everybody in. I have some questions that i'd like Chris and the team to come back with. i'd like to see. which, and then i'm going to close it so, for our presenters, I would like to see it does seem like the base is in correct me if i'm wrong different sides of the base are different architecturally as well as the towers. can I observe that? is it the. the expression of the of the podium is consistent on all 4 sides, but the heights vary as you move around that podium. so, we'd like to see the owners are lower, for instance, in and Water Street. is lower than Pearl Street so i'd like to see the i'd like to see far more presentations. so people can understand what it looks like. and while you may think it's a, a funky look to have a wider look. people do not only look at ground level when they're walking and they look up. so we would like to see all the expressions. i'd like to understand how you feel that, like, some of the speakers have said that what you've presented architecturally helps to frame when it is the largest building within the neighboring areas. there is not a building in the historic district, or even across the street. that is the same height and you showed us buildings in the neighboring height. there is not another building that's as tall as this or several. so, i'd like to understand you've shown us that i'd like to see how that fits in because it does not did not seem to mesh to my look. i'd like to understand the height differential between the new building on John Street to the rest of the area and what the views look like around that building as well. but it would look like from 1 of the ships. that's associated if you were standing on the ship, or on peer 1516, what that building looks like in context to everything else. because it did feel very modern to me, even though it could be brown or it could be green and i'd love to see what those look like from different view corridors as well. all right. okay so I think that right so we will show that within 2 blocks, there are other buildings over 400 feet, and we can show the heights and buildings in context Water Street. that's what I was referring to previously, and we can also show views from the waterfront looking. towards the west, I think that's going to 2 points. and from the east, I mean, if you're standing to the North South East West, what are these buildings look tenuous? yes. and quite frankly, the buildings that you're referring to are outside of the historic district, correct that are similar in height. there and what we call 100, but buildings inside the historic district. that is correct and there is no, there is no building across the street or next door, or even Caddy corner. that is the same correct. this would be the tallest away into the. area that we have already said was fine for building as of right for towers. outside of historic district? yes. 1 Block South. correct? yeah, yes, 1 block sounds over the historic district, which is 3 blocks south from your building or 4 correct? well, 1, 199 water is. we can show it on the map and then we do not need to dispute the 1 block. okay. but well, yeah, maybe, but it is it's just south of Fulton Street, which is a block south of. right. so definitely want to make sure that we understand and that the public understands what we're talking about in terms of the reference about that. okay, okay. that would be important because it. yeah, and then somebody commented about the height of the Brooklyn bridge to the height of the towers. if you can come back and give us an understanding because. from what I saw, just in the renderings that I saw the buildings that seemed to stick out from the landscape and equal to. what you're presenting are the building over it? 2 bridges that looks like the cheese greater building and then the Gary building. those were the ones that I saw mostly as a comparison of framing, which. understand we are half of the height of those buildings. so, we can, we can diagram the heights of all the contextual buildings. ok, and then what guarantees when you go to landmarks, are there for. the materials that you have presented as being the only. those that will be allowed to be used if the building is not built by Howard hughes and the buildings are sold. i'm sorry, i, you repeat the question, you broken in the middle. if you go to landmarks and everything is approved, what guarantees does the community have from a landmarks perspective? for the materials, and the style that you have presented as being the template for the next developer. please do you want to jump in? sure. go ahead, Frank. I can do it for the police wants to jump in and be good. right? can you hear me? yep. the Max Commission would have to review any changes that would ever be proposed by for him that was approved, whether it was the same owner or somebody else. so the commission controls that. so the only thing that we really need to worry about here beyond what you're talking about is really the height. and whether the height is contextual is that a fair statement? Bruce? Muted. i'm sorry at that very moment. the 1st time I was responding to someone by email who yeah, no, I saw. yeah. so, will you please. they were not so, my observation is if. we go through all of this, and we opine on the specifics for the brick and the colors and the copper and everything else if power to use for some. for any reason whatsoever decides not to develop these buildings and they sell. right. they fell 250 water. none of this dialogue, except for the height of the building in our perspective on the of the base and the height. will matter, because they will all have to come back with new designs. either they build exactly what LPC approved. in the sale that the transfer of the of the. design is replicated by the new. developer as per LPC approval, or it's from scratch again. could see, is that true? Bruce, that they can't sell it and say, i'm sorry, we can't do the design. it's too expensive. we can't blah, blah then they have to be submitted do design for Lpc. correct correct? and pcs approval has a time period after which it can be renewed, but there does come. and expiration point I forget after how many years? something like 8 or 9 years. okay, great. and then just to clarify for the community. the presentation by included, the buildings that were for the South Street Seaport museum as Jonathan represented, and that is on behalf of edc because neither the museum nor Howard Hughes owned the building lot on John Street, nor the museum itself. Sol, is that correct? repeat that question 1 more time. the presentation tonight with him on the John Street Lot, and all of the changes. yes. technically, for the city, because they own all of that you have an option for John Street, but they own the others. yeah, so, let me just clarify the owner are we signed to the application which in this case is the city of New York just like, they've always find file the application for pure 17 or 10 building or whatever it is. and then we file along as the lessee. this is all ground least if you remember. so, for the portion of the museum space that is currently lease by the Sasha Port Museum. they would be signing as the applicant as well as for the job lot but to answer your question yes, we do have a right of 1st, refusal on this job a lot, but it has not come to us yet by. so, we have a right of 1st refusal when that, when that site does go. sale or performance and so would you be able to. do me a favor meet yourself? me. yeah okay. sorry it just when you talk, I get feedback. could you please. would you be able to commit in writing to come back to the Landmark Committee if there are any changes that are planned? and that promise goes with any sale, or assignment of any of the spaces we've looked at today. as far as materiality, or, I mean, just in general yes, we have no intention of. of changing anything without coming back to the Community Board and marks in preparation for the next meeting. could you possibly I just want to add that once there's a public hearing on these applications and Lpc. the 2 of them, the developer, the applicant LPC or LPC separately. Kevin probably will make changes and that would not as of right come back to us. that's why i'm asking if he will commit to come back to us. i'm sure it public engagement. i'm sure there's some language that we could come up with collectively that would work for both sides under that circumstance. so okay. a couple other questions, just to close out the meetings. when you come back, we'd love to see a section. you know, 250 water. and, you know, kind of floor plans of the base. so we can understand it and its wholeness of the podium and the power. if possible if that's possible and then to understand, do you. Howard Hughes, if this is approved. is funding the construction of John Street. or only the planning, what is. the commitment there, our commitment is to give the South Street Seaport Museum. 15 M dollars, and for the museums Board to decide. what, how to spend that 15 m that's not going to be directed by us. so, once that pot of money is to them, if you are not involved with the construction, or purchase of John Street, no, we would at that time, give up our right of 1st, refusal on the jobs to lot and transfer that right over to the museum. and we would not be involved in the development or the construction, unless the museum were to want our help in developing it, implementing it or anything like that. but our, our current plan is, we would, we would send over the 50 M dollars at that point. and it would be up to them to decide how they wanted to move forward. you know, at the next meeting, I will leave some time for the museum to talk about that only because we were the community understood a different aspect of it. we did not if you're doing general concepts, but you're not doing the plans and helping with the construction of the building, then that's something that may never happen. if they need that 50 m for their operation. yeah, I think the current plan that we've worked with the museum, and it's is that they would like to put in Jonathan you should jump in here if i'm saying anything beyond but they would like to put 40 M dollars in endowment, which would allow them to keep the doors open without having to have a new building, and then have to come back and say they're broke, which some users have done. the balance of 10 M dollars would reopen phase 1 and create that card or area that. connection between the new and the old to the extent that costs more than 10 M dollars, which we're out pricing it right now the 1st phase we've committed to working with Jonathan to make sure that we get that phase open. whether it's to me value engineering or whether it's to contribute more money or raise more money. we've committed to phase 1 opening, which was discussed with Christopher in this presentation. but that's. it's 1 is not the John Street building phase. 1 is only that glass. Attachment Correct. Jonathan, do you want to explain what phase 1 is? I think sort of to start in reverse order here. I think the, the museum's plan is informed by a deep study of the long term issues. those issues that have to do with lack of reliable, recurring revenue that i'm trying to answer your question. we do not want to talk about this. i'm sorry we won't, but what we're trying to understand is, is the building is whether or not the building is through this conversation. what is being presented is that yes, we want, you know, we understand the museum. where you are, but we're also reviewing plans for a John Street building that if I understand correctly is not funded the construction, nor the design these are conceptual plans but the, that's all i'm asking and I apologize. I do not mean to be rude Jonathan. i'm just trying to understand about the construction aspect of the John Street building, just that right? so the proposed 50 M dollars, which is around number, that actually has thought behind it informs the funding of 40 m dollar endowment. the purpose of which is long term sustainability. the remaining fund to solve, just mentioned would satisfy that with some things that we're still working on, including our own FEMA money would satisfy the completion of phase. 1. Phase 1, as has designed it, and it's very thoughtful and respectful to the row. would allow us to reopen the museum into the historic galleries and we'll provide a forward compatible link building. meaning elevators, escalators a track the whole works that works with the historic galleries, and then works forward compatibly with the new building. but that would form the basis of then our opportunity to using the design and a stable foundation to raise the money necessary to build a new building. so, it is effectively phase 1 and phase 2. so, any questions your eyebrows are still up, i'm happy to clarify. on how much do you approximate? you are designed that you present it tonight? will cause, you know, design on John straight. I'll have to give that over to him. so am I do not have that estimate. good question. yeah. good question. it's way more than 50 m. so this is just stopped buying the sky because there's no way we can afford to build that building for 50000000. well, you well, we need the museum to have been running character character, right? what phase? and. yeah, 50 m dollars. is a reasonable, budget for everything that we have proposed tonight. but the question is, what is the 50 M dollars going to be used for? 1st? and so I do not think it's fair to characterize the proposal is costing more than 50 M dollars. in fact, it's, it's inaccurate, but what's the but the 50 M dollars. what captain bull where will explain is that. there is stabilization of the institution. that is being prioritized over the full build out of both phases. and so when the 50 M dollars, it was really a question. so the, but what is but the brick and mortar question, tammy that you that you have been asking us. so definitively is the brick and mortar question of phase 1. is the guaranteed portion in the in the immediate future? and that is the restoration of the full 10 cherry hotel building. and the 1st, counting how to. the West and the 1st, counting house to the south and so those who that historic cluster of buildings is being stored is Frank presented tonight and it's being modernized with. mechanical equipment that is resilient. to prevent the problem that we had the 1st go around. and also providing a accessibility to all 6 floors of the museum. which also, that's not the case today, is that the glass enclosure is the accessibility model for that's the reason. that's correct. and that also the link between the low building, and the cluster of storage structures on the corner. so that is really that, I mean, I think that for bruce and for the committee, it's important to understand, and the public is, that's really what this is about everything that we looked at for John Street is a lovely idea. but it's not being funded through this mechanism. what this mechanism is doing is building the accessibility and helping the museum reopen, but it is not funding or constructing the new building. it's not the plans for the new building detailed. it's not the construction and the community kind of needs to understand that, because I do not think that is really clear. I think that the community in the last 5 hours, I did not know that linkage and this is paying for the. so, the, the new building per se. it is, it is a hopeful future for the museum, but it does it is not. before we get to the future, it funds reopening the museum makes Brandon. we understand that it funds the reopening. it funds the accessibility the glass tower allows the galleries to be reached by everyone possible but it does not. it's a brick and mortar question that I ask it funds the glass. it does not fun. John Street. that's correct. it's correct. but I would like to add 1 element to that because it's something that many members of this committee many members of the Community Board and indeed. many of our members Donors board member supporters have raised overtime is the long term sort of, vicissitudes of the museum, the number of times at which and Bruce mentioned it earlier this evening number of times the story has been at the museum is struggling. that is solved by this. the vehicle of the, let me just finish my thought, please, the vehicle of the endowment is the difference between a museum that is sustainable over long term and not. and my prediction as a professional nonprofit leader over in nearly 30 years, is that. at the end of this pandemic and result in economic fall out, there will be a very high correlation between endowed museums and survival. understood, but in the context of landmark preservation, Jonathan, for what we're talking about in this particular thing, and where we have to opine, we are talking about the brick and mortar. that's what we are reviewing here. I understand what you're saying. and we've had long discussions about many things about that, but that people need to know that sorry. okay, I just wanted to add 1 thing that I think might have been confusing in the conversation. Howard Hughes is paying for the design of John Street live with out of pocket. because we, from what we understand speaking to other museums and other cultural institutions, it's really impossible for the museum to raise funds, even with the 50 m dollars to go out and raising any other endowment or funds to date. it's really impossible without having a plan of what they're planning on building. so this project will be put, put the museum in a position where they can go out with these plans to fund the construction of the expansion. and that's why we've been paying and we'll pay to finish the plans for change in the perspective. what we just. for 5 points a cost, the cost of design. the, the cost of design pails next to the. construction number 1, and number 2 I just want to say. Brendan, that the exact same scenario that you describe has come to us. for review and consideration, usually in a positive way. before the 21 years i've been on the board, and for the last 30 years, when i've been a resident and each, and every time the sponsoring facility has gone bankrupt before the museum was funded. and before that, the money must transfer before the building before the approvals are final. you are going to get objection from us on this point that, like, this is, we could not agree with you more. and that is something that needs to be crystal clear in this. so, I want, I want to just say 1 other thing. I mean, we tried to make it clear at the beginning, but we were also told that this was not about funding the museum and the details of that. so I just want we were not this thing. this was, this was the way the meeting was directed so I just wanted to be clear on that. Brandon. totally fair. I understand that. but at that point, we should not. I have issues about talking about the brick and mortar when it's not necessarily relevant. it is relevant in some ways, but it is not integral to. the part that's most integral to making all of this work is the glass house, getting the museum back open and we opine in landmarks on that aspect for the historic building. I know we need to. have an understanding of why we're appointing on John Street at all, but that's a question for the city. and that's something that i'm happy to have a conversation with on. and ask them to come to the next meeting and answer that question, because maybe they have it in their heads. if they're going to develop it. if you're so gracious as to have the plans all paid for. but that's a question that should answer for us. I think we're a pining on it because we want to find out if these guys are serious about. building it or if they just want to make money to 50 yeah. going on that note, we look forward to seeing the question. is this appropriate or not but would you please tell us how many units are affordable units? no, no. all right. so, no, no. could somebody please if this is not an approval of. next time could somebody please tell us what i'd like to know what the percentages we have? we have a website and a fact sheet that we, you can go and look on all that and nicole available. saying, so that was easy. thank you. thank you. thank you. exactly, let's it. we will see you in December we look forward to getting the other information that we asked for and. if community board members have questions, I ask that you email them to Jennifer and to manno 1 so we can forward them all. so, Chris and Jonathan and Saul, and their whole team can be ready with any outstanding questions. so we can go forward from there. thank you. thank you, Tammy. thank you. thank you. bye everybody. bye bye. thank you. bye.
