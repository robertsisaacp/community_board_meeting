This is we've offered up this time to have conversations, questions that you'd like to ask the applicants on these applications in terms of their environmental impact statements and on issues dealing with environmental protection, concerns.
Excuse me, the land, the zoning land use and zoning committee on December 14th next week, which point we may add in comments on the EIS, or we may have time for a separate, meeting, I think in January for those issues.
Questions just have more time to talk about what concerns and thoughts the public have in terms of environmental impact statement on 250 water street, the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
We were happy to post this again and a positive declaration issued on November 16th established that the proposed actions may indeed have a significant adverse impact on the environment, thus warranting the preparation of an EIS which is pretty standard protocol, so the environmental impact statement, so the public interested agencies, Manhattan community, district, 1 and elected officials, are invited to comment on the draft scope, either in writing or orally, At a public scoping meeting to be held on December 17th at 2, pm.
If there's issues and things that you'd like to have considered Diana will be taking notes and questions will be fielded to Howard, Hughes and DCP.
Okay, Some of the areas that we want them to study more closely are about shadows, specifically the Pearl Street playground, the tree canopies along Pearl Street at Delores, Square Park, the Peck Slip school roof playground how it impacts the blue school and the Seaport district.
Water and sewer infrastructure was certainly concerned about the cso being over capacity already at Newtown Creek, and the cumulative impact on infrastructure, resources and city services with proposed towers and then also whatever is going to happen at two bridges.
It's going to be needed to support a huge tower, We're very concerned about the carbon footprint that this development will create and then, finally, We're very concerned about the effect of the five-year construction timeline on the adjacent schools and on the residents who are at the moment trapped in their homes.
I mean they have a grid that runs from basically the river all the way up to Pearl Street, okay, anything else, good, okay, David, thanks, Susan, Cole I, see your hand raised Susan.
You want to sure when Alice was talking about the changed date, that was for the community board, one landmarks and preservation committee, which was originally on December 10th, The 250 water street project is currently at the LPC stage or the landmarks Preservation Commission stage.
Look like, but I will tell you that I have a significant concern, because I have a husband who has significant medical issues and without knowing the information as far as what the results are, and there was also a comment which I'm not going to hold them to it- that there was an expectation that this excavation would start in February.
All of the concerns that Michael had expressed, If you can basically include our building, is literally called Seaport Park Condominium Association, if you're going to envelop the Super Park Condominium Association onto all of the things that were just expressed exp, especially from the noise and also public health, standpoint, I am work from home.
Unless I'm speaking around about the agency, there was they're talking about a citywide text, amendment that is going to be implemented for all buildings in high risk flood zones.
We have 40 percent of New Yorkers that earn a hundred thousand dollars and over hoping to leave New, York and 40 of our luxury housing, sitting vacant, and so the question is: Why is mayor De Blasio, allowing any of this to go through much less interfering with our historic districts and disrupting the intellectual, the architectural integrity of the seaports of Tribeca, our lofts 385Greenwich aka 71, North Moore.
Mih is to attract businesses from other states and in other words Google and Amazon, and whoever else it is so that I just think that given half of the mayor's staff has, you know, abandoned ship, we don't have Maria Torres stringer by the way my case pushed the loft bill, passed the Senate in Assembly, with Senators Hoyleman, Squadron and Debbie Glick.
Obviously we wouldn't want to see that straight across the street and a little side note is in looking a little bit at Howard, Hughes Corp, one of the things they're being sued for right, now, Is, not adequately storm proofing properties that they sold.
Okay, I, don't know it's not going to be too concerns that are realistic and will need to be mitigated.
Just in the beginning of this discussion, You said that right now is the chance for the community to weigh in on what they would like included in the scope of the environmental review.
You know if the zoning for coastal resiliency goes through, then that changes the height and the landscape for shade studies, and things like that.
That part of the way to do that is to address it in the environmental review process and have a plan for mitigation of both the pollution and the noise impact which is going to be huge.
Every single day, So I think we do need to have a plan that will actually be able to address that, and it will go on for years and I.
So, I'd, really like to know the impacts that this would have and what mitigation could be done for that community, which is living right, which are living right across the street, and many of them are disabled.
Coming back to the point or the issue that's been raised repeatedly about schools when Wendy was mentioning the experience with 234, I'm wondering if there's any value in actually citing specific examples, where, despite representations and extensive efforts to mitigate the issues, they were not effective and we're concerned about a repeat in this instance.
If we can actually cite specific examples, I think it's a great resource to use examples in history, not repeating itself as Beerus, pointing out with the borough based jails, application of this absolutely with ps234.
All right, I have see a hand from I, don't know I, think Carrie.
And I know over 20,000 square feet of retail space that would likely displace many of the historical bars and restaurants that make up the fabric of the Seaport and the longevity of those bars and restaurants, many of which have gone back for centuries and time before the Brooklyn bridge will be impacted economically by having another 20,000 square feet in retail space.
I, usually say: Caton Catone, Hi James, so James Catone, the resiliency planner, with the land use division at the New York City Council was very kind to volunteer and come today to help us out to just discuss further thoughts.
The proposal would also provide flexibility for grading and shoreline design in waterfront areas to help mitigate flood risk and will prohibit the construction of new nursing homes in high risk areas, given the negative health consequences associated with evacuating nursing home residents.
So the goal, as you read off there of this text amendment, is to provide additional flexibility in the city's floodplains to facilitate resilient building renovation projects and new construction to allow the zoning to better accommodate what the building code requires.
I'm happy to you, know, answer questions as they come up in the discussion with respect to community board.
The new flood text, the resiliency text, will control in the in cases where there's a conflict and the main situations where I saw that might be of concern to the committee and to residents is primarily with respect to how building height would be measured and for area ratio.
So in trifecta and battery Park city building height is measured from the curb height on governor's island.
The zoning text allows is, for you to measure your building height from the base, flood elevation or from an alternative reference plane that you can set at 10 feet above grade.
What that effectively means is that in some parts of these special purpose, districts say in Tribeca or in battery park city, if you were building a new building, effective height limits, are essentially increased by 10 feet, to accommodate more restricted uses on the ground floors and in basement levels of building and flood plain to kind of incentivize and make and provide increased flexibility to design designers, architects and professionals in historic districts.
So thank you and Allison is a person who can help us a great deal in answering some questions on this zoning for coastal flood, resiliency, so, and also governor's island and probably a million other things so anyway.
Anyone just to remind everyone tonight is a conversation again, giving us a little additional time to look at this city-wide zoning text amendment and ask our questions.
You are okay, I, really think we have a meeting with our landmarks group because, like what I think is that this zone and makes a lot of steps if I were a building owner in the South Street Seaport or on the front of this tavern block.
You know I would want to build another story, talk, but I wouldn't want to have to spend my whole life dealing with our landmarks committee on the community board or the Landmarks Commission.
And I feel the same way about the shoreline after natural shoreline, which is you know, Unless the shoreline slopes inward open space, it can't place word beyond the bulkhead because of DEC regulations and this city, planning.
I just want to make sure that it's coordinated with them and that you know, if there's any guidelines that we need to have that are specific to our historic districts.
You know that we really start to think about them, because I just hate like I'll, give you an example of where I'm coming from.
We had to discuss this for a long time and that just seemed absurd to me, because, obviously, If you're going to have green roofs, you need to have a way to get for everybody, even people in wheelchairs to get to them, You know, and so my concern is that, as a community board member we're going to end up talking ad nauseam about somebody's building, an extra story on their building on water, Street or front street, or something when they should just be able to do it, and you know, like somebody's gonna, say: Oh it's too modern to this.
In the last few years, In Tribeca, where you know a building owner, has gone through a special permit process to add an additional story onto their building in a historic district.
You know, I think it's maybe a conversation for you all to have at the committee level of if you feel strongly that projects that come in that seek that additional height for resiliency purposes should be.
You know a private property will be directly on the shoreline, but those particular provisions really don't have a lot of applicability in community district.
But I will say you know other, but other waterfront projects I mean now I'm using my community board time for something professional.
It overrides the existing text, amendment, that is I, think you're, referring to the South Street Seaport subdistrict in lower Manhattan, which, where the 120 feet rule applies, So it allows for that 120 feet to be measured from a different point, which is 10 feet above so it's effectively resulting in.
After this meeting on, you know, retreat I would love to do that, Thanks, awesome, I, believe the question there is referring to the special coastal high risk zone overlay, which is a tool that the Department of city planning has to limit density in areas of special high risk and the two neighborhood actions that are moving forward at the same time.
Is the communication of these things with all of these owners of different kinds that someone contemplated, how to present this to them and how to make it possible for them to work with these new changes, because even to understand these things within the context of a community board, is taxing to someone like me, anyway, and to lots of owners.
You know, I, Think a lot of what you're we're talking about you know is in regards to from the property owner's perspective of concerns about finances and insurance, and you know communication of this information in a manageable way.
And I think that's all really important, and I'm so glad to hear you know you Community board, member, raising those concerns.
Amendment is about the special zone that you're referring back to Howard Beach I am confused and concerned only because three board, one in Manhattan, was so highly affected from super storm Sandy and your modeling of the map with the new overlay, certainly changes so much of the landscaping community board one to ask: Why aren't we actually included.
If the coverage needed to be adjusted so drastically for community board one knowing that we have historic districts, knowing that we were flooded, Why are we looking at additional density and far giveaways when we fall into the exact verbiage that you describe in the text amendment as not preferable for that.
Think that, from the perspective of the Department of City planning, Manhattan community board, one is the place where zoning will is going to have to be assumed to be playing in conjunction with large infrastructure projects in the long run.
The interplay of the historic district and the coastal resiliency and the height and the contextuality and the heights of the buildings and usage on ground level are critical to keeping you know.
I feel like I would be surprised if someone who owned a you know six story attached, building, The, first 30 feet of the ground floor far would be.
Allison knows exactly what I'm talking about, and those are the kinds of loopholes while not intended are very viable and actually very flexible for the owners to a level that does not serve us as community benefit.
I've answered this question in some contexts, without pointing out that actually, the current temporary provisions in zoning allow for a property owner to exempt the total ground floor area of the building if they do a dry floodproofing, whereas the tech that this text amendment reduces that to only the first 30 feet from the street frontage, and the reason that has been changed is that there were some projects that DCP noticed where developers were building an unusually short, first floor, so that they could capture that benefit and make a taller building.
You know I, think I'd, ask if you're gonna provide these in written form.
Does that mean that if that 10 percent maximum building height of 300 feet, then 330 feet, I'm thinking of a very specific situation, like governor's, island, sure yeah, because that sounds like that's.
Out, but, for instance, in a property like 250 water or for the governor's island, buildings, That's, all street frontage essentially, and it's a significant amount.
Absolutely I mean we discussed this when I, When we presented at the land, use, Committee and I, you know I think it's a very good point, Yes, email.
There I know that one thing that this text does that, if one of the things that the city-wide text amendment does it applies outside of the flood plain, is it allows power systems like batteries or solar panels as permitted obstructions, so it.
I guess this text allows backup power as a permitted obstruction for most buildings in most places, but I, don't know a great deal more detail than that.
You know I just think when you're doing a new update in terms of you, know, flood mitigation, you know part of it is people want to make their buildings green at the same time.
But, But I just keep thinking that you know batteries and solar panels and everything else are coming as well, just if someone's going to take the time to upgrade their building.
Think nursing homes are kind of exemplary of the type of population that were aiming at I, don't know if there's other specific buildings or use groups that would fall into that category.
Being that that's a population where even evacuating is kind of traumatic, Hospitals, I, just think of other use groups, it just I know this is a question that came up before.
Would the requirement of you know a 40-foot minimum width of the promenade and others are over that, in other words, permitted obstructions that are described in the zoning for coastal flood resiliency text are those the same.
But I think that's a governor's island question more than a phone infrastructure.
Sure, I, know, governor's island is probably on the line right now, so maybe they want to already jump in.
I think we are going to move on to that unless I, don't actually I want to open it up to the Diana.
It's really kind of simple: If we're not talking about a historic building renovation, why does the city feel the need to give financial incentives to a developer, building new construction for taking resiliency measures in a flood, zone, I, And, I, think Rosa or sorry.
So, sorry, I'm, probably missing the person's name who spoke earlier, You, know, I, think this is something that, as a city-wide text, if you're considering this from all perspectives, so, for example, I am a you know, somebody who just bought a I, don't know vacant loss exists in New York, but I bought a you, know, vacant thousand square foot, lot.
You know those costs are expensive and yes doing something new versus renovating something is always going to be less expensive, but it's still expensive to build something to be in a resilient, form.
I think it's helpful to keep that in mind that this is a city-wide text amendment and not all of New York City, the majority of New York City, looks very different from community board one, and you know these provisions are trying to meet the needs of everyone.
The text as proposed I, Think that you know the way that it utilizes the way these buildings will utilize.
To, lower Manhattan, thanks, And I- would guess the city at some point has to kind of identify why this approach in the flood zone.
I. Think that there's a lot of problems with the way the text is written and how it overly incentivizes the new builds I just want some.
The community board to be aware of all the different ways it can be impacting I think that I this text is really about coastal resiliency and I, Understand the scenario that you're lying out there.
And, therefore they're the benefit that they receive, specifically on those types of projects or like governors island, and this is unfortunate because your text amendment is coming up exactly when we are reviewing these two specific properties.
Sorry is that right, the 21st I'm constantly, and so please do send all your questions and comments that you would like included at that time, because, obviously, at one meeting it would we're not going to have you know hours to flush it all out.
You know it's like the trifecta, so you went from 250 water street to the citywide coastal zoning text, amendment and.
Tonight, we're talking just a little bit about environmental impact, specifically as it concerns resiliency and sustainability.
And, so hopefully folks have a chance to have thought a little bit about that and engage in questions, thoughts, concerns, and even if you haven't read it just general environmental concerns on the island that you'd like to have addressed.
Anyone in the committee have anything that they'd like to speak about in terms of governors, Island, Resiliency, Sustainability, environmental impacts, wow, surprising.
If there's you know, technical questions or concerns and Sarah wants me to jump in, then I'm happy to do so, but I leave it to her perfect thanks.
Rise, and we can provide I, can follow up with I know, Diana requested a copy of the master plan, but a lot of those design elements are really outlined in great detail as part of West State's plan that was released in 2010 specific questions on that we're happy to answer and provide more information.
You know what that really looks like and what that means in terms of the scales of these promenades, which so that's a two-part I, guess question.
I think the different strategies around resiliency have been researched kind of in great detail for our proposal, and we wanted to show a range of strategies that could be accomplished on governor's island really as a showcase for different resilient construction.
Well, I have another question which I you know: I just curious about how the proposal you know under your general purposes, one of the main goals I think, was to promote public use of the island for water-related recreational and educational activities that benefit from the unique island setting and I.
I think it would benefit the community to know more about.
I know that this community board has talked a lot about some of the waterfront alliance's recommendations.
I think you know, as we've shared with the community board in regard, You know there is still more open space to be built on the South Island, including the wetland portion of the park you mentioned.
So you know, I think, would encourage you all to comment on that in the resolution, but the detailed financial model information is available on that November, 9th presentation and again, If there are specific questions and what's been provided.
Would there be any time to present the 2013 that people refer to the earlier 1.625 million square feet development that was presented into only 2013 and has now come up as an alternate that the community is being asked to look at because I, don't think we've ever seen.
That was basically included as a placeholder to study the North island rezoning, which I think a lot of folks on this board were around for, but you know, The trust at that point did not move forward with the rezoning of the South island.
But you know the previous RFP attempts did not generate a proposal or plan for the South Island.
You know we're not proposing any changes to the open space on the historic district as part of this.
You know if there's specific questions that you have or concerns related to the open space on the north island.
One thing I want to point out is the as I think everyone knows.
The park space on the South island was built relatively recently between open between 2014 and 2016, and it really was designed to be a cutting-edge showcase of developing resilient landscapes, and you know we shared some of those strategies in our presentation.
I appreciate that it's also, you know what we spend a lot of time in this committee, Specifically talking about the connectivity of resilience measures around the tip of the island.
It is it's something that has really always been envisioned for the island since the transfer, and it's certainly something we've been talking about a lot with this community board and also you know.
Is that just something that the trust has decided that they need to do or just don't know the structure of that it was written into the deed as part of the negotiation between the federal government and the state and the city when the island was transferred for a dollar to New York, So it is written into the deed which I think we've shared with the community board.
