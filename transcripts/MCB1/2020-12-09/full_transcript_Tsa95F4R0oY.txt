Now, recording all right welcome everyone to the Environmental Protection Committee meeting today, December 7th, I'm Alice, Blank Chair of the committee and Wendy is with us here. Where are you Chapman and Diana sweetheart from the office director of planning? So thanks all for coming, we have a pretty profound agenda here. I should quickly point out that the applications for 250 Water Street governors, island both will be reviewed again. This is we've offered up this time to have conversations, questions that you'd like to ask the applicants on these applications in terms of their environmental impact statements and on issues dealing with environmental protection concerns. Hence why it's in this committee there will be additional meetings as I think most of you are aware of in terms of the governor's island. The comments of the resolution for this community board will be written at the landmarks. Excuse me, the land, the zoning land use and zoning committee on December 14th next week, which point we may add in comments on the EIS, or we may have time for a separate meeting, I think in January for those issues. So that's governor's island. So today, we'd love to hear and have discussion questions just have more time to talk about what concerns and thoughts the public have in terms of environmental impact statement on 250 water street, the Landmarks Preservation Commission. A committee meeting. Excuse me, so the community board meeting on that application has been postponed because that was happening. This Thursday, which happens to be the first night of Hanukkah, so that will now happen on December 21st, so just want to make everyone aware of that and again here the we're looking at the draft scope for the environmental impact statement. So this is a time to opine on things that you'd like to have included in the draft scope of work, and we can start with that and I open this up to the committee members. First I'll just quickly read what just in case. Everyone wonders what the draft scope of work is. So this is for the environmental assessment statement, which is subject to environmental review in accordance with the city's environmental quality review guidelines and an eses was completed. So the environmental assessment state was completed on November 16th and it analyzes the proposed actions. Potential to generate significant adverse environmental impacts- and this is something that's been sent around and that is available online and we were happy to post this again and a positive declaration issued on November 16th established that the proposed actions may indeed have a significant adverse impact on the environment, thus warranting the preparation of an EIS which is pretty standard protocol, so the environmental impact statement, so the public interested agencies, Manhattan community district, 1 and elected officials, are invited to comment on the draft scope, either in writing or orally, at a public scoping meeting to be held on December 17th at 2 pm. I, don't have the address here. Actually, yes, it's we'll send around the meeting site, but it's a New York City government site, I'm sorry that hasn't been provided to us here so tonight. It's the time to describe what you'd like to add if anything, to the draft scope and so without further ado, I'm going to open it up to the committee. If there's issues and things that you'd like to have considered Diana will be taking notes and questions will be fielded to Howard, Hughes and DCP. On these issues, so anybody have anything that they'd like to ask or considered wow. That's quite extraordinary I see Michael's hand up, so I will yeah you're good with that day and I'll. Okay, so I'll handle those questions, so Michael go ahead. Okay, some of the areas that we want them to study more closely are about shadows, specifically the Pearl Street playground, the tree canopies along Pearl Street at Delores, Square Park, the Peck Slip school roof playground how it impacts the blue school and the Seaport district. The impact on residents in nearby low-lying buildings, the historic and cultural resources are concerned about the massive construction on the fragile historic buildings, immediately abutting the site and beyond for urban design and visual resources. We feel that it confuses the historic district identity that you as you enter the district. You would never know that you're entering the district when you have views within the district that are dominated by the tower natural resources. Of course, we're concerned about the water table and the redirection of water to surrounding properties and above ground, about direct sunlight and overall light. Water and sewer infrastructure was certainly concerned about the cso being over capacity already at Newtown Creek, and the cumulative impact on infrastructure, resources and city services with proposed towers and then also whatever is going to happen at two bridges. The noise is a significant impact. We think that the pile driving for some reason is not a good thing for school kids and it's going to be needed to support a huge tower, we're very concerned about the carbon footprint that this development will create and then, finally, we're very concerned about the effect of the five-year construction timeline on the adjacent schools and on the residents who are at the moment trapped in their homes. So those are our preliminary improvements to the Deis. It's really helpful. Michael is this on behalf of the Seaport coalition that you're stating this or the you say. We is that the Seaport coalition has these concerns. Yes, but they reserve the right to have more concerns. Okay, I've got that okay. This is really helpful thanks. Those are clearly important concerns. David Sheldon I see a little pinky being raised. Yep thanks Michael David you're on. If you can but you're well, you're, muted, David I will unmute you go ahead. Looking at the preliminary documents, we noticed I noticed and collectively we noticed a number of streets are mentioned in the documents, and yet it's not clear at all what is proposed for them and why they need to be included like that clarified I mean they have a grid that runs from basically the river all the way up to Pearl Street, okay, anything else, good, okay, David, thanks Susan Cole I, see your hand raised Susan. Are you with us? Susan I am also going to unmute. You are you there? Oh, should you think we are doing it at the same time was similar to David's, it's all about the traffic pattern and what they're doing and how it's going to work and with all who was saying with all the increased traffic, but it's all very vague. It's very unclear and I I'd like it I think it should be clarified. Good thanks, Susan anybody else. I see. Okay, it looks like the committee and board there's no other questions. No other hands raised. I can not see the attendees hands Diana or, if I, oh, yes, I can try the hands up from a gentleman named Andy, Sosan I think it went up before we started. I think he asked a question, but I can't see it. I'm sorry hi Andy are you there. Do you have a question on 250 water or something you'd like to add? I'm here, I didn't realize that we had the scope. The scoping document is still on for the 17th, but they moved the committee meeting to the 21st for the environmental, all of CB1, I'm a little confused as to what meeting what dates have changed Anna. Do you want to sure when Alice was talking about the changed date, that was for the community board, one landmarks and preservation committee, which was originally on December 10th, the 250 water street project is currently at the LPC stage or the landmarks Preservation Commission stage. We were to vote on that resolution through our landmarks committee on December 10th, but due to the conflict with Hanukkah, that's moved to the 21st, so that's the CB1 landmarks, Committee that's been moved and that December 17th date is the deadline for comments on the draft scope of work for the environmental impact statement. What is the deadline for written statements for the Deis I? Believe it's December 17th, it isn't January the 11th or something 11th is what I have for Gosh one of the other ones. Let me check the job. No, actually you're right, wait! A minute. Okay, I'll, just read it out loud here: the public interested agencies, either writing or orally to public scoping needing to be held on December 17th. So that's the public scoping meeting province received during the draft scopes, public meeting and written comments received by January 11th will be considered and incorporated as appropriate into the final scope of work. Thank you thanks. Thank you. You're welcome thanks for joining. That's all that I see right now, Alice for two of the people, I think so. I've got Carrie Shanley, yes, I just scrolled down. Okay, Carrie I am unmuting you right now. Thank you all and I appreciate the board time. Can you hear me? Okay, yeah, okay, fantastic, so I'm a resident of 117 Beekman Street, which is literally right across the street from 250 water street. My apartment essentially has a full view of 250 water street. A couple things one is you mentioned that the scope is publicly available information I've yet to be able to find it, or maybe it's just information, that's available to the board, because we did have an annual meeting with Howard Hughes Corporation and they were unable to provide us with details about a month ago related to the specifics of their testing, their boring testing. So we actually don't know I, don't know what the actual results do look like, but I will tell you that I have a significant concern, because I have a husband who has significant medical issues and without knowing the information as far as what the results are, and there was also a comment which I'm not going to hold them to it- that there was an expectation that this excavation would start in February. We have no idea from a ti and we have other projects going on within our building structure itself. So we have no idea of what the expected timing is. All of the concerns that Michael had expressed, if you can basically include our building, is literally called Seaport Park Condominium Association, if you're going to envelop the Super Park Condominium Association onto all of the things that were just expressed exp, especially from the noise and also public health standpoint, I am work from home. My husband has worked from home. I'm going to reiterate this that this is also the case for I would say almost everyone in our building, so there's a significant health risk that starting the excavation now will cause risk. My building is a landmark building. I have no idea what the excavation will do to affect this building, let alone all of the resources that we need as expressed before water, etc. But let's just talk about what the effect is going to be, especially with the expectation that you were taking out enough soil to be able to build what they hope to be as a 450 story. Two of them towers to take the full print, so that's quite significant, and even if you're just drilling down to the foundation, you need a pretty big foundation in order to essentially set the concrete to start building a significant building. We have a significant lack of information here, so there's a concern across the board with my building and the effect that we're going to have the effect that this is going to have on us from a personal health standpoint and I've. Yet to hear any information as to how that's going to be alleviated I've yet to hear what Howard Hughes is going to do to keep us safe. All I hear is the risk. Thank you. I appreciate everyone's time, thanks Carrie very important points. Thank you. I saw Megan, but your hand is down now. I see her hand still is up and Megan emailed me so Megan, I'm going to unmute you now sorry. My internet is very weird right now, so I wanted to bring up two points. Speaking for children first in the first regard is that, after eight months of our children being trapped outside of our schools and no one-on-ones with our teachers, this is going to start in the same year that we might have a chance to get back to some normalcy. Our children are significantly behind in their schooling. They are emotionally socially completely stressed beyond what any reasonable person would allow if you could help for these young children. These are this pre-k center. We have three-year-olds to 10 year olds that are in these spaces. Then we're going to lose our outside space, we're going to lose our roof deck and all the windows and doors are going to need to be shut because of the dust and the remediation that's going to happen. None of this should be starting now, and none of this is being talked about inside this scope. The scope needs to consider the social, emotional and health of all of the children that this is going to absolutely destroy. That is my major point that the scope needs to address, and then my other I don't understand how this scope looked at. What Howard Hughes is proposing, while simultaneously the city is putting through massive texts through the dop. It will literally change the shape and structure of the entire building going on in the Seaport. The entire project that is in front of us should not be considered until all of the new text amendments have been agreed to and it can be incorporated into an actual scope that would look at the environmental impacts. The Epc for the city hasn't even voted on the DOB changes. Yet it's absurd that this is before any of us or going in front of Cpc. This is a rush job by Howard Hughes to try to slam this thing in the middle of Covid-19 and when the mayor, De Blasio, is looking to get any project started. While we are all under such stress, thank you. Community board, one rocks. So do you Megan one question: are you referring to the when you're talking about the DOB? Could you specify what you're talking about? Are you talking about the Department of City planning, city-wide zoning for coastal resiliency? No, the DOB is putting out those new text amendments that where there was a whole remember like two weeks ago, unless I'm speaking around about the agency, there was they're talking about a citywide text, amendment that is going to be implemented for all buildings in high risk flood zones. It is it's going to give new far it's going to allow new height. It's going to allow sorry, my children are yelling. It's going to allow shut up over there. It's going to allow a complete new building to be placed after this is being looked at and the scope. Then they won't have to go back and get it looked at as long as they're hitting all the bells and whistles that the new DOB standards are including it's the cart before the horse right, okay, you're, referring to what was presented last month, thanks, okay, right and right they're going into elect, they want them to go into effect in 2021 right like four or five months. Yes, I! Think that's correct! I! Actually can't speak to that, specifically, though I think you're correct, but it's a really good point. I have to look into it, so I see a co and thanks Megan I, see from Victoria Hillstrom saying she'd like to respond hi everyone, hi Victoria, is that you, okay hi it is. This is Victoria Hillstrom at 385Greenwich, aka, 71, North Moore, our lofts since 1982, and I'd like to speak to the previous caller. That has really substantial concerns. Our lofts across from the Greenwich Hotel and most people don't know this suffered damage from adjacent property. Now on 37 permits, it wasn't just a matter of the Greenwich Hotel going too high. They went down three floors. Instead of one failing to surround the survey, the surrounding landmarks and 385Greenwich dates back to 1805, 71 North Moore dates back to 1815. They caused damage to both roofs. Our windows began to break one by one. We literally caught them falsifying every record. With the city. We worked with Frank Rubes, who many of you I'm certain know from the D.O.T, and it turns out the damage went down to the support beams in 2006 16 that finally proved how the damage on the 37 other permits occurred. They also damaged 64 northmoor next door to the hotel, 61 northmoor. So you know these are and I would also like to say. I had walking pneumonia for two years from this construction being so close and our windows were broken. They were rattling. I didn't even know that I had walking pneumonia by the time it was over. Our lofts, incidentally, were the centerpiece of the city's 20 million dollar airbnb scheme in response to me filing for loft protection and protected occupancy status. So I would like to say, as a designer I designed the prototype for the Madewell Store on Broadway I, designed the liquor store and Ludlow for J.Crew. They were prototypes for the J crew men's store. It is completely inappropriate for any of this to be going on without all of us present, so that we can't see what people are talking about. Number one number: two: we have a pandemic where 1.4 million New Yorkers stand to lose their home. We have 40 percent of New Yorkers that earn a hundred thousand dollars and over hoping to leave New, York and 40 of our luxury housing sitting vacant, and so the question is: why is mayor De Blasio, allowing any of this to go through much less interfering with our historic districts and disrupting the intellectual, the architectural integrity of the seaports of Tribeca, our lofts 385Greenwich aka 71, North Moore? They literally pulled the plug while LPC was approving, they couldn't see what they were approving and now these landmarks have been altered. They are the oldest buildings in Tribeca. 385Greenwich was a hotel for sailors, but the Greenwich Hotel is actually a copy, le Conque Verde's door, it literally copies it was a triple brick building. So I would just like to say that I don't know who this Howard Hughes Corporation is. There are 46 buildings in our case with the Guindy's century 21 who just went bankrupt. There are more accidents and fires where every single business record has been falsified. Buildings are being illegally converted and conveyed, and so that we are very foolish to believe that this doesn't just reflect these two towers. In fact, every landlord will, in other words, we're creating predatory equity where they go after everyone around them. In our case, our lofts have been tied up on the courts for 13 years, a quarter of a million dollars, I keep winning and they keep using the city to circumvent the courts. What I'd like to say to everyone? Most of all, many of us were at the MIH hearings. That's where I met our wonderful neighbors friends of the South Street Seaport Tribeca trust. We all testified in record numbers against mandatory inclusionary housing along with Harlem. If anyone sat through the city console hearings, Vicky Bean and Alicia Glenn promised us that they would use every tool in their toolbox in order to approve MIH and what that meant was the DOT, the d.o.b, the Dof, where it's atrocious. What has gone on I, don't know. If anybody knows about the 21, the lucky 21 rent-stabilized buildings in CB1, you might look up those 21 buildings that are being marketed at market rate. My friend is in two gold, so I have very serious concerns that this is about anything other than making Howard Hughes Rich. And yet these are. This is a historic district. These are our landmarks that are to be preserved for public enjoyment for hundreds of years to come, and the notion that the mayor is doing this in Soho in the seaports in the meatpacking district, where I am at this moment is absolutely vulgar and as Cpc testified, this wasn't for us. It wasn't for the community. Mih is to attract businesses from other states and in other words Google and Amazon, and whoever else it is so that I just think that given half of the mayor's staff has, you know, abandoned ship, we don't have Maria Torres stringer by the way my case pushed the loft bill, passed the Senate in Assembly with Senators Hoyleman, Squadron and Debbie Glick. We just passed the loft bill in Bushwick, so that I think that we need to be very clear that it isn't that this is being handled remotely, that every other community group across the city, Gowanus industry city. Everyone is objecting to this absolutely saying this must stop. We want nothing to happen until the pandemic is over and we wouldn't be alone to suggest such a thing. The other issue is that it seems that mayor De Blasio has taken significant campaign contributions from every single developer. That has you know an iron in the fire that we need to really whether it's that we look to Governor Como I completely stand with my friends at children's first, with the save the seaports with Seaport preserve every single community board in every single tenant group across the city, every single thing that's going on for 10 years. All anybody says is nobody wants a repeat of Tribeca after 9:11, and it's now happening at the seaports and whatever is going on. It needs to stop in most cases. If you look at the city records in my case specifically, what they claim permits are for is not what the city found is not what the FDNY found it. It's not what the Lmccc found that we are introducing a level of fraud to make developers rich and underneath it they are forcing its residents out for higher taxes and I would respectfully submit that this mayor has done nothing for us. The city is in shambles, our landscape is changing, and this community board needs to stand up put on their big boy pants and let the mayor know and know. In certain terms, this is not happening until the pandemic is over, and if that's, how we run out the clock until we have a mayor that addresses everyone's concerns, we have buildings being warehoused every fourth building in Tribeca I, don't know what rezoning see anyone well, of course, at the time, the idea was that either you were owners or you were renters and my god, you would make a fortune and be able to move to Florida, of course, but my neighbors were removed by hook and by crook, with horror stories. So, let's be very clear: what a company the size of Howard, Hughes, Corporation and the effects on these seaports- these are our landmarks and historic districts and I would respectfully submit that if we can't stop it as a community that we need to file suit because they are violating everyone's rights that can't participate during a pandemic right Toria, it's a tremendous, passionate eloquent. Yes! Well, I'm a victim of this, so yeah I appreciate the precautionary tale. Thank you. People we are going to have to in these footprints. Elderly I would just like to say and I don't want anybody to suffer what we were made to suffer. Many of you know us Justine, Almada, Carlos's daughter was chief of staff for Dan. Gorodnik grew up in our lofts. Carlos is a very famous restaurateur. We are very well loved in Tribeca and we would feel very badly if we didn't privately share with our neighbors. What happened to us so that you don't have to go through this world? It's a it's very helpful that you made that on public record, so I applaud you you're doing that and I encourage you. Given your perspective to show up at the oh Jason here, Jason Friedman, Community Board, one yes I, just I was inspired by this horror story and just wanted to go on record saying you know my buildings that I live in right across the street date back to as early as 1789, and there don't even have much of a foundation to them. So I mean I'm actually one of these guys. That's going to hoot and holler about the height of this I. Think there's a lot of people to do that. But of course we can't have people just driving huge piles into the ground and destroying the you know the structures right by- and these are very let's say, highly susceptible structures- exactly delicate. So I'm just gonna since I'm here go on. Carlos is an architect thanks, very much Jason. That's a really important point as well. Are there other comments from others that we could add to the Alice Charlene next from the box I mean? Can you hear me yes, hi, so Charlene Balfour I also live in 117 Beekman, which is the building just adjacent to the 250 water street. I. Want to raise two points in addition to the points that were raised earlier, one is for additional consideration for the location of the site with respect to the exit strategy for many of the financial district. Businesses that operate downtown the site is about a hundred meters, away from the Brooklyn bridge, on-ramp, the FDR on ramps and the on-ramp for both FDR north and FDR South. Any obstruction to that, given that we also have the gold reserves for the Federal Reserve, building very close by will materially inhibit the financial markets as well, because you won't have a viable exit location if construction would block any of those very important routes to the major throughway for the city. I also want to note the that not only is a site from a transportation perspective, a huge issue, but should it cause any undue flooding or any deterioration in the sites? Again, you have huge financial sectors that are need that throw away of water street for important exits, not only for the city for the financial markets as well. So just want to make that noted thanks very much important points. Diana, do we have anybody else? Yes, we have Carrie Shanley that I'm going to next and then Stacy Shub after that and thanks Gary I did have a chance to speak before, but I do have a question because again I'm unable to find the report that you are referencing and I've gone on to several websites. What is the time frame for when Howard Hughes is looking to start the major excavation as it currently stands in the report? This is a draft for the scope of work. There is no timeline and there's no excavation, so that is not indicated. We will definitely Diana. Can we post this on the website, we'll post the link, Carrie and you know, get that to you right away so that you can review it? Sorry that it's difficult to get to so thanks I, appreciate that, because I know that there were two items on your agenda, one was review. The scope of work is the next item not related to time frame either. The next item is the zoning for coastal flood resiliency. Is that what you're referring to or the earlier item we're waiting for, Laura Dodge? That may be what you're referring to she will be yeah. She will be updating us on the brownfields application and the remedial investigation, so I think that's what you're referring to, and yes that is hopefully going to happen imminently with an update on just that question, but now yeah well, unfortunately, Laura Dodge, our consultant is late, which so, where she promises to get here so we're hanging in there. So we're just moving forward on the agenda until she shows up thanks, Carrie, so I see Charlotte I appreciate that. Thank you, yeah Charlene Balfour is that his next I say he just went to Charlene. I'm actually going to try to clear these because we've gotten through all those I'm going to. Let me find Stacey who I know wanted to speak as well. Hi Stacy. Are you there all right? I've, unmuted Stacy? Oh yes, hi am I unmuted. Now, yes, you are okay, great! Thank you. So my name is Stacey. Shube I live directly across the street from 250 water at 100 Beekman during Hurricane Sandy. We were evacuated. Water entered our building and deployed elevators. The lot that we're talking about was completely submerged during sandy I bring this up because we're really not addressing resiliency. Here we don't even have a funded plan in place. We have no idea how we're going to be dealing with that, so I don't understand how we can even really be approving plans for something when we don't even have a plan for resiliency. Of course, tall buildings add to rising storm surges. If you go down the block just a few blocks over, we have a tall building that is leaning three inches. They have stopped construction on that for months or years. I, don't even know how long and obviously we wouldn't want to see that straight across the street and a little side note is in looking a little bit at Howard, Hughes Corp, one of the things they're being sued for right now is not adequately storm proofing properties that they sold. Thank you I just want to know what the rush is we're in a pandemic right now we have all of these issues that have not been resolved. A structure like that being built. You can't make changes after you know, measure twice cut once. Thank you. Thanks, Stacy Good point, I had my hand up, can I go that Paul didn't see your hands yeah. Oh I thought it was up. Okay, I, don't know it's not going to be too concerns that are realistic and will need to be mitigated a lot of them. I think. Another point the board should make is that you know, especially with the city facing dire financial straights for years to come. The cost of additional inspections like Jason, might need in his building or additional traffic agents for the neighborhood additional environmental reviews. Those things should be borne those expenses by the developer, not by the city, and we should make sure that the mitigation measures are put into place and again, if the city can't pay for them, or maybe they shouldn't even be forced to pay for them, we should suggest that the city be reimbursed by the developer for these costs. That should not be borne by them. Thank you thanks, Paul, well, I. Think. That's a really good point. Thanks for bringing that up, this is Wendy. I see David Sheldon's finger up again, Diane I, don't know just am I on. Yes, you are just a point of clarification. My question did not refer to traffic issues. It's the number of unmet d-mapped streets that are included in the original scoping proposal that I'm concerned with, because I could not find why they're there what is proposed for them, but they are clearly outlined in the maps. That's my question. Thanks for the clarification, okay, anybody else see that data has a hand up hi. This is Deda, I'm a public member, a different community, hi Alice, so I. Just in the beginning of this discussion, you said that right now is the chance for the community to weigh in on what they would like included in the scope of the environmental review. Correct I just want to make sure that I'm understanding that that's what we're discussing yes I mean there's more issues that are being raised here than that, but yes I think that's the that would be helpful to cover. Oh thank you. Okay, Alice I. Have a quick question. Is that Tommy it is hi Board Cher, Hey, Tammy how's it going. You know, well welcome good, to hear your voice thanks, and you know I'm always lurking around question that I have and I apologize for being late, but did you go over and the environmental impact that may be derived from the additional heights? That will be? You know if the zoning for coastal resiliency goes through, then that changes the height and the landscape for shade studies, and things like that. So is there a point that in here can request those to be included? It's a good idea. Megan touched on that idea and I think that's yeah to be more specific on. That is a good idea. I would say: I do have concerns specifically on that site about the effects that it has on the school next door. The schools, because of the rooftop place spaces light to for the kids and being in shadow, is not great Timmy. The light was definitely came up and also the you know putting all of the foundations in all of the you know, pile on piling when that's happening, how it's going to affect you know all the buildings, but especially school children in the building that also came up in case you didn't hear it that's cool and then there's I, don't know where this goes. Alice and I leave this to more of my environmental experts. There has been dialogue and conversation about potentially changing traffic patterns around building based on applications that they may future file. Is there a way to include that initially in their environmental study and review, because their slides showed pexlet close, which DOT had ruled that out? If you remember, when Paxlet became a school, they said that it was impossible to close peck slip due to circulation needs. At least D.O.T came back to us and said that when Peck slips school open said that it was required to leave that street as a definable street and in fact, that's also where the school buses drop off. So the question is on their presentation and slides that they've showed the community board. They did show peck slit closed. So how does that fit into an environmental study? Well, I can, what might be helpful, is first of all, I think the more specificity that we have and that the community is offering the better. The you know will benefit from I would argue. All that is written in the technical information portion on transportation. Currently is the following: the Ceqr Technical Manual, which is the city environmental quality review states that the quantified transportation analyses may be warranted if a proposed action results in 50 or more vehicle trips and or 200 or more transit pedestrian trips. During a given peak hour, the proposed actions may exceed the Ceqr threshold for analysis in areas of traffic transit and pedestrians. A description of the task to be undertaken for the transportation section of the EIS is provided in the draft scope of work, so I would say providing more specific again specifics that many people are now speaking to including the one that you've just addressed should be part of our resolution. Thank you. Okay, so I know it was touched on a little bit about a storm. You know in terms of you know, if the site is open, if the hole is in the ground, you know what would they do about it? Can we is that specifically addressed or you know, what are we talking about in terms of you know, obviously, there's no overall plan, but even interim measures that they're working on around the site itself, I'm not sure I, couldn't answer the question so I didn't write the scope here, but you're asking that be recognized that you know if we have. You know if there's sandy, that's a really bad situation, but even if there's a more minor storm, you know what flood mitigation measures are they doing to protect that site when it's an open hole? You know that that's one. That's come up multiple times over the scope of several meetings and, of course you know everyone's like well. All lower Manhattan will be in so much trouble, we'll all be in a terrible situation, but I think that we can at least ask that again absolutely yup. Thank you. Thanks a lot wendy. Okay, are we Alice? This is Rosa, actually hey, oh hi, so I, I'm not saying anyone's okay, I'm going to rely on Diana, because I clearly am not seeing the hands. Well enough. Okay, Rosa thanks! Sorry! So I'm sorry because I actually didn't read the document, so I'm just gonna wing it, but in relation to the schools and the sensitivity of the neighboring properties, I guess I have two significant concerns. One is obviously the noise during the period when the site is being remediated but then also the inevitable planned construction. The foundation work for such a large piece of property is going to take a significant amount of time and be incredibly noisy and polluting, and then the construction work itself of assembling the building until the envelope is able to be closed is going to be incredibly disruptive to the neighboring properties and I. Think that as New Yorkers we serve I mean at least I take it for granted. That is something that you have to accept as being a New Yorker, because you know we're all like slammed right up against each other, but in this specific case, because we do have schools right next door, specifically with you, know young children in them. That is an enormous concern to me, especially for the period of years. It will take for this work to be done and, while I do accept that you know, people with private property have the right to develop that property. My concern is that the impact here is going to be enormous for the children, and that must be addressed and I. Think that part of the way to do that is to address it in the environmental review process and have a plan for mitigation of both the pollution and the noise impact which is going to be huge. I mean I can't imagine how children are going to be expected to study and learn, while construction is going on right beside them every single day. So I think we do need to have a plan that will actually be able to address that, and it will go on for years and I. Don't think that any sane parent would want to send their child to a school where they think that their children will not be able to learn in that environment for years. So we're essentially closing the school. If we don't have a plan in place to address that Rosa. Basically, what you're bringing up is what happened to ps234 when the whole foods, when that whole building went up and they built a wall around 234 and tried to you know sound proof it of sorts. But of course, as you can imagine, it was very dark in the cafeteria and everything along that wall, and it was still very loud, so it I mean anyone who was around at that time period. Even those of us who had you know homes a couple blocks away during the piling the whole you know blocks shook, but that's yeah. Everyone knows that's normal when a big high-rise is going up. Yes, thank you, yeah I, guess what I? What I'm thinking of is, rather than trying to build a box around the school, I'm thinking build a box around the property, but look it's not ideal in any way shape or form, but we do have to have a real serious plan to deal with that yeah good, very good point Rosa to say the least yeah. These are really excellent points and really helpful. Okay, we did just get an email from Laura, Dodge I should say which I so Laura is still tied up. So she is not sure she's going to make it but she's hopeful, but I, wonder today and I guess I can we can still wait around and then she's typing up notes to provide the update and then I'll read it to everyone. So why don't we should we wait a little longer or what do you think Diana? The fact that she provided a written update makes me think that she may not be able to join us for some time. I want to make sure that the folks paint for this will catch it so I think you're right, maybe I can read it or if you read it, you can go ahead and read it, but I think we should go ahead and provide the update that she has right now and if folks want to stick around and see if Laura can join, they can of course, do that absolutely terrific go ahead. Diana that'd be terrific thanks very much so this thing's up right now up. Okay, so we're not oh vera, I'm sorry yep more people from okay, so we'll backtrack. Here, a little before you read Laura's statement, so vera yeah I wanted to bring attention to the fact that they're Saint Margaret's house, which is right across on the west side across the street, which houses about 250 some seniors and I, really would like that. The scope address the impacts that this construction will have on a senior community Facil. You know seniors who are living there, what an impact they would have on their health on their lives. As we know, there have been studies done, especially in our borough-based jail. When we were, we did studies. There was a team center where the blue jail's to be built, and we know that the effects of the dust and the noise could actually be life-threatening to vulnerable people such as seniors. So I'd really like to know the impacts that this would have and what mitigation could be done for that community, which is living right which are living right across the street, and many of them are disabled. How are they going to be able to navigate around all the construction and the traffic and all that? All of that perfect yeah, really critical thanks for right, absolutely, okay, I see Andrew Zelter quickly, Alice. Coming back to the point or the issue that's been raised repeatedly about schools when Wendy was mentioning the experience with 234, I'm wondering if there's any value in actually citing specific examples where, despite representations and extensive efforts to mitigate the issues, they were not effective and we're concerned about a repeat in this instance. So if we can actually cite specific examples, I think it's a great resource to use examples in history, not repeating itself as Beerus, pointing out with the borough based jails, application of this absolutely with ps234 yeah, of course, yeah. The ball fields had hazards from the Goldman Sachs Building. When Glass fell out during construction onto the bald fields, when kids were out there, which actually resulted in essentially boxing in Goldman Sachs as it was being topped off so that it wouldn't happen again. So we can mention that as a president as well. That's Jeff and Jeff. That's super important, considering that pexlet has an outdoor play space as their primary resource or the streets, so good, that's great! Okay! All right, I have see a hand from I, don't know I, think Carrie I think we've already spoken, so we've got roberta and did we hear from Roberta Bell balloons and I? Think I cleared these earlier, so I think oh okay, I think Carrie's hand went right back down, but no, we haven't heard from Roberta yet and Robert Meeting you now hi Roberta are you on? Maybe we circle back to Roberta I see Megan has a hand back up as well, so I'm going over to Megan now. Hi. Sorry, guys really quick that. But the glass thing reminded me: the Geary building had panels of glass fall out and actually left a gouge in the ground where the children would be walking into school. Look flip what was put in there was not supposed to be 470 stories above it. This would be a 12 story. Building. So I just think that there's it's not what anyone signed up for there because of the law, and there was a panel that fell and almost and gouged out the ground underneath the Geary Building okay. So how? What are the glass? How is the glass gonna be held in yeah? That kind of thing thanks, Megan, okay, I'm gonna go back to roberta. Are you on? Can you hear me we can hear you? Oh great, okay, I was just about to type you a message into the chat because I don't know why you couldn't hear me. This may seem like a very small concern compared to some of the major concerns, but it is a concern for me and possibly for other people having gone through this pandemic and been locked into the house. The only thing that kept my mental health was being able to go out onto my terrace and grow things. We will not be able to open windows go out onto our terraces, and that is also a significant financial impact because we pay for those terraces on a monthly basis along with the apartment, because they are considered part of the apartment and it it's I find that to be an incredible hardship, I'm right across the street at 100, Beekman and so I just wanted to put that on record in case that was considered as important as I think. It is. Thank you yeah. Thank you very much, okay, that's it. Let's see I'm going back to Terry Shandlin yep, just very quickly since Laura is not presenting but you're reading a statement from her. Does that mean that the public will have another opportunity to actually ask her questions in a public forum? I would say that's yes, she will be coming back, certainly, and she will be coming to community board one which is her forum and, in fact, I would say that questions that you all have for tonight. We can feel to her as well and if I'm not mistaken, we can get back to everyone somehow. Would that not be something we could do? Diana yeah, of course I mean it's unfortunate. If I do it live tonight, but we'll provide the update that we have and for folks that have questions, I'm happy to engage with Laura and get back to people via email. Rather than doing that again, my question is: will we be able to ask her questions in a public forum for all to hear versus this one-on-one, the one-on-one? I'm sorry she will be coming back to community board meeting to provide an update, and so at that point that will be a public meeting. Is that what you're asking she definitely will come back? That's what I'm asking so that's just basically a meeting to be determined because, again from my time frame since I'm on the fifth floor and I will have literally be directly within the scope of risk. Once the remediation does start, I need to know a time frame because I may need to escape. My building I have no choice from a safety perspective, because everything that I'm hearing so far really puts a lot of concern with the health of me and my family. There is no construction, that's imminent in any way here. So let's Dana one! This seems like a timely moment to read the update, so we can see Laura's sense of timing on that. If you'd, like I just want to get to one more and Charlene Balfour who did not have could not raise her hand, I just want to get to Charlene quickly, maybe for a bit go ahead. Yeah, so thank you. I was able actually and Carrie I'll, send you. The document online I was able to look at the document online and I know over 20,000 square feet of retail space that would likely displace many of the historical bars and restaurants that make up the fabric of the Seaport and the longevity of those bars and restaurants, many of which have gone back for centuries and time before the Brooklyn bridge will be impacted economically by having another 20,000 square feet in retail space. In addition to about 20 vacancy in region, retail space that currently exists in the Seaport now I, also like on in within the scope of work for the Howard Hughes Corporation, to specify their definition of low income with a specific income range, that's associated with that low income number they put in the statement of work and finally, within the statement of work, it would be really helpful if the Howard Hughes Corporation was very specific on the alternate ways they can rebuild space in the Seaport to accommodate their need for museum space. There is already around 30,000 square feet of museum space. That's not in use so just want to understand the need to add additional museum space. That's called for in the plan. Thank you for the points okay, I. Think now Alice. Would you like me to read the statement from Laura? That would be swell thanks. Okay, this is her statement on November 23rd 2020 I received updated figures from New York State Department of environmental conservation that were prepared by Langan in response to the agency's request for additional figures and our request for Langan to prepare a cross-sectional view using the soil borings in the vicinity of the former thermometer factory workshops. We have reviewed the figures and have some comments that we will provide to New York state DEC in the next day or so. I spoke to the DEC project manager. Rafi Alam, relayed back. That DEC has reviewed the additional information, but is waiting for the new State Department of Health to provide their feedback. Rafi indicated that the Department of Health has a lot on their plates right now, but he is hopeful that they will have an internal DEC DOH call by early next week to discuss whether or not in the agency's view the remedial investigation is sufficiently complete and whether any additional field investigation is warranted as part of the remedial investigation or to the contrary, they will be requesting some additional investigation after DEC and Dh have their internal discussion and I have completed their review. Tom, Facillo and I will have another conference call with the agencies to discuss our comments on the supplemental figures and the status of the remedial investigation overall, to relay our thoughts and discuss the agency's findings. I will provide you an update after that conference call has occurred with respect to timing. I expect our follow-up call with DEC and DOH to take place either right before the Christmas holiday or right after the new year. It depends on whether or not DEC and DOH complete their review by the end of next week. Rafi could not estimate when the draft remedial investigation report would be submitted by Langan, given that the agencies are still reviewing what has been submitted to date, but the draft remedial investigation report is clearly not going to be prepared for submission this calendar year. I will provide DEC her comments on the supplemental figures, week's end and I will follow up to Rafi by the middle of next week. If I don't hear from him before that. That's the end of her statement, thanks Diana. Of course this was on the update for anyone that was came in late by Laura Dodge, the communities consultant on the what on 250 water streets, remedial investigation plan, any I, don't think we could ask or answer any questions other than what you've heard is I. Think that's the update that we're getting, and we will, of course, as in stated there have further updates, obviously so I think from there. Unless anyone has some comment. We'll move on to the next item on the agenda, which is the zoning for coastal flood resiliency city-wide zoning text, amendment which is James, is it is kotone or cotton. I usually say Caton Catone, Hi James, so James Catone, the resiliency planner, with the land use division at the New York City Council was very kind to volunteer and come today to help us out to just discuss further thoughts on we've had one conversation on the city, one the city-wide zoning text amendment and how it affects community board one. So I think this is kind of a discussion comments for those of you who need a refresher. This was something that was presented to us at the last joint I, think Epc and land use, meeting and I'll just read right from the New York City Planning's website. What this is in brief. This work is part of the city's one New York City plan, which includes numerous strategies to make the city more resilient through multiple lines of defense. This proposal would make permanent zoning provisions that were adopted on a temporary basis in 2013 and improve them in several key areas where the rules do not fully support or may contribute to discouraging resiliency investments in buildings. The proposal would also provide flexibility for grading and shoreline design in waterfront areas to help mitigate flood risk and will prohibit the construction of new nursing homes in high risk areas, given the negative health consequences associated with evacuating nursing home residents. So James, do you want to comment a bit about where you're at the council in reviewing this application and thoughts as they concern Beauty Board? One sure, thanks just to introduce myself. My name is James Caton, I'm a planner with the New York City Council Land Use division, I specialize in resiliency. This text amendment is currently at the community Board level review stage of Euler. So the council is not necessarily considering it as such, except that members are, some members are receiving briefings and some members are fairly familiar with this text, as some of it is updates to texts that have been in place since 2013 or 2015. In some cases this is technically a non-ulurp action, but it will be following the Euler calendar because it's going far with two neighborhood level, rezonings in Howard, Beach and Garrettson Beach, which have some relationship with the resiliency text amendment. So the goal as you read off there of this text amendment is to provide additional flexibility in the city's floodplains to facilitate resilient building renovation projects and new construction to allow the zoning to better accommodate what the building code requires. If you're working in a flood plain and I should say, I'm I, I'm happy to you, know, answer questions as they come up in the discussion with respect to community board, one I did kind of hook around a little bit on the zoning text and the local kind of zoning conditions there. So Community board. One has a couple of special purpose: districts: there's the lower Manhattan special purpose district and the battery park city special purpose district, the lower Manhattan, the Tribeca special mixed use, district, the lower Manhattan special purpose district includes the Seaport city sub district and the I think that might be the only one. Oh no and then the commercial, historic, commercial, core, subdistrict, the zoning floods. It also has a number of historic districts. So there's several in Tribeca, there's the Seaport city, historic district, there's a few small ones in kind of the core of Manhattan. There's the Francis Tavern block, there's the commons and african burial ground and governors island. It also counts as a special purpose district. So there's a lot of special districts and historic districts in CB1 for the most part, the way that the zoning text is going to interact with that is in cases where the zoning text amendment and the local special purpose district come into conflict. The new flood text, the resiliency text, will control in the in cases where there's a conflict and the main situations where I saw that might be of concern to the committee and to residents is primarily with respect to how building height would be measured and for area ratio. So in trifecta and battery Park city building height is measured from the curb height on governor's island. It's measured from the base plane, which I asked to risk on that, because I would need to look into that further to understand it better. But if we're just looking at Manhattan, the new flood text amendment will allow a new project or a substantial improvement. So that's any project. That's costs more than 50 of the market value of the building. If you're doing a new project or a substantial improvement, you have to comply with current building code, which will have certain provisions with respect to flood resiliency. That's in Appendix g of the New York City Building Code. What the zoning text allows is for you to measure your building height from the base, flood elevation or from an alternative reference plane that you can set at 10 feet above grade. So what that effectively means is that in some parts of these special purpose, districts say in Tribeca or in battery park city, if you were building a new building, effective height limits, are essentially increased by 10 feet, to accommodate more restricted uses on the ground floors and in basement levels of building and flood plain to kind of incentivize and make and provide increased flexibility to design designers, architects and professionals in historic districts. Any work still has to be approved by the landmarks, Planning Commission, and so all the normal rules would apply so even if the height limit. So if you were working on a historic building in Tribeca- and you were moving, say- mechanical equipment from a basement level to a roof extension or to a backyard extension, all the normal conditions that LPC would normally care about in that situation, would still apply and be subject to their approval. That was a lot of information based on discussion. I had with some members of the community board last week and I can probably answer more questions as they come up, but I'm not sure what the direction of the discussion should take at this point. I think I've spoken enough. Well, that was really helpful. It's a vast piece of information and how it affects us is also really difficult to tease out, particularly if you don't have any expertise. So thank you. I just want to ask Diana I thought. Allison Brown from the Department of City planning was joining us. Is she here or was she able give me one moment, she's on a dial-in just bear with me: I'm gonna unmute, all the dialings, I'm not sure which one she is hi. Can you hear me? Oh hi, Allison. First, try hi Allison I just wanted to zero seven number. If that happens, I'm sure I'm the only one I just want to give a special shout out to Allison Brown from the Department of City planning for a lot of things, but mostly right now for coming tonight at incredibly short notice. I think like an hour before so thank you and Allison is a person who can help us a great deal in answering some questions on this zoning for coastal flood resiliency so, and also governor's island and probably a million other things so anyway, I think at this point, should we open it up for questions from the committee members? Does anyone just to remind everyone tonight is a conversation again giving us a little additional time to look at this city-wide zoning text amendment and ask our questions and then it's next week at next week or two weeks? No, it's December! Sorry Diana! When is the executive committee meeting, I'm pretty sure it was moved. It was on the 16th I think everything was moved to the 21st nope we're still the 16th okay exec is still the 16th okay. So tonight is a good time to ask your questions. Get some more information tease out your thinking, but that meeting next week will be the one where the community board will write the resolution on behalf of the community on this text. Amendment so don't hold back with questions or concerns or issues and such that you'd, like included, okay. So having said that, if I can open it up to committee members first, anyone have any thoughts, comments or questions on this. Well that okay, so I see my figure out how to raise my hand, wait out. Oh I can't figure out how to race. Okay, Laura, it's okay, Laura Starr are I. Don't it's so funny. It's in participation, all right, it'll be so in it, but Laura don't worry about it. There you are okay, I, really think we have a meeting with our landmarks group because, like what I think is that this zone and makes a lot of steps if I were a building owner in the South Street Seaport or on the front of this tavern block I was basically going to lose my first floor economy because of flood issues. You know I would want to build another story, talk, but I wouldn't want to have to spend my whole life dealing with our landmarks committee on the community board or the Landmarks Commission. So I actually think there's something that should be out now during this process and I feel the same way about the shoreline after natural shoreline, which is you know, unless the shoreline slopes inward open space, it can't place word beyond the bulkhead because of DEC regulations and this city planning. These finds the tax amendment isn't coordinated with the state DEC. So you know, I know this from my own professional experience that when the city planning regulations are not coordinated with other sister agencies, it's hell and I recommend they do the coordination in this process. Well, Laura, it's so Alison. Can you speak to what coordination was done and where LPC- and you know the shoreline question- is, can you just respond to that? Absolutely so. In regards to the first part about Ltc, you know Community board, one in particular. Has you know many historic districts that are also within the floodplain, so absolutely support your suggestion. Laura to you know, bring this to landmarks Committee and have that discussion there. This is a particular concern, I think for this community district I will say you know, as James noted earlier, a lot of the provisions are making permanent or we feel improving upon provisions that have been in the zoning resolution since 2013. So you know as far as coordination with LPC, this isn't new information. This is things that buildings could have been utilizing this text in a form you know, maybe things are being slightly changed in this iteration, but building owners could have been using these provisions since 2013 for seven years, so I think a lot of those. A lot of that coordination and communication has already come through. Lpc is a sister agency. You know. Obviously we have communicated with her with them, and you know they're, obviously very aware of this text going through at this time and I. Don't is the concern there. I just want to kind of narrow down it's a concern that LPC may not approve of a project of the resiliency measures of a project because they do not feel that is in keeping with the nature of the historic district. Is that the concern yeah I mean yes, for you know like if somebody wants to build a modern, you know glass, whatever on top or something yeah I just want to make sure that it's coordinated with them and that you know, if there's any guidelines that we need to have that are specific to our historic districts. You know that we really start to think about them, because I just hate like I'll, give you an example of where I'm coming from. Okay. What came to the landmarks Committee a couple of years ago was a co-op wanted to build an elevator bulkhead on their roof so that people could get to their green roof. You know handicapped people every so it was universally accessible and we had to discuss this for a long time and that just seemed absurd to me, because, obviously, if you're going to have green roofs, you need to have a way to get for everybody, even people in wheelchairs to get to them- and you know it should have been like this stuff needs to be considered completely. You know, and so my concern is that as a community board member we're going to end up talking ad nauseam about somebody's building, an extra story on their building on water, Street or front street, or something when they should just be able to do it, and you know, like somebody's gonna, say: oh it's too modern to this. It's too that so why not talk about it now and just say what the parameters are: yeah I mean we like I, said: LPC is very aware of the text, and it's really not. This isn't really a proposal to change their process. You know if, via the zoning tax, let's say, hypothetically a property owner of a historic building and historic district wanted to. You know flood proof in some way the building and then, as a result of that, they ended up adding additional height to the building in any situation where there's an additional height added to a building and I've seen these projects go through and I know the landmarks and the land use. Committee have also seen these go through in the last few years. In Tribeca, where you know a building owner has gone through a special permit process to add an additional story onto their building in a historic district. You know it's the same process and the same considerations will be put forth into that by the LPC. It's not changing their process, so you know I think it's maybe a conversation for you all to have at the committee level of if you feel strongly that projects that come in that seek that additional height for resiliency purposes should be. You know, analyzed or discussed in a different way. Then that's definitely a great conversation to have now. So everyone is in agreement before you know. A project may be received in the future, but Lpc's process, like their technical process of reviewing things, is not suggesting to be modified as part of the and then and sorry to your. If your comment, sorry, can you hear me I'm getting a little bit of feedback yeah your question about DEC and shoreline. Is this in regards to like any shoreline extension project? Or can you just clarify? Well, let's say: let's just take okay, let's take an example like let's say near the South Street Seaport like near the Brooklyn bridge Esplanade, you said: oh geez, there's this bulkhead, it's so unnatural, like it should be like we want a softer shoreline. We want more contact with the water right. Okay, so what your language says is: okay, you can have yourself to shoreline, but you have to slope from the bulkhead back in to get it which would eliminate the esplanade and the public space there, because you can't slope out from the bulkhead without going through agony with DEC right, and so it's basically not really helping us. So I want to be really clear that the test so there's you know as we like to say in the city like multiple layers of defense, that are all being pursued at the same time. You know some in regards to infrastructure like flood walls and barriers that- and some in this instance are really down to private property owners in the flood plain, and this tax is really you know geared towards ensuring the privacy property owners that are in the flood plain can seek. You know resilient options for their private investment. Well, there's no private property and lower. As far as I know the only private property along the whole. What we call the? U is actually the battery maritime building and that's it and it wouldn't even apply there because there's a ferry, so it's irrelevant to us exactly yeah, that's what I was just going to say. You beat me too, with a bunch, but in other parts of the city remember. This is citywide text. There are instances in the city where you know a private property will be directly on the shoreline, but those particular provisions really don't have a lot of applicability in community district. One yeah, but I will say you know other, but other waterfront projects I mean now I'm using my community board time for something professional. But you know, though, when you, when one is doing like a waterfront development right and the developer is developing that waterfront Esplanade they if they float back from you know the their property line, they'll lose. They won't be in compliance with the city, planning, Waterfront Zoning guidelines with the you know, the whatever it is: 12-foot esplanade and the 12-foot. You know all that stuff that you guys have so it's right so yeah, it's again. It's two different provisions, I think in the text that we're talking about I, mean I, know that you have personally done professional work and that you know have to comply with the waterfront public access areas right and in this Texas. We're really talking about privately owned buildings that have a footprint in the floodplain. Okay, all right you're too much of an expert Laura. No I'm just trying to get too difficult a certain thing. I'm trying to use this process to loosen a few things up. That's all! Okay! That's it for me! Thank you! Okay, thanks and thanks, Alex, okay, bye, okay, why don't we hear from Michael Kramer head next hand up Michael, Kramer, no okay, I'm unmuted! Now! Thank you. Okay, all right would I be correct in assuming that, in a in the Seaport, where there's a 120 foot height limit that you can only build to 110 feet. Sorry, could you repeat the question, so you have a hard and fast 120 foot height limit due to the down zoning. Does that mean a new development could be no taller than 110 feet, plus the 10 feet of resiliency? No, the so, essentially what the text allows for. Is that the point that you're measuring from instead of measuring say from the curve you're measuring from a reference plane that is 10 or sorry not from the curve? Sorry, let me show you in if a building is located in a flood plain, you are measuring the height of that building from the base flood elevation that base flood elevation may be, you know, higher likely is higher than what you know today. As the curve it can, it will vary, and you know the topography varies within the floodplain. What the text allows is if the building pursues certain flood protection measures that meet standards set out in the text, then they are allowed to measure from a reference plane that is 10 feet higher than that flood elevation. So essentially, instead of in this example you're saying 120 foot building, it would be a 130 foot building, so it overrides the existing down zone. It overrides the existing text, amendment that is I, think you're, referring to the South Street Seaport subdistrict in lower Manhattan, which, where the 120 feet rule applies, so it allows for that 120 feet to be measured from a different point, which is 10 feet above so it's effectively resulting in 130 foot, tall buildings right and the other question we have Alice yeah. Thank you, Alison and the other question I have is when we're dealing with coastal resiliency. Sometimes the solutions are things like coastal retreat or stormwater retention. Will this zoning these text amendments allow those types of public purposes, so this text doesn't speak to those sorts of measures again. This is really talking about if you're, a private property owner in the floodplain ways- and you have to comply with Appendix G in the building code, how can we ensure that you are able to comply without being penalized essentially and making sure that the building code requirements and the zoning resolution requirements are in line rather than in conflict? So you know things measures like you were talking about. You know those are really I, see them more. As like larger infrastructure and policy decisions that you know this particular text doesn't really contemplate. I would probably would like to direct you to our website for more information about. Maybe those sorts of policies and I can follow up with Diana for half after hours after this and provide some links. That's helpful, yeah I just want to go throughout that task force. That's why I asked I just wanted to piggyback on Michael's comment, because it's also of interest to me. You know in your in the text amendment it states very clearly, if I'm not mistaken, or maybe it was, the presentation, I think I quoted it in some areas where flood risk is exceptional, including where sea level rise will lead to future daily tidal flooding. There is a need to limit future density to decrease the exposure to damage and disruption, and my question was going to be: where is this approach being considered in the city of New York, specifically in Community board, one I mean that's a policy statement in the text. Amendment yeah I think I'll have to get back to you with more detailed information on that there are some local actions that are going alongside this application and in neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens that I believe and I. Please don't quote me on this I believe some of those local actions are seeking to over time. You know decrease density or proposing a lower density than what exists today, so that in the future you know if it's a critical question, I mean it's absolutely critical. You see cities all over the world taking that tact, and yet here we are in New York City and we really haven't they're, not saying that the city has to take that tech, because we have to address it head on and so I would say. That's to me a missing element from the text if I might just something I'm well versed in so if I could provide more information to the community board after this meeting on, you know, retreat I would love to do that. Thanks, awesome, I, believe the question there is referring to the special coastal high risk zone overlay, which is a tool that the Department of city planning has to limit density in areas of special high risk and the two neighborhood actions that are moving forward at the same time. Is this text amendment I, believe it's old, Howard, Beach and Garrettson Beach in Queens and Brooklyn? Those are implementation of that special coastal risk zone. It's a tool yeah! It's a tool that I believe DCP is implementing kind of in small steps in communities where there's a strong community support for limiting development and density. I'm just saying that what your definition is, of course correct, but you know, arguably the high risk area is covers governors island, for example. So you know you would ask yourself. You know that fundamental question, I'm sure on some people's mind is you know, is this the right approach? So it's just one that I find is there's so little literature on it's a little stated about it and it comes up a lot. So I'm hopeful that as we go forward that this gets addressed more anyway, I'm sorry to throw myself in there anyway, Michael were you finished yeah, just the comment that you know looking for alternatives to shoreline extension in fidei and the Seaport. These are strategies that could be used and they're missing in this text, and certainly a moratorium on density is missing in this text. Thank you thanks Michael, so I have from our committee Bob Schneck. Next Hey Bob. Oh there you go okay, I just wanted to make a put this in some kind of perspective, so I can understand it and various effects. I think all of this is going to have. This is a flood text amendment and to my understanding, it's to make compliance easier with resiliency requirements and that there'll be a mandatory there'll, be mandatory compliance with the appendix g and that a flood map is coming and the map is going to be formalized within the next within the near nearest within the near future. All of these effects are going to have tremendous will have be tremendously expensive for property owners. Even big property owners are going to face some big expenses with this, so I'm just looking at since we've considered the administration has considered the text amendment itself, as it also considered these other things on my list. Starting was the idea of retreat, so we're in line with you, Alice and with Mr Kramer. Then the next thing is the effect on insurance rates. If these things are going to happen and we're going to have new flood maps, how do if you are compliant? How does it affect your insurance rates and has the is the city really involved with that kind of question? Next? Is the finances for renovation? These things are going to be very expensive, and even though the idea here is to alleviate those costs or reduce them, they're still going to be something so they're going to be really considerable. So what options is the city considered financed for how to make these things possible? The next thing that I was thinking about is for new buildings. This, at least, is an advantage because you can build to the new standards, but if you have a building that isn't like that, the expenses for compliance with Appendix G really are expensive and they are mandatory. So a lot of owners are going to have trouble kind of bridging that gap between where they are now and where the mandatory requirements put them, and someone had to have thought about how to make that possible. The final thing I was thinking about is the communication of these things with all of these owners of different kinds that someone contemplated, how to present this to them and how to make it possible for them to work with these new changes, because even to understand these things within the context of a community board, is taxing to someone like me anyway, and to lots of owners I think these things are really difficult and threatening. So that's my observation. Thank you. These are all really excellent questions and observations to be said and I greatly appreciate all of them. You know I, think a lot of what you're we're talking about you know is in regards to from the property owner's perspective of concerns about finances and insurance, and you know communication of this information in a manageable way and I think that's all really important, and I'm so glad to hear you know you Community board, member, raising those concerns. You know I think again, I. You ask a lot of really good questions and I think if I can provide, perhaps our full kind of briefing docket document to the committee following this meeting. It's right on our website, but I can you know, just share a link, so it's easy to find I, think it'll answer or speak to at least many of your questions and concerns raised. I. Think what I'm really trying to express here if I were a property owner and I were confronted with this very threatening wave of legislation and I actually had to comply with it would be. I've been talking to lots of small business owners downtown and they're, really under a tremendous threat right now and they yeah and to see people that put their lives in the businesses, scared to death, like that, it's I'm operating under that effect, because I saw some of those guys this afternoon, but the same principle holds for anyone who tries to operate in the context of New York. It's really expensive, really complex and you need six lawyers even to figure out how to address this. The idea this text amendment is to make it easier to comply with resiliency requirements. It's still awfully hard and we still have all these questions. I'm from I've looked through a lot of those documents. You refer us to and follow those links before, and they just make me more confu I look at them carefully, they're more confusing, so I'm just looking for ways we can kind of help people that actually are overwhelmed with these requirements. I, absolutely you know, I agree. It's really difficult, you know being a property owner small business owner, especially in these times. You know where the text is trying to help it's trying to you know create. You know we were in a situation before where it was difficult to comply with both the building regulations and the zoning resolution, which is just you know, never a situation that one wants to be in and we're hoping that this helps to not only you know, remove those conflicts, but also you know help with some of those. You know financial concerns that you mentioned, but you know I sorry, you can probably hear my dog in the background. I actually understand what you're saying it's very difficult, especially right now I just offered Allison one thought that I had been going through all of the documents and this committee did actually receive all the documents and, in fact got the YouTube tape of the city. Planning commission, you know certification hearing, but I'm just curious. You know it just seems to me that there's just not enough examples. You know like Laura Starr gave an example of something or Bob. It's really helpful. To give the example see how it plays out and frankly, see a graphic of what we're talking about I. Think there's not enough of that in this text, often in many texts, but particularly here, and I'm just wondering if that might assist at all in making this just a more clear and usable document, but just throwing it that out there. Thank you so I think next up, it looks like already on the committee, so well, Tammy help her so Alison. One of the questions that came up that I'm learning so much more information. Every time I hear some more about the text. Amendment is about the special zone that you're referring back to Howard Beach I am confused and concerned only because three board, one in Manhattan, was so highly affected from super storm Sandy and your modeling of the map with the new overlay, certainly changes so much of the landscaping community board one to ask: why aren't we actually included? Why is it a special district that has to be set up for that and why isn't CB1 included there, because we are on record a thousand ways to Sunday, not wanting huge giant development. We have already been flooded. We had over a year's worth of generators on the streets and other things like that. So I'm very curious about this and how CB1 is not considered along our shorelines based on the amount of additional coverage. The zoning text adds to our community board. Why aren't we some kind of an exception for developing sorry? Could you repeat that last part, why aren't we what some exception to density and development along the water, the floodplain? So are you referring to? Why was there not a just I'm just trying to clarify there? Wasn't a local I mentioned some neighborhoods that have local actions. Why was there not a local action for Community Board, one yeah, the city-wide text, which applies well yeah, because when you look at the map and the overlay was and what now is you've taken from a rim of the coastline around Community board, one and two probably I mean I'm not sure the percentage is I haven't done the math, but it certainly does seem like all of a sudden in community board. Women were now 65 percent covered by this new ruling, whereas before it was maybe 30 percent along the edges and not even all of governors, but now it's a hundred percent of the islands in our district. So if the coverage needed to be adjusted so drastically for community board one knowing that we have historic districts, knowing that we were flooded, why are we looking at additional density and far giveaways when we fall into the exact verbiage that you describe in the text amendment as not preferable for that? If the, if you're, referring to the special coastal risk district to be clear, the special coastal risk district restricts use to single family detached homes, and so that tool wouldn't be particularly appropriate for community board. One and I think that from I mean I shouldn't speak for the Department of City planning, but I think that, from the perspective of the Department of City planning, Manhattan community board, one is the place where zoning will is going to have to be assumed to be playing in conjunction with large infrastructure projects in the long run. I would completely agree with that. Thank you, James that you know retreat coastal retreat in you know if there's any place in New, York City or for in the United States, for that matter, where retreat from the coastline is probably makes less sense than investing in large infrastructure projects. Lower Manhattan is probably that place, but all of a sudden now we're being you know, my concern is how it affects the historic districts and our special districts, because, as you know, from what we talked it is and what Laura even mentioned, the interplay of the historic district and the coastal resiliency and the height and the contextuality and the heights of the buildings and usage on ground level are critical to keeping you know. I don't want to see a 10 foot wall around the ground floor, used for storage and reach. You know that doesn't bring life and vibrancy to the community other than plants, oh absolutely, and so what the? What this text does in those kinds of situations? If you imagine a mixed use, building in Tribeca, for example, where the ground floor is retail, and then the upper floors are residential use. What this text would allow is for the property owner to make the ground floor dry floodproof, so it would have waterproof aquarium, glass windows and a floodproof door. Perhaps a flood panel that you would lock into place in front of the door and the walls would have to be structurally reinforced to deal with the loading of flood water. All of that expense could be, to some extent recouped and also, if you have to move any mechanical equipment, could be recouped by adding some additional space on top of the building. Why does it have to be recoup for building something, so your building is sound for new construction. If I'm going to build a house, I need to build it to its sound. So why did they have to why I don't understand? Why there's a recoup I can understand for buildings that are existing, but why they're the recoup is more intended for existing buildings than new buildings and for new buildings I suppose it would provide additional flexibility with respect to where you put the particular equipment. So if you have some additional flexibility with your far, if you have some additional flexibility with the far it gives designers additional flexibility, I take the point that for new construction, it seems less critical to give the to give far exemptions. But I guess it's difficult to differentiate in the zoning text between new construction and I mean we talked about new construction versus substantial improvement. Why is it difficult? Can you explain that to me I guess: I don't mean difficult, I guess I mean you would be setting up two sets of rules, one for existing buildings and one for new buildings and existing buildings already only have to comply with the building code. Flood protection with the resiliency requirements of the building code. Existing buildings only need to comply with current code if they are engaging in a substantial improvement, which is more than 50 percent of the value of the building, so that would be a pretty extensive renovation or if the property owner wanted to take it upon themselves for one reason or another to go to do a flood proofing project that had no other changes to the building. I actually find it I feel like I would be surprised if someone who owned a you know six story attached building. If they were flood proofing the ground floor, they got 30. The first 30 feet of the ground floor far would be exempted. I find it hard to believe that they would then decide I'll build a 30-foot, deep penthouse unit on top of this building to quote-unquote recoup the costs of this flood improvement project that I just paid for I mean you could I suppose generate more income from that unit. If it was a, you know, apartment or something you just hit on exactly the problem that we have with the Water Street Text amendment, one of the major issues that I have with the Water Street text. Amendment is developers not only got a floor area bonus for doing public space, but then we're allowed to enclose the public space and privatize some of it, so they are double bonused and whether that was intended or not is immaterial to the fact that that's the way the text, amendment lands and Allison knows exactly what I'm talking about, and those are the kinds of loopholes while not intended are very viable and actually very flexible for the owners to a level that does not serve us as community benefit. For what they're getting right. It's worth saying and I. Guess it's worth pointing out that there's! No! The word bonus probably has a connotation that there's some additional fb, far that's being awarded for these improvements. It's really more you're, not suffering the it's a deduction and the reallocation right. Thank you so much yeah, sorry and I don't mean to interrupt again James I. Thank you. No, please do you're doing a great job, you're doing a great job representing the decks. I'm really impressed I just want to say that I, you know I if I think Tammy. These are these seem to not be so much questions or as much as suggestions for alteration, and if that's the case you know. Perhaps these are things that should be included in some resolution unless I'm missing something. If you're still, if there's a confusion, I know, we've talked about I want to ask about social occasions, so I get it I just want to. We will be doing a resolution, but if I don't ask and I don't ask about any of that, then I don't know what the answer is. I mean, why put it in your residence? If you can't, you know what I mean: okay with the ground floor, flood proofing, part of the text, I actually I, realized. I've answered this question in some contexts without pointing out that actually, the current temporary provisions in zoning allow for a property owner to exempt the total ground floor area of the building if they do a dry floodproofing, whereas the tech that this text amendment reduces that to only the first 30 feet from the street frontage, and the reason that has been changed is that there were some projects that DCP noticed where developers were building an unusually short first floor, so that they could capture that benefit and make a taller building. So this is intended to provide a more appealing and attractive ground-level street front and removing that you know quote loophole, as you know mentioned earlier. Tammy like we have had the opportunity. You know with this text, which isn't normal to essentially have a beta version out for seven years to have learned from that experience, and we hope that you know have been able to improve upon it. So that's one of those ways: Tommy. Are you good there? We go. Thank you, okay, Rosa Chang! Thank you. So thank you, Allison and James. This is definitely something that's of enormous importance to our community, so I appreciate you guys coming here to help us with some of our questions. I agree with all the prior speakers that flood proofing is an entirely different proposition for existing buildings versus as yet unbuilt buildings and I do feel quite strongly that they should be treated differently. Because of that and then my more specific questions and I'm I believe Diana actually has a list of my questions, so you'll probably be getting a copy of them, but the ones that I'm hoping you consider clarify for me today. One is to deal with permitted obstructions. One was in permitted obstructions in open space and then permitted obstructions and required yards cords and open spaces for all zoning lots. So for the first one, I'm concerned that generators etc. Have you guys known a minimum distance of three to five feet from the lot line and even when enclosed your screen, there's a concern of noise and exhaust for both the property owner as well as the neighbors, and that's I'm wondering about why it's allowed to be so close to the lot lines and then also in yards, etc. It allows for flood control devices to be stored in any open space which to me goes against the entire purpose of providing requiring that open space be provided. So that's question one. Do you want me to I think yeah I think so you know I think I'd ask if you're gonna provide these in written form. That would be very helpful. That's a little too technical for me and unfortunately, no one from our zoning team could join us today. Who were you know really the authors of the tech, so I'd love to get that question in writing and I can share it with them and get back to you. But thank you. Okay, I believe Diana does have that one was a of height for flood resistant buildings. There's a section that carves out quality, housing, buildings and I was wondering why that was I. Think again, these are great technical questions that are, unfortunately, not in my wheelhouse. So again, if I could get that question, writing and I can get back to you. Okay, thank you and the next one was special floor area, modifications for flood-resistant buildings and flood-proofed ground floors. It says for developments. The first story about flood elevation is 13 feet or more above the level of the adjoining sidewalk and I. Guess. I was wondering why and so yeah I think that kind of goes back to what James just touched upon about ensuring that you essentially wouldn't have like sneak in like a four foot tall first floor and count that as a first floor and still get some additional space, it was kind of a I guess, let's say a loophole that we realized with the previous text. That resulted in not a great pedestrian experience and that's why there's now a height minimum. So am I misunderstanding that then, that you are not saying that it could go up to 13 feet. You're saying it must be under I thought it was that it was at least I. Think again, sorry I, if you could provide this one in a written form. That would be very helpful. These are highly technical questions which I always love, but I, don't wanna state the wrong thing: okay and then the last one was for special permits for modifications of certain zoning regulations. It says any modification of height and setback regulations related to increasing the permitted overall height shall not exceed the maximum height permitted by the applicable underlying district regulations by 10 or 10 feet. Whichever is greater so I guess I'm wondering why greater and because does that mean that if that 10 percent maximum building height of 300 feet, then 330 feet, I'm thinking of a very specific situation, like governor's island, sure yeah, because that sounds like that's a gift of 30 feet: yeah I, sorry, I'm gonna have to get back to on that as well. But thank you. These are all great technical questions. I do appreciate you doing so much due diligence, yeah I! Guess it I guess. My point, though, is that it, as everyone has said in prior comments, I mean it is an enormous challenge for an existing building to retrofit themselves and I do believe that the give back to help defray the cost of that work and effort is appropriate. But I think that when you're talking about a new building and especially a very large lot new building with a lot of street frontage I understand the change that you made to make it so that it's only the floor area to set back 30 feet from the sidewalk is taken out, but, for instance, in a property like 250 water or for the governor's island buildings. That's actually enormous. That's all street frontage essentially, and it's a significant amount and then you're allowing those buildings to then raise their street wall. Maximum Street wall height to you know, 10 feet higher or possibly more. If I understand this text correctly, possibly 30 feet higher and then the maximum building height and so I guess there's a significant concern that, with these larger mega projects that the benefit being received by these is not commensurate because right now everything's on paper and there isn't an enormous cost, I mean there's. Obviously the construction cost of doing that extra work, but it is not the same cost as it is to let's say a landmark: existing co-ops between 20 unit owners, I can't agree in the cost. You know like it's a situation, and so, while on, in the one hand, I believe that it makes sense. On the other hand, I really do believe that it's becoming a very large loophole gift to private companies. Yeah absolutely I mean we discussed this when I, when we presented at the land, use, Committee and I, you know I think it's a very good point. So thank you. Okay, thank you and I. Believe Diana has all my more technical questions. Yes, email, I, just emailed them to you. Thank you. I will forward them to my more educated co-workers on this text. Thank you. Can you guys comment a little bit about in terms of going green? Eventually there will be battery storage in buildings on roofs. You know maybe inside some of the other. You know this has come up before and this is unclear still because of battery safety. But is this addressed you know? Is this something that you're addressing in terms of putting solar panels on roofs and then there'll be battery storage? And this type of thing? Can we talk a little more about that? I can not talk more about that I. Don't really that's not a provision. That's part of this text, James I, don't know if you have anything you wanted to add. There I know that one thing that this text does that if one of the things that the city-wide text amendment does it applies outside of the flood plain, is it allows power systems like batteries or solar panels as permitted obstructions, so it I guess this text allows backup power as a permitted obstruction for most buildings in most places, but I, don't know a great deal more detail than that. Can you clarify what the question was? More specifically certainly I know you're talking about doing it, for these are individual homes and there's some buildings that you're talking about. But you know I just think when you're doing a new update in terms of you know, flood mitigation, you know part of it is people want to make their buildings green at the same time, you know the people might even want to go towards a passive house standard. You know these types of things and I understand from earlier discussions that the passive house standards isn't exactly in line, but you know it's getting closer, but I just keep thinking that you know batteries and solar panels and everything else are coming as well, just if someone's going to take the time to upgrade their building. This is going to be part of the discussion yeah and from what I understand this text will allow those things if you have to put them in, if again, not so much in a Manhattan CB1. But if you have a backyard or a side yard you'd be allowed to put a battery. You know a power wall back there or maybe, if you had a wind turbine or some solar panels and on your roof. So I guess this allows those things, I'm not sure if it incentivizes them per se, and there might be some additional flexibility about placement. I I'd have to look at the text again. This text really isn't sorry sustainable building as much as you know, resiliency from flooding and other you know, natural hazards, yeah I think it's included in this text, mainly as a idea about backup power in case of an outage right and I. Think what you're speaking about is something different: it's more about sustainability and having a maybe a low carbon or carbon neutral building, which is, you know, obviously a great thing to do, but not the intent of this text. Okay, thanks, Jason, Friedman, Jason I just wanted to know. Did we all have a chance to weigh in on this first zoning text amendment or was that something done like emergency? After sandy by city planning? No, the community ward, one did pass a resolution on the 2013 text amendment. We should pull that Alice just to see what we talked about then. Definitely I can not recall the resolution comments, but I know it was approved unanimously. I can I think I. Have that on hand actually I think I actually downloaded it from the CB1 website, so I can send it to the link to you if you have any difficulties, locating it. So if I'm understanding correctly I mean I have a series of detailed questions, a little lined with some of roses and I don't want to spend the evening going over those either. So is the idea that those of us with many questions that might be what you would call detailed or in the weeds, should be just fielded to you and you'll. Get back to us with the answers. Is that the best way to approach that Alison and James? Yes, absolutely, you know please keep in mind, there's 59 community districts that are all reviewing the same time, so to the extent that you can provide any questions in written form and email them to us just so that we can keep track of everything. So a little bit of chaos, as you can imagine, I, would greatly appreciate that and it lets us track things much better. I, just totally send them as soon as possible, so that we have time to respond before their crafting resolution. So thanks very much I encourage everyone to do that, to send them to the board, and then we will field them out to DCP. I should have two questions. If I can ask just curious that it looks like nursing, homes are the only use group that can't be built in the one percent annual chance floodplain. Is that correct and were other uses considered for that exempted group? I have to get back to you on that I think. The idea was that it was you know, vulnerable populations and I. Think nursing homes are kind of exemplary of the type of population that were aiming at I, don't know if there's other specific buildings or use groups that would fall into that category. So I'll get back to you. My understanding I mean absolutely Alison double check. My understanding is that it is only nursing homes and it's the one percent flood plain and a few specific other parts of the city, namely all of the harbor islands and anything south of the Belt Parkway, essentially so I believe it's only nursing homes and the idea there being that that's a population where even evacuating is kind of traumatic. What about hospitals? Sorry? What was that question? Hospitals, I just think of other use groups, it just I know this is a question that came up before so if I could get back to you with our response on that, because I know, we've been asked that question before about. You know other types of uses. So, okay, so that's a more general question, then I just have one specific one. That's been burning in my mind, particularly looking over the governor's island text. Is the shore public walkway, that's referred to in the text amendment the same as what would be considered the esplanade or promenade that's referred to in the governor's island text. No, they are republic walkways a zoning defined term. The waterfront Esplanade, as described in the Gunners Island Texas Something, unique to governors Island. So in that particular interpretation of the text on governor's island would the requirement of you know a 40-foot minimum width of the promenade and others are over that, in other words, permitted obstructions that are described in the zoning for coastal flood resiliency text are those the same. That would be considered a governor's island, so a landscape firm, for example, could be put in the promenade governor's island as a permitted obstruction, and it could be any size. It seems like as long as you've left a 40-foot width in that promenade I just wanted to understand that I don't know if that's too detailed, sorry, but I really want to get that. No I know it's a great question but I think that's a governor's island question more than a phone infrastructure, resiliency question I mean I, understand that's next on our agenda, so yeah. If you could also you know, email that question to me and the applicant for that particular project. The trust for governors Island sure- and you know, we'll review the text and confirm yeah. Terrific thanks I know: governor's island is probably on the line right now, so maybe they want to already jump in I think we are going to move on to that unless I, don't actually I want to open it up to the Diana. Do we have anyone from the public here that would I, don't see anybody? Okay, so are we set to move on? Oh I'm! So sorry, Stacy Schube has a question. Let me unmute her right now: hi Stacy hi. Can you hear me now? Yes, Tammy did steal a bit of my thunder and my question but I think I'd still like some clarification. It's really kind of simple: if we're not talking about a historic building renovation, why does the city feel the need to give financial incentives to a developer, building new construction for taking resiliency measures in a flood zone I? You know I. Think we've talked about this in several times and I think Rosa or sorry was it rose. So sorry, I'm probably missing the person's name who spoke earlier. Who raised a similar point? You know I think this is something that as a city-wide text, if you're considering this from all perspectives, so, for example, I am a you know, somebody who just bought a I, don't know vacant loss exists in New York, but I bought a you, know, vacant thousand square foot lot and I'm trying to develop a single family home on it perspective. You know it's very different context than it might be in lower Manhattan, so I would just say that and the type of developers and type of building forms we see in lower Manhattan I. You know those costs are expensive and yes doing something new versus renovating something is always going to be less expensive, but it's still expensive to build something to be in a resilient form. So I think with all of these. You know, as the community board drafts a resolution I think it's helpful to keep that in mind that this is a city-wide text amendment and not all of New York City, the majority of New York City, looks very different from community board one, and you know these provisions are trying to meet the needs of everyone. Okay, I guess my the reason for that is you they're doing something that is prudent for them to be doing for themselves, you're buying a lot you're building a lot in a flood zone I just don't see why we have to incentivize them to waterproof their flood they're building in a flood zone. That's all! Well, it's we're not just to be clear. They have to comply with the building code. If they're building a new building in the flood zone right, they have to comply with Appendix G. So the zoning first and foremost ensures that there are not conflicts with what the building code says versus what the zoning resolution says, so that when you're building your building you're, not you're in compliance with both sets of rules and then beyond that it kind of minimizes or attempts to minimize you know financial hardship as part of trying to be compliant with the building code. I understand the point that you're making I do, and you know similar to the previous point about new buildings versus retrofits. You know we appreciate those sorts of comments in the resolution. Thank you thanks very much Stacy. Oh I see two more hands have gone up: okay, David, Sheldon, okay, I'm trying to understand what it would be about: Garrettson, Beach and Howard Beach that would warrant special consideration. That would not be warranted, say in red hook. Can you help me with that? I I'd like to point you to information on our website. I think we're I think that's it's too long of a conversation to go into at this moment. So I'll point you to additional information. Yeah! That's all I can really say right now. I've been involved in the text at that time of deciding which neighborhood David will we'll add that question to the group questions and forward the response. Thank you very much. Thank you Alan. Thank you, Alex. Thank you. Okay, Bob is your hand up there. Yes, it is I. Think I, just wanna. I've been thinking quite a bit about how to apply this, particularly in CB1 and I spend a lot of time around pier a and I imagine puree being flooded in that whole first floor, designing a first floor. That's supposedly flood proof, but really there's tens of thousands of dollars of investment. In bars and stairwells all kind of bathrooms it, if it got flooded, it would be onerously expensive anyway. The other kind of things I'm thinking about is in community board one. We have things like France's tavern next to a regular building. Those buildings are kind of historic, and you there's nothing. We can do to flood proof really, except all we can do, is really build big defenses around lower Manhattan, rather even than to try and apply these kinds of principles, and the next thing I think about is basements and elevator escalators, rather into basement sales areas, which are very common down here. If there's isn't any first floor that you can kind of flood proof and protect there is we have such vulnerabilities, because the cost of a flooded basement and the flooded first war is so onerous, and the next thing is: we have things that are related to subways that are very deep, extremely difficult to protect areas. So I don't even try even trying to imagine how if I were God I could apply this ruling in lower Manhattan, it's kind of like we have to make a decision either or either we're going to. You know kind of make a major defense around this, so it doesn't get flooded because we really don't have the option of on a particular basis, trying to train trying to protect buildings with the idea of higher Florida flood proofing. Like was just said, building a building here in a coastal flood zone shouldn't be allowed in the first place and we shouldn't kind of like go two ways at once and say you have to follow this rule to build something. That's flood proof when we shouldn't be building here at all, it might I, I'm just trying to express a kind of concern about the difficulties of trying to even apply this legislation in lower Manhattan I, don't know if anybody, James or Allison won't respond, but I again, I feel like discussed this. A lot I think that there are ways that historic buildings and all the buildings in lower Manhattan can utilize. The text as proposed I, think that you know the way that it utilizes the way these buildings will utilize. The text is going to be different than you know: single-family detached homes in another borough, perhaps but there's still benefits to lower Manhattan thanks I guess what you do here is a lot of people. Speaking on the same point and I would guess the city at some point has to kind of identify why this approach in the flood zone- you know basically to increase density or build yeah I. Think it's an interesting question that probably would be worthy of more conversation anyway, Megan Melvin hi, guys hi. Can you hear me yeah, hello, hey so just really quick along the lines of what Rosa was talking about, but before, but also in relation to Covid-19 and the massive impact that the rent problems that a lot of land building owners are facing in the next couple months. There is a huge likelihood that many of the small buildings- friends like the ones in the Seaport or also in Chinatown when I, was talking to Jan from nubc. They are losing small landlords hand over fist to giant developers who are gobbling up these little small, beautiful character, driven communities and they're going to knock them all down. They're going to take advantage of this far and they're, going to completely turn major swaths of New York City from the character driven, unique little buildings, they're being incentivized to prey on the weakness of these small building owners right now and turn it into a giant profit and to a giant building. I. Think that there's a lot of problems with the way the text is written and how it overly incentivizes the new builds I just want some, the community board to be aware of all the different ways it can be impacting I think that I this text is really about coastal resiliency and I, understand the scenario that you're lying out there. I. Don't think that this is going to be a tax that you know, alters or hinders any. You know a proposal to purchase adjacent properties and amass the air rights, but this doesn't affect one way or another: a developer's ability to do that. Why is that not true? Why? How does this text enable a property owner to amass air rights on their property? It doesn't allow them to amass rights so much as it gives them use of the ground floor, whilst, while ignoring the square footage that is utilized for that in specific parts of your text hi. This is Rosa again so, for instance, that 30-foot setback not setback, but the yeah right that and then being able to still have that as functional usable square footage and yet ignoring the fact that it's there for the purposes of calculating zoning square footage and then also the ability to obviously close off any of the permitted obstructions that are now being encompassed with generators etc, whether it be on the roof or whether it be on the on in any. You know previously open space that they now could possibly occupy and then, of course, the increase in height for both the maximum base height of the building, as well as the overall maximum building height, so I believe that all of these building components, so the concern is the building, will dry flood proof will be able to duct that floor area to a depth of 30 feet. So, let's say I, don't know, maybe a thousand square feet. It depends on I, guess the frontage of the building and that they would then sell those air rights to a neighboring property, and there would be a property that is simply amassing those air rights from all of its neighbors. Well, no, the air rights actually, typically, air rights can only be transferred to a neighboring property with which you have at least 10 contiguous feet of adjoinment. So that to me, that's not specifically a concern, but there is an enormous gift. When I agree, when you're talking about a smaller lot, then again you know I'm fine with that where I have concern is when you were talking about a lot like, for example, 250 water, that has street frontage on all four sides, and it is an enormous lot and therefore they're the benefit that they receive specifically on those types of projects or like governors island, and this is unfortunate because your text amendment is coming up exactly when we are reviewing these two specific properties. So it's on our mind and we can't really avoid it. But when I look at the text, amendment with those two properties in mind, I see an enormous giveaway and that could be dealt with if you say, capped some of the benefits at a specific square footage, for instance, or if you cast all the floor. Air reductions are capped. It depends on the building side, it depends on the building size, so, for instance, you're saying 250 water could not then utilize. Basically, right off the you know, 30 feet back on all four streets and then take their maximum base, height up 10 feet and their maximum building height up 10 feet or possibly more as a percentage. If that percentage thing is in play, I'm saying that all of the floor area reductions are capped in a certain way, the way that their cache is described in the text, that's usually dependent on you, know, red flood, spoofing or dry floodproofing or deployable panels and storage, and it's a usually a mathematical equation of you know how much of the frontage is utilizing that particular floodproofing measure, as well as the height of the building, the design of the building. The transparency, for example, there's a lot of factors that weigh in, but it's not just a you know you get an entire floor, written off, there's requirements have to be made and met, and then calculations made based off of those requirements that are mapped. I'm not I would love it if you could get back to us with that information, because, obviously that would then lay a lot of our concerns. If there was let's say a benefit, cap of you know five thousand square feet, or you know whatever, and it wasn't like three hundred thousand square feet that would help Rosa. That's gonna have to go into a resolution. She's not gonna, be able to get back to us with suggestions for teaching they're, not changing, she's, saying it existed. I can get back to you with the provisions of the text that explain how the four era reductions are calculated. That would be excellent. Indeed, thank you, I think, if I'm not mistaken, Diana with that, we are we've covered everyone's questions. The zoning for customer resiliency text is that right. It looks that way and I'll put my email in the chat for anybody who wants to follow up with me with a question or whatever it might be, and I'll coordinate with Allison to get responses on these things and we'll circulate them back out. So just again that everybody understands this is really helpful. I'm really glad that we got to speak a little bit more on this incredibly important text. Amendment and I really thank James and Allison for coming at the last minute and helping us out with it. So we have another round of this when the resolution will actually be written, as you know next week. Sorry is that right, the 21st I'm constantly, and so please do send all your questions and comments that you would like included at that time, because, obviously, at one meeting it would we're not going to have you know hours to flush it all out. So this is why we're doing some of this tonight. So thanks very much for all the participation really appreciate it. So now we'll be moving on to you know it's like the trifecta, so you went from 250 water street to the citywide coastal zoning text, amendment and now we're going to governor's island. So here again just to be clear. The resolution on the zoning map and the text amendments will happen at the land nuisance zoning meeting on December 14th next week. Tonight, we're talking just a little bit about environmental impact, specifically as it concerns resiliency and sustainability again to kind of inform our resolution coming up, or in fact, we've discussed the possibility of having a separate resolution on the EIS, which in fact will happen in February I. Think if I'm not mistaken Diana, could you just confirm that? That's great that's correct that we actually could have another meeting in January with this committee to discuss the EIS in more detail? Is that correct? That's right and Sarah confirmed that with me today we can submit written comment on the Deis up until I believe 10 days after the Cpc hearing in February, Sarah Krautham is I think with us on the phone I thank her very much from the governor's island. Trust to I guess answer questions as well. I, don't know if I've opened her up to something she wasn't expecting, but in any case we are so. This is the second. There are many environmental impact statements over many years on the island but plus I. Think if I'm not mistaken, the last one that we're reviewing is the secondary supplemental generic environmental impact statement that I think was released in October and so hopefully folks have a chance to have thought a little bit about that and engage in questions, thoughts, concerns and even if you haven't read it just general environmental concerns on the island that you'd like to have addressed. If there's anybody from the committee who'd like to engage on this I see David Sheldon's hand up no okay down whatever, oh. Well. Surprisingly, I'm sorry David is that that's a no okay, so is anyone? Does anyone in the committee have anything that they'd like to speak about in terms of governors, Island Resiliency, Sustainability, environmental impacts, wow surprising? Ah so there's our Rosa Chang I was gonna, say I'll. Ask you a question later too, but Rosa you go first, sorry, Wendy I didn't see you no worries. I am you're back good for you, everybody's gonna be sick of me. One thing I noticed at the last presentation was that the buildings were elevated, noticeably at a higher level than the esplanades were, and so to me it seemed a little strange that the buildings were essentially protected from flood water, but the public parkland areas were not and I was wondering if you could clarify if that was correct, yeah Allison. Are you still with us I hope, because you would be the right person to answer that. Can you respond to that? Or did you already like sorry? Are you asking me yeah? It would be helpful if you had a thought about that. You want to ask that. Did you hear it or do you want Rosa to repeat it, I would like Rosa to repeat it, I think, but the trust for governors Island is on correct yeah Sarah's on Sarah, just messaged. You were on a attendee with your verse panelists, so you can mute and unmute yourself, but yes, Sarah's with us. Oh great, thank you. Both all questions should really be to the trust for Governor's island as the applicant. If there's you know technical questions or concerns and Sarah wants me to jump in, then I'm happy to do so, but I leave it to her perfect thanks so Sarah. So, okay, so Rosa, maybe repeat the question briefly and they are welcome and thank you for taking the time to respond. Hi Sarah. So at the last presentation that you guys made I noticed that in some of your renderings, the elevations of the buildings were starting at a higher elevation than the neighboring Esplanade areas that were shown in the renderings, and so it seemed like the buildings were basically being flood-proofed or protected, but that the overall parkland was not and I was wondering if that was an incorrect understanding or if that is in fact the case hi, Rosa and Sorry. Can everyone hear me I apologize for Diana I missed your chat yeah. We can hear you so that is not totally correct and I think we did receive this question via email from Diana. But when West ate designed the park, the majority of the new park space that was created was lifted. Above the flood plain, there were portions of the park really most, notably the esplanade that were not elevated, and that was there are certain areas of the park, including the lawn spaces that are intended to be able to withstand flooding and in the development sites, will need to incorporate resiliency measures. I think the renderings that have been shown show a range of methods. There have been proposals to either elevate the space to create this high-level esplanade. We've also showed some alternative approaches, such as elevating the buildings, but the majority of the park was elevated and really has been considered a model in terms of utilizing park, spaces for the plan for resiliency for future flooding and sea level rise, and we can provide I can follow up with I know, Diana requested a copy of the master plan, but a lot of those design elements are really outlined in great detail as part of West State's plan that was released in 2010 specific questions on that we're happy to answer and provide more information. That would be great Sarah I have just again on that rose and I discussed this a little bit, but in 2018 the Deis had the proposed. The proposal included the elevation of the development parcels and the establishment of the split-level promenades as part of the actual proposal to respond to the resiliency concerns. I'm just curious why those were removed. Is it just to offer more flexibility, and in that vein, it would be really helpful to see given. That seems like a potential likely scenario, given that it was a proposal only a few years ago. You know what that really looks like and what that means in terms of the scales of these promenades, which so that's a two-part I, guess question, but you know or ask what's very unclear to me and I was trying to bring up earlier in the Sony Coastal resiliency discussion is how these promenades go from level zero. If you will to you, know level 15. and it's the idea that the berm, let's say in a split level, you know to understand: are we talking about that 75 feet being cut back by the scale of the berm? So you're talking about only 50 feet or how does that work in terms of the split level promenade? It may not be something you want to do tonight, but if you can just get give us a better grasp on that, because it looks like that's something: that's likely that could happen and we don't really have any information on it and it was in the Deis, as you know earlier, yeah that I'll have to get back to you on the specifics of your question, but the split level promenade was a concept that was proposed and is something that could still be done as part of this proposal. I think the different strategies around resiliency have been researched kind of in great detail for our proposal, and we wanted to show a range of strategies that could be accomplished on governor's island really as a showcase for different resilient construction methods. But your question around the promenade I'll have to get back to you. If you don't mind sending the question to Diana yeah. Of course, why? In two years, was it taken out of that proposal? The current proposal, but it was in an earlier proposal- is it just to show I'm just curious? Why, like I said I think we wanted to show a range of methods? No, you know all of this will be subject to a future. Rfp got it. Okay, all right! So, let's see Michael Kramer. My question is about the construction process. My recollection is that the south end of the island is all built on landfill, meaning that it's going to be very soft and you're going to have to go down very deep in order to build 30-story buildings. What are you going to do with the fill? Is that in the future going to be on the Seaport side and extending our shoreline? I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand your question the fill so when the world Trade Center was built which was basically built with it with a bathtub underneath because it was basically landfill. Are you going to have to build a bathtub to build your tall buildings and then what are the environmental effects of all the fill and the deeper foundations that are going to be needed? How will that impact us? That's another question that I'll have to get back to you all on good question. Okay, thanks all right, Rosa your hand is up again. Is that you again or good if it is about to lower it? Okay well, I have to say I'm surprised at how few questions or concerns folks are raising, but I imagine more will come as we look over the actual Eas EIS. Perhaps at the next meeting. Well, I have another question which I you know: I just curious about how the proposal you know under your general purposes, one of the main goals I think was to promote public use of the island for water-related recreational and educational activities that benefit from the unique island setting and I. Just was wondering how you know the goal is being met in the current proposal. It's kind of unclear where areas have been set aside. As for recreational uses of Saudi associated with this unique island setting, you know the potential for step down areas and for fishing and boating, and the like, and much of this was recommended in the waterfront alliance maritime plan. That was provided to the trust in 2019, which highlights a lot of these areas for recreational activities and stresses the need to make wedge and assured part of the development, and it just seems at this point it's critical that gets addressed so that the infrastructure for waterfront access occur early in the development process. So I would be curious. I think it would benefit the community to know more about. You know how that goal is being met specifically in terms of the public use for water-related recreational. I'm sure it's all there, but it would be great to highlight it in terms of the zoning, if possible. That again doesn't have to be right now, but sure so you know it's something. Increasing waterfront recreation and educational opportunities has always been our goal and I think, thanks to the partnership that we have with many of our partners, including the Harbor, School, Billy and oyster project. Other programming organizations like the climate museum, grown Yc and earth matter on the island we've been able to deliver a really I, think successful range of public programming opportunities related to climate and the environment on the island. We are very much interested in expanding recreational opportunities. I think many of you know that the downtown boathouse runs a free, kayaking program on the island. We think there's a lot more, that we can do and we think that the vision we've outlined as part of this proposal will help amplify and expand opportunities for that work. Part of what we are focusing on now, in tandem with the outreach we're doing related to the rezoning, is developing a really robust set of goals. We want to incorporate into the RFP so goals around public engagement. Other recreational amenities we want to see on the island I know that this community board has talked a lot about some of the waterfront alliance's recommendations. I know that there's been interest in opportunities to touch and engage with the water. These are all things that we can both write into future rfps, but also continue to explore through programming through recreational enhancements. But you know a lot of this requires funding and you know we're committed to expanding this stuff, but it's as funding becomes available, but we are happy to continue to engage with the community board on these ideas and talk about creative proposals for more recreation on the island. Related to the waterfront I mean I would just argue that I think that it's as I said it's just really critical. That infrastructure gets really lodged early and you know I, don't know if there's a way to address it in zoning, but I'm wondering if that's not a good idea, and you know I remember in an earlier proposal: for example, the wetlands at the south part of the island were being addressed, but now are removed from this proposal. It just seems like that would be a great thing to remain as part of this zoning proposal and the like, I, don't know if that's possible, but it just seems as if the water foreign uses and recreational uses are just you know, just in waiting for an RFP, I'm just not sure if that's the wisest approach but yeah the Rfp's goal. Setting is really one strategy for achieving that. I think you know, as we've shared with the community board in regard, you know there is still more open space to be built on the South Island, including the wetland portion of the park you mentioned. That is something that West state had proposed. I think most folks are familiar with picnic point on the island. There is a portion of the currently fenced off area adjacent to the Eastern Development zone that is allocated for park space as part of our master plan, so there's actually still unbuilt park on the island. We're excited about the wetland idea. We actually did show it in our renderings for the climate center proposal, so that is certainly still on the table. Those portions of the master planned Park were not completed due to funding. They were basically veed out of the plan back when the park was being built, but we you know, are still committed to building them. So I think we'll want to definitely engage with the community board on ideas and how to use that space, but we're still into the wetland idea and excited to pursue it. But again you know we currently have the funding for that and we'll be building that public spaces. Well, that's good to hear look forward to seeing more with that water activation plan yeah and just lastly, you know given this is a little bit more on environmental impacts. I actually read the chapter on hazardous materials and I just was I was struck in reading that, since it was a an active military base, it was impossible. It was possible to encounter quote unexploded ordinances, which were defined as unexploded bombs or remnants of war and that it states that there are a set of precautions currently undertaken during intrusive activities. I was just I mean I, assumed you had that under control, but I was kind of curious as just where you're at with that, and more specifically, is the gas station and the that hazardous building out there on the south end of the island. Is that gone or and are those brownfield sites? I'm just curious about those that whole area down there in the south end so I'll have to get back to you on some of the technical aspects of your question. I will say that we do have an archaeologist that we work with on some of these issues when there's any construction on the island. That's particularly come up within the historic district and the existing tenants and projects we have there, whether it's Lmcc or the Harbor School new construction has had some review by an archaeologist which, to me sounds like a pretty fascinating job. I believe the gas station you're, referring to on the South island, which previously was located in the Eastern Development zone, was demolished, but I will have to triple confirm that yeah, the entirety of it is no longer present. Are there brantfold sites on the island? Let's get back to you on that question, all right, I'm gonna shut up now. Thank you very much Sarah. Oh my pleasure. Okay. I see Jeff Galloway, I'm fine thanks, I apologize if you've addressed this already, but I didn't hear it. If you did as I understand the current development plans that the RFP will be based on anticipate development of somewhat in excess of 4 million square feet and if I remember right. Previous plans showed development of a little over a million square feet. So there's been a substantial increase and, as I understand it, the rationale for the increase is to achieve self-self sustainability of the island. Can you is there anything you can share with us in terms of what numbers in terms of revenue required in order for the island to be self-sustaining, and it seems to me that the more you develop the higher those numbers might be because there would be more infrastructure that would need to be developing and a corollary question is to what extent. Well it's really a commentary. Is that I think we'd not like to see over development? If the objective is to create something like battery park city, where you have these huge excesses of revenue that end up going into the general fund and it's you're really generating more revenue than you need to be self-sustaining. So if you could just comment on the kind of the economic analysis and what kind of numbers you may be able to share with us in terms of self-sustainability sure, so on November 9th at the land use committee, we presented a fairly detailed presentation that went into the zoning rules, the Deis and our path to financial self-sufficiency. So I'd encourage you to review what's been presented previously and to the extent that the community board has specific questions on the financial model, we're happy to dig in and provide those answers. But if Diana, if you could point the Jeff to the public presentation that we shared I'd, appreciate it sure I'm putting the link in the chat right now, perfect. Okay, thank you and then on the question of previous density. That's been studied. I will say that previous studies either related to the North island rezoning, which happened in 2013 or the park construction. At that point, there was not a specific plan for development on the South island and the 1.3 million square feet number was based on the previous coast guard development. This the proposed cap on density on the South island was developed both with financial self-sufficiency in mind and also to reflect what we see as an opportunity to create a vibrant district on the island to support both the climate center vision, as well as expanded, year-round use of the island. You know we have said this before, but we really want to make sure that we have the right mix of uses to support an island that is as exciting and vibrant in the summer as it is in the winter it. You know, we've heard a number of concerns from the community board related to heights bulk and overall density. So you know I think, would encourage you all to comment on that in the resolution, but the detailed financial model information is available on that November, 9th presentation and again, if there are specific questions and what's been provided we're happy to answer those okay. Thank you. I'll. Take a look at that Sarah. Would there be any time to present the 2013 that people refer to the earlier 1.625 million square feet development that was presented into only 2013 and has now come up as an alternate that the community is being asked to look at because I don't think we've ever seen? That is there any time for that. You know. I realize time is running short, but I'm just curious. I will say that there wasn't really a proposal put forward there. That was basically included as a placeholder to study the North island rezoning, which I think a lot of folks on this board were around for, but you know, the trust at that point did not move forward with the rezoning of the South island. For a number of reasons. One is that there was not there had been previous rfps for the South Island development sites and I think there was a question of whether Guy peck at the time would have a respondent manage the rezoning versus the entity, so I wouldn't say that there's really much to present other than what's already publicly available related to the EIS, but we're for previous studies. But we're happy to answer any questions around that, but you know the previous RFP attempts did not generate a proposal or plan for the South Island. So that's why that number was included as a placeholder right. I'm sorry I was a little unclear. There. I meant that at this point, if I'm not mistaken, a similar plan is being presented to the community to the city as an alternate. Isn't there one that's a no action plan and then there's a intermediate plan that resembles these kinds of square footage that are that is in the application as an alternate I, don't you know, the community board has never seen that I. Just wonder if that's something that we might be able to arrange to see. Do you know what I'm talking about? Am I crazy? I'm talking about the alternates that were presented in chapter 19 I. Think of your of the EIS is, if you don't mind, following up with an emailed question, I just want to make sure that we're talking about the same thing, yeah I could have it wrong. I will certainly do that. Thank you of Course Tammy Tommy. Did you have a have your hand? I apologize, I'm juggling my apologies, no problem when we're looking at the EIS. Is there different resiliency measures and the environmental impact being considered on the mapped parkland on the north versus the planned open space in the cell? I'm sorry Tammy the existing open space in the historic district. No in the North island you adapt parkland right Sarah on the North Island, there's mapped, parkland right, part of the federal lands or map park. The open space on the North island is not mapped parkland. There are 22 acres of governor's island that are designated as a national monument that includes the two historic forts on the island. Those are owned and operated by the National Park Service. So are the resiliency measures and the thought process and the environmental impact different for those zones versus the rest of the island. There are different res. There would be different resiliency considerations for the North island, mostly because the majority of it is not is above the floodplain I'll have to get back to you. If there's specific questions there's you know we're not proposing any changes to the open space on the historic district as part of this but I. Could you know if there's specific questions that you have or concerns related to the open space on the north island? We're happy to get back to you and look into it? We're just looking for I'm looking for a contextuality of you know: I, don't want to say north versus south sure. You know that, because that doesn't sound right, but to understand the treatments and the considerations for both, because it is one island so looking to understand the relationship between those and feel free to get back to us. You know: that's just it's a good starting place to have conversations on that. Yeah definitely I mean I. Think I. One thing I want to point out is the as I think everyone knows the park space on the South island was built relatively recently between open between 2014 and 2016, and it really was designed to be a cutting-edge showcase of developing resilient landscapes, and you know we shared some of those strategies in our presentation. I know there have been a lot of presentations, but on November 2nd it. You know. The North Island luckily is situated above the area that the new park on the South island was built on, as Michael mentioned earlier, it was built. The South island was built using Phil from the construction of the Lexington Avenue subway line. So we had this flat blank slate to play with and you're talking about the hills right, yet the hills, but also you know, parts of park phase one like Hammock, Grove, Leggett Terrace. When you enter through the legged archway to first encounter the new park. It's subtle, but you'll notice that you start to kind of walk on an incline as you walk towards the hills. All of that space was designed with the city's latest resiliency projections and elevated above the floodplain. So they are two distinct landscapes but agree Tammy that it is one island and resiliency. Considerations have to be taken into account for everything, but the North island really fared quite well during Sandy. A lot of it again is elevated higher than the previous South island space, but we can I can get back to you with some more specifics on how we're approaching resiliency just in our day-to-day operations, even with the historic district. Well, it's also thank you. I appreciate that it's also, you know what we spend a lot of time in this committee, specifically talking about the connectivity of resilience measures around the tip of the island. It would be absolutely without precedent. You know we would be remiss if we didn't ask for understanding of the connectivity for what resiliency and climate change plans, how they overlap and integrate to be seamless around the island. I'd hate to lose one without having asked the question absolutely and how about I mean I know it's not related, but you've got the two different docs that you know you connect to Brooklyn and you connect to lower Manhattan. Are they? How do they fare when you look at resiliency? Are they going to be okay with sea level rise? Are there pilings deep enough to handle all the storms? Are they related to other things that you're working on or do you feel like they're? Fine, you know I mean I, don't know. If that's this is the appropriate time to bring it up or not? No, it is a good question. Unfortunately, our real estate and capital team couldn't join tonight. I definitely want to let them answer the question around how we're investing in those assets. Obviously it's something that the trust is continuously looking at and thank you peer. We really do envision, it's just being expanded and likely rebuilt to support more frequent ferry service to the island. So resiliency is something that's certainly top of mind when we're thinking about future planning for the pure infrastructure, but I will get back to you on the existing conditions, and so you need the development in part to pay for the upgrades to those areas. Is that the thought process as well? Yes, absolutely and you're still of the mindset that you've got to do all of this development, so it can so this governor's island can support itself. Is that still the main goal here? It is it's something that has really always been envisioned for the island since the transfer, and it's certainly something we've been talking about a lot with this community board and also you know. Our goal too is to make sure that we're able to maintain the island as it is today, but we really want to expand access year-round. We think that this is a huge asset for the city that should be publicly accessible in the winter just the same as in the summer. So this plan is really also finding what we think is an exciting vision to really make the island part of the everyday fabric of the city in a way that's accessible and use in line with the vision with the deed. Certainly that makes sense. Do you feel like you're, in competition with the Hudson River park, since they have the same mandate that they need to figure out a way to be self-sustaining in terms of being able to cover their costs? Or you know, do you not feel like you're in competition with the Hudson River park, I wouldn't say we're in competition. I think we share similar challenges. I think that one difference they would point out with governors island. That's we really are more than a park. You know we operate as a number of different agencies. You know we run the transportation to and from the island, I can't think of another park that is responsible for getting people to and from it solely. We also maintain all the infrastructure. We have tenants. As you all know, we also have a pretty robust cultural community, so you know: there's the island as an arts and culture destination which I think we've shared too is a huge part of our vision for the future that all costs money to maintain, and we think it's important that we continue to support that in a robust way, and then you know to making sure that we're able to maintain the island as a recreational resource. You know the open space today is great, but we think that there are ways that we can be utilizing it more fully whether it's through athletic field uses more recreational activities. I know, we've heard ideas for more performance spaces, Amphitheater Bandshell that thing, so we think that there's a lot more. We could be doing on the island to serve the community. Thank you is that is this. Sarah is the self-sustaining aspect, something that's in a regulation. A mandate I think has River park, trust, that's part of their mandate. Right. Is this part of a does? This exist as a document where you it has to be, and will the city pull out or at a certain time or how does that work? I mean? Is that just something that the trust has decided that they need to do or just don't know the structure of that it was written into the deed as part of the negotiation between the federal government and the state and the city when the island was transferred for a dollar to New York, so it is written into the deed which I think we've shared with the community board. But if helpful, I'm happy to pull that language. I didn't realize that so the deed states that the trust has to be self-sustaining, not that the city would have to have paid for it, but that the trust would be responsible for the that's right. Okay, I didn't read that. Okay, thanks very much okay, I see, Michael Kramer has this hand raised. I'm wondering whether, in your planning, you've considered whether the island could be used to defend lower Manhattan, to take some of the water, the effects of a storm away from lower Manhattan in your planning, and then, alternatively, if not, will some of the measures that you put into place? Direct more water to lower Manhattan I know that the park was really designed. The way the park was designed was meant to really be a model for how natural landscapes can serve as mitigation efforts. I, don't believe. Your second question is accurate, but I can get back to you. Okay, just because water travels in every direction and it could be unintended consequences, certainly how green everything is and how many plants and the hills and everything I it's got to help a lot. It's got to collect a ton of water compared to the way it used to be it does it definitely was an improvement. You know the again I encouraged folks to look at the presentation, materially provided previously and some of the elements of the master plan, but it is very thoughtful and fascinating to look at how West State really thought through the planting strategy. You know combining a mix of native and negative and native adaptive plantings within the park. The way some of the fields are meant to absorb the water, the elevation of topography. It really was quite thoughtful and I believe we've shared this before, but the initial landfill was to elevate. The topography of the park during the construction was almost completed right before Sandy and when Sandy happened, all the construction equipment was moved to the newly created high ground and that we were able to restart construction in two days, because that newly created ground didn't really get any flooding, which is pretty amazing, so it has been tested, but I think you know it's. It was a very thoughtful plan and I encourage folks to read about it. Are there any other questions or comments to be addressed tonight? Anybody Diana, do you have anything or any other attendees I? Don't at this time and let's see I, don't see any other hands all right, well, 9:13. I think that'll. Do it well. Those are three highly impactful proposals on the community for our community and frankly for the city of New York. So I'm really glad that we had some more time on this and happy that we'll have even more so again a reminder that the resolution on this on the zoning for governors Island will happen next week at the land use meeting. So I'm hopeful everyone can attend that and in the meantime please send all your comments and thoughts that you'd like to have included or addressed or answered to Diana at the board, and thank you all very much for hanging in there as always, really appreciate it and I wish you all a good night. Thank you and thanks Sarah. Thank you very much.
