Okay, Thank you and we they helped like pretty much wrote the resolution that is in front of you today, as you remember everyone they were with us last month and we are doing I wanted to share with you.
Additional classroom space that you see them ask for at this resolution between meetings, we've also been working on the solution, and we have connected with a marine engineer who pretty much knows every of the New York City shoreline.
While that is one of the asks of this resolution that the primary goal of the resolution to talk to instance, the permanent solution, we have an opportunity in this month or so to make an impact with the other things that are coming in front of the governor's, island, trust and the city of New York, to make sure that we have a seat at the table.
What's going to happen with certain buildings on the island, and so on this resolution we have identified the buildings that the harbor School feels as though the best fit for them, For this purpose, they've received feedback from the SCA that this is logical, No ask, but there's been some handing back and forth between the governor's island trust and the SCA on.
We know this because we've been here a hundred times before with our schools, and so our goal for this is to get everybody to focus.
At the same time, We have the SCA saying that they're committed, and we have the governor's island trust on a recent call with the city council saying they too are prioritized.
I, don't know whether this would come over their purpose to really question, because we're going after the typical channels, which right now are the SCA and the nca you know has said to the harbor school that they have to do something that they can't justify a pool straight out for the school given what's happening, Covid-19 and the city budget, so that good faith is just a lot of money.
Read the resolution, so Nan. Okay, great, whereas the New York Harbor School's, core mission, has not been fully fulfilled in the last 17 years as a result of not having proper facilities, whereas the harbor school is overcrowded and sees her in high demand as the only maritime marine School in New York City, with a growth area in jobs that need the diversity harbor students represent proudly and well.
The harbor School has been asking for an aquatic training center as a central need in a program that involves daily teaching on the water and in votes, whereas the Harvard School was promised a gym in 12 additional classrooms and that ask was funded by the DOE SCA in 2018.
Therefore, Given the delays and lack of delivery of additional academic, places, gym auditorium or a pool committee recommends, the New York harvest will be awarded by Tgi Building 515, the former hospital or another existing building of adequate space as a part of its campus to enable the facilities needed for it to fulfill its mission and that build out funded by the SCA DOE.
The committee recommends that effective immediately the trust for governors name a temporary space for a pool facility to be used by the New York Harbor School that can be occupied for up to seven years until the permanent building becomes available.
Your space hear what they have to say about the other space, but, okay, You know you've done a lot of work on the island.
Anybody else, any ideas, thoughts, questions, concerns, I echo, you Trisha, that I think it timing-wise.
But, even though, If we don't get this, the e, if we don't get at the same time as the firemen, we'll at least get or the hospital workers, will at least be getting, you know those teachers will be getting something: absolutely okay great.
, so you can expect the, whereas and therefore it resolves to look like just defining the importance of you know getting our kids back to school.
