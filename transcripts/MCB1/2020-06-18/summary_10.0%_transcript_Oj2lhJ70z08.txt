And so I'm Pat Moore, chair of the quality of life and Tonight, we have some young people who live in our community with everything that's going on in a country and the world I think we should just leave it open and everybody to just participate and say what they have to say.
If you will, is combined, meaning that there is one sewer pipe right which carries the sewage from the from all the properties, whether it's businesses or residential units, and it also carries the stormwater runoff rainwater to one of our 14 wastewater treatment facilities that we have in New, York, City.
I know you have other agenda items, You know, there's obviously committee members, just a couple of simple things that I think are very helpful, especially and what we are all going through.
You know bovid and this everything that happening right, now, okay, in terms of recreational use or talking about summer being upon us You can't go in the water, yet in New, York, City But, so we're still, you know being near the water.
Thank you and if I could just finish by saying that you're referring to wastewater, not waterways, where we've had conversations with Manhattan borough president's office, where we are gearing up to test for the kovat in our wastewater and that would be able to help us to track and trace, but in terms of the waterways that is not I, believe what you are referring.
We know what areas are have or can be, are likely to be in danger of kovat, or we can tell the a trace the high volumes of cases of kovat If it's in the waste water and it goes to the treatment plan in the treatment plant.
That's, something we're gonna have to work with the University If that's something that I can discuss now or something possible, again, the agreement or the or where we're trying to go to in terms of this new process is just basically to trace.
We are working with several universities, including NYU, Stanford University, and we're trying to come up with a testing technology here that is best suited for this type of virus, and we want to analyze the data and assess it and to use that data to help us with these health issues in the future.
Waterways might actually be open this year, or should we be looking to 2021 before we you know, can expect that the coh would say there might be open like do you guys have an inclination as to whether or not that time may come this summer, right?
Look at this on the specifics of the waste water question in Copa, 19, pretty fascinating, stuff, Any impact on our sea be Is. What is the impact on our sewage treatment facility or access, or because I mean every now, You know talk for too long, but one thing I'll say is that we have a funding plan that we have in a yearly basis and a 10 year, Capital plan, where we always invest in installing new water mains and new sewer, mains.
That's what it's been determined to do, but with regard to not only the committee but globally and this issue I think we have to be very careful and walk the line of what proper terms are, as deemed by the government what words they're using and the black community Very careful about trying to protect the feelings of either people sometimes are guilty.
We are two white girls raised in Battery Park City, lower Manhattan, New, York Our parents are Italian and Irish and have been political activists in this community for years.
Far too many families like mine, Beverly Allen, our other mother I, do make an American, wife and mother of three who built her life for her kids in Brooklyn, New York in part by commuting to this neighborhood to work a job taking care of my sister and I, our parents and our grandparents.
We watched as protests against structural racism, white supremacy, violence on black lives, especially by the police, pick up after years of black organizers, protesting for the same thing, equality and justice and end to police violence that has killed two disparate disproportionate number of black people in this country.
Basically, the answer seems pretty obvious to me- is something we want to talk about tonight, but it feels like it's white people's lives that are being protected at the expense of black people's, and this is relevant to this community board because it happened right here in our community.
Ask that this committee and this board lead us in making structural changes against white power structures and that we use our influence to continue this conversation.
That, finally, everyone will understand exactly what's happening in the black communities around this country with regards to policing and over policing and militarized policing I after Ferguson, it's hard to hold your breath, it's hard to hold your breath when you know a 12 year old kid gets gunned down with a toy gun and the city that you grew up.
Forward, I, think, to a large extent, white power structure, waits for us as black people, especially to quiet, down, settle down to get it out of our system in terms of unrest in terms of online protests.
Its support for the police reforms put forth by you know the city of the state and the federal government, those that have already passed and those that have not yet asked, and then another one.
You know this community board slightly by providing space, whether it be a working group or a whole committee.
We talk, LGBTQ issues, we talked about gender class, a it give me a space to continue this long overdue conversation and then also a place where this committee can continue to talk about the reforms that we are seeing passed in our state and our city I'm, really glad that they passed its thanks to all the organizers and our elected officials.
The other side of that is in terms of policing over a period of time, and in that whole scenario, policing has been used as a force to control, whoever you know, So here we are, and police have been given the right away for many years, and the establishment has looked the other way and we are where we are So. I think that education, starting from the root of the roots of American history, would be a very good thing.
I think you might want to consider maybe just narrowing the focus to New York City black people who have been killed and look at like Abner, Louima, Eric garner.
My point is to keep it local, And, I'm, sure you're, Probably you might get a better response, not to say that I think all the names should be listed, but that's happening in other parts of New, York, City and then coordinating with the first precinct would be a good idea in terms of the protesting issues that you want to you know and that you want to have happen in this.
But you know one step at a time that maybe there's a way we can organize meeting with Manhattan community boards and any you know, and the public to continue the conversation.
And I mean I couldn't agree more, but even though it's in Brooklyn, but not in Manhattan, the last fort in the city, Fort Hamilton, the government denied the like The city councils are some people of our year.
Those seats are located in and have a conversation with them: Fort Hamilton, our military base in Brooklyn Do I just want to thank both Katie and Taylor for the great presentation and the hard work that went into doing this I also would recognize their cousin Claire, who was behind the scenes and a lot of the stuff that they've been doing Sorry, who don't know clearly.
It's personal to us here in Battery, Park City, because that's where we live I think it was you Pat about making this to the other community boards and bringing it larger, because the conversation has to start and the Jen sees and the Millennials need to step up and take over the reins and a lot of them are doing it and a lot of them aren't And I want to see their friends and their colleagues and their classmates and their whatever getting more involved, because it's not gonna change unless everybody gets involved, and that means voting.
If I couldn't do, if I could just say for me, I just want people I'm not advocating tearing these things that on what they shouldn't, be glorified And you see these like melted bicycles and little kids of you know.
It was important to this committee and to the board that you have an opportunity to speak, but I just want you to know how important it was to me as an individual that we hear not only from you specifically, although that was super important to me, but that we hear from young people You know some of you may be into astrology approaching the Age of Aquarius.
This is gonna, be your community, Your world Congratulate you for your bravery, and in doing this, you know, and for your sensitivity and compassion, and even recognizing that there was a problem, because some people could have seen the exact same thing that you saw and not been moved.
So black people were murdered to create that Park and displaced evicted to make to make that Park So I think you know you extending out of our neighborhood up there.
So anyway reading something when you hear me: yes, I want people, because many people don't know that a lot of those thanked the Jim Crow South because of the they were afraid of losing power after the you're right.
And I know that for most people, what comes to mind when you think when you hear the word white supremacy is like the KKK and like more violent individuals, but also that what that it is a person who genuinely believes that white people are superior and I just want to echo.
When there were white areas where people lived is brought home even if they wanted to sell their home to a black person.
We are going to be working in conjunction with other community boards, so it has more impact I want to just to let you know that, for all that would be interested in attending.
You need to give these kids the information so that they can say I had no idea that that's helped my black classmates And I didn't know about the islands and the culture and the slavery that happened in other places where people came from You for doing anything to correct the education, because I think when we educate our young people, we move even further Maruyama.
If you would have me the especially like you know, moving on, but with that sort of topic and the larger issues and educating people as to what's really going on We want to approach borrow board so that we could end and approach our president and see if we could organize a town hold together, a convention of some sort for Manhattan, where we can talk and possibly put forth a resolution that comes from our entire borough.
Those four points: how about if we just like, if everybody agrees that we just support that you know the points that they think we're done, I would second what Mitch said.
So, speaking of black people, men, whatever how you want to classify it, who've been murdered in this city, right.
As the law says that they're supposed to, then they shouldn't be there that long, but there is a potential for it to happen, and it has happened right here in New, York City on Rikers Island You want to just leave the word protesters to the rest of the committee.
Because I think you ones you'll keep the momentum going by every month revisiting the subject, instead of you know, kind of getting it all out and then not having anything else to talk about here, but also there's some other committees that you might want to work with on this Ladies, had such nice things like to include everything they did in one lump sum for like for the work that they put in I just thought it might be a nice thing.
Yes, I'm a hand up before, because I just wanted to ask how we could start a working group that maybe could turn into a committee to continue this conversation or would that happen in this committee?
Number three I think tomorrow night we have the executive committee meeting And I definitely am going to introduce your topic tomorrow at the executive committee meeting, and you might want to be there to say a few words and possibly ask that question there right, now.
All right, The names is that what you just said, Lucien, have a question: before, on gender number, five has state of policing in New, York, City, discussion and possible resolution.
If you'd like to all night, you have the executive committee meeting and You might just want to tune in, and you know.
I. Just want to point out that Cora is noting in the chat that there are several agencies who are involved in permitting the outdoor dining applications and community boards are not included on that list.
So I, don't know if they got permission or not, but on Gold Street today, I saw several tables having been built where the licensing and permits committee had said they could not be that we were not allowing a sidewalk cafe for that restaurant.
If we can include the word temporary and whatever resolution, we do that You know to set up the temporary outdoor dining program It bypasses the community boards All of us just wanting to be able to circle back after all of this is done and be able to actually permit or not whoever in the restaurants wanting a sidewalk cafe.
Try to ask how about places that are restricted, like don't even think about it, which you know do you have already have those information?
Then we don't have to waste time, trying to think that maybe City Hall Park can work.
They came to us transportation because they wanted to know the community boards input.
One issue that always comes up is when you have outdoor cafes, it's limiting the hours and because there are actually residents that live above it You know, we don't want noise all hours of the night so that they can enjoy their home So I.
The licensing committee painstakingly negotiates hours for sidewalk cafes every time if they were to as a rule roll out hours that are much more permissive than then You know they've, essentially taken all the work, the community board, throwing it out.
We say the hours should resemble that all their neighbors have sidewalk cafe, wise, because the community board one's very deliberate in the hours that they allow green You know I, think that people are open to maybe a little bit of leeway for their business, neighbors and so like.
But if it has to be clear that it's a temporary thing that you know that made you just be my personal feeling, but I think that people would be more open to relaxing some of the rules as the governance, as the government has been.
You know you are the committee members We may want to okay.
