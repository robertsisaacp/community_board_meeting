The police would not necessarily get all of the money, all the funding that they get, because maybe we don't need a police officer to respond to every call, and so everyone's been watching the news every once in watching TV I'm, going to turn over the discussion right now to two young people who brought it to our committee and I got a few calls about the title of this agenda, which is addressing systemic racism and white supremacy and Battery Park City, and a request was made that we changed.
This white supremacy, because that sounds like it's a neo-nazi group and so maybe just addressing systemic racism and Thank- you that thank you for that sorry, we're gonna be presenting on just generally what's been happening, our personal take on it and what we're trying to do and get others to do to help in this whole movement and process Why, don't you start by telling everyone who you are and where you live and how you approach the community board to bring this topic to our community Katie Everyone on this committee for all the work you do Since.
I'm, with Department of Environmental, Protection, public affairs, I'll just say a couple things briefly: DPS job is to mitigate the combined sewer overflows, basically, according to the consent agreement that we have with the state, which is the Environmental Conservation short for Dec, basically about 60% or most of our sewer waste water, Rainwater collection system, if you will, is combined, meaning that there is one sewer pipe right which carries the sewage from the from all the properties, whether it's businesses or residential units, and it also carries the stormwater runoff rainwater to one of our 14 wastewater treatment facilities that we have in New, York, Some areas you have two pipes, which is the more ideal situation, which means that you have two pipes on the street.
We have some sewage waste, water and rainfall that goes to our Newtown Creek, which is located in Brooklyn, and then some under more west side They go to our North River plant, which is on the upper Upper West Side in Manhattan Now. These the Newtown Creek is a much bigger, newer plant, which can basically have a higher capacity than most so basically you're in a good area here in terms of drainage and treatment of the waste water But, like I, said before we continue operations in terms of installing new sewer mains, making sure that we review operations in the in the wastewater treatment plans, in addition to long-term control plans that we have agreed to with the state, as I mentioned before, those could be either as we call grey infrastructure or green infrastructure, gray, infrastructure, meaning more pipes, more filtration plants and whereas the green infrastructure meaning more green rain gardens as we like to call it where, as we plant more trees and more plants and more green catch basins, if you will, instead of catch basins that you see in the street corners, basically just as a sponge to absorb the rainwater as it is raining, the basic idea of that is to contain the rainwater, as is raining So, these sewers, the sewer city, the city sewer on the street, does not go over its design capacity.
You know there's obviously committee members just a couple of simple things that I think are very helpful, especially and what we are all going through right now, but I'll start with one We have a program which is called weight which we've been working in Queens and Brooklyn, but it's very important that you, which any one of us can use Oh, wait to turn on the dishwasher or wait to do to wash clothes and etc, because those are appliances and uses of high volume of water which ultimately goes into the city sewer and, as I stated before, can cause flow over capacity issues.
Or you know you know potato chip bags or gloves and in that kind of situation, like I said before, we follow state guidelines to make sure that the waterways are safe and clean, but they are some classifications, Another fact here that the state designates so, for example, my thinking community board one here where you are We, basically have a water quality area here in our Inner Harbor, which is called via which we test the excuse me Hudson River and upper New, York Bay and this area is classified as fishing and boating Lastly Sorry I do ramble, but I opened myself up to questions, but, lastly, in terms of swimming and beach season, I did include that in the email that I sent to Lucian, basically the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene also does their own testing of the waterways of beaches.
I can't see the list of people who may want to ask questions because I'm still out I'm on my phone large population of 911 survivors people dealing with different health conditions that resulting from 911, and that was one of the reasons that I wanted to make sure that we went over this topic Even, you know bovid and this everything that happening right now, okay, in terms of recreational use or talking about summer being upon us What, we're tasked to do is make sure that the waterways around the city, New York City, are up to the standards of the state.
It's, excuse me in our sewage and our waste and that's something that we can use So, then that can help us to test and trace We know what areas are have or can be are likely to be in danger of kovat, or we can tell the a trace the high volumes of cases of kovat if it's in the waste water We do a treatment of the waste water where there's chlorination and basically there's several steps of our treatment in our wastewater treatment facilities that we are mandated as the city and state to do in order to treat the wastewater before and rainfall before it is released into the waterways.
Department of Health would issue an advisory to the public and you would be aware of it of any of those situations, but just to let you know, I Think of me: I've been in a lot of meetings, even with Parks Department, where you know, Obviously funding is an issue, but they do want to open up pools and again so I think conversation here, We will certainly follow up in the Environmental Protection Committee and jointly.
We would be protesting on the streets right now, if not for Kovac 19 and our at-risk family members We are turning to other forms of active activism right now and trying to talk about something, that's long overdue police violence and structural racism that are so embedded in this city, That intro may feel complete or look complete to many people, but actually it's far from it, leaves out many people and structures that bring us here today.
Basically, the answer seems pretty obvious to me- is something we want to talk about tonight, but it feels like it's white people's lives that are being protected at the expense of black people's, and this is relevant to this community board because it happened right here in our community In. This example on power structures, and this is an example of power structures at play- We come to ask this committee to be transparent about this racism, What I, guess we have labeled white supremacy and we're using the label of black organizers as white supremacy as it plays out in cb1?, and we say that we are not okay with police violence against black Americans here or anywhere We. Ask that this committee and this board lead us in making structural changes against white power structures and that we use our influence to continue this conversation My sister and I have been hearing a lot from our white family and friends.
How this conversation is going, you know, what can we do as like people to make a difference right, but so many answers have actually been given to us by people of color they've been in many ways, and this is something that I wanted to consolidate for us For. Those of us saying you want to spread love in this time.
I'll be writing my column, and that moment will happen, but whether or not it will result in any concrete change is really up to people who may be least involved with the trauma People who are not affected by this do something I feel like it directly applies to us here, especially about your Park City residents in lower Manhattan, especially the white, the white residents here, there's four of them and would love to talk about them more right now, so the first one We would like to see a resolution put forth.
That also stands on the record, supporting black lives matter and States Its support for the police reforms put forth by you know the city of the state and the federal government, those that have already passed and those that have not yet asked and then another one We would like to request the immediate release of protesters and nonviolent arrests from jails and sentencers, and our and our cb1 community I think I could think of at least three jails and then that we asked precinct one to welcome protesters here in our in cd1 and that we say that we won't accept any more police violence against these protesters, like we saw on June, 2nd and all throughout the protesting In. This in lower Manhattan we've seen violence done by the police on protesters and request that there be no more arrests of these protesters just for protesting the third proposal So this one is our way of our idea for continuing this conversation to structurally change.
What some of the programs that I listen to on how black people deal with white aggression and race relations and things that have been happening are, is the fact that America is American Why. We are where we are because it's from the very beginning, there's been a systematic progression of white supremacy, taking control over all non-whites What happened was they took real American history and civics out of the education prize, I mean black people as well, who are ignorant of the real American history The other side of that is in terms of policing over a period of time, and in that whole scenario, policing has been used as a force to control, whoever you know, and so here we are, and police have been given the right away for many years and the establishment has looked the other way and we are where we are so I think that education, starting from the root of the roots of American history, would be a very good thing.
I think you might want to consider maybe just narrowing the focus to New York City black people who have been killed and look at like Abner, Louima Eric, garner My point is to keep it local and I'm sure you're, probably you might get a better response, not to say that I think all the names should be listed, but that's happening in other parts of New, York, City and then coordinating with the first precinct would be a good idea in terms of the protesting issues that you want to you know and that you want to have happen in this area.
I think that if you reached out to them and say we have this idea, you know in terms of the protesters down here this and that any other whatever so I think you guys are great for starting the conversation, and you have a lot of wonderful idea and I am happy that you will keep hope alive and that something will happen in terms of the beginnings of talking about race relations in the United States, the well, a community board gwon the United States, and it is just not here.
The conversation work to try to continue it and I would love to continue the conversation Thank you in having this conversation, and so there may be a way that we can organize, and maybe we show the borough president and see if we can organize a Manhattan I mean it's happening all over the city, but you know one step at a time that maybe there's a way we can organize meeting with Manhattan community boards and any you know, and the public to continue the conversation and I mean I couldn't agree more, but even though it's in Brooklyn, but not in Manhattan, the last fort in the city, Fort Hamilton, the government denied the like.
The city councils are some people of our year too This Stonewall, Jackson, Drive and generally Street in Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, and the government refused to change the names like as recently as one or two years ago, So, even though it's not since we're talking about world issues, not just community board.
It's personal to us here in Battery, Park City, because that's where we live I think it was you Pat about making this to the other community boards and bringing it larger, because the conversation has to start and the Jen sees and the Millennials need to step up and take over the reins and a lot of them are doing it and a lot of them aren't and I want to see their friends and their colleagues and their classmates and their whatever getting more involved, because it's not gonna change unless everybody gets involved, and that means voting.
He refused to prosecute any protesters, so we applaud him for that The governor, also in support of that which made me very happy, but then just to segue over to your discussion about the monument to me wanting to make a memorial to Mitch's point I'm thinking, things like you know, like I, am Wall Street I served as the first slave auction.
I really tried, but these meetings they never go on agenda when I hop in late I was actually wait, but I want to say to Marianas point Thank you for the education comment, Please I'm sitting here listening to Tricia, which I appreciate all the work she does and the fact that the girls and women brought this up because I'm a firm advocate for civics and history being taught and it has to be adapted In. My opinion of the public school education is based on social justice, but they don't give the students context so the over political correctness and excuse the term I, don't mean to offend that I think happened.
Those four points how about if we just like, if everybody agrees that we just support that you know the points that they think we're done, I would second what Mitch said So we need to sweetie to speak from this committee to bring it to the full board and especially that the least less controversial parts and what I'm looking at is controversial might be the memorial and Battery Park City everything that they said and at the memorial Don't want a green nation.
, There's a number of items here that are very time-sensitive such as these perform and legislation executive orders, as well as the budget conversation that's going on that will fundamentally could the could or has the potential to fundamentally change NYPD, depending on what compromise is drawn out between the mayor and city council Those are things that you definitely I would recommend putting forth resolution this month, a resolution to stand with the protesters like I've matter, to advocate for the humane treatment of protesters, people who were expressing their freedom of speech.
This is actually the black Latino and Asian or BL a caucus of the City Council, which consists of 26 of the 51 total members of the City Council The chairs of that committee You know some advice from other people on how we might proceed and again, I still think It's very important to include other community boards.
Yeah, yes raises your yes and the other vote it down to public members, job good time;, yes, Einstein, freaky Church by the way, there's one thing, and that is not a resolution, but just to get your comments together for tomorrow's meeting on the open, dining on the sidewalk they've already started by me, like one of the items that came before licensing impairments that we actually denied at 77, Fulton Street, four test: a wall street they've started I Guess under this new opportunity to build yes to build tables, go outside, jumping the gun on gold, Street But it's an exact location that they brought before licensing and permits that we denied they were supposed to go back and speak to John Prada, because he was one of the people who was supporting it kind of work.
So I, don't know if they got permission or not, but on Gold Street today I saw several tables having been built where the licensing and permits committee had said they could not be that we were not allowing a sidewalk cafe for that restaurant, so I think we should take that just use the number Are these restaurants going to be treated as outdoor cafes?
It has to kind of act at like public seating, that's agnostic to the restaurant, but it can be essentially a you know, adjacent to the restaurant on the street, so that could be another, so converting the curb Lane in some way to additional dining space and an Lucien, oh, my god, Gold Street, kerb, Betty and Cora have shared comments in the chat and with regard to this that just to point it out to everybody, I see So. If we can include the word temporary and whatever resolution, we do that You know to set up the temporary outdoor dining program and it bypasses the community boards All of us just wanting to be able to circle back after all of this is done and be able to actually permit or not whoever in the restaurants wanting a sidewalk cafe.
So I think that there no matter what resolution from cv1 will be worthwhile just give us some guidelines , I understand what how we can impact the process I, don't why we identifying Street we're talking about us just from a quality of life You know Frances said the community board should be including the approval and an oversight.
An outdoor world question Why well taken to that point , I think what people are having a lot of trouble with Is these fireworks, though we didn't, you know, come under any committee, but it's four thousand five illegal fireworks sales are up four thousand percent.
