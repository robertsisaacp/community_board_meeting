And so I'm Pat Moore, chair of the quality of life and Tonight, we have some young people who live in our community with everything that's going on in a country and the world I think we should just leave it open and everybody to just participate and say what they have to say.
I'm, going to turn over the discussion right now to two young people who brought it to our committee.
And I got a few calls about the title of this agenda, which is addressing systemic racism and white supremacy and Battery Park City, and a request was made that we changed this white supremacy, because that sounds like it's a neo- nazi group And, so maybe just addressing systemic racism and Sorry , we're going to be presenting on just generally what's been happening, our personal take on it and what we're trying to do and get others to do to help in this whole movement and process.
My concern in having received some information through other committees with related to our 911 health, was that we there are some concerns with sewer overruns, and you know our Beach water, our swimming water, our rivers and just you know inviting Umberto to help us to understand what that's about I, appreciate that and thank you all Lucian, the committee, all members.
We continue operations in terms of installing new sewer mains, making sure that we review operations in the in the wastewater treatment, plans, In addition to long- term control plans that we have agreed to with the state, As I mentioned before.
I know you have other agenda items, You, know, there's, obviously committee members, just a couple of simple things that I think are very helpful, especially and what we are all going through.
You know bovid and this everything that happening right, now, okay, in terms of recreational use or talking about summer being upon us You can't go in the water, yet in New, York, City But, so we're still, you know being near the water.
We know what areas are have or can be, are likely to be in danger of Covid-19, or we can tell the a trace the high volumes of cases of Covid-19 If it's in the waste water and it goes to the treatment plan in the treatment plant.
That's, something we're going to have to work with the University If that's something that I can discuss now or something possible, again, the agreement or the or where we're trying to go to in terms of this new process is just basically to trace it.
We can try to go to those neighborhoods those areas and have the city obviously respond to those needs and issues I just wanted to.
That's that we're all dealing with now A lot of questions that I can answer to you by you know having our either scientists or engineers or other city agencies.
We are working with several universities, including NYU Stanford University, and we're trying to come up with a testing technology here that is best suited for this type of virus, and we want to analyze the data and assess it and to use that data to help us with these health issues in the future.
Waterways might actually be open this year, or should we be looking to 2021 before we you know, can expect that the Coh would say there might be open like do you guys have an inclination as to whether or not that time may come this summer, right?
You know talk for too long, but one thing I'll say is that we have a funding plan that we have in a yearly basis and a 10 year, Capital plan, where we always invest in installing new water mains and new sewer, mains.
So a lot of not all of them, but most of them deal with the renewal of the utilities like electric gas, steam, and, more importantly, water and sewer, okay Sorry I do not want to be late sure, but it's a labor.
To answer your question, two things during a heavy rain storm you have to allow I know: You are not trying to cross the street, but please allow the rainfall will take some time in certain areas.
That's what it's been determined to do, but with regard to not only the committee but globally and this issue I think we have to be very careful and walk the line of what proper terms are, as deemed by the government, what words they're using and the black community Very careful about trying to protect the feelings of either people sometimes are guilty.
We are two white girls raised in Battery Park City, lower Manhattan, New, York Our parents are Italian and Irish and have been political activists in this community for years.
Far too many families like mine, Beverly Allen, our other mother I, do make an American, wife and mother of three who built her life for her kids in Brooklyn, New York in part by commuting to this neighborhood to work a job taking care of my sister and I, our parents and our grandparents.
We watched as protests against structural racism, White supremacy violence on black lives, especially by the police, pick up after years of black organizers, protesting for the same thing, equality and justice and end to police violence that has killed two disparate disproportionate number of black people in this country.
Basically, the answer seems pretty obvious to me- is something we want to talk about tonight, but it feels like it's white people's lives that are being protected at the expense of black people's, and this is relevant to this community board because it happened right here in our community in this example on power structures- And this is an example of power structures at play, and there are so many other examples.
Ask that this committee and this board lead us in making structural changes against white power structures and that we use our influence to continue this conversation.
That, finally, everyone will understand exactly what's happening in the black communities around this country with regards to policing and over policing and militarized policing I after Ferguson, it's hard to hold your breath, it's hard to hold your breath when you know a 12 year old kid gets gunned down with a toy gun and the city that you grew up.
Forward, I, think, to a large extent, white power structure, waits for us as black people, especially to quiet, down, settle down to get it out of our system in terms of unrest in terms of online protests.
Its support for the police reforms put forth by you know the city of the state and the federal government, those that have already passed and those that have not yet asked, and then another one.
You know this community board slightly by providing space, whether it be a working group or a whole committee.
Can we work on them and I would love a space where this community can continue talking about that and continue proposing changes to make those effective and I do not I know that and precinct one can have meetings with this committee specifically, but I would love to have a space where we can really have hard conversations with our officers and with our detention, centers and happy vocal about how we can see those spaces be safer and a Town Hall.
I think we are in duper one very soon and the fourth one is request that we provide a space for a memorial in Battery Park City, with names of unarmed black Americans killed by the police.
The other side of that is in terms of policing over a period of time, and in that whole scenario, policing has been used as a force to control, whoever you know, So here we are, and police have been given the right away for many years, and the establishment has looked the other way and we are where we are So. I think that education, starting from the root of the roots of American history, would be a very good thing.
I think you might want to consider maybe just narrowing the focus to New York City black people who have been killed and look at like Abner, Louima, Eric garner.
My point is to keep it local That's happening in other parts of New, York, City and then coordinating with the first precinct would be a good idea in terms of the protesting issues that you want to you know and that you want to have happen in this.
But you know one step at a time that maybe there's a way we can organize meeting with Manhattan community boards and any you know, and the public to continue the conversation.
And I mean I could not agree more, but even though it's in Brooklyn, but not in Manhattan, the last fort in the city, Fort Hamilton, the government denied the like The city councils are some people of our year.
If that's the case, I support those as a favor framework and because I just want to say to that conversation, it's personal to us here in Battery, Park City, because that's where we live I , think it was you Pat about making this to the other community boards and bringing it larger, because the conversation has to start and the Jen sees and the Millennials need to step up and take over the reins and a lot of them are doing it and a lot of them are not Everything.
It was important to this committee and to the board that you have an opportunity to speak, but I just want you to know how important it was to me as an individual that we hear not only from you specifically, although that was super important to me, but that we hear from young people.
This is a 911 affected community And we're losing a lot of our historians on a personal level, Right the people who knew these stories and who had this information, and that means that we have no choice but to hand the baton to the Millennials to Dinsey.
This is going to be your community, your world, so who better to hear from then You Congratulate you for your bravery, and in doing this, you know, and for your sensitivity and compassion, and even recognizing that there was a problem, because some people could have seen the exact same thing that you saw and not been moved.
So black people were murdered to create that Park and Displaced evicted to make to make that Park So I think you know you extending out of our neighborhood up there.
So anyway reading something when you hear me: yes, I want people, because many people do not know that a lot of those thanked the Jim Crow South because of the they were afraid of losing power after the you're right.
And I know that for most people, what comes to mind when you think when you hear the word white supremacy is like the KKK and like more violent individuals, but also that what that it is a person who genuinely believes that white people are superior and I just want to echo.
When there were white areas where people lived is brought home even if they wanted to sell their home to a black person.
My black classmates And I did not know about the islands and the culture and the slavery that happened in other places where people came from To me, as an American citizen, that my kids were not taught about the Civil War, but I come from the generation.
You know if you would have me the especially moving on, but with that sort of topic and the larger issues and educating people as to what's really going on We want to approach borrow board so that we could end and approach our president and see if we could organize a town hold together, a convention of some sort for Manhattan, where we can talk and possibly put forth a resolution that comes from our entire borough.
Those four points: how about if we just like, if everybody agrees that we just support that you know the points that they think we're done, I would second what Mitch said.
We need to sweetie to speak from this committee to bring it to the full board and especially that the least less controversial parts and what I'm looking at is controversial, might be the memorial and Battery Park City everything that they said and at the memorial I just do not want a green nation.
You know the word just Edward peaceful before the word protest is I mean that I would say, I agree with you and even then I like the idea, rail I just would hold off on where we said to place.
So speaking of black people, men, whatever how you want to classify it, who've been murdered in this city.
If people are going, people are going to be processed dually as they're supposed to right, as the law says that they're supposed to then they should not be there that long, but there is a potential for it to happen, and it has happened right here in New, York City on Rikers Island You want to just leave the word protesters to the rest of the committee.
Let's have some want some other people chime in What y' all say do like do a quick vote Would like to know so what we're saying or what we're proposing is that we take presentation, Taylor and Katie and Claire put together, and we just turn it into a resolution.
We include that in this reso, or is that a separate asks that we send out a letter and Possibly again, I think that we need to use our boroughs president, who is extremely helpful in many cases and Also we may want to talk to I.
Because I think you ones you'll keep the momentum going by every month revisiting the subject, instead of you know, kind of getting it all out and then not having anything else to talk about here, but also there's some other committees that you might want to work with on this Ladies had such nice, things like to include everything they did in one lump sum for like for the work that they put in I just thought it might be a nice thing.
Yes, I'm a hand up before, because I just wanted to ask how we could start a working group that maybe could turn into a committee to continue this conversation or would that happen in this committee?
All right, The names is that what you just said, Lucien, have a question: before, on gender number, five has state of policing in New, York, City, discussion and possible resolution.
If you'd like to all night, you have the executive committee meeting and You might just want to tune in, and you know.
It certainly should not be used on a civilian population of peaceful protesters, 100 percent, sure, okay, 100, yes, I mean the point resolution I know you said: you'll work with Lucien about it.
So I do not know if they got permission or not, but on Gold Street today, I saw several tables having been built where the licensing and permits Committee had said they could not be that we were not allowing a sidewalk cafe for that restaurant.
If we can include the word temporary and whatever resolution, we do that You know to set up the temporary outdoor dining program And, it bypasses the community boards All of us just wanting to be able to circle back after all of this is done and be able to actually permit or not whoever in the restaurants wanting a sidewalk cafe.
Try to ask how about places that are restricted like do not even think about it, which you know do you have already have those information?
Then we do not have to waste time, trying to think that maybe City Hall Park can work.
Think that we are hearing is that simply the community boards are not going to be involved in this process.
They came to us transportation because they wanted to know the community boards input.
The, Southbridge, towers, Board president to see what else he could work out with them, and You know they could have come back, but what their application has put forth to us right before Kovac.
One issue that always comes up is when you have outdoor cafes, it's limiting the hours and because there are actually residents that live above it You know we do not want noise all hours of the night so that they can enjoy their home That's reason why he was denied Most important point would be that it should be.
The licensing committee painstakingly negotiates hours for sidewalk cafes every time if they were to as a rule roll out hours that are much more permissive than then You know they've, essentially taken all the work, the community board, throwing it out.
We say the hours should resemble that all their neighbors have sidewalk cafe, wise, because the community board one's very deliberate in the hours that they allow green You know I, think that people are open to maybe a little bit of leeway for their business, neighbors and so like.
But if it has to be clear that it's a temporary thing that you know that made you just be my personal feeling, but I think that people would be more open to relaxing some of the rules as the governance, as the government has been.
