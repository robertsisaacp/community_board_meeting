Good evening, everybody how are ya and so I'm Pat Moore, chair of the quality of life and there I am James, is on also she- go chair and we've got a couple of topics. Tonight we have some young people who live in our community with everything that's going on in a country and the world right now, we'd like to have a discussion about it might take many directions: I'm, not even sure what direction it will take. I think we should just leave it open and everybody to just participate and say what they have to say. But everyone knows that there's legislation that's pending to possibly send money, do the money that the police have to put it into other avenues and not necessarily the police. The police would not necessarily get all of the money, all the funding that they get, because maybe we do not need a police officer to respond to every call, and so everyone's been watching the news every once in watching TV. We know, what's going on I'm, going to turn over the discussion right now to two young people who brought it to our committee. Taylor and Katie are you on the line? Yes, I think you do Katie yeah, so Taylor has the presentation I'm waiting for her to pull that up and get that started. Sorry I just want to say Juana we're moving up to number one and I got a few calls about the title of this agenda, which is addressing systemic racism and white supremacy and Battery Park City, and a request was made that we changed this white supremacy, because that sounds like it's a neo- nazi group and so maybe just addressing systemic racism and what changes we might like to see take place and take out the terminology. White supremacy yeah. Thank you that thank you for that. Sorry, we're going to be presenting on just generally what's been happening, our personal take on it and what we're trying to do and get others to do to help in this whole movement and process. So thank you for that introduction. Why do not you start by telling everyone who you are and where you live and how you approach the community board to bring this topic to our community Katie I think. Is we never speak? So Taylor I think you need to speak up Katie. Are you together or separate they're in separate places and I saw her and now she's gone? First Taylor needs to be unmuted she's in the attendee list. I think you got. Maybe she fell off and then came back up so yeah there. You go hear me now: okay, sorry, there was something wrong with technically okay, you so much hello, I'm, really great cool. You guys gave us the opportunity to talk here and thank you. Everyone on this committee for all the work you do. You've made this place, a wonderful place to live so really. Thank you. Katie and I would like to share a little presentation. We've been putting together. There please bear with us we're a little nervous. Okay, how Lucian had overshare this? How do I share this? Do I master? There's a yeah. You have Presenter controls. Okay, what you do is you on the bottom of your screen. There's a number of circles. One of them has the square with the little arrow pointing up the topic. Yeah Exterior, camera click on that and then either share screen or share. Specifically, okay I'm going to have to it's going to make me close up the app and log by and I'm. So sorry, it won't I'll be right. Back, okay, I think that I believe. Well, we could we could have Taylor and Katie work out their technical difficulty and go to Umberto if he's on Mary Yama. Yes, that's fine, I mean I'm, that's okay! Mariana! Since you brought this topic to the committee, would you like to do not have any chair at this moment? I did bring the topic, admittedly I'm, not very well versed in it, which is why it was you know really wanting to have representation from DEP, so I think so greatly for coming. My concern in having received some information through other committees with related to our 911 health, was that we there are some concerns with sewer overruns, and you know our Beach water, our swimming water, our rivers and just you know inviting Umberto to help us to understand what that's about so I'm going to find an Bert, oh he's on the phone. Let me just see if I can find him I'm Bert! Oh, is this you? Yes, can you hear me perfect? Okay, oh so you can hear me right: okay, yeah, you're, welcome, I, appreciate that and thank you all Lucian, the committee, all members. Obviously thank you for your community service as well, so my name is Umberto Galarza I'm with Department of Environmental Protection public affairs. So thank you for this opportunity. Just very briefly, I provided Lucian with some links on combined sewer flows, information and beach season. Excuse me information, so just in case, if you want to go over it after our discussion, you can ask solution, I'm sure he can forward that to you all, but all that information can also be found on our DEP website. Very for the interest of time. I'll just say a couple things briefly: DPS job is to mitigate the combined sewer overflows, basically, according to the consent agreement that we have with the state, which is the Environmental Conservation short for Dec, basically about 60% or most of our sewer, Waste Water Rainwater collection system. If you will is combined, meaning that there is one sewer pipe right which carries the sewage from the from all the properties, whether it's businesses or residential units- and it also carries the stormwater runoff rainwater to one of our 14 wastewater treatment facilities that we have in New York City. In some areas, you have two pipes, which is the more ideal situation, which means that you have two pipes on the street. One carries the sewage like I, said from residential and businesses, and it takes that sewage to our wastewater treatment plant directly and then there's a second plant pipe, which we call a storm. A storm water pipe which would during rainfall, carry that water into the receiving bodies of water. Basically, back to the combined sewer outfall a short week, we call it CFOs during a heavy rainstorm. We receive higher than normal flows of rainwater. If you combine that with the sewage that we release from again from the residential units and the businesses, it's too much for the wastewater treatment plant to handle at one time in a short period of time. As you know, you know, as you've noticed with the weather forecast, that was the weather here in New York City. It's actually been more rainfall, but heavier and shorter, more frequent as when you pass. So you have that combination flows in a short period of time it actually it's it overflows the capacity of our wastewater treatment, meaning that it can't treat all that sewage that is receiving combined with the rainwater, therefore is, and we call it combined. Sewer outfalls is because we release some of that water into the receiving bodies of water and in situations when we have rainstorms those are times that we try to maximize our operations or our inspections to make sure that the city sewers are running properly. There's no clogs no sewer, you know clogs that can cause sewer backups into properties, but also to maintain a good flow into the wastewater treatment plant. As we know, we do not want this wastewater going on to the receiving bodies of water, because it can create a bad situation for recreational use and I'm sure. That's what you're referring to here. As you know, we have standards regulations from the state that mandate us to make sure that we improve the water quality in these waterways. Therefore, DP continues to improve the water quality. By improving our wastewater treatment plants, we are upgrade, we've either upgraded or continue to invest in upgrading our wastewater treatment plants, for example in Community Board one. We have some sewage waste, water and rainfall that goes to our Newtown Creek, which is located in Brooklyn and then some under more west side. They go to our North River plant, which is on the upper Upper West Side in Manhattan. Now these the Newtown Creek is a much bigger, newer plant which can basically have a higher capacity than most so basically you're in a good area here in terms of drainage and treatment of the waste water. But, like I, said before, we continue operations in terms of installing new sewer mains, making sure that we review operations in the in the wastewater treatment plans, in addition to long- term control plans that we have agreed to with the state, as I mentioned before, those could be either as we call grey infrastructure or green infrastructure, gray, infrastructure, meaning more pipes, more filtration plants and whereas the green infrastructure meaning more green rain gardens as we like to call it where, as we plant more trees and more plants and more green catch basins, if you will, instead of catch basins that you see in the street corners, basically just as a sponge to absorb the rainwater as it is raining, the basic idea of that is to contain the rainwater, as is raining. So you do not over. So these sewers, the sewer city, the city sewer on the street, does not go over its design capacity. So if you're holding on to water in certain areas is not into the city sewer, that's what I meant to say if you're delaying the channeling of the rainfall into the city sewer and then into the wastewater treatment plant, it allows the Wastewater treatment plant who treat the receiving wastewater that it can handle. So that's one way that we are basically helping improving the waterways within these New York City areas be just a couple of and I do not want to take too long. I know you have other agenda items and I know you have questions, but now that I hear that there's other you know, there's obviously committee members just a couple of simple things that I think are very helpful, especially and what we are all going through right now, but I'll start with one. We have a program which is called weight which we've been working in Queens and Brooklyn, but it's very important that you, which any one of us can use. Basically, it means that when we have a heavy rainstorm, I would suggest and hope that everyone can participate, whereas if you are listening to the news- and you hear that in the weather- news that there's going to be a rain storm, what I suggest is when it is occurring that you all wait in terms of using a large amounts of water. Basically wait to take a shower. Oh wait to turn on the dishwasher, or wait to do to wash clothes and etc, because those are appliances and uses of high volume of water which ultimately goes into the city sewer and, as I stated before, can cause flow over capacity issues. The second thing, which is important right now and we obviously are all dealing with Covid-19 and we as DEP the agency, ensures that we make sure that actually we make sure that we provide you with clean and safe drinking water, but at the same time we're all using disinfectant wipes. I know I am at home. We want to make sure that we're clean and we try to protect ourselves, but those whether it's wet wipes disinfectant wipes. It would be very helpful if that is disposed of in the trash instead of down the drain. That could can cause problems not only internally with your plumbing at home, but also with the wastewater treatment plant, as it damages our equipment and not only that, but it also delays our operations. It's actually a costly endeavor to eliminate all the disinfectant wipes. The wet wipes yearly, so I would advise also that you know as we're using gloves to dispose of it in the trash cans if possible, when you are out and about as I've seen. Obviously it's hard to you know keep trash with you or litter, but it would be very helpful if you maintain it until you get home or you see a trash can, because if you do litter again, the litter goes into our catch basins, which is connected to our city, sewer and again it dirty. Let's say it during a rainstorm the litter. There is a possibility that it may end up in our waterways and to connect to the beach topic. These waterways also connects to the beach the beaches that we have in New York City. So you do not want to have to have a trip to the beach in New, York City, and you see all these kinds of litters, whether it's bottles or you know you know, potato chip bags or gloves and in that kind of situation. So that would greatly help us out just a minor fun facts: I guess we handle about 1/3 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater each day in terms of the CSO's we have about 700 of them throughout the city. Basically, you can note- or see them usually near our wastewater treatment plants which are 14 with around New York City and along those lines again. Water quality is a high priority for us. The waterways are of high quality and better than a hundred years ago, ever since the Clean Water Act from 1972. Basically we try to sample the waterways as often as possible. We have a mechanism of having boats that can test the waters. That information is also in our DP website, which we call the Harbor Survey. So again we you know, we emphasize that you know this information can be found in our DP website. And yes, we do like I said before we follow state guidelines to make sure that the waterways are safe and clean, but they are some classifications. Another fact here that the state designates so, for example, my thinking Community Board one here where you are. You are part of the New York New York Harbor, the Inner Harbor. We basically have a water quality area here in our Inner Harbor, which is called via which we test the excuse me Hudson River and upper New, York Bay and this area is classified as fishing and boating. Lastly, I'm sorry, I do ramble, but I opened myself up to questions, but lastly, in terms of swimming and beach season, I did include that in the email that I sent to Lucian, basically the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene also does their own testing of the waterways of beaches. Excuse me, and they are the primary agency which notifies the citizens of the residents of the quality of the beach of the beaches and basically provide advisories. We as a DEP. Here we also provide advisories but on the waterways, so that information again can also be. For you know found in our DP website it's a lot. It's very extensive. We try to do real- time, but also, if you go to notify NYC, you can also receive alerts to our water body advisories. So if you go, for example, to our DP website and you look at you type and water body, advisories you'll be able to see, for instance, the Inner Harbor area and look up Hudson River, and you would see that there is no alerts, no advisories at this time. I'm sorry, I, rambled and I took route and I took a little longer, but I I'll be happy to take any questions. If not I can always ask our DP staff Thank You Mariana. Did you want to ask question? I can't see the list of people who may want to ask questions because I'm still out I'm on my phone large population of 911 survivors people dealing with different health conditions that resulting from 911, and that was one of the reasons that I wanted to make sure that we went over this topic. Thank you that we've discussed this topic. My question would be if there are any additional precautions that we should be taking in that respect. Even you know bovid and this everything that happening right now, okay, in terms of recreational use or talking about summer being upon us and you can't go in the water yet in New, York City right, but so we're still, you know being near the water. Is that okay? Should we be further concerned, like I, said if we have some sort of pre- existing condition, maybe that perhaps we should not even go to the beach at all? Yes, okay, so again, I apologize for rambling and I was not exactly sure what you know it. I was trying to give some general information, but I can definitely answer your question so and I'll start off by one other note in terms of New York, City drinking, you know drinking water supply, it is safe to drink. The Covid-19 is not a waterborne illness, so there is no concerns in terms of your drinking water. Regarding recreational activities, I understand everybody wants to go outside and obviously we're moving into Phase two in New York City in terms of DEP. What we're tasked to do is make sure that the waterways around the city, New York City, are up to the standards of the state regarding the beaches. The Department of Health has that delegation of making sure that they test and that they provide you with the information and also determining whether or not the beaches can be opened or not. If there was an issue with the beaches in terms of the water quality, the Department of Health would have to send out an advisory and in a que in a situation like that, they would delay the opening of the beaches but again in terms of the beaches in particular, that is under the realm of Department of Health and also Parks Department in terms of maintenance and etc. But the water quality is done by the Department of Health. But, as I said before, the waterways, around New York City, is cleaner than it's ever been before, and I urge everyone to take a look at our DP website. But again, your area as I stated before is CB1 in the Hudson River area, that's classified by the state as a boating and fishing area now I know that there's other recreational activities I mean I, have a friend who you know you know, helps with the boathouse and they do canoeing and I'm sure. There's people that swim throughout the Hudson, River and etc. But that is not for us to you, know, determine or advise people that they can or can not go up on that so I think I saw stirring on New York one and maybe I'm mistaken and maybe I'm correct that they were mistaken. I thought I saw a story that said that Covid-19 has been found living in some runoff water, and you just said that Cove it is not waterborne and therefore we do not have to worry about it and so I guess. Did you see that story on New York, one or anyone else did see the same story and I also shared I, initially learned of this topic, I shared an article in Chicago yeah and can I add something Pat and Mariana that I just shared in the chat that there's a webinar tomorrow on this very topic on Cobin 19 to tection and wastewater streams, as it was a way of an advance warning, so I would love it if that could be addressed here. Umberto and thank you all for this important topic. Yes thank you and if I could just finish by saying that you're referring to wastewater, not waterways, where we've had conversations with Manhattan borough president's office where we are gearing up to test for the Covid-19 in our wastewater and that would be able to help us to track and trace, but in terms of the waterways that is not I, believe what you are referring to. Does not our wastewater go to the same problem with what do they call plants a purification plant? Yes, that's correct, but you're referring to waterways in terms of the rivers like the Hudson, Rivers or you're. Talking about because the news article yeah diet, I'm. Sorry, we thought that we heard it has been found in wastewater. That is correct, but I'm. Sorry, I thought. The issue of the agenda item here was waste water, I'm, sorry, waterways, like the rivers and also the beaches. Yes, it can't be traced in wastewater, and that is something that DEP is looking into and working on. Okay, and so we have a wastewater treatment facility. What I read because she was asking if it has been found in wastewater facility treatment plans, so it's it was there. What scientists are saying is that the Covid-19 or the Czar's too can be traced can be found in our wastewater or in our way. It's excuse me in our sewage and our waste and that's something that we can use. We can go into our wastewater treatment facilities and test. So then that can help us to test and trace. We know what areas are have or can be, are likely to be in danger of Covid-19, or we can tell the a trace the high volumes of cases of Covid-19 so I'm, sorry, if it's in the waste water and it goes to the treatment plan in the treatment plant, can the Covid-19 did not see removes of the water killed. So right so again, it's its traces in a sewage that we can look at and test. If it's in the early stages, we do a treatment of the waste water where there's chlorination. There's an abaya, there's organisms that we have that killed the bacteria and basically there's several steps of our treatment in our wastewater treatment facilities that we are mandated as the city and state to do in order to treat the wastewater before and rainfall before it is released into the waterways and I think what you're referring to. Then. The news is the again the tracing and the testing of the sewage to determine if there is Covid-19 in certain areas of the city, the nasties, if the tests prove that there is Covid-19 in the water and it be removed or what then happens to the water, that's contaminated with Covid-19, again so I. These are we're in early stages of this process, we're working with a couple of universities to help us with this study. But this is again. This is early stages, where we're gearing up in our that we hope to have in our 14 wastewater treatment plants. But again, if a person has Covid-19 and obviously you're using you know, you know you obviously do a number one or number two. If you know you have, it is likely traces in the sewage, yes in terms of treatment and or how should I say, did not make right contain containing the Covid-19. That's something we're going to have to work with the University I'm, not sure, if that's something that I can discuss now or something possible again, the agreement or the or where we're trying to go to in terms of this new process is just basically to trace it to know where it's coming from what areas have the high volume of Covid-19 and hopefully be able to trace it beforehand in advance? So we can try to go to those neighborhoods those areas and have the city obviously respond to those needs and issues I just wanted to. Let you know that Graham and Lewis climate both had their hands of just you know: okay, I used to leave so I'm. Looking at his note in the chat, grandma who's, a man who has to leave shortly, but also Graham Burchell, was the first one to reach out III still. Who was the person asked the question louis Kleinman? Okay, thank you for putting me on the question. Now is not whether or not the virus can be treated in the wastewater treatment plant. The question is what happens to it when there's an overflow? There are millions of gallons that overflow every year into our rivers and streams over a hundred thousand different kayakers and other human power boaters used the water last year and the question arises is how dangerous is that virus in the overflows? Since many of the boat houses in fact, have their boat houses directly over a combined sewer overflow? Yes, thank you for rephrasing and thank you for the question so yeah that goes part of what I was referring to earlier in terms of our operations or procedures. In terms of when we do have a rainstorm. We do have protocols, whereas when our wastewater treatment plants can not take in all the rainfall and sewage at this time we do release. But again it's a only during heavy rain storm events and when those events occurs, we do have a protocol where we either chlorinate or we try to maneuver our wastewater treatment procedures, equipment to try to address those needs, whether it's, if it's holding more waste in our interceptor pipe, which is a big pipe before the wastewater treatment plant situations like that. But again, our goal is not to release any wastewater or a combined sewer overflow into the waterways and, as I stated before, we have been doing a pretty good job of it. We have analysis of the waterways in our DP web site. In addition to that, if you do see some overflows and in the waterways that can also be reported to 3- 1- 1, but we do have DEP staff out there, monitoring the situation and, as I said before, we also monitor the waterways so during and after and you know, did to determine what actions need to be taken, because we are regulated by the state and we do have to report all those events. I do not get into this. Does that answer your question? No, not really, but I do not have the time to read back guys. Can you hear me? Can you hear me hi? This is Graham virtual president- you're, downtown boathouse, where your friendly boathouse, we repair, 26 and just for the record there is swimming that goes on in New, York Harbor, like Governors Island, has had an annual swim around the harbor for years. You just have to pay money, they're organized swims, they exist they're, not very common they're, not very cheap, but there is swimming and they are done when the water is clean. In fact, there's one that for many years left from North Cove that went around Manhattan. It was quite a large prize funding and it was too round meant Manhattan circ, so swimming exists in the harbor, as was mentioned, though it is not officially like the harbor is not certified for swimming all the time, but you can swim in it and I confess I kind of swim in it a lot so and quite frankly, today, you I'd rather swim in the harbor than swim in a swimming pool. If I'm worrying about a virus right, there's just a lot more space in a harbor, there are always viruses in the harbor. Even a drop of ocean water has something like a billion viruses in it and so- just one more. This is, as was mentioned by the did you see. This is not a waterborne virus. This is not polio, which would you be really like waterborne? It's not cholera right. It's basically an airborne virus and it's just one of millions in the environment. So my attitude is: if you guys wanted to go swimming, you could go swimming, and why did not you just reach out to me any community board member who wants to get in the water I'll figure out a way to make it happen? You have my contact information, no excuses right thanks a lot. Thank you. That's great I think what we were trying to get. You, though, is how dangerous the safest place to be right now, rather than being on you know, on the street there sharing the street with a bunch of other people and an airborne virus I mean I, could put you guys on the harbor and Kayaks I'd love to I can't because I do not have a beach. So with that great well, thank you for that. That's actually that that's actually a great to hear and I'm excited to hear that you're, taking advantage of the water waves again I'm. Just you know I'm generalizing here, but again our we have a mandate from the state to pretty much remove any pollutants, basically we're up to 85 to 95 percent from our wastewater treatment plants, and we disinfect the wastewater. That's part of the treatment process in our wastewater treatment plant. Now, as you know, Covid-19 is obviously a virus, an issue, that's that we're all dealing with now and there's a lot of a lot of questions here and a lot of questions that I can answer to you by you know having our either scientists or engineers or other city agencies. Respond to that. But again we take pride in the operations and the procedures that we have. The waterways are clean. It is, if you decide to swim, that is under your discretion again, the state classifies it, but we are doing all we can in terms of treating the wastewater and in terms of Covid-19. Obviously, as I stated before, we are working with several universities, including NYU Stanford University, and we're trying to come up with a testing technology here that is best suited for this type of virus, and we want to analyze the data and assess it and to use that data to help us with these health issues in the future. So again, I have to emphasize these are early stages and then I'm. Sorry, I can't give you the answers that you're looking for right now, but I definitely do not discourage you from using the waterways or the beaches. Obviously do H will announce when the beaches can be used and open, but we do have a high standard of protocols in terms of when release and how we release and water actions are to be taken to reduce the pollutants in the waterways when these combined sewer overflows occur. Thank you. Waterways might actually be open this year, or should we be looking to 2021 before we you know can expect that the Coh would say there might be open like do you guys have an inclination as to whether or not that time may come this summer right? So let me just have to it. So in terms of the EP, we do not notify the public or it's not within our purview, to notify when the waterways are open. You know, as the gentleman said, there's a boathouse and you can go through in that direction. Our job is just basically to make sure that we monitored the waterways, because we have wastewater treatment facilities on the waterways number two in terms of the beach season, from what I'm hearing. Yes, they do want to open it right now. It's just it. You know it's cold and but they are allowing people on the beaches again. If there were an issue, Department of Health would issue an advisory to the public and you would be aware of it of any of those situations, but just to let you know, I. Think of me, I've been in a lot of meetings, even with Parks Department, where you know. Obviously, funding is an issue, but they do want to open up pools and again. Chlorination is a is key here which we do in the wastewater treatment plant and that's one form or method of treatment, but I hope that answers your question because again we do not say whether or not it's okay to swim in the Hudson River. That's not as I understand I, appreciate that. Thank you so I think conversation here. Although I did see Alice did you have your hand up Thanks yeah. Can you hear me yeah I, do too I think I think I assume you heard me before. I just was identifying this panel tomorrow on this topic, making sure everyone was aware of it and which I've shared in the chat and to just thank you very much for taking this up Mariana and Pat. We will certainly follow up in the Environmental Protection Committee and jointly look at this on the specifics of the waste water question in Copa, 19, pretty fascinating stuff, thanks very much okay, so I'm going to thank you so much for coming to our meeting okay Umberto. What or is the is there? Any impact on our sea be ones increased density on is what is the impact on our sewage treatment facility or access, or because I mean every now, and then we hear what a main break over here pipe broke over here. You know so, and we are the oldest part of the city and the density is just constantly increasing with. As a matter of fact, we had a meeting last night about how they want to build this monstrosity building on the at 250 Water Street. So what does that mean for the sewage around where I live? Yes, just my thoughts question. Yes, thank you for the question yeah. You know I get that throughout the city as well, but you're right, CB1, the district. The areas is one of the oldest there. One thing I do not want to. You know talk for too long, but one thing I'll say is that we have a funding plan that we have in a yearly basis and a 10 year, capital plan, where we always invest in installing new water mains and new sewer mains. But I'll say this even going back to a hundred years ago, our engineers, when they first started, building and installing water mains and sewer main. Basically we use the same method. We want to you to install water mains and sewer mains that will last a century. When we talk about wheat, you hear a lot about aging infrastructure. That is a fact that is true. The city does get old, however, these pipes, the materials that we use and the way that we install and operate them. Our goal is to make sure that they're operating for a century for a hundred years, we've gone from iron cast water mains to ductile our mains, which is a little bit more sturdy bendable flexible. But to answer your question in terms of numbers: I can tell you that I am the contact person for all water mains throughout New, York, City and I can't recall the last notification I sent solution in terms of a water main break. What you do hear a lot about is a lot of leaks and some of these leaks may be from internal plumbing or it can be from a hydrant valve or valve from the city water main it's not necessarily the pipe itself bursting or with all the construction that's taking place, and we have a situation where it where it affects our water mains. So I hope this answers your question, but that's a very good question, but just to let you know, that's good to hear-, it's good to hear and just push, but also with Bloomberg- saying the form of which this takes are the DVC projects that come in here so worth Street, for example, interest rate. These are projects right where they are laying and extensions of the new water tunnels, water pipes that are or tunnel three or a tunnel. There's a tunnel three umberto correct. We did not activate it yet so yeah, so a lot of not all of them, but most of them deal with the renewal of the utilities like electric gas steam and, more importantly, water and sewer, okay, I'm. Sorry I do not want to be late sure, but it's a labor. Do not you huh. So, yes, in terms of you, can you hear yeah my question? Well, my additional question is considering: is there I would imagine there is some sort of evaluation? That's done on the ability for the infrastructure to handle those kinds of things before developer is given approval to build a new high- rise, building and I'm, focusing on 250 Water Street in the fact that they're trying to make that happen, which means that a lot of our pipes and stuff, you know or I, mean I'm going to have to be done or extended or something if we get like, say, 200 more apartments, well, I'm, probably more in the type of high- rise that they're that they're looking at building, but there's nothing Vietnam to put more stuff in a small area which is already oversaturated. Great question and I was going to answer that. That's something that comes up a lot and I'll say that there's many levels of oversight when it comes to that and you know whether sewer or water. It's always a concern, but you know whether it's City Planning or in a lower scale, whether it's Department of Buildings receiving these applications for new connections or the units within a building. Those things are all overseen by the city and city agencies do communicate with each other to make sure that they allow what's allowable for within that district. So again, whether it's building, DP or city planning, we all communicate to make sure that the capacity is not overtaxed. But again, we also rely on your elected officials and you yourselves community boards, to raise these questions in terms of these skyscrapers of you development to make sure that they are found regulated. So, yes, yeah, okay, all right! Thank you. Thank you. One good question, I put my hand up sorry. This is Mimi Flynn yeah, I'm, a I'm, a Skywarn weather spotter, and when we have storms, I tend to monitor some of the reports from the area and I'm. Just this is regarding lick'em the runoff from the streets. It tends to be a bit of flooding pretty quickly when we have thunderstorms come through. Do you know if there's any plans like or any plan to fix that it's pretty bad in our area? I see so I'll try to be quick, but I failed to mention before that. Whatever I did not answer. If I could not answer your questions, please have Lucien forward my email address and email me. Your questions I'll be happy to get back to you. I'll have conversations with internal staff to answer your question two things during a heavy rain storm you have to allow I know it's frustrating, especially walking out during a rainstorm. You are not trying to cross the street, but please allow the rainfall will take some time in certain areas. Certain low- lying areas where you have Bowl or drain a poor drainage. Whether it's you know you know, streets are in need of repair or catch basins or clogged or the city sewer system is either in small capacity. Well during a rainfall, some areas do take time for it to drain. You have to allow it some time, but very simply, if there's flooding street flooding means that the city sewer can't handle the rainfall you can follow through on one service request, let Lucien know or myself know, number two. If the catch basin is not draining rainwater, that's a clog that can easily be serviced by a DP by us. But again, yes, you have to allow some time for rainfall after a couple of days, if you have a bad street where it's still a lot of stagnant water ponding, you know that's something that we can take a look at and it can be filed it in 301. Again it could be a clog in the city sewer or catch basin yeah. Thank you appreciate it well. Thank you. Anyone else have their hand up okay, so thank you very much and we will. If we have more questions, we will send them to you. Thank you for coming tonight and sharing this information and I hope after the testing has started, you say we're working with some universities. After you get some information, we would love to. Have you come back and share it with us? Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. Have a nice evening, Thank You Alberto, you alright! Are you there Katie, yes, hi Pat! Thank you. Wait. I, hope. You've got your technical difficulties washed out now. Sorry about that yeah! Okay, perfect! Thank you guys. So much again, I share my screen with you. Can you guys see the screen? Okay, using the terminology of white defendants, ASA might want to change that for the presentation to the full board to change the term. I do not think tiller was on I, think you're having technical difficulties but yeah. They asked to remove white supremacy, okay, to make a comment on that I'd like to make a comment on that. This is Mariama, so I'm in support of changing the name. If that's what it's been determined to do, but with regard to not only the committee but globally and this issue I think we have to be very careful and walk the line of what proper terms are, as deemed by the government what words they're using and the black community yeah very careful about trying to protect the feelings of either people sometimes are guilty. Do not understand it's a teaching moment. You do not take advantage of a teaching moment by avoiding the topic if it's white supremacy that's at the root of this issue and we should be comfortable using the term white supremacy. If that's. If we determine that, that's not, maybe you know what that's what's at the root, then you know we should whatever is. We should be comfortable using it. You know no different, then let's say with the LGBTQ issues. Hey, let me add- and you know it's not for us to determine what words are appropriate. We need to. Let them tell us what's, okay, to say and what's not okay, you say that's how we learn so I just think you know just again that was a general comment: I'm not objecting to changing you in this instance, but I. Think and again, not just for the committee or the neighborhood, but in general for the for the world we have, we have to be. Is it a moment of honesty and truth coming to bear, and so we have to face it. Sometimes truth is difficult to deal with, but we are going to really make real progress and we have to deal with it. So phrases like lives matter or I do not see your color okay. Thank you. Thank you guys for taking the time to listen to us. I hope we do not make too much of fools of ourselves this evening, quick Intros on who we are. My name is Taylor and my sister's name is Katy. We are two white girls raised in Battery Park City, lower Manhattan, New, York I'm, a millennial she's from Jen's II. Our parents are Italian and Irish and have been political activists in this community for years. One is actually a member of this board and the other is a writer for the local newspaper. We would be protesting on the streets right now, if not for Kovac 19 and our at- risk family members. So we are turning to other forms of active activism right now and trying to talk about something: that's long overdue police violence and structural racism that are so embedded in this city. That Intro may feel complete or look complete to many people, but actually it's far from it, leaves out many people and structures that bring us here today. For example, we've also been raved another person, one of whom's roll pillows unnamed. By far too many families like mine, Beverly Allen, our other mother I, do make an American, wife and mother of three who built her life for her kids in Brooklyn, New York in part by commuting to this neighborhood to work a job taking care of my sister and I, our parents and our grandparents. Every day since we were born she's here, tonight- I'm, listening into this meeting, this may be the first meeting she's attended, even though she works. This neighborhood has every right to be at these meetings. Another metaphorical parent of ours and of this neighborhoods is the White power structure that depends on racism to operate. So I wanted to share two stories that took place on the same Street in lower Manhattan on September 11th 2001. My sister was nine months. A fetus and I was 8 years, an adult looking out my window and gateway Plaza on to West Street and the twin pillars, watching as two Plains changed our lives forever. That day, the NYPD and many first responders were our heroes. They ran towards danger and their own lot in their own deaths to save our lives. Since then, we and other survivors of 9/11 have fought and continued the fight every day against the Battle of illness brought on by being in the dust cloud that day, we've done that fight together, fast- forward to almost 20 years later on, June 2nd 2002, my sister now 18 years old and I 27 watch history out our windows on West Street. Again, we watched as protests against structural racism, White supremacy violence on black lives, especially by the police, pick up after years of black organizers, protesting for the same thing, equality and justice and end to police violence that has killed two disparate disproportionate number of black people in this country. We watched as these protests gained momentum and global attention in all 50 states. In 18 plus countries around the world at 8:00 p.m. that night, when New York City's curfew fell, we watched peaceful protests turned violent, except the violence on West Street was being inflicted on civilians by the NYPD armed they charged the crowd, shoved and beat protesters with batons. My NYPD heroes on 9/11/2001 became my villains on June, 2nd 2020. These two stories beg the question whose lives are our NYPD police protecting and whose are they hurting to do so? Basically, the answer seems pretty obvious to me is something we want to talk about tonight, but it feels like it's white people's lives that are being protected at the expense of black people's, and this is relevant to this community board because it happened right here in our community in this example on power structures, and this is an example of power structures at play, and there are so many other examples. So we come to ask this committee to be transparent about this racism. What I guess we have labeled white supremacy and we're using the label of black organizers as white supremacy as it plays out in CB1? We ask that we speak up and we say that we are not okay with police violence against black Americans here or anywhere. We ask that this committee and this board lead us in making structural changes against white power structures and that we use our influence to continue this conversation. So my sister and I have been hearing a lot from our white family and friends. Phrases: they're, not racist and I, guess our response to that is to our to our white, family and friends as that's great, but what we want to know and what black organizers wants to know are our white, family and friends, anti- racist. What we mean by anti- racist is: what are we doing as white people who are not racist to combat racism and white power structures? Are we quietly accepting the status quo or are we speaking up for change and we ask this community board to examine ourselves as individuals in ongoing ways and to examine the systems we are moving within in this neighborhood in this country in this world? You know: where are there places we can say? No, this is unfair. Where are the places we can say, stop Let's change, let's change how this conversation is going. Let's talk about this, you know: where can we offer something better? Something loving and something just, and we also hear a lot and we ask our sweet we're asking it ourselves, you know what can we do as like people to make a difference right, but so many answers have actually been given to us by people of color they've been in many ways, and this is something that I wanted to consolidate for us. For those of us saying you want to spread love in this time. Research is love, advocacy is love. Having hard conversations is love, you want to spread love, listen to those in pain who have been systematically oppressed and say, I, hear you I believe in your humanity and I will fight for it, no matter what it takes. That is the most loving we can be, and on that note, I wanted to try and share a clip from a podcast, an NPR podcast called cold switch. Jamil Smith spoke and the last minute of the of the podcast. He he's a senior writer for Rolling Stone magazine, and he you know, they've been talking about the protest. You know in this, in this episode and they're talking about what's different and all the historical contest contacts leading up to this, and he ends with this message to us. I will defer judgment on whether or not this is going to be the moment that, finally, everyone will understand exactly what's happening in the black communities around this country with regards to policing and over policing and militarized policing I after Ferguson, it's hard to hold your breath, it's hard to hold your breath when you know a 12 year old kid gets gunned down with a toy gun and the city that you grew up in, as was the case for me with Tamir rice and the city kind of just kind of shrugs. Everyone moves on your rice would been 18 in June and the America moves on America moves forward, I think, to a large extent, white power structure waits for us as black people, especially to quiet down, settle down to get it out of our system in terms of unrest in terms of online protests. I'll, be writing my column, and that moment will happen, but whether or not it will result in any concrete change is really up to people who may be least involved with the trauma it matters. Whether or not people who are not affected by this do something so you've listened to that clip. I feel like it directly applies to us here, especially about your Park City residents in lower Manhattan, especially the white, the white residents here. So we also put together some proposals, there's four of them and would love to talk about them more right now, so the first one. We would like to see a resolution put forth that gives our gives condolences for the black Americans killed by police. That also stands on the record, supporting black lives matter and States. Its support for the police reforms put forth by you know the city of the state and the federal government, those that have already passed and those that have not yet asked and then another one. We would like to request the immediate release of protesters and nonviolent arrests from jails and sentencers, and our and our CB1 community I think I. Could think of at least three jails and then that we asked precinct one to welcome protesters here in our in Cd1 and that we say that we won't accept any more police violence against these protesters, like we saw on June, 2nd and all throughout the protesting in this in lower Manhattan, we've seen violence done by the police on protesters and request that there be no more arrests of these protesters just for protesting the third proposal. So this one is our way of our idea for continuing this conversation to structurally change. You know this community board slightly by providing space, whether it be a working group or a whole committee. Where we just talk about racial injustice. We talk LGBTQ issues. We talked about gender class, a it give me a space to continue this long overdue conversation and then also a place where this committee can continue to talk about the reforms that we are seeing passed in our state and our city I'm, really glad that they passed its thanks to all the organizers and our elected officials. How do we? How do we know how those are going to play out? Are they going to be done effectively? Are they enough? Where can we work on them and I would love a space where this community can continue talking about that and continue proposing changes to make those effective and I do not I know that and precinct one can have meetings with this committee specifically, but I would love to have a space where we can really have hard conversations with our officers and with our detention, centers and happy vocal about how we can see those spaces be safer and a Town Hall. It could be a place where, in Host, Town Hall town halls with experts I think we are in duper one very soon and the fourth one is request that we provide a space for a memorial in Battery Park City, with names of unarmed black Americans killed by the police. There are many memorials in this country and many in Battery Park City specifically, but none that mourn for unarmed black Americans murder by the police that I know of Battery Park City houses, the police memorial right now. It also houses has new memorials coming in for Hurricane, Maria and mother Cabrini to two hurricanes that are two memorials that are not specifically, you know, based and are related to this neighborhood in yet we house them so these are. These are some our proposals and then you to this committee, this committee, so much for taking the time to listen to us. Sorry for our nerves. My nurse, we really appreciate everything, you've done and would love to continue. Talking about. This of all I have to tell you that I give you a clause. You get a fantastic job, do not be nervous. It was a great presentation from both of you and I think points. I. Think the committee will agree. You did a fabulous job I'm going to open it up now for either discussion questions so who wants to go? First, we put our hands up. I can't hear I. Believe Mitch I do not see any hands up on the board, but I Mitch said some I. Think yes and lose there I'm happy to recognize Mitch. You I can't do that. I basically agree with everything. The two young ladies said, like 99.9% and every one of the suggestions, I was support. I would just maybe put a little asterisk I forget. There was one of the things about no like I agree with no arrests for the protesters and peaceful protesters, maybe just because, unfortunately, there were people on the extreme right and the extreme left that we're trying to hijack this righteous movement. And so you know some of the some of the looters did not have the best of intentions and we're trying to upset the righteous protests. So maybe somehow put something to separate that from you know my support or our support of not arresting peaceful protesters, which, I think is you know, I, do not know how it could be worded or I do not know how you feel, but then, unfortunately, a few people that that's an important clarification I would just add to the quaint. As a point of clarification, further point of clarification that side vans. The district attorney has pledged to not prosecute. Although there's been the number of arrests, he has pledged to not prosecute any protesters. Oh but I support going forward with resolution as well. Iii support not prosecuting any protester I'm just separating the term looter protest and which I was saying, I think that's a valuable and important clarification that you made. You know a distinction, yeah and I agree with you, I like yeah, okay, so I think that the point is, you might want to put peaceful protesters inside of it. That's fine and then I agree with the hundred percent of that. Thank you. That was a good clarification point in the right. I also learned the difference between generations, Z and Millennials, which I was not sure before today can I pop in and say something I see a lot of hands up- yeah I mean what the heck yeah hands go up from your committee. I'll, wait to the end, I mean I, see your hand- Tammy facial way to the end. Let me see Francis. This is hinges up: Bob Francis, my firm, okay, ah, very good presentation, teller. Thank you for helping us begin. The conversation I think that the conversation is a lot bigger than we know or extends back a long period to many years ago. What some of the programs that I listen to on how black people deal with white aggression and race relations and things that have been happening are, is the fact that America is American. History is built on a lie and we need to go back and learn American history, and once we learn American history, then we can understand better. Why we are where we are because it's from the very beginning, there's been a systematic progression of white supremacy, taking control over all non- whites and it started with the Native Americans, and then they imported slaves and it continued. And what happened was they took real American history and civics out of the education prize and I know it as it's the dumbing down of America and there's a lot of us. I mean black people as well, who are ignorant of the real American history. And if we be to look at the real American history and where we come from and how this country was built, then we will have a better understanding. We were at now. The other side of that is in terms of policing over a period of time, and in that whole scenario, policing has been used as a force to control, whoever you know, and so here we are, and police have been given the right away for many years and the establishment has looked the other way and we are where we are so I think that education, starting from the root of the roots of American history, would be a very good thing. I also think that, in terms of the plaque, I think that's an excellent idea. I think you might want to consider maybe just narrowing the focus to New York City black people who have been killed and look at like Abner, Louima, Eric garner. You know, Sean Bell I, think you get more one mileage out of that. You get my point. My point is to keep it local and I'm. Sure, you're, probably you might get a better response, not to say that I think all the names should be listed, but that's happening in other parts of New, York, City and then coordinating with the first precinct would be a good idea in terms of the protesting issues that you want to you know and that you want to have happen in this area. I think that if you reached out to them and say we have this idea, you know in terms of the protesters down here this and that any other whatever so I think you guys are great for starting the conversation, and you have a lot of wonderful idea and I am happy that you will keep hope alive and that something will happen in terms of the beginnings of talking about race relations in the United States, the well, a community board gwon the United States, and it is just not here it's all over. It's all over the world. You know so I think that's something we looked at and you know parents. Thank you. Thank you I. Thank your parents as well, and thank you so much I just want to trick them in and say, and thank you for giving us opportunity to speak and being patient with us and, as we speak, I want to say, though, we're definitely not starting. The conversation work to try to continue it. It's definitely been certified by many organizers and but thank you I'm glad to bring it here and I would love to continue the conversation. Thank you in having this conversation, and so there may be a way that we can organize, and maybe we show the borough president and see if we can organize a Manhattan I mean it's happening all over the city, but you know one step at a time that maybe there's a way we can organize meeting with Manhattan community boards and any you know and the public to continue the conversation. All right. Who else has their hand up? I have my hand up, but I said I would I was happy to you know be last of the hands. If nobody else has there. So can I add something to what my what Francis said that okay I was just doing some research while she was talking and I mean I could not agree more, but even though it's in Brooklyn, but not in Manhattan, the last fort in the city, Fort Hamilton, the government denied the like the city councils are some people of our year too. This Stonewall Jackson, Drive and generally Street in Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, and the government refused to change the names like as recently as one or two years ago. So, even though it's not since we're talking about world issues, not just community board, one issues, I think that's something that if we can add to the docket that would be directly related to what these two young, ladies we're talking about, and what we're talking about I think we should reach out to the community for that. Those seats are located in and have a conversation with them: Fort Hamilton our military base in Brooklyn and there's two streets Stonewall Jackson Drive in generally Street. Okay, thank you. I. Do I just want to thank both Katie and Taylor for the great presentation and the hard work that went into doing this I also would recognize their cousin Claire, who was behind the scenes and a lot of the stuff that they've been doing I think she's a that she's on the attendee list. She's done a lot of research with them. Sorry who do not know clearly, sorry for those who do not know these are my daughters, but I also wanted like a second or echo. What Mitch said I like the idea of going through and getting rid of the names of Confederate, what the hell they are soldiers, whoever it's not it's, not animated, Justine enemy combatants, that's what they were enemy combatants there. You go enemy combatants, I like it so I support that suggestion. I support. Almost all the resolution, ideas that the girls put forth I do not know if this committee could pick that up and take it with them as that, but with those lists as a framework for a resolution or a bunch of resolutions coming out of this committee or how that works. But if that's the case, I support those as a favor framework and because I just want to say to that conversation, it's personal to us here in Battery, Park City, because that's where we live and that's what my girls grow up and that's what talking about. But it is every place in the world. So I love your suggestion. I think it was you Pat about making this to the other community boards and bringing it larger, because the conversation has to start and the Jen sees and the Millennials need to step up and take over the reins and a lot of them are doing it and a lot of them are not and I just love the fact that they're coming forward and I want to see their friends and their colleagues and their classmates and their whatever getting more involved, because it's not going to change unless everybody gets involved, and that means voting- I'm done. Thank you. I hope that the hands up, meaning again I, agree. Everything I, think that you know to speak to saying about the streets in Brooklyn. I think that it would be good for us to just look at all of our monuments. I know that it's not in our district, it is in Manhattan, though there is the Oblast- general worth who is a hero of genocide. The with the Indian Wars I, think that we need to you know just look at our monuments and question them and look into that so but think about general Worth's like Opal Ask. Is that there's I think he's buried underneath it, but that's also not in our district, but we should definitely look at what is in our district and meaning that you're worth three. If I could, if I could not do if I could just say for me, I just want people I'm not advocating tearing these things that on what they should not be glorified I'm advocating having them in a museum just like when I'd like you go to the Holocaust Museum, and you see these terrible atrocities on display so that you do not forget or the Peace Museum in Japan, and you see these like melted bicycles and little kids of you know so: I'm not advocating having them disappear, but not being glorified. They should be removed to a museum or something like that. Yeah I, agree, I also yeah worth Street is another one and by the way I'm from Fort Worth, which is named after him as well. It's interesting I got it. So the only thing I want to add I wanted to say thank you very specifically to the girls for coming and speaking, it's hard, it's scary, but you will get better at it. I will tell you the more you practice so I'm delighted. If we were your first I hope we are not your last hey please come back. There are other things to really think about, because your thinking is amazing, but we have such a cultural history in lower Manhattan that we can actually be a part of a future dialogue that African burial grounds in lower Manhattan show, from the very beginning, stages of what happened to the African experience in New, York City and in America. We can capitalize on that, because there are still places that are unbuilt from it and not a plaque. But you know a plaque. Is a nice place to stop this one of the things that drives us all crazy about the number of memorials in Battery Park City, something interactive, something that celebrates the success of where we are the goals for the future and recognizes the past would be really comprehensive and something I am sure that you guys can help figure out and be a part of that solution. And, while you think of Battery Park City, because that's where you're more located I think it should be at City, Hall right. I think it should be in the biggest place, with the most amount of tourists that have the biggest impact and to really have a say that says this is not who we are as a nation going forward right. We've got the African burial grounds. There are places around all over Tribeca that represent the experience in the life and that we need to capitalize on and really make something that is dynamic. I agree with locking all the crappy people into a museum behind glass in terms of like memorials and statues, but celebrates finding ways to celebrate the positive impacts as well. To show a really good dialogue would be amazing. So that's more food for thought. Think outside your neighborhood, because we've got lots of really great things, east and West to take a look at make sure that when you're thinking and proposing you do it someplace that you feel will have not only the greatest impact for the people themselves, but that more people will see it right. And thank you again, it's very scary. The first time when we get in person it'll be easier versus virtual I promise. I promise and I can not wait to see you at the next meeting. So thank you. Yes, so I'm just going to double back. First of all, thank you so much Taylor, okay to Claire, for your presentation, I want to congratulate you. Clearly it was important to this committee and to the board that you have an opportunity to speak, but I just want you to know how important it was to me as an individual that we hear not only from you specifically, although that was super important to me, but that we hear from young people I think we have to face facts again. We have to this is a time we have to capture the moment. This is a moment of truth. You know some of you may be into astrology approaching the Age of Aquarius. The sign of Aquarius is all about freedom and humanitarianism, and so you know there's this thing as above so below it's going on above us in the celestial system. It's happening here we're moving into this age of freedom and humanitarianism, despite whether you know you do not want to come, you'll get left behind. Basically, so it's really important, but even to narrow it down to this neighborhood, specifically I think it's we have to face fact. We have people, colleagues, friends, family members who unfortunately, are passing away from you know this is a 911 affected community and we're losing a lot of our historians on a personal level right the people who knew these stories and who had this information, and that means that we have no choice but to hand the baton to the Millennials to Dinsey. This is going to be your community, your world, so who better to hear from then you specifically so I. Thank you know from the bottom of my heart. Congratulate you for your bravery, and in doing this you know, and for your sensitivity and compassion and even recognizing that there was a problem, because some people could have seen the exact same thing that you saw and not been moved, so to get more specific into some of the things that you were talking about. First of all, the white supremacy and I see Claire has made a comment about it. That I was going to make yeah the so Francis touched on the history of this country. Right officers and I have respect for officers. Actually some of you may know that I actually come from a military family on down to have they having been an army wife for over a decade, my children were largely raised without their father, because we sacrifice for the country. Okay, so I have nothing against officers. I want to be very clear about that, but the Turnham officers comes from overseers on the plantations, so this is from where not only the mindset but the systemic roots come and have and from where they've grown. And so, if we're going to be honest about what's happening, we have to go back to where it started. That's where and how it started, and so why did racism begin because of a supremest mentality, whether we like the sound of that word or not, the United States Constitution was written to state that some people were people and some people were not human at all. That's not been removed, it's just been amended to make a correction, but you can still read the Constitution. It is there 3/4 of a person not a whole human being, and so this is what we're having-. This is what we have to deal with. We may not like it. The truth can be ugly, it can be painful, it can be a turn- off. You know, depending upon everybody, has a right to their own perspective, but one thing that it is going to be for us all is the truth. Is the truth. It is my mother used to say, but the truth does not care who anyone tell you know who tells it. So that said, there are avenues that we can look into, maybe are not from our community, but I've. Seen some things in the larger community, for example, Yale is offering a free class. I do not know if it's already begun, if it's too late to get into, but with American history and specific-, as it relates to African Americans from the Emancipation Proclamation. To present. This is something that people can become educated, I. Think even black people should do it. You know I should do it or not. I do not consider myself a dummy, especially regard to this topic, but you know I can learn something we can. You know always learn something so it's available, but maybe there's some sort of education that we can provide out of the neighborhood and I. Think that speaks to some of the proposal that you were making yeah I had clarified earlier that, with regard to the arrests and everything, arrests had been made to my knowledge as well, but I did see the New York State District Attorney sign banks say that he was not going to prosecute any protesters. He refused to prosecute any protesters, so we applaud him for that. The governor, also in support of that which made me very happy, but then just to segue over to your discussion about the monument to me wanting to make a memorial to Mitch's point. I too had thought about. Maybe some sort of you know monuments, maybe a combination of what you guys both had in mind. I'm thinking things like I am Wall Street I served as the first slave auction. You know, I am the South Street Seaport I receive you know the people I think that we should have some sort of plaque or some educational information at all of these places. You know this whole area. Is we not just that little cube of the African burial ground, but this whole area is to wear black people were relegated and where we lived, you know until it was decided. We could not anymore here and what's now, Central Park, which was then Seneca Valley. What's something, but some people do not know either it was all erased so that we could have what we have today, a Park. So black people were murdered to create that Park and Displaced evicted to make to make that Park and so I think you know you extending out of our neighborhood up there. Every entrance of Central Park should say I people used to live here. You know, then, and give the history of that, because New Yorkers do not even know something about to Mariana, I'm, sorry and something about the Underground Railroad, like the movie, absolutely yeah, absolutely there's still homes that you can visit, particularly in Brooklyn that were along the railroad that are that have been. You know: monuments made into monuments that you can go and check out and find out what's going on, but yeah with regard to them. The Confederate million statues and things that you were talking about. I meant to make a point. So the governor supports maintaining Christopher Columbus. You know a lot can be said about that either way. I personally think there are a number of great Italian Americans and he was not one of them. You know that's my first opinion so I'm not sure. Why does not need to hold on to that but to reject others, but that's something that was going on in Mariana. I actually agree with you about that, but just to play Devil's advocate I could see how that could be like a contentious point. But when you're talking about the Confederacy, that's just like an enemy combatant, I agree: I come from a military family. Every man in every man in my family has fought somewhere or served in some sort of capacity. With the exception of my son, we stopped it there. After what we you know his father went through, we did not allow. We did not allow my son to tease people we're traitors, so this is another problem. People do not even know the history of the civil war. These people, like you, said we're enemy, combatants, insurrectionists. These were traitors. These were the losers, they won't leave their treasonous and what happened was they were given like a pardon after the Civil War, the say? Okay, we won't like further prosecute you, but that by no means should they have been celebrated, I mean that's, it's outrageous and you know Mariana could turning the flag stuff after World War, two Germany did not just say: okay with it's part of our history, they, but they ban Nazi flag, which was the I'm an enemy combatant, and it should be this. It should be this should, in my opinion, country in the world, where we celebrate the losers. We celebrate, we celebrate the people who you know many of us. Have you know ancestors not that look not that far back when we're talking about the civil war, eighteen, hundreds that were Union fighters. What are you saying to them? It just slap in the face so anyway reading something when you hear me: yes, I want people, because many people do not know that a lot of those thanked the Jim Crow South because of the they were afraid of losing power after the you're right, so we'll leave it at Tim Crowe. Yes, we so, basically there was 400, that's actually 2019 was the 400th anniversary of slavery. So at this point we are at four hundred sixty three years. I believe it is, if you include, you, know slavery and then the post, slavery, Jim, Crow era, 463 I, do not quote me on the number, but I'm pretty sure. That's it years of basically suffering and perpetuating this these mentalities, and that's how you end up with something that is systemic. You know it is it's not born overnight. It was not born overnight. Here it was bred and so again in order to remove it. We have to visit our past. Like you said, Germany did Germany. Did you know that they totally faced? You know then they're, basically domestic terrorists, history, you know, and they denounced it. You know, and they do not at all celebrating they do not give they do not give any of their citizens permission to celebrate it. You go to jail in Germany. If you attempt to celebrate Hitler or these things, you just can not do it there and we should have a family country where we celebrate our enemies. Yes, I'm sorry wanted to converse with questions and come back to you, okay, so what I wanted to say is what happened? Is that while I've been kind of in the middle of all this experience, I wrote a poem which is also a prayer which I shared on the in the chat and I? Think for me, this is a obvious I'm. Amazingly, for my boy view, I'm over 70 and I've lived a whole lifetime now, and this I think is a chance for this country and all of us to really make some very big changes and I actually can feel in a very real way that things were possible that have not been possible in my lifetime before and I have been in hundreds of demonstrations and kind of throwing my life at trying to make peace for many years but I, and for all of that it never felt hopeful, as it does now. So. I really think that what I would like to offer here is that all of us should really come together in some way that allows us to move our whole culture in our whole world for the best and to open everyone's heart in this and to find some kind of purpose that humanizes everyone and so I. Think when I was a kid. I was a teacher of the humanities and that question always is how to be a human being. And so our opportunity is to end, ask and answer the question: how to be a human being and for all of us to be the best human beings we can possibly be so that's my comment and I want to thank Katie Ann Taylor for the presentation, because I was really touched by the effort. So thank you so much I just took it down sorry about that. I forgot to hit them and again yeah, just very quickly, I think the girls did a great job. It was very interesting, very well presented Thank, You, Taylor and Katie. What was that about education and the lack of civics instruction and the last a history being taught? Realistically, those are things that need to be widely more widely spread. Do we go to the youth and Education Committee to a gunman mayor? Do we go to the Department of Education? How can we pressure? Can we, as a group work or, as concerned citizens pressure to bear on how our students are educated, I I know, did a lot of my family. History is very different from what my child learned in school and it was from us that he learned about immigration. I mean he learned what there was in school, but he learned about it from us, so I feel very strongly that Mariana's point I think it was Mary Amma who said that the education in this country is sorely lacking. I would feel very good about maybe having the girls make a similar presentation to youth and IDI, or indeed to the Education Department, but I. Think that really is the is the key to change education along with jobs, and you know your basic. You know care for other people. However, those things do not happen a lot, so education is something that does evolve and that perhaps we can impact and that should be brought up to the state, also Sarah, because unfortunates, that's, like I, think the New York stated Jeanette were under one umbrella. I know my dad was in the State Education Department 20 years, so fighting in the 70s I agree with what you said, though, all right so I do not see any more hands up. Anyone else wanted to ask the question and make a statement. Can I say it's not talking Katie. Thank you. I was just going to say thank you, everyone for listening and coming, and thank you to all the people on CB 1 for letting us present and coming today, and there are a few people who came just for this presentation: Gen Z Millennials their parents. So thank you to all of them and thank you to tail Claire back to Justine, Cuccia, Matthew Fenton, all for helping support and put this presentation together and thank you to Pat and Mary Emma- for supporting us. Thank you so much I know this is tale, clears comment in conversation with Marianas comment in conversation with I. Guess what I missed about there not to include white supremacy, I think is really well put. Is it possible for her to say that or comment? Well, let's let Claire maker comment it's clear: can we get clear on the line Claire yeah Claire Craig, that's Claire, Clark, Craig you're on the line, uh- huh. We can hear you hey sorry, I'm, yeah, I, think the comment kind of covers the point. I just kind of wanted to respond, because I saw in the chat that there was concern about the word white supremacy and what it means and I know that for most people, what comes to mind when you think when you hear the word white supremacy is like the KKK and like more violent individuals, but also that what that it is a person who genuinely believes that white people are superior and I just want to echo what black activists have been saying and also I noticed that there were some other people who are commenting as well like Maruyama and Pat mentioned in the comments too, and in there with their voices too, that it is referring not solely to violent individuals and a personal philosophy, but to a structural issue that goes to the foundation of the country. I do not want to sort of repeat what's been said, but yeah that was just there do not. You read your comment, clear sure. Okay, let me see what was I right right, so the history of the US was built on a culture of white supremacy, as Maruyama mentioned. It was well not mentioned explained that it was built by white slave owners who wrote into the law that white people were superior, and it's also not forget that these white slave owners writing these laws and creating the country were creating a structure on a land that was stolen through genocide. So it's a two- fold form of white supremacy. So, although we might want to think that this history is over, the foundations of our law of society and economics are formed on white supremacist ideology. I think I think that an example that is particularly relevant to our neighborhood is Wow. Sorry yeah that one can trace is the existing economic and housing disparities when it comes to race and some examples of that are for one. The fact that we have never paid reparations to descendents of people who are victimized by slavery in the U.S. redlining is a practice that is still, unfortunately, you know it's not as explicit now, but it's still in practice. That is one that affects housing, security, quality of life and access to education and social, climbing yeah. Absolutely redlining is the practice in which, so it's actually I think going with a more visual explanation helps because it was done visually, so they would take a map of the city and they really draw a red line around certain neighborhoods or down a street and say on this side on this side of the red line in the red area. This is where the black population will live, and only this sign of the red line. They will not live, and so it refers to the ghettoization of American cities and they took it further in terms of loans. Banks were given those maps to follow and really would know to whom you know to say yes and to him to say no when it came to a loan application thanks for not allow them to sell property to anyone who lived a good long to anyone who lived in the area that was actually outlined in red and also take it further. When there were white areas where people lived is brought home even if they wanted to sell their home to a black person, they were not allowed to sell their home to how they kept a particular area. Yes, Pat yeah I just want Claire, also to know- because this is you know- probably might not know this from that age when they built the Cross Bronx Expressway. The Cross Bronx Expressway had a similar effect in an analogous situation to redlining where it broke. It kind of split the Bronx into the hazard had mouths, and you know that was Robert Moses, but that was the effect of the Cross Bronx Expressway many years ago and hi. This is just add only that red line also believed to continue to exist in the form of exclusionary zoning which New York City. Everybody here, loosens comment. No, not quite sorry, so redlining also believed to still exist the form of exclusionary zoning that exists not only in New York City, but its surrounding towns and acrosss, the United States. So it's still actively used measure two to four one population to keep out another also a way to keep on. You could not have black ownership, and you hear this a lot now in conversation where one way to dope family wealth and generational wealth is by owning a home. You know, because you can, then, if you need to you, can either sell the home or you can live there and once the home is pay for, you do not have to pay rent. Oh, it causes a lot of area to, however, and how it affected black people. Alright, there's nothing. One else have a comment or a question: if everybody's done I'll just finish mine or no, if somebody else has to comment, it's fine, they I wait. Sure has her hand oh come on. Can anybody come right here me know you can hear you Tisha see you yes, I first want to say thank you also to Taylor and Katie and Claire what an amazing presentation it took a lot I have so much respect for you. I'm really excited to that you'll be working on this I hope to get my girls involved too there and finals. So their heads down right now, I wanted just to jump quickly and I had nothing left to add all the great comments on that. But I wanted to address something. Someone said about youth, an edge and addressing the history. Part of you know how we teach our kids about American history. We actually have an item. That's coming that I'm, adding to our agenda for July and I'm, going to read it to you really quickly. It's calling upon the Department of Education to create a teacher led Committee to thoroughly inclusively in transparently review its curriculum expectations, especially in social studies and English language art, to reflect the diversity of the student body from review, provide recommendations to implement a more honest and truthful retelling of our history and include literature. Beyond the Western canon and we're going to be exploring that topic and developing a resolution, we are going to be working in conjunction with other community boards, so it has more impact I want to just to let you know that, for all that would be interested in attending. For that conversation, I'm sure you might want to have a conversation. Also New York comes to me one of the most in terms of Education in school backwards, very segregated. You have areas where you have mostly all black students, and you have other areas where you have mostly white students and the schools are not equal, do not have a sensibilities, they do not have access to equipment. You might want to include that it's already that's been years in the making Pat, and we also already have a task force. The CEC is taking on that issue and they have a diversity task force. That's been working on this for the last couple of years. There I just attended I mean this is a quality- of- life meeting, but for all those interested in that report, I just attended that meeting and the results of their resolutions. I'm going to be announcing about some of the things that they're advocating for comment and then I think about okay, yes, so first two to Sarah and Trish's comments and points. First of all, they very well taken by me personally. I did want to mention. So you know: I have three children that I raised here in CB1 I was a longtime member of Trish's committee, education, I joined back when Paul, Hovis and Rebecca, who was an educator. The Department of State Ed were the chairs, so I joined as a public member. So it's a committee. That's you know very dear to me that I only you know left recently, because we were trying to focus on having only two committees, each as board members- and you know when I was invited and I'm asked to become the co- chair of quality of life I. Let go of youth and Ed, but it's still very dear to me. So two of my children went to 234 and the other one to 89, but at 234 in the 5th grade. I do not know if they still do this, but in the 5th grade at the time they had this project every year, where you had to basically tell your family's immigration story. My now 24 year old experienced it am I now 18 year old, experienced it, and it would make me very angry every time it would come up because I would say we're a black family. Ok I do not have an immigration story. My kids do not have an immigration story, my mother's half Cherokee. So we are native and african- american. We do not have an immigration story. A part of our family was brought here and part was already here, but that was that was them attempting to be sensitive to other cultures, right they're, trying to teach the kids something about other cultures and how we all arrived here in this melting pot, but even in doing something like that or I was so I'm. Coming from a really positive place, I'm sure it was exclusionary right because it's exclusionary to people who are native or and/or the descendant of slaves. We did not. We did not migrate here. We did not choose I, want to get to America and come acrosss Ellis Island, that's not how it worked, and so and I think that is something that's often forgotten as well. It's very important to me that we correct some of the curricula and just because we should just be teaching our children. The right thing right like a correct history, whatever. Why do we want to teach them falsehoods? It does not make any sense. Maryana I want to ask you a question because I actually like I agree with, could not did that been like, since they were basing it on the majority of people immigration stories. So when it came time for your family could not that have been a great time to have your story told to educate the others. I would always make my children do something that was based in our heritage, but that was not the assignment you know and when my kids respond, cause I'd, say well tell you teacher that we did not migrate here. You know and then the teachers respond positively tonight. I had to get angry every time, then that's the problem right there, not yeah I'm, told that Amy Kay from Teddy fiction has a comment. Okay. What I wanted to get to? Finally was my input on the resolutions, but I guess we can just start the conversation about the resolutions. After else is done and I'll jump back in then Betty, Amy, okay, Amy, sorry, I'm, very apologetic to Taylor and Katie Joe and Claire for missing their presentation. I really tried, but these meetings they never go on agenda when I hop in late I was actually wait, but I want to say to Marianas point. Thank you. Thank you for the education comment. Please I'm sitting here listening to Tricia, which I appreciate all the work she does and the fact that the girls and women brought this up because I'm a firm advocate for civics and history being taught and it has to be adapted and it has to be taught within the context of where we are now too much. In my opinion of the public school education is based on social justice, but they do not give the students context so the over political correctness and excuse the term I do not mean to offend that I think happened. Essentially, rais'd history of America students need to know you have to know how everyone in your class got here and some of its ugly. But you need to learn that to be a strong American who can raise their hand and fight injustice. The right way with the right information and by not educating our students I think it's a great disservice, so I totally I love the fact that mariana everything you're saying stick to history, stick to the facts and give the students the tools to learn from do not skip it, because it's uncomfortable to be an American is to be uncomfortable. In my opinion, and now more than ever, you need to give these kids the information so that they can say I had no idea that that's helped my black classmates, some of them got here and I did not know about the islands and the culture and the slavery that happened in other places where people came from and I did not know about the civil war, which is absolutely appalling. To me, as an American citizen, that my kids were not taught about the Civil War, but I come from the generation, I'm 55 I was not taught about Vietnam. History was way too recent and World War 2 was not even gone into in that degree, but we can't repeat that with these kids and that's also, please I'd love you for doing anything to correct the education, because I think when we educate our young people, we move even further Maruyama. Did you before we start the discussion on how we're going to move forward? Did you have one more point? Well, yes, I really want to cheer on the young. Ladies I almost called them girls in that girl's it wrong for a visiting, also the topic of intersectionality, because this is one that is overlooked as well and when it's not overlooked, people try to lump it together. So let me just say that to be LGBTQ, Ia is not necessarily to be black and it is not the same experience. However, we do have, of course, black people who are also LGBTQIA, and so there are not. Everyone has to know your sexuality or your gender when they meet you, people do tend to know unless you're able to what we call pass right, I'm putting air quotes you can't see, but we do tend to know, is what race you are right. Well, color what rate you appear to be at least right if you're brown, and so when we have any situations where gender or sexuality are also coming into play. We have people who are being victimized multiple times over and over and over again for the different boxes into which they fit, and I think that this is something that we that has not been visited, not only in this community but in general. You know in the city. I do not remember having a conversation similar to this, but I do remember having instances in this community things that came up for vote. I'll give you one example. There was about a year or two ago, some chance, transgender people beaten up in a restaurant Rebecca, the owner of that restaurant applied for a liquor license at some other location. I brought it up at the meeting that this is who these people were essentially, and you know there, of course, that you know there was some feedback from people who were like. Oh great, you know to bring that up, and there were some that are like it does not like impress upon the application to this day. I do not really see how it did not enforce upon the application. I think it goes definitely to character, and when and what kind of places we you know who we feel we can trust with a license and who we can but there's been issues basically is what I wanted to get to where LGBTQ issues have come up and I'm a straight woman, but I dressed them to the extent that I'm able but I, think that we need to do more. You know so I'm happy that that's been brought to the table and I'd love to be involved in any of you know the different things that you talked about. You know if you would have me the especially moving on, but with that sort of topic and the larger issues and educating people as to what's really going on I think we should spend the next 15 minutes talking about how we would like to go. We want to write as oh, we want to because things are changing by the minute. We want to approach borrow board so that we could end and approach our president and see if we could organize a town hold together, a convention of some sort for Manhattan, where we can talk and possibly put forth a resolution that comes from our entire borough and all someone give me how about the points that the young, the two young women, are like. Those four points how about if we just like, if everybody agrees that we just support that you know the points that they think we're done, I would second what Mitch said. I think we need to do something, and if everything you said yes, but I, do not think we should let a minute go by without having this board speak. So we need to sweetie to speak from this committee to bring it to the full board and especially that the least less controversial parts and what I'm looking at is controversial might be the memorial and Battery Park City everything that they said and at the memorial I just do not want a green nation. You know the word just Edward peaceful before the word protest is and then I think everything clicks in every box they brought up agreed yeah I mean that I would say, I agree with you and even then I like the idea rail I just would hold off on where we said to place. Peaceful is implied with protesters. I do not know that we actually need to useful I agree with Mitch cuz people are going to push back and say well the looters that are Datsuk. No, maybe we have to I think nothing can be looters these people that are leaders. Why would the word peaceful be controversial? I mean it does bring up a question potentially because people look for loopholes all the time you know like what is what is peaceful mean that maybe it has different meanings and different people similar to like affordable housing, affordable to you know, peaceful by homes, by whose standards I do not know I do not know. Maybe nonviolent protesters is a better way to go Maryana that no problem, I'm cool with all of that just you know so that we just the two groups, can comment. I'm sorry I do not know if it's out of turn for me to speak just in reference to this I know that I know that the way that people code- something that comes up a lot and regardless of my own opinions, I mean personally I- would like everybody to be released, but the question that I have that, regardless of how we personally feel about how people should protest or how we choose to respond to the way people choose to protest is a is not Covid-19 affect the way that we choose determine who gets released from jail, because even before the protest began, there was a pretty strong movement to try to release as many people as possible from jails to their peaceful work, even if they were looters I. Think still, you know. That's covetous definitely does change. That's correct now. Those people, however, were people who had been convicted and were serving sentences, so it came up and whatever you know, any given jurisdiction for their governance to decide whom they were going to free and they were letting people out who were determined to be nonviolent criminals. Those were who were released in this case because the Dutchess attorney has pledged not to prosecute. We should be looking to people. The people that we're talking about should be people who have not yet been arraigned, because when they, when you go to arraignment, is when the DA charges you officially and the judge accepts or denies those charges and you're easier, either prosecuted at that point or you're dismissed right there by the judge, so we're looking to people who have been arrested, but not yet processed. In my mind, I'm three and a lot of these things are no bail. I mean now with the new reforms, then the law changed protesting. They get arrested because they've resisted arrest, they've just stopped at the peace, whatever all that would all be no bail. So why, in God's name and even being taken in the time of Covid-19 right now, the problem potentially is with sometimes these delayed arraignments. So speaking of black people, men, whatever how you want to classify it, who've been murdered in this city right. We have a young man that spent a year over a year on Rikers Island awaiting arraignment. For a crime he had never committed over a stolen backpack that he did not steal and he killed himself because they put him in solitary confinement for like a year so over. So if people are going, people are going to be processed dually as they're supposed to right, as the law says that they're supposed to then they should not be there that long, but there is a potential for it to happen, and it has happened right here in New, York City on Rikers Island I just want to, and so what is this? Do? You want to just leave the word protesters to the rest of the committee, or do you want to put any type of adjective before that? So let's have some want some other people chime in leave it just as protesters write. What y' all say do like do a quick vote and then we, you know, do a quick, raise your hand or say something: I want to say that if there is anyone who objects to leaving it as protesters, you got. Please have no one speak up, just leave it as protesters. Okay, Danny, Ham, right I still. Would like to know so what we're saying or what we're proposing is that we take presentation, Taylor and Katie and Claire put together, and we just turn it into a resolution. Missing include number one: Lucien I think you're I, like the idea of giving a condolences. You know how we put it in words that make sense to us and we support black lives matter. I'm good with everything said here. We supports the police we have to put in support black lives matter. It's in here just say: we need stand alone, it has to okay, I, understand and then keep going with all yeah. Okay. The problem is that everyone I can't you can't all tied at the same time, because I'm not understanding where we're going. So what I said is: are we taking the presentation and turning it into a reso, except we want to take out the part about the memorial which was suggested by Justine and then I heard Francis say we want to we want to put in? Oh, it is in there that we support black lives matter, so in here all right, so I'm not understanding what the objection is. The only part we have the part about the memorial well I do not understand what would it be? Why are we making out? Can we go to the memorial, the second page, Lucien who's controlling it? My notes and I took these from. The presentation, though, share for me. I just put two the two resolutions that they proposed I did not copy over the so I can give me a minute and I can get that over here-. Thank you, Lucius I was going to ask also if it's required to be in resolution format the two things that we did not stay as like resolutions. If they need to also be stated in resolutions, then yeah we stand with the two meetings were the memorials and then starting a committee specifically talking about race and justice. I support it I do not make that a resolution with that have to continue the conversation. I do not know what form it will take like I said it could be the entire borough of Manhattan. It could just be CB1. I know that he ate was interested I. Think CBM had a resolution that they have worked on already. I guess my Smike changed to number three would be provide space for a memorial in CB1, with the names of one block, unnamed black Americans and just take out Battery Park City. Unless some people do not agree with me just make it broader does not mean it won't, be Battery Park City, but it's a Brooke I'm fine with that. But then again I prefer that if we had something some sort of not memorial whatever you want to call it at each of these locations where they would be yeah, maybe put it in there to say, is not there a memorial, a some sort of a cook we've at a screen street fairs and signing signage or something so maybe we can maybe just say we provide space for memorial within Community, Board, District 1 as fleshed out by that task force. Until we can have that conversation, they are versus here, because we need more people to talk about it. Right smells and everyone clearly Mm-, hmm, yes, you know how up and down the Broadway they have in the sidewalk little on pavement under yeah, exactly yes, notation who did what, when we approached the city about putting I love Mary on this idea that you know this was a slave market, and this was these were homes that no house, the Underground Railroad and all of the notations. Why do not we approach the city of that actually coming up with some way of doing that? Okay, I'm, going to really throw something in here? Why do not we approach Howard Hughes and tell them to put something over in the Seaport where the slave quarters were? It definitely belongs over there-, historical plaques, Katie and Taylor and Clare say yes, thank you. Sarah's raising her hand does the historical plaques and the there's an underground railroad, stop on the corner of unless Bernard and Strait were the coffee places that building is one even if it's an extension of that existing program. There's no reason it can't happen because of the very same type of plaque appeared in many places like the first Thomas's English muffin, bakery about starting a program where they actually put plaques and notation historical notations of what occurred in this location. Now. Do we put in do we include that in this reso or is that a separate asks that we send out a letter and possibly again I think that we need to use our boroughs president, who is extremely helpful in many cases and I'm sure that if we presented this to her, she would be equally interested in pursuing it. I think that's a good idea. The City Council has, though, has a Black Caucus. Also we may want to talk to I. Think that's a good idea. I have a recommendation for consideration. There's a number of items here that are very time-: sensitive, such as these perform and legislation executive orders, as well as the budget conversation that's going on that will fundamentally could the could or has the potential to fundamentally change NYPD, depending on what compromise is drawn out between the mayor and City Council. So those are things that you definitely I would recommend putting forth resolution this month, a resolution to stand with the protesters like I've matter, to advocate for the humane treatment of protesters, people who were expressing their freedom of speech, that's definitely timely and the third the memorials. That's something that I think the committee can put more thought into think about form what programs exist and really put forth something that is a little bit more pages. So we can we put that back on for next month, Lucien by putting them so keeping this. In with this thing it does not does it does not preclude us from then doing something more specific after that, does it no because I think you ones you'll keep the momentum going by every month revisiting the subject, instead of you know, kind of getting it all out and then not having anything else to talk about here, but also there's some other committees that you might want to work with on this okay I. Just ladies had such nice, things like to include everything they did in one lump sum for like for the work that they put in I just thought it might be a nice thing. You know, there's already been an enormous amount of work on monuments, and so I'd like to get a little bit background. So I think you guys could really be more surgical about how to approach that, because the borough president had a monuments, experts, convened and I think it'd be good to know what the pipeline looks like and then say like. This is how it should be supplemented, and this is what it does not look at, and you know I think there's a way to really have them understand. Look thank you. I understand, I! Do again what, if anyone disagrees with that without taking off the third items and holding it next month doing it separately pick up now, I took off mine because I do not disagree with this. I was waiting to you were done with this item. I just wanted to draw everybody's attention to the fact that Cora shared all the information for the correct name is actually the black Latino and Asian or BL a caucus of the City Council, which consists of 26 of the 51 total members of the City Council she's listed some phone numbers, the chairs of that committee. It looks like, and the email address to reach tonight, everyone, no one has objected to moving number three next month, agree to the to the you know: the caucus of the City Council did not. Even we can speak to the growth president. We can get some other. You know some advice from other people on how we might proceed and again, I still think. It's very important to include other community boards. I do not think we can address next month is Mitch's proposal that street names as changes in street names. We might want to reach out once again I said to these unity boards and see if they work with us and we have, we might have streets around in Manhattan, I'm, not sure Pat I just sent you the I sent you the email with that information in Fort Hamilton Brooklyn. Thank you right now. What's on the table, is that we're going to turn point one into a reso? Anyone object to that. Does everyone understand what we're turning into a reso? If anyone objects each now, I see Taylor. Do you Taylor? You have your hand up yes, I'm a hand up before, because I just wanted to ask how we could start a working group that maybe could turn into a committee to continue this conversation or would that happen in this committee? That was my hand raised, but I do not think that, like we said next month, we would like to continue this conversation and take some action on your point. Number three I think tomorrow night we have the executive committee meeting and you might want to attend that and I. You know. I definitely am going to introduce your topic tomorrow. At the executive committee meeting- and you might want to be there to say a few words and possibly ask that question there right now, I would I would just say that it sounds like this committee is already doing the work I mean it sounds like this is the committee. She was talking about a subcommittee to specifically focus on the racial and intersectional issues. Somebody does not really do that. We have other topics that all the ways with all that we do. You know not to diminish anything. We do not really focus, not been a focus specifically on Internet, intersectionality or LGBTQ issues period and that I've witnessed in my time on the board. Yes, like I, said we could either decide that that's something we want to take up and have our own form a task force to pursue that topic. But again we can discuss this tomorrow night of the executive committee and get some input from some other members of the force right now. Can we just wish this reso and Taylor I do not need any we're going to pursue it. We will and we're going to keep you involved. You and your sister and your cousin involved all right. So no one is objective to us taking points one and two and turning them into a reso. Does everyone see what they are? Anyone saying? No, so I think everyone sees what they are. So we do this. Shall we have a vote that we want to go forward with. This is a reso or if anyone objects with being a reso speak now, no one object. We're going to turn it into a vessel for my committee. Okay, we're doing it. I do not see any objections. I do not hear any objection, so it is becoming a resolution and then next month we will go forward with the discussion about Memorials street names and anything between now and then that we can come up with we'll. Also discuss gamble, discuss this at tomorrow's on executive committee and Mariana. We might want to talk about running a task force in quality of life, all right yeah. That sounds great with that for the names the names is that what you just said, Lucien have a question before, on gender number, five has state of policing in New, York, City, discussion and possible resolution. That should that's included in this, so that it's not a separate one right so we're including that topic from the agenda in this resolution. So we do not need to have another resolution and then next we might want again every day every minute. Something else is that what is that relation? That's happening? You know the city level, the state level, the federal level so I think next month, we'll still have a huge topic to discuss specific to policing right, okay, so yeah, because this is this- is a little light on the state of policing. This particular resolution there's no critiques, there's no specific critiques on observed police tactics or policies, I think we would need to either need to have a discussion about that and make it a separate resolution and take it up in July, okay, because I think what we should. What we have here is good, it's good, it's generally Emily but I, think or to it, because at the end of the day, what I think that the girls will get into but I think at least for me, it's important part of the deal is, as the new laws are put into place and take effect. How do they work? What does it mean? You know they're disbanding some anti- something chair, anti- crime in tech, crime task force. How does this all work? We want them to take some money from the police force and put it to social programs. All of these things are things that we I'm, hoping this new working group or whatever it's going to be, is going to work on to come up with so I think it's going to be resolution, a resolution at the resolutions, it's going to happen over the next year and get some leadership with you, because it's way bigger than just community board one is it? Would it be? Okay, if this part three of 0.3 of part, one we're talking about police reform legislation- because this is kind of this- is a bit bumpy and specifically that New York state, passed old, ten bills and I believe the governor signed all ten men. Why see has burr of bills under consideration? The federal government is actually politically right. Now it's going to look to be politically deadlocked with a Republican. You know the Republican held Senate having a vastly different, so it could be. You could say that support of police reform at all levels of government and just because you're kind of leaving it vague, and then you can be more specific next month when you look at these tactics under a microscope, sounded that because I like I'd like us at some point, if the Senate does not, you know make a change on their own to call upon the Senate I mean we have representatives of the Senate here to call upon the Senate to pass. The house is Bill agreed again, it's a quarter to nine. We have to move on and Claire again it was fabulous. Thank you for starting or continuing to the station fabulous I do not feel nervous every day. Sam. You said every time you do the presentation you'll get a little more comfortable and if you'd like to all night, you have the executive committee meeting and you might just want to tune in, and you know, depending on how the meeting is going, I may ask they awarded two okay. Yes, thank you guys so much appreciate you all. They sure you'll be here next month as we continue the topic I'm confident we'll be here will be here. Thank you guys that I got the votes IDO. If you want me to call the roll on this well, what I actually had said is the no one objects, but if you want to call, if you have to do it formally, then okay, all the roles that yes, oh yes, it was with regard to Kovac right, not with regard to the police. If I read it right, yeah I think I can speak for myself. The issue specifically about it. It's really all chemical irritants is that one they are very abusive to the person. I mean they really hurt and I do not think they're, fair and that's realm, but they also cause people to put hands up to their faces and their eyes, which is the worst place to put your hands unless they're clean at a time like Ovid, but also if they think that the vehicle of the gas itself is something that the particles can carry on making those who inhale it more likely to pick up ambient Covid-19 particles. So it's on many levels. Yes, the peak. They know that in the air it will adhere much as they found it does to exhaust from engines to pollution. Those studies same thing with gas particles that are out there as an aerosol any other colvett particles in the air will adhere to it and be more likely to carry along with it. What would be used? I'll certainly help Lucien later with the Finer points, but I think really they should banned the use of chemical irritants, actually not only against protests, but it's protesters and all other people, especially at this time of Covid-19, where it's an especially large risk I think, particularly because they claim not to use any yeah AG bar claimed that they had not even used any. Although it's come out that they have finally a minute, it's okay, if you're saying you did not use anything, why should you have a problem with us banning them? So let's go ahead and do it. Benny can I agree with you, a hundred percent I'm just like do you have an answer for like then? What would what would be a substituent on lethal substitute because we do not want them using batons or actually what there are other more deadly weapons. So what would be like an alternative and like I said I agree with you in principle, but I'm just you know: I do not want this more deadly force, they've really ratcheted down the force they're. Finding no problems for the protesters, so it's being used inappropriately anyway and I agree with you. I just do not want them to have an excuse to say. Well, we do not have this, so we got ta use a baton. You know, that's I, think if we have to suggest the replacement. Why would not we suggest what he claimed to have been using that he said was not a chemical every irritant, even though he lied, though yeah he claimed he was using. Is a cop chemical irritant, cuz I think that there's like I was reading something and then Claire was with me in the chat, but I was thinking that every there's two gaps and then there's something: that's not called tear gas, but it makes your tear I, think they're, all chemical irritants and they're all. Why do not? We include tear gas with the pepper spray in these resolution. Also, that is exactly what a chemical irritant is. It also includes mace, okay, it's a sweeping term. That includes all those things and it's well known, they're, all chemical irritants, okay, trying to make people reach for their eyes and COFF, because that will make them physically pause. It's not what they're doing and also wrote which I think I grew it it's tear gas is not allowed as a weapon in war. It's a correct! So it's ridiculous! Yes, it's not allowed in war, but its moist yeah. It's totally any Street all right. Okay, I'm good with that. I agree with that I'm good with that Betty, so Betty I think we should include that in the reso that, if it's not included, if it's not allowed as the weapon of war, why is it allowed to be used by any police force in the United States citizens agree? It certainly should not be used on a civilian population of peaceful protesters, 100 percent, sure, okay, 100, yes, I mean the point resolution I know you said: you'll work with Lucien about it. Oh yes, no problem! Okay, great! Thank you! So again. If anyone objects to this resolution, please speak now. Okay, listen! Do we need to take a roll call, we all agree, I know I'm, sorry, I'm, sorry, I, think he's typing I see him typing notes. Okay, thank you. Just for completeness sake, I'd like to call the roll okay Pat, yes, Markham Russo Tom Burton fern Cunningham, Mimi Flynn. Yes, thank you. Yeah, yes raises your yes and the other vote it as well right. Yes, okay, Mitch, Froman, yes, okay, yes, Kettering, Roberts neck, yes down to public members, job good time; yes, Einstein, freaky Church by the way. What is that here? Okay, thank you. This passes as well great, thank you and then you and Betty will work on the language and again it does not happen because I think it's. It can be right to the point. Well, so we have this thing's decided so I think that yeah there's one thing, and that is not a resolution, but just to get your comments together for tomorrow's meeting on the open, dining on the sidewalk they've already started by me, like one of the items that came before licensing impairments that we actually denied at 77, Fulton Street four test, a Wall, Street they've started I. Guess under this new opportunity to build yes to build tables, go outside and they built about 15 tables there that it looks that they're tall so looks like they're going to put stools by them. People will sit your stools today. Oh yeah I'm, jumping the gun on Gold Street, there's very little of mass, quick and very little social distancing and the ones that I've seen so far. But it's an exact location that they brought before licensing and permits that we denied they were supposed to go back and speak to John Prada, because he was one of the people who was supporting it kind of work with one eye, though, to go back to the drawing board, I thought that people were only allowed to use space outside their establishment if they had it before. Otherwise, they were using parking, lots and others. It may have jumped the gun, but they built a bunch of tables today because they were not approved they would. They do not have any kind of approval. Oh anyway, I mean I, everyone had it denial, they had an official denial from our committee. Not I brought this up with Susan. We knew we were going to have this problem, or did you have something you wanted to share with us before we have the discussion? Oh, the only thing I can share. Is that Thingy? There is this idea of using the public right- of- way for extended dining area, because in phase two, whenever we do get to phase two, which is yet unclear, restaurants will allow to have CID and dining, but only at 50% capacity. So the idea is to have the balance of the capacity made up by potentially allowing dining either on the sidewalk that the sidewalk is Lyde wide enough or within the curb Lane. So because this is a conversation that goes acrosss many different committees, we are having all the committee's discuss this and the implications, so he had transportation discuss at the small business. Working group discuss it and, of course, quality of life committee should also discuss certain pitfalls. That may come up it, and all these discussions will lead to a resolution that comes out of executive tomorrow. That way, not any committee is left out of having the opportunity to talk about this okay, so my first comment would be. Hopefully it would be in terms of comment from all the community boards as a borough, wide resolution that all the people seeking to do that have to get clearance or soar check in with the community board, because we're the ones that know our areas and if somebody is going to stretch out and do something outrageous, we you know we're the ones that can monitor it. I think that's the problems that I think the mayor is kind of the mayor is not it kind of initiative and they're not necessarily going to check yes, absolutely that it should be something that the mayor is, but the mayor has been very cagey with details, he's been very late in terms of giving Us timelines for when he thinks that we'll move into phase 2 or what will happen at phase 2. So it's very much still. It seems like it's on there drawing table because it does not feel fully baked on their end. I just want to point out that Cora is noting in the chat that there are several agencies who are involved in permitting the outdoor dining applications and community boards are not included on that list. So I do not know if they got permission or not, but on Gold Street today I saw several tables having been built where the licensing and permits Committee had said they could not be that we were not allowing a sidewalk cafe for that restaurant, so I think we should take that just use the number, but before anything else, I wanted to say Lucia. Are these restaurants going to be treated as outdoor cafes, so they're going to have the same limitations and are we going to be able to discuss the hours? Are we going to be able I know? You know they can't have that many tables because they have to pack the social thing clear any and what we've seen in other cities and the best I can do is tell you what other cities have done, because I can only assume that the administration is doing the same thing, and that is there are some restaurants that whatever guidelines are given have done, some dining on tables. Some cities have shut down entire streets, so kind of like Mulberry, Street and Little Italy during the warmer months with those streets that's treated shut down for dining in the street. The other idea is to have something that's akin to street seats, but allowing the restaurant to serve directly from the street sees the current street scene program does not allow or a restaurant to I believe have cable service. It has to kind of act at like public seating, that's agnostic, to the restaurant, but it can be essentially a you know, adjacent to the restaurant on the street, so that could be another, so converting the curb Lane in some way to additional dining space and an Lucien, oh, my god, Gold Street, kerb, Betty and Cora have shared comments in the chat and with regard to this that just to point it out to everybody, I see. So if we can include the word temporary and whatever resolution, we do that I think that'll be a good coordination, so that and seller I'm, just getting from it core. A mini core can explain it. But it's not that they're getting permission. You know to set up the temporary outdoor dining program and it bypasses the community boards I'm just I'm sure all of us just wanting to be able to circle back after all of this is done and be able to actually permit or not whoever in the restaurants wanting a sidewalk cafe. This should not send me into permanent sidewalk cafes looks like expires in October yeah Betty says it expired, a language in it just to be extra, you know, detail- oriented I can talk, I am Alive. How can I help this? What I know? This is what the OT DCA Department of Consumer Affairs and workers protection. Actually, that is a new name, DC WP, no longer DCA, but I was just picking the shortcut and also Department of Health Small Business Services. They are all working on those details. Trying to finalize a plan. Our office got lots of phone course they are. As can I put. The chairs can I use this table. Can I use the sidewalk I've been chasing down agencies looking for announcers I. Try to ask how about places that are restricted like do not even think about it, which you know do you have already have those information? So then we do not have to waste time trying to think that maybe City Hall Park can work. No, they do not have. They do not have that kind of information either they are working finalizing the details, so we have to wait and to be a little patience. So the question that you just asked like what does that mean? Is self-? Certify I do not have the answer. That is a good question, but that is only a recap of what they're trying to do, because there are multiple agencies involved, so we do need to give them some time. They also at the same time, has to hurry up. Councilmember Chien has been advocating to SBS. The process has to be simple. The process of registering getting the information letting them doing is set up. It has to be simple for the restaurant owners. It has to be simple for the small business owners, so that's she's been advocating for and Cora I think I think that really what you just said lends itself to the idea of self certification, self Certify and the planning world, specifically at Department of Buildings, indicates that someone who's filed an application is saying that it is. It complies with the code, so they are saying that and an examiner does not have to go through necessarily and cross- check it with the code. So self certification is as akin to a promise that this does adhere to all the guidelines and restrictions way of expediting the package, so they do not have to wait for its turn in the queue to be given that green light, for whatever is dead, they have to take I think the temporary term is going to for them right now. They're thinking about September, but still everything is still talking, but there is September. What I think that we are hearing is that simply the community boards are not going to be involved in this process. Can I speak, stop well, they're, two different things, though open streets is one program. This outdoor dining program is a different program, although kind of they are related when you have to open Street, because there's some own restaurant owners asking well the street is already closed. Can I do this, but this is not just something you just put the chairs and tables out there that Department of Health involved as well so Pat I'm, not sure. If I understand your question correctly, because if you're talking about Oakland trees, community board is involved and everyone actually can go to the D- O- T website and submit a suggestion. Does it have to go right so about you know closes it's a walk, I'm talking about the restaurants moving outside and it sounds as though the community board and then Betty will get you in a minute, but it sounds as though the community board is not going to be really involved in that process. The city is going to must run South certified, registered self-. Certify. So tell me more if come reach bodies involved. Are you saying it's like the licensing, the liquor licensing and permission of process that they have to go through the committee board? Can I please speak with that I can answer a lot of this question, delay the process or hold on, because Betty says she has an answer to this transportation committee. This is what happened this month at the committee. Kimberly rancour, who is in the commission of Manhattan commissioner. Do Teas office will be in charge to be in charge of the program she's speaking tomorrow, at weight of little programs, me of which program Betty the outdoor dining program or yes, I'm not talking about cafe dining, because that's run as it always has been by a different group and licensing handles the D- O- T is involved as the mayor pulled that in with the mayor's program and said, use the open streets program that he's already. The mayor had already called for expanded the open the street seats at the borough president wanted, and that was expanded. Again, that's D- O- T permission. It's all about right- of- way space, so the D- O- T is really the driver in this because they grant space. There will be no other permissions from other agencies. It will be the D- O- T. They came to us transportation because they wanted to know the community boards input and it's going to be discussed tomorrow, an executive committee. What came up from that and here because they want guidance on what's the community board wants? They have done this from other community boards as well through their transportation committees. They do not have the time is there feeling when they get individual applications, they have to act on them and act on them quickly. There? The mayor has asked there be no process like typical, which takes up to a year to get through the D- O- T will be acting on applications as they come through. They want guidance, that's exactly tomorrow. What they're, putting together from all the committees to put forward the final advice document. That's going to go to do T so tomorrow. Okay, so to be clear, it sounds like what you just described does not apply to the restaurant on the corner of gold and Fulton, because that's not in the middle of the street. It's not an open or closed street. It is South Bridge, Towers property, technically leading up and up into a part of the sidewalk I'm, not sure exactly where the, where the border is where the city picks up the rest of the sidewalk and it's city property, and that is where they were wanting to put and where they have put their outdoor seating, and that is where licensing and Perm said no. You may not, and rather than give them an outright like we're, not a rejection resolution. We sent it back to John Frieda the Southbridge towers, Board president to see what else he could work out with them, and then you know they could have come back, but what their application has put forth to us right before Kovac. You know the pandemic and the closure of the board, and you know, offices and agencies all over the country. We had sent that message back and then we did not meet again. That's happens like it falls under what Cora was describing and that maybe they've gotten some sort of permission from a one or more city agencies, or maybe not you know they may have dumped the gun and done this thing on their own know all these D- O- T and they call it sister. Agencies are working to finalize the details. If there's a restaurant, that's already put up tables which there is on the corner of Fulton and gold, then they would have done so of their own accord and not with permission of an agencies that correctly, yes, I, think there are many community members seeing many other restaurants. Many other places around town, not just Patton, but the whole New York City is doing that smells like bull poopoo for Cassidy I'll. Send you some pictures. Lucian D-, O- T is going online on Friday for starting the application process yeah, because all it is supposed to be in Phase two and we're not even out of phase one. Yet that's going to help and they predict in about a week. Twenty-. Second right is the beginning of phase ooh they're planning to have this program to be implemented during phase two. Today's a few more days, if we all work hard to just make sure we do not mess up the numbers, hospitalized listen, why are we having you went out packed? Yes, we can. The community boards are not going to be part of the process right. Oh, this is the beginning of the month we went from knowing zero. It was just an idea to now. At the end of the month, there seems to be some sort of plan coming together, but with I mean not to not to paint the entire administration with this one brush, but up in the hallmark for plans coming together quickly, Oh a lot of guidance, so in typical fashion, especially during the pandemic, it seems like a lot of the details, are still to being decided upon and even with this I think, there's always the possibility that, even when they say it's finalized that there's still opportunity for changes to the program, because this is not going in the legislation. That's for this looks like it's going to be an executive program and the other part of it is that they may not be ready when they say they're ready, so I think that we still even be able to be able to have a resolution in before this is officially rolled out. So I think that there no matter what resolution from cv1 will be worthwhile just give us some guidelines, so I do not know I'm still, not quite sure, I understand what how we can impact the process. I, do not why we identifying Street we're talking about us just from a quality of life perspective. What are some pitfalls that could be avoided if they were to craft this program correctly? So, for example, you know Frances said the community board should be including the approval and an oversight and I think that you know you can either dig into what oversight looks like. How can we report bad actors, improper installations, where social distancing is there? You know not being it's not the point of maybe certain restaurants, installation at restaurants that are invading public space if they are to maintain a certain amount of sidewalk and they're. Not doing so, we have to have a clear idea of who is we're taking this to. Is there as one agency that's going to be the one this or do we have to kind of vulcanize every kind of comment to every single other agency, so I think that you know we can. We can certainly speak to you know what it would. It would a perfect version of a small business saving policy be but within reason, given what you know as a quality of life committee. One issue that always comes up is when you have outdoor cafes, it's limiting the hours and because there are actually residents that live above it and they can't. You know we do not want noise all hours of the night so that they can enjoy their home and that's reason why he was denied so I think. The most important point would be that it should be. You know again, we've said this over and over at transportation and a licensing that any of these things should be temporary. In no way should it be implicit that a restaurant is going to have any opportunity to just continue without public engagement and comment. The way any other permit would be issued under normal. You know circumstances and times to put it to kind of take what you said: Pat the hours being really important. The licensing committee painstakingly negotiates hours for sidewalk cafes every time if they were to as a rule roll out hours that are much more permissive than then what the good you know, good actors are adhering to. You know they've, essentially taken all the work, the community board, throwing it out the window. So one thing could be it's like you like you're, saying the hours are an issue. We say the hours should resemble that all their neighbors have sidewalk cafe wise, because the community board one's very deliberate in the hours that they allow green but I think also in stressing the temporary Ness of it but III. You know I think that people are open to maybe a little bit of leeway for their business neighbors and so like. Okay, I prefer not to hear noise under my window, but for a couple months. I can tolerate it because I do not want my neighboring. You know businesses, small businesses to survive and to bounce back, but if it has to be clear that it's a temporary thing that you know that made you just be my personal feeling, but I think that people would be more open to relaxing some of the rules as the governance as the government has been. You know at all levels to relaxing some of the rules in this regard, but certainly not to make it permanent and never to take away the public's opportunity to weigh in on what it is they want. You know beyond the community board itself. At the same time, most people are home, and so, even though I you know, I fully agree that somehow businesses have to open again a lot. Most people are at home, basically 24/7, because they are not going into there offices and, if they're going to be impacted even more than they would normally be by the noise potentially come I'm an outdoor world question I mean it's just one thing to take into consideration. You might be right point well-, taken. Why well taken to that point. I think what people are having a lot of trouble with. Is these fireworks, though we did not, you know, come under any committee, but it's four thousand five illegal fireworks sales are up four thousand percent according to the governor and like in everywhere we're hearing them all the time. So I do not know another. Seventeen, nine, eighteen and I had to call my 92 year old mother, but she goes to bed so again. Does anyone else have anything we're going to have this discussion tomorrow and executive committee? Oh I'm welcome to tune in and there anyone have anything else that we would like to that. As a committee to the executive committee for discussion about this topic, any time limiting them being, they can not be permanent structures. I think they have permanent like me to be an outdoor cafe after the time period is over. Anyone have anything else. They would like to add. Okay, nothing all right, I! Think you exhausted Texas topic only thing I are good great. Thank you. The only thing I have to say to the committee, if you have first of all, you know, we've discussed is that next month we're going to go forward with the discussion about the monuments and names and possibly getting community boards, all the communities which Manhattan involved with some sort of town hall other. If you have any other topics that you want to bring to quality of life, as they always say this, you know you are the committee members I mean you might want to put fireworks on for next month. I do not know. Perhaps we're added in the chat, a request to ask NYPD to wear masks. We may want to okay, consider yeah I. Would yeah I think it's a good thing to add to that's an iota next, the next month, all right, I think we're done everyone. Thank you for your participation, bye. Everyone! Sorry! Thank you so much bye, whew, just I, do not know lovely girls. My lovely girls was starving to them because I really needed to be heard and I appreciate it. Cuz no cool they were. It was excellent, very good, I'm, so glad Francis.
