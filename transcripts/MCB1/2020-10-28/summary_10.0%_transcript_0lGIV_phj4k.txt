The first thing that we actually have on our agenda tonight is the Community Board one capital and budget expense requests for year.
It seems like announced New, York, City's, Human rights watch provided bias, trainings on various topics like LGBTQIA plus rights, and I heard they were really positive, but they were only live and then recordings were I'm, not available, and so I was wondering if maybe a budget request could be funding and access for more of these and maybe updated annually, so that once a training is provided to community board members, the recording then be posted to all community board sites so that both the public and members can late access at a date that works better for them, Because I know, timing was an issue for many people But then the community could also have access to them since they're, very valuable-Looking through the sign in sheet , I, do not see anybody else who is looking to speak specifically on our budget.
The, only place, but the snow is in the crosswalk, so I think we need to think that through and while it's important to save our restaurants, to the extent that we can perhaps automatic permanency is the giving up of public space without a euler without an eis without a large discussion is a problem.
She spoke on the need for community engagement and open lines of communication which were missing throughout this process and we'll continue to push for clarity and full transparency from our city agencies, as well as other related parties, and for an update about the 70 mulberry community meetings.
Hello, everyone from council member chain's office, a few highlights for you and the most important one is to continue to assist the tenants at 225 rectal place to help them to stay until the pandemic is over or as long as they can, and they are also participating in tonight's meeting as well.
I'm, going to wrap up on composting that our community needs very much after fighting to restore funding throughout the City Council membership partnered with the earth matter, New York to celebrate their newest community composing drop-Off at the bowling green market.
If you can unmute Anne Stetson, who is in the public, area, hello, Anne, I know, Justine is going to be introducing a resolution supporting our tenancy and until the until covered, the Kobe risk is over and Cora from Council member Chin's office just made a reference to it as well.
I hope that you will support the resolution and I want to thank you for the time that you've given us in previous meetings and having an opportunity to speak before the board.
You want to use the rest of my time to be brief and touch upon a few things that were on the agenda in front of the community board.
And lastly, I want to thank the Community board for all their work this month on bringing the community together for a really productive and constructive conversation about homelessness in the area.
We've got a large group of people here on a very on the topic of South Street seaport and a variety of things I'm going to save them for one large block and try and get everyone else, who's going on different topics.
I do not know, but I, suggest, or I postulate that I should be, because the police, much like the military, are supposed to protect all new yorkers, not one side or the other, and personally I would feel much better.
, I'm, very aware of all these issues and we'd be working with the community Board, the council, member and the city.
I think many members of Community Board one know as well as I do about some of the remote learning and blended learning.
I just want to finally just state that you know that the Community board applications believe it or not, are going to be released next month , we've given out grants for cultural tourism, just a regular expense, and, of course, I think.
I am in support of the resolution for the creation of new receiving sites for the seaport development.
What I, want to bring up to the community board, is a different use for the 250 Water street property that will bring a larger benefit to the sea.
It may not be possible, but it is my thought to propose that the best use in terms of benefit to the community is that the 250 Water street property on the upland border of the area which flooded during Hurricane Sandy, is large enough and well situated enough to serve as an on, land, resiliency infrastructure, most of the blocks up through the napoleon built.
Is it time for the city to consider eminent domain or some other purchase in services providing the whole neighborhood with storm water control through above and below ground flood mitigation infrastructure, while a green space roof structure could provide open space amenities to the community.
Is, their community board interest in public sources of support for a resiliency pockets for Water Street?
Originally air rights in the South Street seaport Historic district were to be sold outside of the district in order to support projects within the district.
I speak in support of the revolution, resolution, perhaps a small revolution indeed to make those air rights transferable, to projects outside of the seaport, historic district.
I should speak in support of the revolut resolution to make those air rights transferable outside of the district.
Okay, I'll skip a lot of the other stuff that I said during the other meeting, but we're proposing this subcommittee to actively seek collaboration with various constituent, situats and city agencies in order to promulgate just proposals and resolutions and Thank you, pat gray, and thank you for coming to the quality of life meeting very consistently.
This is a unique opportunity to meet the demands of parents to keep their neighborhood safe for their children and preservationists to help the seaport remain a true historic district, while still allowing the developer to serve to sell their air rights to financially support the South Street Seaport Museum.
Member of the greater seaport coalition, I'm, talking today, to speak in support of the resolution to expand the available receiving sites for Airport first airport for seaport, air rights.
This action will allow the air rights to be bid on by a larger market and will result in a robust revenue stream that can support the South Street Seaport Museum and, at the same time generate significant and deeply affordable housing in the larger neighborhood by allowing more apartments to be built in areas where the zoning is aligned.
I just want to thank you for your time and consideration and hope that this receives a full support of the full board.
Madam Chair and I just want to thank community board members in general, because I know how tireless and thankless a job it is, and it's really hard.
Consider the very well vetted alternative we have of allowing for the sale of the city-owned air rights outside of the historic district by monetizing.
It's, embarrassing to me that my daughter attends school downtown There are other ways for us to do the right thing by telling the story as well as provide much needed funding to the museum as well.
We are very concerned about some of those stated issues with outdoor dining, but with that said, we're going to be a continued partner for our small business community to make sure that we're doing everything that they can to stay afloat, and we have several endeavors in the legislative front, including the small business Recovery Lease Act. If passed, would allow the state to enable the city to allow for business donors and building owners impacted by Covid-19 to renegotiate terms and provide tax abatements that will really incentivize longer term stability for the tenants and with the eviction moratorium.
If you'd, like to know more about this, I, will also drop our website link in the chat below there's a lot of various legislative endeavors to make sure that we are providing this statutorily as a tenant protection right, Definitely, no problem, please feel free to call 311 or get utilize housing court answers hotline which I will also drop in the chat.
I am a downtown resident, long, time, downtown resident and parent of a child on governor's island at the New York Harbor, School, and I am here to tell you guys that you're about to hear again from Governors Island trust about their big, exciting plans for the island, and I just wanted to ask that you.
We would like to ask that the Community Board support us, please in the effort to get the school some of the basics that it really needs.
We do not have the equipment or the space or the building, and we need the support from the community Board to get Governors Island trust to give us that kind of space and place, and it needs to be prioritized and thank you so much for all that.
Any event, I want to take the opportunity to impart my support of the receiving site resolution presented.
My community is not against affordable housing, just build it within the 120 foot restriction and allow the sale of the receiving air rights outside the historic area to support the financial needs of the museum.
Think about the precedent we are setting for all of the landmarked and historic districts throughout New, York, City, so I'm, hoping that everybody votes in favor of this resolution.
Moving on Mariama treasurer's report and by the way, just want to announce that this is the closest the fastest public session and public hearing I've had since I got here, so You right, despite all those very important issues, that was amazing.
If you do not recognize it because of the two development zones that are there, Understand that this is a dialogue and a conversation happening now in community board, one because it's our jurisdiction, but it is an amazing public asset for everyone.
There was a resolution that we talked about because there there's been a lot of comments that have come from the city that do not accurately reflect the work that we've done in community board.
I, see no hands we're going to do roll call, because it's the first resolution and you're calling which one of you is doing roll call All right you're on when I call your name, if you could say your name and then your vote.
You know the mayor's been out there talking very often how our schools are now the model of how to operate in a pandemic, how we are past the height, how things are easing, so it is time to take a look at the executive orders and restore some checks and balances back to the way the city operates, and so that is what this one is.
You would like the city to provide training available online services available for everyone forever for community board members and make it mandatory within a period of time and make it happen.
I did ask D.O.T to return next month to transportation, we're going to put an invitation out for them to return with whole foods, because part of the problem that we have is whether or not other they took the whole block and whether or not questions needed to be answered specifically buy whole foods or places like.
While we might not make their scheduling season, we we went we're asking them to come in November all right, And I'm not going to show slides because it'll be the third time they've seen them this month.
It's, going to focus first on the resolution, please for supporting the 80 20 tenants and landlord at 225 rector place in Battery, Park City.
So we're not talking about lefrak organization as a big entity, but we're still talking about people who have some money and We're also talking about now down from 60 units that were affordable, housing down to 13 units in the building What this resolution is asking for, anybody, any questions.
I know the community board already passed a resolution with the Landmarks committee supporting this in concept.
He's worked for many years on that park in conjunction with the community board, so he gave us an update.
We were also informed that they are working with citigroup to restore ferry service from pier 25, I believe, and they also added hours so that they're starting A little earlier city groups hours have expanded because of Covid-19 they're trying to have people not in the building all at once.
It's for maintenance because, as you know, most of our public spaces, except things like Brooklyn bridge park and Hudson river park, which come under the umbrella of a trust, are losing their their money.
The first time that all the community boards will be joined to discuss is Really critical, resiliency measures for lower Manhattan, so thank you.
I did not have the resolution done it's going to be postponed longer, but if anyone can send me the article that would be great and next again the resolutions can be dependent on when we finally hear anything and Ann Street update was interesting and a couple of points I want to make as people bring them.
It's a well, known problem and they're working on it, I mean for my purposes, For you know the Community Board of the people who hear all the problems get all the complaint, we're the ones that do the licensing and everything else.
Assuming that rebel scooters are a private entity right Like many years in the past, we have a lot of deaths on the vice on the bike, accidents throughout the city and the boroughs.
You come to the transportation meeting in November and asked why I do not want to debate life with Betty I ride a bike, and it's really dangerous, and It is if they're in bike, lanes, Definitely and then Cora from the council member's office Reminds all of us that we should not be using Google to take a look at what a New York state Highway is that New York State D.O.T has an official highway map, and that is actually what the law goes.
P.M is the first precinct community meeting, which I think we're going to send out or post on our website for people to attend and ask questions.
I just feel like it's important to point out instances of systemic racism and implicit bias, and one is in an item that was discussed earlier in The Waterfront Parks Committee Paul went over damages that had been heard at city Hall.
First topic was EDC came to talk to us about policing and management at the South Street seaport, which of course generated a lot of discussion.
Oh right, Diana's like showing the slides and it's basically, there were a lot of you know, questions and discussions about that because of how the the community's idea of the marketplace lease versus Howard, Hughes's idea of the marketplace.
This board got a presentation in 2015 of probably a half a dozen or more examples of this working where hundreds of thousands of the square feet of these development rights were sold off to these sites outside the historic district.
The City, Planning Commission has the power and they have in the past, created these So-It would make it easier to sell off those development rights And we would even encourage howard use to sell off theirs or transfer them out of the historic district.
So, the first change that I put in is in that, whereas, as you can see, with the red lettering here, whereas the South Street seaport, Historic District, has long had a mechanism in place to allow for the transfer of unused development rights from the historic seaport, district, too, and I just added the word designated receiving sites just to clarify what we're talking.
Now I put this one in the last, whereas because a couple of people pointed out to me that the language that I had in the second be it resolve where I suggested you know, we should move the development rights outside the historic district to create additional, affordable, housing, etc.
Colin you're, first: I'm there I probably started the abstention for the best in the original vote, but I changed from extension to supporting it, and I want to speak publicly in support of this, You're, essentially saying is the air development rights?
We just think there are alternate solutions to move those development rights and pay for the needed improvements to the community.
Ask the first question correctly, but is there a dispute between the current zoning within the historic seaport district and what can happen as of right on this location?
If we use the air rights outside the historic district, there are developers elsewhere in lower Manhattan.
I know your wife works for the council member who seems supportive of this Bob, but I hope you could take an open stance on this and look at it.
You know as an alternative way to fund the seaport, but I think will work, better.
You know kind of making offers or the thing in play or feel like there were really alternative possibilities, but that there had been a future, but there have been breeds all right, hold on.
It has been an ongoing issue since I've been on the community Board and at this moment in time it needs to be said, that, while I support their existence, I do not think the world has to has to tilt on its axis because of the seaport museum.
I just wanted to mention, of course, that they had come to Community, Board, I, think in September, and you know as a precursor to their plans, but subsequently, like a couple days later.
So we did not want it to turn into a casino and condos, or you know, an island for the wealthy, because the public space gets squeezed out and that's to truly understand that the community has long fought for, and we need to include that into the dialogue about rezoning and anything that goes ahead on the element.
I should announce that alice will be our new community board, one representative to work with governor's island.
I. Think school construction was, you know, trying to get capital money, for that is that related in any way to the development?
You know this expansion people are not used to the outdoor spaces, so we've been trying to work on it and and street there's a new ownership.
