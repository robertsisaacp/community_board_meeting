Okay, good evening, everybody welcome. This is Manhattan community board one's full board session for October. The first thing that we actually have on our agenda tonight is the Community Board one capital and budget expense requests for year. 2022, it's a public hearing aspect, so I'm going to open it up for anyone who wishes to speak for the public hearing about the budget. If so, please raise your hand. I do not see any sign ups topically about the budget in specific, so I'm going to look for based hands, seeing nothing like crickets over here: okay, fantastic! Oh, that's, Taylor, okay, let's unmute taylor! This is for budget purposes. For the public hearing taylor we're going to unmeet. You go ahead now, please hi good evening. This is Taylor banning I'm a resident of Battery Park City, and this is relating to budgets for this year. This borough, president, it seems like announced New, York, City's Human rights watch provided bias, trainings on various topics like LGBTQIA plus rights, and I heard they were really positive, but they were only live and then recordings were I'm not available, and so I was wondering if maybe a budget request could be funding and access for more of these and maybe updated annually, so that once a training is provided to community board members, the recording then be posted to all community board sites so that both the public and members can late access at a date that works better for them, because I know timing was an issue for many people and then it could maybe even be mandatory for some of these to be viewed by members by the end of you know a time period or something, but then the community could also have access to them since they're very valuable- and I know a lot of community is looking for these trainings. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you, Taylor. Looking through the sign in sheet, I do not see anybody else who is looking to speak specifically on our budget. Do I see any other hands up no hand up, but is that something that could be added to the budget or no? Or is that not the process? Now, when we get there to the budget station in the business session? Okay, we'll discuss that Mariama budget same thing, I was going to ask if there was a friendly amendment or something that I could make to. You know support that, because I actually did get to see. Okay, hang on and wait for it to come, no problem. Anybody else for budget session. Okay and looking, I see no one else who has noted about budget for the sign- in sheet. So with that and no hands raised we're going to close the public hearing on the capital budget, okay and directly go to public session. So for the public session we do have quite a few people have signed up to speak, we're going to start with our elected officials first and then we will move on to members of the public officials get four to five minutes of time. Members of the public have two to three minutes and Lucy, I believe, will be our timer tonight. So, let's start and see, I think Brian Kavanagh was joining us, so we will start with Deborah Blick. I broke ahead and unmute yourself. That would be assembled thanks very much. I very much appreciate the opportunity. I really can not wait until we are actually all together and we can just see each other give each other hog. This is this is a long process. Obviously, the big thing this week is voting. There are normally something like 5200 voting locations across the state. I think we have at this point only a little under 300, which accounts for the long lines. Obviously this is in a presidential year. That's when we have the most turnout, and so it is quite you know it's relatively new to New York to have early voting. So we've seen lines like this for presidential on election day. Hopefully, by election day, it will be when we have more sites, it'll be a little bit more under control. So I pledge to you all that we in Albany will be looking at what we can do going forward to make it easier. We've made registrations easier. The fact that we have early voting is one of the ways in which we try to make it easier for people to vote. Obviously, the enthusiasm this year sort of overwhelmed our capacity and it's also in the middle of the pandemic. So you have people socially distancing on the lines, so the three or four blocks is also about people standing a few feet away from each other, but nevertheless we really do need to give people a better opportunity to vote in the we're beginning to talk about what the state can do. Regard news in the event that we do not have any relief from Washington. But I will tell you now that without relief from Washington, it will be dire, even if we can raise resources. The next couple of years sales tax are down income, taxes down and our expenditures on health care are way up and on providing testing and PPE and sanitation. You know, disinfection and the MTA is in a crisis, so we desperately need money from Washington. The state will not be able to fill all the holes. Obviously I chair higher ed and what the situation for colleges and the support, especially for smaller, independent colleges, they are a vital part of our higher ed infrastructure and they are on the ropes so I'm going to. I did not sound like an optimist, but in my heart I am so. I think that we will get some relief. It should have come two months ago, but hopefully in the next three or four months, it will be here and we will have to rebuild a lot. I will just close by saying. I think that the issue of open dining is concerning in the way it went through with a permanent allocation or permission. I think that it would be fine to do it for a year and then look to see what the ramifications are around noise on certain streets, sanitation and in lower Manhattan our streets. Some of them are quite small. I drove up mulberry the other day to deliver some hand sanitizer and it's the car just fits between the outside dining. I do not know about a sand. I know around the corner from me. The only place, but the snow is in the crosswalk, so I think we need to think that through and while it's important to save our restaurants, to the extent that we can perhaps automatic permanency is the giving up of public space without a euler without an eis without a large discussion is a problem. So I'm looking forward to tackling all of these issues with you- and I do not know if we will be together before thanksgiving, but if we are not. I hope that, although this is a weird year that you have a good thanksgiving and I wish everybody and their families to stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you so much Deborah. We appreciate you coming. We have spoken also about trying to find a way to rebalance and redesign our streets, so we can get everybody's needs taken care of next. I believe Lizzie tell me if Ryan is here yet not here. I do not see kavanagh, but I can unmute Lizzie and she can let us know: Lizzy are muted hi, Tammy, Senator Cavanaugh's, taking a bit longer. I'm sorry about that I'll. Try to get him on as soon as possible. Just on this detective, we know we're going to continue on. I have Sarah Yan from Assemblymember Yulin News Office Dara we're going to meet you. Please go ahead hi. This is Dara from Assembly member News office. I just wanted to give a quick update of what our office has been up to so this month, the assembly member, alongside State Senator Salazar, introduced her fines, fee and surcharges bill. This bill details a large extent of fines and fees and surcharges from our criminal legal system. To read more about the bill, I will drop the link in the Chat box and to speak about the Fidei homeless, Shelter Statement. The assembly member, has released a statement regarding the announcement of planned homeless shelter at the former Wall Street Radisson Hotel hotel. She spoke on the need for community engagement and open lines of communication which were missing throughout this process and we'll continue to push for clarity and full transparency from our city agencies, as well as other related parties, and for an update about the 70 mulberry community meetings. This month, the community meetings regarding the future of the site have begun and it has been the assembly members priority to encourage community engagement as well as amplify the voices and the needs of our community. The assembly member, as well as our staff, have attended each of these meetings and will continue to promote a process of focusing on the voice of the community and throughout the pandemic. Yulin has prioritized, organizing and participating in food distributions to ensure everyone has access moving forward, we'll continue to provide these meals for everyone who needs it, and if you need help exercise accessing food, please contact our office, but with all that, I will end it here for tonight and I will drop some information in the chatbot. Thank you very much. We appreciate that we're going to move right on to Cora from Council member Chin's office. Cora, your mic is open. Oh hi, good evening, everyone, oh you can not knew me. That's right! Thank you. So I do not have to look for the button hello, everyone from council member chain's office, a few highlights for you and the most important one is to continue to assist the tenants at 225 rectal place to help them to stay until the pandemic is over or as long as they can, and they are also participating in tonight's meeting as well. Thank you, Bpc Committee meeting put the efforts in there to discuss the situation and to help the affordable housing 421a issues in the overarching situation. Thank you. All for the seniors senior center have navigated numerous obstacles during the pandemic to continue to provide resources to the older new Yorkers. So Council member Chin urged Difter the department for the aging to provide some transparent steps on senior center reopening and also the path forward, because city centers have been doing a great job and many seniors in CB1. They count on the senior centers to have social interaction, social activities, but the senior centers are not offered enough opportunity to give their input to look after the seniors that they have been taking care of this Friday Councilmember chin will be sharing an oversight hearing on the future of senior home, delivered meals, many seniors at Ipn and the area also use the home delivery meals. But there have been a lot of problems with that. So, if you are interested in testifying, I will include a link in the sign up for you to sign up in the chat box and last week, councilman machine and her colleagues passed Intro 2030 that keeps the threshold five for three and three programs fifty thousand dollars, and this will allow a greater number of seniors and disabled to qualify for rent increase exemptions. In addition, the outdoor dining was passed by the City Council 4062, and this bill makes outdoor dining permanent and also officially allowed for the use of electric and propane heaters. I'm going to wrap up on composting that our community needs very much after fighting to restore funding throughout the City Council membership partnered with the earth matter, New York to celebrate their newest community composing drop- off at the bowling green market. If you have not there, please do participate, that's it for now. Thank you, Tammy and thank you all. Thank you Cora! So much for joining us and thank you for that update. We want to move next. We have quite a few members of the public, so we're going to move on to the members of the public we're going to start with Ann Stetson. So if you can unmute Anne Stetson, who is in the public area, hello Anne, I know Justine is going to be introducing a resolution supporting our tenancy and until the until covered, the Kobe risk is over and Cora from Council member Chin's office just made a reference to it as well. So I hope that you will support the resolution and I want to thank you for the time that you've given us in previous meetings and having an opportunity to speak before the board. I'm doing that on behalf of quite a few of the tenants who are here this evening. Thank you, you're welcome, and for those who missed that in the beginning, she is a resident of 225 rector and about affordable housing. Next, we're going to move to Connie Fitzgerald from invisible hands, see Connie you're, open, yeah, great hi. Thank you so much for the opportunity. I am just simply here to introduce invisible hands for an organization that will free of charge, go and run and do deliveries of grocery shopping and other essential items on behalf of your constituents. We'll do that for those folks who can pay for their groceries and also we have done deliveries via mutual aid organizations. We will do it we'll visit a food pantry and make the delivery, and we also do bulk food deliveries. Another thing that we're doing is given that we're heading into an election we're also delivering absentee ballots, signed, sealed absentee ballots. We will take them to the board of elections or drop them off at the appropriate polling area. So we just wanted to introduce ourselves and our services we can be reached at invisiblehandsdeliver.org or you can call us 732- 639- 1579. That's all okay! Thank you very much for coming and thank you for joining us. We're going to go to Luke Wolf from Controller Stop Stringer's office. Next Luke. Sorry about that mister, not a problem at all, hi everyone, I'm Luke Wolf from City Comptroller Scott Stringer's office. I wanted my two minutes today. Talking about the economy, it is increasingly clear that we are not experiencing the v- shaped economic recovery. Many of us had hoped for at 13.9 percent of September. The city's unemployment rate was six points above the national Average and New York City still lags behind the nation in job recovery, with only more than one third of jobs lost the height of pandemic regained, since, which is why this week, comptroller stringer announced a comprehensive overhaul of Workforce development in New, York City to upskill, millions of new Yorkers dramatically, diversify high- wage industries and generate career opportunities to spur New York's recovery. The plan has 12 recommendations which I will drop in the chat, but to highlight a few. The first is making community college free like it was for generations of new yorkers again through the CUNY schools. Number two create a CUNY tech core to actually help small businesses, adopt digital tools and develop an online presence and number three expand career and technical education in public schools, which is actually decreased since 2013.. So in this vein, we recently announced a cohort of 20 recent CUNY graduates who participate in a six- month, fellowship with the comptroller's office, to get work experience which will hopefully help them in their job prospects. Do you want to use the rest of my time to be brief and touch upon a few things that were on the agenda in front of the community board this month? One our office remains actively involved talking to the tenants from 225 vector and working with them to reach a solution to keep them in their homes. Our office also continues to monitor coastal resiliency downtown and pushes the city to exploit that process to make sure downtown neighbors are protected. And lastly, I want to thank the Community board for all their work this month on bringing the community together for a really productive and constructive conversation about homelessness in the area. So I want to thank everyone who was involved in making that possible. Okay. Thank you. So much, I'm going to move on. We've got a large group of people here on a very on the topic of South Street seaport and a variety of things I'm going to save them for one large block and try and get everyone else, who's going on different topics. First, that's just a heads up. So next I'm going to go to justine Kucha. She is a full board member signed up to speak as a member of the public justine Thanks Tammy, Madam Chair, I should say so. My name is justine Kucha and I'm a member of the Community Board one, but I'm speaking tonight in my pup in my private capacity as a resident of lower Manhattan during protests over the summer, our community lower Manhattan was the scene of several egregious instances of excessive force by the police. All of this violence was directed at protesters who were speaking out against systemic racism within law enforcement and the criminal justice system, but the police reacted very differently last week, when a pro trump demonstration took place in lower Manhattan, in that instance, police seemed very sympathetic to the demonstrators and hostile to local residents who jeered at the March. But my real concern is that this discrepancy was made possible in my opinion, because a few months ago, the police, Benevolent Association Union, chose to endorse a candidate Donald Trump's campaign for reelection. I find this offensive and disturbing on so many levels. The men and women of law enforcement are supposed to represent and protect all of us. How can we believe this when they embrace advice of figure who espouses hatred and racism such a move sabotages the confidence we need and deserve to have in our police now. Would I be similarly troubled if the police union endorsed a candidate that I supported? I do not know, but I suggest, or I postulate that I should be, because the police, much like the military, are supposed to protect all new yorkers, not one side or the other, and personally I would feel much better. All the way around if police unions going forward were barred from indoctrination endorsing any candidate, whether I happen to be in support or oppose that person in the same way that military service personnel are prohibited from partisan activities. What they do in their private lives is up to them, but their public life should be nonpartisan. So I'm calling upon our elected officials to consider legislation that I know I'm done, but I want to say let me finish. The sentence consider legislation that they would change the legal status of police unions to something similar to a 501 c 3 organization which are, according to federal law, absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in or intervening in any political campaign on the behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for elected public office. Legal scholars would agree that this prohibition does not conflict with, should agree that it does not conflict with freedom of speech and it would be a small change, but I think it would be significant to restoring the public's confidence in our police force. Thank you, okay. Thank you very much, justine we're going to move on to the next. I just want to do a double check, because I do not see Senator Cavanaugh here yet so I'm going to move into we're going to move forward to the public speakers because we need this is a large topic and I have half a dozen people have signed up to speak, we're going to like you trying to get to one to two minutes, so we can be targeted and on time, so we're going to start with Linda and Jay Hellstrom we're going to unmute you from the public session. I do not see a Melinda Linda and Jay Hellstrom they're here. Thank you. Madam chairman, we are speaking. The two of us are speaking in support of the creation of the news receiving sites for the seaport development rights. We live at 273 water street. It happens to be the home, this is our home, but it happens to be the building that is captain rose's original home, and it is the third oldest building residential building in New York City. So we are a part of the historic seaport in in a very deep way. I come from Georgia, which is also a historic city, and I know the difficulty and I very much support this of preserving and the battle is on to preserve the historic nature. This is a crown jewel of the city and I call upon our elected officials and all those in support of preserving one of the unique aspects to allow us to transfer only one more. Oh, he gets more time than I do usually also. So I will feed my time back to Linda. Well, we just do not want the development rights to go into the historic seaport because they should be transferred out of the seaport once we set a precedent of, I appreciate that from development rights into the seaport district, it's Katie bar the door. Okay, thank you for your time. You're welcome. We just so everybody is aware. We have one two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine ten more people to speak on this topic, so I will be getting to you at one to two minutes each. However, before we do that Manhattan borough, president Gail Brewer is with us this evening, so gail Brewer, welcome and lucian. Can you, unlike okay, Tammy? Thank you, I'm going to be very quick because I know I much rather listen, but I do appreciate because I have five community boards tonight. I just three quick things: one I whatever happens in terms of project renewal and the Lucerne and the Radisson Hotel and Community Board one. I want you to know that all across the borough, you have been the model as to how to handle these issues. So your leadership and your board just do not want to say, congratulations. It's! We will see what happens on November 16th and I know there's discussions in between. But congratulations. Let's hope it goes well on November 16th and the Lucerne remains with those residents the we're working on governor's island. I know I heard discussion about South Suite seaport, I'm very aware of all these issues and we'd be working with the community Board, the council, member and the city, it's very challenging, but we will all be working together. I want to mention just some exciting, just concepts: Community board, one knows better than anybody: every single street and sidewalk with outdoor donating outdoor, dining, bicycles, drop-, offs stores. I understand that retail is going to be allowed to go out on the street soon. I do not know that that's public, but I've heard something to that effect. We need a public realm czar somebody who can focus on the 20-some agencies that look at streetscapes for us from the scaffolding to the state Liquor Authority. So I think you will agree with that. I know that community board five has been looking at this issue. We would love to have all of your input. Covid-19 is ongoing. I did testify yesterday at the City Council, because the waste water treatment plants can now do testing of waste and in Boston Big article in the papers today, six days in advance of a spike Austin found it before it became a problem because of their analysis of our waste. So we're working. I've been pushing really hard with the Davar department of Environmental Protection Deputy Commissioner Pamela Largo has been fantastic, so they have a team of three. They have a lab they're doing 35 to 40 a day, but they want to do a lot more and they're waiting for some equipment to be able to do that. So just something to think about. I think many members of Community Board one know as well as I do about some of the remote learning and blended learning issues. We've mostly been focused on trying to make sure that not only the young people have devices which may or may not be as big a problem in two as it is elsewhere. But when you have a device you often do not have the connection and the bandwidth to go with it. So it's a it's a package: that's not there in all cases, and it has to be there in every single case. Affordable housing on all levels is an issue, so we have a task force. We are trying really hard to talk to every single person to see what kind of affordable housing opportunities are out there. Particularly in this downturn are there buildings that could be purchased to be the kind of affordable housing that has the planning that community board one is known for. I just want to finally just state that you know that the Community board applications believe it or not, are going to be released next month, we've given out grants for cultural tourism, just a regular expense, and of course I think you know that we gave out money for census. We did the best we could on all levels and of course we give out capital every single year tomorrow, 10:28 downtown 10:29, I'm sorry 10:28, uptown, 10:29, downtown the New, York City, NYPD reform and reinvention collaborative listening tour. You can certainly get all the information on our website and certainly I'm sure NYPD, but please participate. 1029 is southern Manhattan residents. We will put the information on the chat, but we want a lot a lot of people. I think around 150 participated in Queens. We want a lot more in Manhattan and finally on November 23rd with HPD we're doing a tenant resource, and thank you very much for everything that board one is doing well. Thank you. Madame borough, president, for joining us, it is a very busy board for the next 12 months minimum and we appreciate your support. So thank you for coming. Okay. I am going to Adrian, so I apologize if I'd not said that right, she is in the attendee section very good. Thank you to the Community. Board won membership in public and thank you Chairwoman Nelson. I am in support of the resolution for the creation of new receiving sites for the seaport development rights. That's about to be presented. What I want to bring up to the community board is a different use for the 250 Water street property that will bring a larger benefit to the sea portland's community. In the city, a recent CB1 environment committee featured Laura Dodge, who reported that langan and Hhc completed their investigation phase of the toxic site and are now composing their report. We explain the next steps from the process and their preliminary results. Then the EDC at that same meeting reported on East River resiliency in their experiences with the Tiger den and they reported to CB1 that they could identify no good land- based options for controlling flooding in the seaport area. It may not be possible, but it is my thought to propose that the best use in terms of benefit to the community is that the 250 Water street property on the upland border of the area which flooded during Hurricane Sandy, is large enough and well situated enough to serve as an on- land, resiliency infrastructure, most of the blocks up through the napoleon built, so the opportunity to originate this type of flood control structure is unique in these days of code. It is time is it time for the city to consider eminent domain or some other purchase in services providing the whole neighborhood with storm water control through above and below ground flood mitigation infrastructure, while a green space roof structure could provide open space amenities to the community. Such an example of fine funding and land use for flood mitigation for public benefit is in Hoboken, New Jersey realizing this is a long shot. Is their community board interest in public sources of support for a resiliency pockets for Water Street? Thank you for your consideration. Thank you very much for joining us at Community Board one, and thank you for the interesting ideas we are going to move on to David Sheldon and we will unmute you David when you're unmuted over here there you go welcome David. Thank you very much good to be here briefly. Historically, the South Street seaport Historic district was financially designed commercially to support the South Street Seaport museum. Subsequently, the new marketplace lease denies that revenue to the museum. Instead that money is going to a private developer. Originally air rights in the South Street seaport Historic district were to be sold outside of the district in order to support projects within the district. Now those rights are being sold once again to the benefit of a private developer. I speak in support of the revolution resolution, perhaps a small revolution indeed to make those air rights transferable, to projects outside of the seaport historic district, in order to preserve the height restrictions in the district and to secure those revenues to support needs within the district as originally intended. This area should not be entrusted to the middlemen of this or any developer. Why are we putting them in control of the money that we need spent there by the sale of our public assets? I should speak in support of the revolut resolution to make those air rights transferable outside of the district. Thank you thank you. Mr Sheldon, and I will say that is the mechanism that currently exists so I'll leave that comment as it is all right. Pat gray signed up to speak hi. Thank you so yeah, my name is Pat gray. I've been living in battery park city for 18 years and I'm a member of the board of the Gateway Plaza Tennis Association. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. My topic is a proposal to create a subcommittee within the quality of Life committee. I spoke to this topic at the board's July 28 meeting and raised it again today in the hope that a decision on creating the subcommittee might be made by by say the start of the January by the January meeting. I I'll just give you a little bit sort of repeat some of the things that I said: July 28th in the event that some of the people here may not have been present at the time. There is a group of us who have formed shortly after Mr Floyd was killed, we sort of cut. We call ourselves just to have some kind of a name, Barry Park City, for black lives matter. We believe that now is the time to sincerely grapple with the racism that tragically vividly and boldly captured the nation's attention, beginning with the killing of Mr Floyd on May 25th. We asked this community board today to respond to the truth of the accusation that long- standing racism continues to be insidiously inherent in all facets of everyday life. How might the community Board one best respond? A key definition of the Community board is that it plays an important role, improving the quality of life for all new yorkers, and so CB1 has a standing quality of life committee. We believe that now would be the time to expand that committee to include an intersectional racial and social Justice subcommittee and just on the side. Looking up the definition. There are many definitions of inter sectional, and one of them concludes with through an awareness of intersectionality. We can better acknowledge and ground the differences among us. I think the word intersectional kind of covers a wide swath of people, types of people groups and so what we're proposing then, if this yes you're at two minutes and two and a half minutes, so please try and wind it up. Okay, I'll skip a lot of the other stuff that I said during the other meeting, but we're proposing this subcommittee to actively seek collaboration with various constituent, situats and city agencies in order to promulgate just proposals and resolutions and we're proposing that equal time be given to participating community members. I won't take up any more time, but we're hopeful that this will be considered. We think it's the time for something like this to be birthed, so to speak. Thank you for your time. Thank you, pat gray, and thank you for coming to the quality of life meeting very consistently. I would like to recognize Christopher Marty. He is next. I think if he can be unmuted Chris hi. Can you hear me I can loud and clear. Thank you so much. Thank you. Madame chair and community bar one. I strongly support the creation of the new receiving site for the seaport development rights. This is a unique opportunity to meet the demands of parents to keep their neighborhood safe for their children and preservationists to help the seaport remain a true historic district, while still allowing the developer to serve to sell their air rights to financially support the South Street Seaport Museum. This resolution provides a clear answer to what has become a decisive issue that has put community interest against other community interests. I hope members of Community Board one vote. Yes on this resolution. This could really be a win- win- win solution. So thank you for writing this resolution. Hopefully we'll get it past today, wow that was fast and under time. Thank you. So much Chris I'm going to go to Megan Malvern, you got me. I got you Megan! Thank you! So much hi everyone. First of all, thank you to CB1 and to madam chairman, I really appreciate the time and the attention that this has received, I'm speaking as myself, but also as co- founder of children. First, a group that we put together to first deal with some of the 250 water street problems that were arising and we're also part of them. A member of the greater seaport coalition, I'm talking today, to speak in support of the resolution to expand the available receiving sites for Airport first airport for seaport air rights. Approving the creation of new receiving sites, would give the seaport historic district a viable way to remove the oversized and dangerous development bullseye that is threatening the district. The current air right environment, created by the EDC, sets the table for Hhc's profiteering on the deeply historic 10 block area. Without greater alternatives for receiving sites. There are limited options for anyone owning property in the district. The situation will force the district to cannibalize itself into extinction. Children first is in complete support of this truly visionary solution being put forward by the land use zoning and economic development committee. This action will allow the air rights to be bid on by a larger market and will result in a robust revenue stream that can support the South Street Seaport Museum and, at the same time generate significant and deeply affordable housing in the larger neighborhood by allowing more apartments to be built in areas where the zoning is aligned. I just want to thank you for your time and consideration and hope that this receives a full support of the full board. Thank you very much Megan. Thank you for coming, I'm going to move next to emily Hellstrom emily. I see you signed in twice, but I assume you're only speaking once and if we can unmute emily hello emily. I can hear you oh great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Madam Chair and I just want to thank community board members in general, because I know how tireless and thankless a job it is, and it's really hard work, and I think that really what I want to say is that we have to really listen to community boards and the things that come out of community boards communities know best how to take care of their own communities. We are in unprecedented times. We need economic development, but the people who know best how to make economic development so very often is the wisdom that comes from places like the people who are sitting on this board in 2013. They very wisely said we have something amazing here it is the birthplace of not only our city, but arguably our nation, and we need to preserve it because by preserving it we can actually make a neighborhood and a jewel of the city that people want to come to. It creates vibrancy jobs it, but it is really more than that it is living history. So I think that it is something that we really must focus on and not think that there is only one option, and that is the option that is the most expedient and seems the most glossy and shiny. Sometimes the low hanging fruit is rotten. So I really I support this resolution and I thank you to people like Tammy who chairs this board and who's really giving voice to people who come, but also to Paul Goldstein who's, been in this community for years and years, and has watched this and done things like create schools, create jobs, create housing, and you know I think we really need to listen to the people who are here. So. Thank you very much. Thank you emily. I thank you for the compliment and I will say that while I may lead it is really. I may have a title, but it is about the people on this board who do an incredible amount of work. Every single one of the 50 members of community board one being engaged and spending the time to volunteer. So it's not me as much as it is them and trust me. They have no trouble telling me how they feel on that note, we'll go to stacy's show and if we can unmute stacy she's next great there, you go hi stacy hi, so I won't harp on this too much it's already been mentioned, but I do want to echo that we all want to save the South Street seaport Museum, while building affordable housing. Please seriously consider the very well vetted alternative we have of allowing for the sale of the city- owned air rights outside of the historic district by monetizing those air rights. It's a win- win. We can have even more affordable housing while saving the museum and keeping the low- scale nature of the district. I also wanted to mention, since somebody mentioned resiliency. It's another benefit obviously is keeping to the low scale. Is the resiliency issue? There's also information in the chat I will put in a plug. New downtown dems are having a talk on coastal resiliency on Thursday, and the last thing I want to mention- because I never hear it mentioned- is the hidden history of slavery at the seaport. I do not know why this is not mentioned. It's embarrassing to me that my daughter attends school downtown and I've never heard anything mentioned. The museums that have had exhibits, such as the New York historical society, have seen an 80 percent increase in their visitation, as well as millions of dollars to pour in. So there are other ways for us to do the right thing by telling the story as well as provide much needed funding to the museum as well. Thank you stacy great points. All I think we are all wondering the same kind of question on that. So thank you very much. I want to check in back with Lizzie Lee from Senator Kavanaugh's office. Thank you so much Tammy and thank you for everyone for coming together. Even with our constantly evolving circumstances as assembly member clique had mentioned early voting is a iterative process that we hope to. You know make sure that we are getting right the next time. If you do feel comfortable voting in person. We really do urge that you vote early and vote in person this week if you're voting via absentee ballot. I'm sure everyone knows by now to make sure to read the instructions very carefully. Today was the last day to request a ballot I'm in New York, so we're all looking forward to that. Please feel free to contact our office if you have any questions or concerns in making sure that your vote gets counted in regards to small businesses. We are very concerned about some of those stated issues with outdoor dining, but with that said, we're going to be a continued partner for our small business community to make sure that we're doing everything that they can to stay afloat, and we have several endeavors in the legislative front, including the small business Recovery Lease Act. This program, if passed, would allow the state to enable the city to allow for business donors and building owners impacted by Covid-19 to renegotiate terms and provide tax abatements that will really incentivize longer term stability for the tenants and with the eviction moratorium. Again, it's less certain recent days the executive orders have passed and we are calling on further legislation to make sure that we're providing the tenant protections that people really do need. If you'd like to know more about this, I will also drop our website link in the chat below there's a lot of various legislative endeavors to make sure that we are providing this statutorily as a tenant protection right and if you are feel like, if you feel like you're being evicted illegally or people in your network are being regarded in a hello. Definitely no problem, please feel free to call 311 or get utilize housing court answers hotline which I will also drop in the chat, we're continuing to closely engage with community issues and governor's island rezoning. I'm really glad that CB1 so characteristically took the initiative to collaborate with Brooklyn seabees, which Senator Cavanaugh has long been advocating for, and you know will continue to work very closely. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you so much and please let Senator Kavanaugh know if he is able to make it. We know he's on a busy schedule. We would always welcome him, even if he probably starting the business session, I'm happy to have him alone. Thank can you please remind speakers. They have one to two minutes and the clock is on the screen yep and I actually think lucy with that. We might be done if I do not see any other hands up and I do not see any other sign- ons, because we had a couple duplicate, sign- ons. Let me take a quick look through the. If you alex you did not sign up on the attendance sheet. All right, Alex Daschleberg is the only hand I see left Alex, we'll unmute you next time, please you're going to use a backwards sign- in for me, please hi! Thank you so much for letting me speak. I appreciate it. I am a downtown resident, long- time, downtown resident and parent of a child on governor's island at the New York Harbor School, and I am here to tell you guys that you're about to hear again from Governors Island trust about their big, exciting plans for the island, and I just wanted to ask that you, as a community board, remember the New York Harbor School. That has been there for 13 years, trying to teach the kids how to do things on the water or anything related to marine life, but they have no swimming pool, they have no aquatics training center and they have no gym and they have no auditorium. This is a school that could use the space that is provided already, but we are not being given it by Governors, Island Trust and they are proposing putting all sorts of new, exciting things on the island and our school is not being prioritized. So we would like to ask that the Community Board support us, please in the effort to get the school some of the basics that it really needs. Since it's a school, that's based on the premise of teaching our kids hands- on skills, including professional diving. How does our kid get to learn professional, diving without an aquatics training center? It's really challenging so we'd love for the kids to learn how to swim and have that be a prerequisite which it once was for the school before it moved to Governor's island from Brooklyn. We do not have the equipment or the space or the building, and we need the support from the community Board to get Governors Island trust to give us that kind of space and place, and it needs to be prioritized and thank you so much for all that you do. It is impressive that you guys put this time and energy into this work and thank you, Alex I'll. Have you know from me that I did you'll hear if you stay on for the business session and amendment to the budget, to reflect the conversation that you just had with us, because it was brought up in committee for by Amy, Conte and other people from the PTA. So it is a budget mask that we have. Thank you so much. That's awesome! We can always just ask the next person. Actually we have a couple more sign. Ups is Linda Roche Linda. If you could sign up, if we can unmute you and find you, if we can there, you go well Linda hi, I should say: welcome back. Thank you so much Madam Chair. I I've been a resident of the historic seaport area since 1978 and I say the historic seaport, because I'm not sure if you realize this, but Howard Hughes rebranded themselves to be the seaport district, so they removed historic from the name of the area. In any event, I want to take the opportunity to impart my support of the receiving site resolution presented tonight. The South Street seaport, Historic district is really a precious landmarked area of historic proportions. My community is not against affordable housing, just build it within the 120 foot restriction and allow the sale of the receiving air rights outside the historic area to support the financial needs of the museum. If we allow the receiving sites to be transferred to 250 water street, think about the precedent we are setting for all of the landmarked and historic districts throughout New York City, so I'm hoping that everybody votes in favor of this resolution. Thank you so much perfect. So I think with the use of all of our technology and everybody else, I do not see any other hands up for anybody who did not get called on for the public session. I'm checking Colin you're, my backup. Have you looked lucian, I think you're, good, okay, fantastic. So with that we're going to close the public session, I completely appreciate every single person who has come to the meeting and spoken up. You have been heard and recorded so with that we're going to move into the business session. Let's get the agenda up and going and do I have a motion to adopt the September, the September minutes. Listen to minutes fantastic. Second, I second awesome. So if I have no abstentions or recusals or names can I assume the minutes are adopted, awesome moving on Mariama treasurer's report and by the way, just want to announce that this is the closest the fastest public session and public hearing I've had since I got here, so you right, despite all those very important issues, that was amazing. Exactly so. Thank you. Everybody take it away. Thank you very much Madam chair, so this should be pretty quick too. We, as of the fiscal year end, we had a balance of 161,209. Of that very nominal amount has been spent. We had a training for the benefit of the board. Members that is listed here and another 500 that has been is part of a like an inter- company transfer to get it from one account to the other, nothing to be concerned about and the rest is salaries for either the office employee. Well, all the office employees, but either the directly employed by the office, employees or the contracted employees salaried or contracted right, and that's it. So now we have 157,709 any questions. Remember questions during the business session are for board members only the public. If you have a question you can send it to the host and one of the office team, will try and answer you, but for any board members any questions, that's the report. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mariama for seeing no hands raised. We move on to the district manager's report, lucian hello, everyone, it's great to be back. I missed you all last month, most of my report is we had a baby, and so I have devoted most of my my time to diaper, changing and feeding and bouncing said. However, we were able to do a couple other things I was able to help Tammy in responding to the the very out of nowhere proposed shelter, move and the injustice for the occupants of the Lucerne hotel on the upper West side, and that was, I think, a very successful, a public forum, and so I just want to thank everybody. It was really at all hands on deck affair and we had an immense assist from the Manhattan Bro president's office, and so for that we are eternally grateful next week, I'll be meeting with the department of design and construction, the department of Transportation to discuss my proposal to have them include Joseph P Ward Street in their upcoming reconstruction project. As there are myriad issues with the drainage of the water, especially that is now part of a very important pedestrian overpass crossing route. We want to make sure that everything is kind of perfect all four seasons, so I'll be pushing to make sure that the water drainage is addressed as fast as possible. With that, I want to thank the leadership and especially the staff for carrying on my duties. While I've been out, I really do appreciate it, and you know it is a lot of help and a lot of peace of mind that allowed us to really focus on the baby. So, thanks to all of you cool well and if you were here early in the meeting, those who came early got to see baby. So you know the early bird got the pick so sorry for those who did not come early next time, all righty. Moving on from our district managers to the chairperson's report, this is going to be the fastest shared person report ever simply because I think you've seen enough of me this month. So let's move to the this is eight years after super storm Sandy. There are a lot of milestones that we'd like to remember positive ones. This, unfortunately, is not so this is a combination of what we call leadership at work. This is the Community board chairs, have all come together to ask and discuss the progress of what was originally known as the big? U of vision for the 10-mile stretch with the physical and social infrastructure. So this is a combination with her buildback design, CB1 CB2, the city, CB4 CB6, and really it's for a nice general overview, because the most important thing is not only what happens in CB1, but if we can't connect to our neighbors and we can't do something holistically- we've actually doomed the city from the start. So this is a topic that I know is near and dear to many on our board, and we hope that you can join us tomorrow night. It's a nice collaboration and then I do hear and saw in the chat that there are also hyperlocal discussions happening as well. So with that, I'm going to ask everybody to stay in touch. Please look. This map is what has been given to us. This is governor's island if you do not recognize it because of the two development zones that are there understand that this is a dialogue and a conversation happening now in community board, one because it's our jurisdiction, but it is an amazing public asset for everyone all of New York. We did outreach to Cbe, 2 and 6 in Brooklyn to try and have them be able to opine, because they have not had a public presentation since September 2018 and have not heard the most updated information. We talk about it on borough board and talk about it with your neighbors. This is not just ours, it represents everything for the city and one of the last true large, open spaces. So keep in mind. We have a lot stuff happening in CB1. Please pay attention to this as well next, and I think with that, I'm going to end officially the chair report and move into our executive committee report. 52 Williams. We have a temporary shelter that is, there was a resolution that we talked about because there there's been a lot of comments that have come from the city that do not accurately reflect the work that we've done in community board. One to not reflect any of the statements we've made do not reflect anything that borders on the truth, and there are lots of references to things that are happening from the city. So the resolution is generated and started from 50 to William, and it basically says we would like public engagement and transparency. Let's see, does anybody have any questions on the resolution we can put it up if we need to with that. I see no hands we're going to do roll call, because it's the first resolution and you're calling which one of you is doing roll call Hey Brittany all right you're on when I call your name, if you could say your name and then your vote. That would be great and maruso and Marissa Okay Burton blank alice Blank, yes, Brown, Kennedy, Brown Kennedy, yes, Vicki, Cameron, Vicki Cameron. Yes, we did not say your full name. There, cassell, yes, Chang. Yes, thank you to Cole Susan Cole, yes, Kucia, Justine Kucia! Yes, thank you! Cunningham Curtis, Francis Curtis! Yes, thank you! Airmen women! Yes getting hungry already, Flynn! Yes, oh sorry, tran curve. Yes friedman! Yes from yes, Galloway, yes, Joyce on the line, we have to unmute him by phone I'll come back. Okay, Lewinson sounded like she said: you're welcome! Mahoney! No! Thank you! Yes, my hawk yes ciao! Yes, thanks selter Zelter, yes thank you. Do we have Amarusa Burton Chu Cunningham? Yes, I think. Can you hear me now yeah? I can hear you. Oh okay, great! Thank you. My hawk or Tedesco. Okay. Great motion passes. I'm sorry Brittany. Did you get Eric Hook up, Sagan Eric Jesse? Oh Jessie? Is he? Is he a yes? I do not see him here, so I think he's absent so far. Okay. So it's going to bring us to the conversation, so we were alerted by DHS yesterday that they will be moving people into 52, Williams Street. We do not know much of the details yet, but we are waiting to hear it was more of a notification than anything else. We had no answers yet on how many people, when what the capacity is, we do not have a contact for their operator. We just do not have any information that I can share other than to let you know that the mirror has decided he'd like to move people in. So that is what that is. There will be further discussion and everything that happens as soon as we get it, basically, which then puts us to the mayoral executive order. Does anybody have any questions on this? Okay, so I mean I do. If I could. I was trying to find a hand up thing. That's okay is the mayor aware or if he is, he probably does not care, but is he a problem for the most part? I can't speak for everybody, but, for the most part was not the Lucerne man. I mean this moving additional people, typically these from Lucerne that we did not want here. The complaint or the problem has been, or the concern has been that it is patient period for anyone to move into at an inappropriate time during a pandemic. He has to know that some of his colleagues on the city Council have called for a moratorium. What is being said about that? If anything, how straight of an answer, would you like give me what you got whatever hit me with your too best so sad? I mean the answer that we got was community boards do not weigh in on sighting of shelters and that the temporary shelter is being done for emergency needs, and this is where the emergency is. I was going to add that the men that are being moved in there now not from the Lucerne supposedly are being moved in there for de- densifying due to Covid-19 right and the densification is because they can't be added at the moment to the shelters that are full from the densification okay, and that is something that's allowable, even or under the recommendations even by the CDC, is if it's, if that's the specific reason to my understanding, so I guess that's that. Thank you. Welcome Colin, just a point there of clarification. These are families, correct, they're, not men, no they're, just men, just men. Okay, to your point, they are planning on citing a adult family shelter in lower Manhattan, which will be men and women and or people with adult children yeah that's different. That's a permanent shelter and yeah. I just sorry. First I thought really quick. Go ahead. Go ahead! Yeah! I just for anyone who's wondering why I'm consistently voting no on this. For me, it's just an issue of compassion and wanting to help people who desperately need help. I do not know how to vote. Since there is a resolution I can't vote for. So that's why I'm voting, no, because I desperately want to help these people and that's where I'm coming from so do we we're trying to help them cite one okay justine. So this is just more of the same basically, this next move. That was my question when you said it, no notice. No, nothing and some color was given to it by Mariama's question, because this is within a legal authority, because it's an emergency d densification, that's what I have been advised. Yes, there you go well there we go all right. Frankly, I'm grateful that they actually called us and told us, because it does give us an opportunity. We do have an amazing bid in that area, and it's really good for us to be able to let the bid know so once they find a location for the men to smoke an ideal situation that they'll be. You know appropriate canisters and quality of life, things that help everybody in the way, instead of knowing some information is better than none. So that makes sense and to Colin's point is yeah helping these people. All of them is what should be our goal, and I think I think that's what's made me comfortable with the Community board's response- is that it seems as if there has been concern for the for the actual homeless and part of what I liked was actually having some of the members of the homeless population at Lucerne appear and speak at our meeting, and I think that we should be doing more of that, and I applaud it. Thank you yeah. I just want to respond to that. This is the end of it. For me, I won't keep talking about it, but for me where I was initially turned off was how people were classifying the people that were moving into this facility in a way to try and either move it or deflect it or delay it was. It was offensive for me in a day where we're talking about social justice we've some of the people on previous calls I've been on. I do not remember who were talking about the dangers and how these people are dangerous to the community and children around or schools around. I found that really offensive. I thought it was deeply offensive. My wife works you're, exactly right, colin. What's that hundred percent yeah, the beautiful firefighting and we talked a whole bunch about protecting people on at city Hall, we talked a lot about putting the word violent in the protests, but everyone rejected this out of hand as violent people who are a danger to the community. That's just that's all I want to say I'm done with it. I do not want to start, but that's where I'm coming: okay, Colin and Justine. That's not how we on community board one have done any of this thus far. That is not who we are so far, and I hope that we remain who we are. We have been trying to advocate for the best location to provide the best possible care for the people coming in through the shelter system. Objection to 52 William was more in terms of its. You know. We have this amazing sidewalk study that talked about where you can social distance. The needs that they have and how it fits into the urban landscape did was not appropriate for 52 William. We actually did offer other sites so having those dialogues are important. It's not like. We do not want to help people. For goodness sakes. We've supported having shelters here before we voted for a women's shelter, as Susan reminded us in family shelters, so yeah Bruce. I wanted to make myself because just to say that they've moved other people and is implicit of the fact that we were in opposition to the men themselves at the Lucerne, and I did not like the feel of that at all mariama. We have never said that as a community by just saying: oh yeah, we moved other people, so maybe you now you're satisfied. We did not put the loose tournament in. I resent that information yeah look. My hope is that we have people from communities from who are on our streets will be able to have shelter. That's really what that's about all right, bruce last question, and then we have to call a question. I heard that you I heard you just say that we did in fact suggest and put forth viable alternative places within our community board. Is that correct? We offered a suggested area of locations and we're waiting to hear back from DHS on that. So if I hear back off, you know so that's geographic, but do we have any idea whether there are actual facilities or structures within those areas that could possibly house these people? Yes, okay, that's good! Thank you! Okay, so the mayoral executive order was simply about. We are past the precipice of where we are in this pandemic. New York has been. You know the mayor's been out there talking very often how our schools are now the model of how to operate in a pandemic, how we are past the height how things are easing, so it is time to take a look at the executive orders and restore some checks and balances back to the way the city operates, and so that is what this one is we're going to. Can I call the question yeah I will call the question or second date, whatever I can do. I'm sorry, I'm sorry we'll be on the budget. That's next! That's nice! So, with the mayoral executive order, now it's been seconded so we're going to go the way we do other resolutions. Do I hear any no's mahoney? No fine, any other no's james, no any others! I have to abstain because I do not have a copy of the resolution. No problem. I do not know where it was. Okay, no problem, that's timely! Yes, okay! So are there any other abstentions or recusals? Okay motion passes. Now we are on to capital and budget expense for year 2022 I'm going to have lucian unmute, because there were a couple friendly amendments that have come in Lucien. Can you go over them? Certainly, Tammy Diana. Would you put the from the amendment feet up yeah? I got it, I'm pulling it up right now. Thank you and Tammy. Is this the time to talk about what was brought up in the public session before the public session? Hey raise your hand yes and be let loose and go first yeah Diana. Could you go to page two we'll start with page two, since I think I know what is going to ask about. Oh, let's see hold on. Oh wait go back to page one, I'm sorry, I get the oh there. It is it's not on page one justine. If you look at item seven and eight, the agencies cut off because there's so many letters, that's DOH mh. So that's a couple items that were just I'm sorry there's a baby in the background. No that's: okay, but yeah, you're right. That is it! Thank you! Yeah. They were discussed in the quality of life meeting and pat mentioned to me that she was going to move for a friendly amendment, so I included it in this list because I wanted everyone to have a good visual idea of what items are being offered to be included after the executive committee meeting. So starting from the top repair the Collect park, Pond fountain. The next is Reopen park road to vehicular traffic. These are both expensive items and the next item is also expense. Construction of bus stop in front of Ps276. I'm assuming that this is an expense item, because the materials are not very expensive and I do not suspect that there's a need to do any kind of number four install public bathroom at one Center street Plaza. This was brought before the board. The board supported it. I've had this listed as capital Reopen, World Trade, Center streets. I have this listed as capital traffic calling measures for second place and battery place. These are just the friendly amendments that were not included in the 100 that we have already done got it thanks, see ex and so number seven. This is expense and we're beginning with Jmh items, expand, do dohmh race to justice, program to all city agencies and number eight, which is a companion item fund race to justice, training for Cbo's community- based organizations within Cd1. Whoever could somebody go through a mute? Someone has a little sound, leaking number nine establish a ferry route to Rikers island from the East River ferry docks this just to expand on this. A little bit is. This is an opportunity to actually the issues of that was the borough jail plan was attempting to address in part, and that is giving quicker and more convenient access to Rutgers Island for Defense, Council, friends, family and other are those who are incarcerated at Rikers island on a you know, short term or a long, depending on what happens with the borough jail plan. Next page, please. Actually, it also fits in lucian, because if you remember there was an announcement by the city this week that they're going to close in Dc move everybody up to Rikers for something, so it would even be more meaningful yeah and our infrastructure is already in place and I believe that they would just need to put a floating dock to accept citywide ferry at Rikers. The next is a ferry route to Governor's island year-, round city-, wide ferry route to Governors island from lower Manhattan 11 harbor school pool. This is something that we heard. Someone in the public session mention construction construct, a pool for the aquatics program, open a second harbor school building as well. Those are all listed as capital to the Economic Development Corporation. So I'm sure that's the right last two, but I that's an educated guess so bluesome just sticking two cents in and then I'm going to shut up. I have something to add: that's not there! You have a friendly amendment. What is your friendly amendment? My friendly amendment is talking about the trainings, whether it's from race to justice or whatever that place was called. I can't remember now because I do not see it on the board, but some place but someplace, making the trainings for community board members, not just CB1, but all community board members, even the trainings that were already put out there ends up, even though I did complain because the first set of trainings were made available during the daytime working business hours. So then they did take upon themselves. The board for President did make some evening hours available. I could not make those either. I had work, events scheduled and they were just very much. There was not much notice and I could not make it. I could not make it. I took none of them. So justine is the question that you would like them to be available monthly, I mean or make them available online and do it sort of more like what corporations do. I do not know if there's a cost associated with that, but like in a corporation, you have to do annual diversity trainings, whatever the hell you're going to be doing. You have to do them and they tell you have six weeks to get this done and then they make you answer a question and then you get a little certificate. So your friendly amendment is, you would like the city to provide training available online services available for everyone forever for community board members and make it mandatory within a period of time and make it happen. You can't make it mandatory for community board members all right. Well, we can ask they won't because if you I mean, if you make it mandatory and say you have to show up here and now I can see that being a problem, justine just just a point of just to clarify for the budget, it's not as much as what they should do, but what so we're asking them to fund something? Okay, we can't say that it should be made mandatory. Okay, we can say- and this is the language I've added so for item so diane. This is back on page one. I like what was there for seven and eight as it was. This would be another item. Oh well. I think that I think, based on what you're asking, because you want this- the available community board members. We are technically a city agency, so it fits within the city agency item and so the I modified the last the sentence to read at the end propagate the teaching support program across all city agencies and make all trainings online and an at your own pace, option. Okay, that would work. I do not see it here, but okay. I added that to the database got it got it yes at your yes and making it available. That would be helpful. Okay, so Justine with that added. Let's move forward, let's get! Let's colin, if your hand is done, put it down justine if you're done put it down. Andrew is next miriam. If you've spoken and you're done, please put your hand down Andrew go ahead: tammy apologies! If this was mentioned- and I missed it- but do we offer any prioritization in terms of budget requests and prioritizing top 10 needs? That is an older system. I do not believe it still exists, but illusion I do not believe prioritization is, is the same as it used to be. It used to be their big fights over prioritizing and I do not really think that's so much of a thing now. Thank you, okay. You're. Welcome any other questions, any other comments. Okay, alrighty, perfect. I think with that we're going to call the question, because this is a resolution and we will be done and move on with this. Do it so we're going to go the same way. We've done this before. If I hear any no's, any abstentions or recusals, okay, capital expense budget for year, 2022 has passed, has joined us. Was he here for the first two resolutions mark? I need you here right now. I see him mark I'm going to unmute. You just mark. Okay, carry on sorry, I'm that's where we go all right so to close out the executive committee, because it's been a really busy month. We had a presentation twice with D.O.T about the Warren Street Bike Cargo Bike Corral, suggested in relation to whole foods Amazon. The resolution failed in Executive Committee. I did ask D.O.T to return next month to transportation, we're going to put an invitation out for them to return with whole foods, because part of the problem that we have is whether or not other they took the whole block and whether or not questions needed to be answered specifically buy whole foods or places like. Why did not they look at the front sidewalk that they have? Why did not they look at maybe any of the space on West Street and all the other things versus Warren Street. We asked for them to come back and to understand better from DOT if there was a potential for a temporary versus permanent, so it could be a try it before you buy it kind of a thing. So, with all of those questions in hand, while we might not make their scheduling season, we we went we're asking them to come in November all right and I'm not going to show slides because it'll be the third time they've seen them this month. Okay, four hands are still up hat you go yeah, I mean to me. The biggest issue is: why are we supplying public space for a very successful company that makes a lot of money? If they need space for their bike deliveries, they then they need to supply and pay for that space. That was my objection. Well, that's one of the things that when they return for transportation, hopefully you can join and ask okay. Bruce is your hand just still up. This is a yes. My hand is up. There are a lot of issues to discuss tonight. I just want to say that there was a publication sent to me by someone sympathetic to the publication, whom I know that quoted Mariama and myself and posed our opposition as a NIMBY item that for environmental purposes and biking purposes, we were not willing to sacrifice six parking spaces and, as Pat said, that was not it at all it. What my opposition Mariana's opposition, although I want to speak for her, she can speak for herself. Is that we're tired of giving our taxpayer money large, successful private institutions? Let them put in the bike that now and pay for it so marion? If I'm, if I'm speaking out of turn, okay mitch, your mix- yes, the other thing that I just for people that were not at the other the meeting well, the opposition reason was that we found out from D.O.T that this was done as a direct deal between whole foods and D.O.T without any community. You know, what's the word, maybe help me out like when a licensee for a restaurant comes. They have to post notice of that, there's going to be a meeting of something, and this was done without anything posting without it was basically done as a backdoor deal. So whether you fought against it, the process was totally irregular and that was another reason to that why we voted against it. Well, as I said, they're coming back, let's have some open minds on how to find a way to get more delivery, vans off the street and more cargo resolution. I do not think that's a bad thing, but it goes into transportation and let's have it go back there. Mariama is your hand still up and mitch, please put your hand down. Yes, mine was still up too so sort of what bruce spoke to he and I were named, but a number of people were quoted and the title of this thing was that, like a basically a panel of NIMBY people, you know refused bike parking for to save five spaces and, as you know, and anybody that attended the meeting, that is absolutely not why and to use. They use a piece of my quote and again, like I said name me so really they misquoted me because I very specifically said the reason that I was uncomfortable taking spaces away from the members of the public that belonged to the public city parking was because I did not feel comfortable, giving it to a corporation like whole foods, Amazon and Jeff Bezos. I was very clear on that, so just to set the record straight, although Jeff I mean Bruce has also mentioned it, and Pat has also alluded to it as well. That's all! Okay, all right! So without anything, let's move on to our committee reports and keep in mind it's 7.46. I know the budget was big. I know a lot of this is big, but let's rock and roll justine, it's up to you. Okay, well I'll, be quick! It's going to focus first on the resolution, please for supporting the 80 20 tenants and landlord at 225 rector place in Battery, Park City. I think this was passed around. We voted in the committee six in favor. One abstained. The public member one public member voted and was in favor. I can go through the history. If people want to hear it, I need to see faces. If they need to say, do you should I go through it all or not the committee I'll put up the resolution. Would you like that sean? Well, it says Executive committee, we're done with that. I'd just like to see here. That makes sense. Go next. Let's yeah! Let's, like hang on a Sec, we're going to have them, do agenda up Yep Diana's working on it. I can see her in good point bruce. Thank you. There we go. Thank you so much for justine. If you have the resolution, can you put up the therefore be it resolved or the whole thing? Thank you. It's coming, I think, there's a little lag, but it's on its way. So, basically, as I think of the public sector in the public section, we heard some of the tenants speak. We've heard Quora from Margaret Chin's office speak in sort of support of it and, I think also was it luke from Lieu from Scott Sterner's office that spoke to in support of this resolution. Basically, what we're looking to do is have the parties come to an agreement that keeps the tenants in place until the end of Covid-19? That would be that's. What our ask is for this is a reference to a letter that was written by the elected officials sponsored by Margaret Chin. I think that's attached to our resolution, so Lucian was going to at the end of the day. What we want to do is have a something that kind of a win- win for both of them. Well, it's a lose- lose for both of them, because the tenants were living there under 421a provisions that expired in November 2019 after having extended for an extra 10 years. Long story it's in there because of a lease amendment. That was made between this landlord, who was an individual person and the tenants in May 2018. All their leases came due in April 2020., so it was all done good faith. Everything was done before anything happened and then cobot hit. So the landlord then one rector is a group of I think, 17 or 18 private individuals that have gotten together to buy a bunch of properties. So we're not talking about lefrak organization as a big entity, but we're still talking about people who have some money and we're also talking about now down from 60 units that were affordable, housing down to 13 units in the building and we'd like to keep them in place as much as possible for as long as possible. Within reason, and that's what this amendment is. That's what this resolution is asking for anybody, any questions. I see a handout from mariama all right, Mariama. Thank you. I'm saying that Murray I'm going to hand. Is it up? Go ahead? No, I'm sorry, I'm going to take it down. I support your resolution. Thank you. Anybody else asked all right. Let's call the question, then I can't call it can I you can second it. I can. Second it all right, so we're going to go the same way. We've been doing all night. If you, unless I hear from you, are there anyone who is a no any abstentions? Any recusals okay motion passes excellent. I'm still waiting for Mark to respond. Yeah me too, so just no vote for each resolution. So far so far we have no vote for Mark. I do not know where he ha. I hope he's. Okay, yeah and the other reports they're really not much to talk about the census. Family is over and it's done so we're done, and I think we actually got a report on that saying that New York ended up doing pretty well, so that was that brookfield properties report. I believe the construction at 200 Liberty street is finally finished. So the loud noises that people have been complaining about should be done. The restaurant the new restaurant has not opened yet, but I was seeing people put the little finishing touches on it as I walked by this morning this afternoon, and I really have nothing much else to add: we've got a new Statue, Mother, Cabrini Statue opened up in Battery park city, it's rather lovely and that's it. Anybody have questions about battery park, city or anything to add about or anything that's going on there any questions, any issues having seen no hands. Let's move to the next committee. So let's move the agenda up and ask Paul Goldstein. Okay. I think I could also be quick. We do not have any resolutions. We did have a lively discussion on a number of topics: let's go through the slides very quickly. First one was titanic memorial lighthouse. This is a proposal by an organization, friends of Titanic Lighthouse restoration that is spearheading an effort to restore that monument. As you can see on this photo. The lighthouse originally was atop this building at the battery, and it was moved a number of years ago. I forgot about 25 years ago over to the seaport site and it's fallen into disrepair and I think there's a lot of support for improving it. I know the community board already passed a resolution with the Landmarks committee supporting this in concept, so we did not do any further resolutions on it, but are there any other slides to show Diana just keep going so this gives you some idea about what they have in mind. They have to remove it. They have to bring it off site. They said it would probably take about a year to restore it and would have to be moved, probably to Alabama to do it there, and there are a number of groups involved with this, and there seems to be a little bit of a dispute between this organization at this stage and the seaport museum, but we did not really get to the bottom of it. So that's really all there is to say about that. Okay, next, neighborhood! Well, is the seaport museum on the agenda elsewhere at all. Do you know? Well, you could say it is with the landmark resolution regarding the air rights. Okay, thank you. Okay. Next we got a report from Nazarene Sarya Saryai and she had been our community planning fellow. She has departed us, but she came back to offer her report, which she did not have an opportunity to present because of Covid-19. So she did a good study to look at. What's going on in community board, one look at the demographics look at the changes that are taking place in population. I know a lot of board. Members are somewhat familiar with this, but it's good information for those who are not as familiar as some of us so keep going diane. So again she tried to prioritize the needs of the district, repairing parks and building new parks keep going. This was our inventory where she identified 108 open spaces, including lots of parks, plazas and esplanades and 57 pops. So if you count all that, we have what seems like a lot of open space, but I've learned over the years when I see a mental impact statement, saying that the Trinity Church graveyard is part of our open space inventory that you can't always take these things totally seriously anyway, is with the increase in population. The amount of space for the community has technically gone down. Could we keep going okay? So here we go prioritize, maintain and preserve access to our spaces, improve the quality, additional open spaces, investment, etc. So these are all excellent recommendations that we will try to act on keep going Diana. She identified some specifics, Brooklyn banks that we should try to get back, and that is one of our budget priorities and we have a new member who's very interested in working on this. So I'm happy about that and all right, I think you get the picture with this report. Why do not we move on to the next item? Okay, so let me just go quickly. Through the remaining Items City Hall park, we got an update from Skip Bloomberg who's. The president of friends of City Hall park he's worked for many years on that park in conjunction with the community board, so he gave us an update. Things are improving, but there's many parts of the park that had been closed for quite some time due to circumstances have been reopened. Not so much the northeast plaza, that's remaining closed and barricaded, so he and the organization would love to see that reopen, and so would we, the committee, so we're working on that where we did put in several of their items that they asked for in the budget requests. I do not know if you saw them, but you know things like improving broken pavers and trying to get more staff for the park, etc. Okay, and we're also going to try to get the partnership for parks to work with different organizations. That's coming up at our next meeting and we did have a couple of very quick updates on City Hall park. Really the biggest update is that pierce 26 is now open. It's beautiful! I was over there for the opening, so it's andrew, it's magnificent! It's a great space that has sunning lawn sports playing areas, lots of seating and they have magnificent areas to approach the water and get a sense of the environment of the Hudson river. So I urge people to check it out. It just opened a couple of weeks ago. We were also informed that they are working with citigroup to restore ferry service from pier 25, I believe, and they also added hours so that they're starting a little earlier city groups hours have expanded because of Covid-19 they're trying to have people not in the building all at once. So they asked us if we could allow the ferry to start earlier so far, the board reports, no complaints have come in. So we're going to continue to monitor that situation. Andrew gave a very thorough report about the advisory council and, what's going on there, it seems like they're, going to get more meetings going and what else compost sites have been restored, including on pier 25, so I'll leave it at that. So we could keep going. Thank you Paul, totally appreciate that that's going to move us along Diana to the where it's Jeff Myhawk. If he's here for Euthan, Ed or Trisha, I have not seen either of them in there tonight. You so be joining us this evening. So I do not see Jeff. We can come back to you thin end. If, unless wendy you want to, were you at ethernet this month? Do you want to present over there? I was at youth in Ed, but I do not feel like. I should speak Patricia, okay. So what we're going to do is we'll move youth and ed to call back we'll come back to them. Bruce landmarks, hi, very short agenda. 60 calls just three we could even skip. It was just a polite revisit of a applicant who was very nice and just wanted to show us an amended design that we had that we had discussed in the pre and wrote a resolution for in a previous meeting regardless plaza. This is a it's one of those we are so sympathetic as a community board over so many years to the friends of bogartis triangle, which has now spent years doing a wonderful job converting this, which was a piece of roadway and concrete into a beautiful pedestrian space and small park, and over the years we have worked carefully with the friends of regardless triangle, and they have worked carefully to create a contextual and you know, seemly Park, at a very crucial place in the on the border of the Tribeca West, historic district. It's where Hudson street and West Broadway Meet at chambers and read. We were presented out of the blue with the construction almost complete and it's another dvc construction job that is years years late with the desire to put a very large kiosk in the park. This is this is brand new. If the after years, we understand that the friends of a bugattis triangle which is now being called bogardus Plaza need a stream of revenue to maintain the plaza. It's not really for capital, it's for maintenance because, as you know, most of our public spaces, except things like Brooklyn bridge park and Hudson river park, which come under the umbrella of a trust, are losing their their money to maintain their spaces. However, this is what we got and I do not know if we have other slides from the presentation. All I want to point out is that, after years of contextuality and care, D.O.T and reluctantly friends of bogardus are proposing this generic giant kiosk. You know which will be rented out to a retail food establishment to match the bus stops and those ridiculous metal little benches, with little middle round parking bike parking loops that in ten years have met I've, never seen a person sit on or use as a bike stand that rhyme West Broadway. But this is to match all street furniture, generic Street furniture, glass and metal in New York, and when they were making the presentation D.O.T, they specifically showed us bus stops as the as the contextuality. So we agree that we agree that this is good and necessary, but we think they should go back to the drawing board. That's rather long- winded, I'm sorry, but that's it. So, let's call the question: do I hear a second because I do not see any hands up and it was a fairly thorough thing. Second, okay. Awesome. Second question: if we vote what are we voting against? We want them to go back to the drawing board right. That's what we're about yes, correct! We do not like bus stop kiosks. We want something: that's contextual, to the location. Okay, so yes means we're, saying that correct all right. Any of any other questions comments all right. So since it's been called in second in we're going to assume again that everybody's ea are there any no's if you are voting no abstention or recusal, please state your last name in your vote card once going twice. Fantastic motion passes unanimously. Thank you bruce anything else, bruce all good. I got a nod. Thank you. I'm sorry. I was on YouTube all right we're moving on to environmental protection. This is going to seem like an odd presenter for this group, but our fearless vice chair was unable to make the meeting Colin, take it away from the Environmental Protection Committee. Yes, I was the guest host with the Mostest tonight would like to say that I ran a very quick and efficient meeting I'd like to think anyways yeah alice, please jump in and save me at some point, but we had three pretty big and contentious issues. One of course was 250 Watt Street, where Laura Dodge talked about she's, the community's independent environmental consultant on the Tuesday Watershed Brownfield Cleanup program. She gave the status update on the remedial investigation, she's working with New York State Department of environmental conservation and the New York State Department of Health to continue collating all the data collected during the investigation. I'm definitely not reading from cheat notes. Our definitive elevated readings for certain substances like Mercury but Laura was hesitant to say anything conclusive about the findings until all the data is processed and published and we're about a month and a half away from that. If you have any questions that feel free to ask alice, the second one was from the city's lower Manhattan coastal resiliency, quarterly update. I found this one a little particularly interesting for me, given I'm a protagonist on the expansion program, but they talked a little bit about that. They also talked a little bit about resiliency plans. It's an ongoing thing. It was a quick just a quick update, as you can see on the plan here. This is a timeline, I'm oh, that's in the next point. Sorry, sorry and finally, how am I doing? Finally, on battery policy authority, resiliency update, you can see in the slides here from an example of the deployment from the last storm Isaias, where they basically tracked the time from deployment to picking it back up and alice. Help me out. I'm really feeling here perfect great you're, doing great colin you're doing great, thank you, which we talked small biz, but overall, it was just a night of updates on three really important issues to a lot of us on the environmental committee, particularly as it raised, relates to storm surges and resiliency projects. Of course, again my favorite personal project, the proposed expansion of the downtown shoreline, any questions colin. I just want to thank you, I'm sorry but wendy, and I were out of commission- and I do want to thank Tammy also for recognizing the community- wide discussion tomorrow night at six o'clock, eight years after Sandy. It's the first time that all the community boards will be joined to discuss is really critical, resiliency measures for lower Manhattan, so thank you. Mike Andrew has a hand up so Andrea apologies. This is a very broad question that probably requires a detailed answer, but I'm wondering, if there's a short answer to do. We have any infrastructure, that's been put in place since Sandy. Currently, that makes us any more resilient and if not, when do we think we'll have the first infrastructure in place to protect lower Manhattan. That's a that's a good question. You know the lower cup Manhattan coast. Resiliency is very segmented and compartmentalized as you're probably aware. So I would say that no, there is nothing in place. Yet there are, of course, interim measures as you're aware along Battery, Park city, for example. The ball fields- and we saw them, of course, during Isaiah, but we have no permanent infrastructure that I'm aware of that's in place, we'll be getting more information on this about this at the climate coalition meeting this Friday. But no, you know- and this is one of the reasons why we have to really push forward very strongly about seeing a lot of this go through and yeah. That's the answer, the short answer, I hope thanks Ellis, okay, anybody else have any other questions about that. All right with no questions from the board. I want to thank Colin for stepping in alice always for being on top of it join us, as you said tomorrow for the overview and then in the chat. There is another comment about a hyper local view, so if you need that we can copy that back, just chat to those all right, moving on to Dr Betty K with transportation street activity. Okay, thank you. This can be a little bit unusual because everything sort of went sideways this month. If you go to the next one because they're in a different order than that yeah sorry, this is the order I'm going to present them. If you go to the next one I'll talk about Revel, electric moped sharing and for those of you, who've, probably seen them around the district and go on. They were stopped by the city after two deaths and then came back later. But for those just to see you can see with all the blue areas or where you can leave there or pick up the Revel scooters. You can see on the to the right what they look like, so it's not throughout the district evenly, although it is for some other areas. Next, a couple of points I want to make. Since I get a lot of questions about this, there were changes of operation that did occur after to allow them to reopen where originally they just needed a driver's license, which again you photo the when you rent you photograph it. So they do have that. I d about you and you needed an account after they came back on August 27th, with 3,000 mopeds throughout all five boroughs. There's a training video, that's done through the app there is an in- app safety test, which was also mandated the photographic evidence of taking a selfie of the user wearing the helmet, and there are new penalties which are probably what will interest people more. This is where I hear from people they now have trackers on the scooters. They're also use the geo tags that tell them geographically, where these scooters are at any given moment. So, in real time in their offices, they can picture where all the scooters are operating at any given moment in time. They also have pings if the scooters go to a place mopeds where they're not supposed to be so they do know in real time, go on to the next one yeah. So they have a new suspension policy. So you know what happens if they do something they should not be doing. There are permanent suspensions, and this lists five different reasons, such as sharing your account or riding with a passenger under 18 riding on a sidewalk riding on a highway or anything with over 40 mile per hour. This is actually a little ambiguous and something I'm trying to straighten out, which is why there is not a resolution this month also failing to report an accident warnings or temporary suspensions for these other things are with the first offense, but then it rapidly increases up to a permanent suspension for those who repeat some of these errors, things like riding without a helmet or running red lights or stop signs things. They can't tell with their geotags the second two things that people complain about. They can tell in real time riding in the bike lane or on a major bridge or in a tunnel or in a park. They can also going the wrong way down a one- way street. They can tell remotely, if you see some of these things you go to the next one. There is a mechanism where you can complain about them, because reckless driving, yes, includes lots of things. If you see any of these things, some of them will not be picked up with the geotags and they do lead to temporary suspension, and I want you to know too Revel, even though they're aware does not shut off or slow the engines, although they could electronically do that, but they are concerned about the potential harm to the user. Hence they let them complete their ride, and then they put them into suspension. The person finds out they can't rent again various times you go to the next yeah. If you're doing a report by all means, if you want the Revel app to put on, there's no cost to it, you can report any transaction, any things you see wrong out on the street. You can also go online or call it into Revel. If you give them the location and the time they can identify who's on which scooter. So it is very effective. Any questions about Revel scooter because I'm, I am planning a revolution. A resolution next month, like I said, I'm still waiting for some information from the DOT to clarify what a highway is and what is West Street, because that they do not have an answer. You've got a couple hands up. I have a question but I'll wait to the end. Let Bruce go first bruce. First, you have done mute yourself, who's on the phone he's on the phone okay. So I'm going to ask my question first and then he can come back. One of the things that I have a curiosity about is the GPS system that they use for, judging where it is, and rather I'd like to understand how definite it is because I've seen rebel scooters on the bike path on the greenway, and it's almost nigh impossible to understand. If they're on the greenway or 9A, I would assume you know, based on GPS only that kind of delineation I've seen on the Hudson River Park Advisory Council, there's been a lot of dialogue about the dangerousness. The danger is conditions caused by motorized bikes and specifically, they have mentioned Revel. So my question is to understand how their GPS system detailed it is, how finite it is and really understand. How can they tell the difference between the Greenway and 9A? How do they know? You know if they've traveled off into pier 26? Do they know that? Can you tell, for example, if someone's dismounted and walked it over there? No, they can't tell the difference if it's being moved, however, well speed, they could. On the other hand, they do not really care if it does not belong there, it does not belong there. Okay, all right! Thank you. These are not motorcycles. These are motor scooters. They do not go fast mopeds, but New York, State and New York City require very strict motorcycle licenses for not for most weather right, not for Nope, correct, they're, considered limited use. Motorcycles are mopeds, the maximum speed is 30 miles per hour, and so they do not require a license, a motorcycle license or training, which is why the DOT had required and they came back with their safety. App training was trying to get around some of those issues because there was concern about that. Are you pleased with where things stand? Am I pleased? Yes, I do not know if they care what I think but well what if he is doing sorry, but that was really odd. What is the informed consensus of the committee regarding the current state of Revel? It was actually very positive, but there were some concerns about things like West Street, which is why we're seeking clarification and I'm still waiting for that they can't go on tunnels. So those are, they can't go on major bridges, so those are excluded. They can not go on the fdr because that's a very obvious limited access, Highway, Canal, Street and West Street were the two bigger questions of do. They belong there and that's when the representatives from the DOT said you know, we just do not know those details yet and the Deputy Commissioner Santia Santina's, and so she is looking into it and obviously has to go to the state level to get final decisions. Thank you sure. Thanks bruce Andrew, you're next followed by Andrew is, I thought, alice had her hand up and it disappeared. So then, Justine Betty, quick question: how do account holders know where the mopeds are permitted to go and not so, for example, you know if they were going down West, Street and dismounted and got into the greenway or took it into pier 26. How would they know that it's not allowed there? That's partly what the test is supposed to be the test they have to take before they can activate. Okay, thank you, sure, justine and then Vicky. So I thought that he would correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that these things were a lot were able to go up to 40 miles per hour, which is why they were allegedly allowed on the West side highway. Do you think they had Lopez by definition by a New York State Motor vehicle is 30 mile per hour maximum, otherwise they're not a moped, their motorcycle, oh interesting, okay, whatever they did. I know that during our meeting Mitch Frohlmann looked, I think it was mitch. Looked up on Google and asked you know to figure out what West side highway was a highway or not, and they have listed it as a highway. But but you're right, the DOT, the deputy commissioner and she did not agree with that and in fact has gone through this. Instead, yes, she said she did not know. Okay, so she said back to us. The person who wrote wikipedia knew more than it actually exists, unfortunately yeah well, she needs to well. She will come back to us, which will be a very important factor on the computer right now on Google says: West Street is from the bottom of Manhattan up to 57th street and then technically it becomes the henry Hudson parkway. That's according to all the research, unless they've changed the rules well yeah, so I do not regardless. I think we all agree with that. These guys could not be on the West side. I have a point go to the meeting in November when we will have a possible resolution and that this will be discussed. That's the discussion should not be happening here because it has to happen in committee. Okay, get to a resolution and come back to us. Everybody be dude. There will be a resolution what's holding it up or may hold it up in. November. Is getting the final word of the DOT on how to classify West Street? Otherwise, that's fine. Next one second move on that's the ride. We did to hear about it and again another thing I had hoped next month to do a resolution on and now I'm going to end with asking people if anyone gets Daily, News, New, York, Daily News and has an electronic copy. An article came out today, which kind of blew up getting to this real quickly, saying that the MTA board is set to approve a far- reaching contract with ride, share companies, something like a half billion dollars and is to provide excessive ride services. So it's going to be a whole nother chapter to look at of what is the accessoride program? This is well. I did not have the resolution done it's going to be postponed longer, but if anyone can send me the article that would be great and next again the resolutions can be dependent on when we finally hear anything and Ann Street update was interesting and a couple of points I want to make as people bring them up. Yes, the claudio's has a specific problem. They do not have a fixed space, so they have to take down and build up every day which has created unusual problems such as to have a structured for any kind of enclosure difficult to do that when you're moving everything every single day. Another issue, the lunch trade very diminished- and I understand they've actually that the claudio's have just stopped doing lunch service. But for those who want to know it is because there are a few workers or tourists. The downtown alliance is working on addressing this problem for the restaurants in general, we're having the same problem, but I want you to know as well. The New York Times had an article today talking about elevators and how that will become the worst part of everybody's commute and in fact, how high rises will probably limit who's allowed to go down at lunchtime again, probably changing how things are done for lunchtime trade for these restaurants. Also, dots regulations for permanent outdoor dining are still being developed, but you should also know. While I talk about it being permanent, they are Prob. The rules probably are not permanent and will probably change sometime next summer or after the summer why the current use of streets by businesses is not sustainable for the DOT, so this is going to change. They just do not know how it's going to change. So this is all a moving target. It's an evolving issue, hey sorry, Betty, quick question! Yes, really quick! The plowing issue actually came up at the small business working group last night, so if Tammy's, okay with it I'd love to have my working group work with your committee on some sort of solution there, yes, and actually that's part of one of the problems with the use of the street space. There is so many demands coming up for the same street space that while they work on that, as well as the logistics about things such as plowing and sanitation yep. So one of the things I want to say is that we brought this up at Borough board betty. We are not the only community board district struggling with this and, in fact, any district that has historic streets of any kind. Hence the west village parts of the lower East side. Things like that having this regulation be permanent without a holistic look at things and understanding that not every street looks like 23rd and 14th, and you know the grid yeah. The borough president said that she is working on something, but I do not know what it is. So I do not want to speak with her, but it did come up by almost every board on borough board. Yeah, no Ed, Pinkar told Lucian, and I they're working on this. So it's a well- known problem and they're working on it yeah. So all I know is it's going to be changed yeah I mean for my purposes, for you know the Community Board of the people who hear all the problems get all the complaint, we're the ones that do the licensing and everything else. So I find it really very frustrating that the Community Board in itself was not included in any way in the process or the process for fixing just saying that sorry to interrupt, keep going. Well, I'm done unless there any questions, dancing, hello, Tammy, sorry, Vicki! I missed your hand. Go for it right and then francis that it's just a comment and a concern. I'm not I'm assuming that rebel scooters are a private entity right that is introduced yeah. So you know this year. Like many years in the past, we have a lot of deaths on the vice on the bike, accidents throughout the city and the boroughs, and now this year, for example, there's been a surge in bike deaths. I think a lot more people are riding it, but you know I was also speaking to some policemen around the corner when it was an incident- and I can not tell you how concerning it is to have these scooters. People do not even know how to ride a bicycle and we've had what four or eight hundred deaths or something, and so now you know this private entity is introducing scooters. Cops are telling me that you know people are getting killed because they're talking on the phone they're drinking coffee, they do not know rhodes rules, and so he said, they're not wearing helmets, and it just seems like another crazy idea. You know a bit like rollerblading everywhere until we all broke every bone, so I'm very concerned about the scooters and especially when they're in bike lanes buzzing, you know, all you need is one to go around the corner and someone else in a bike pulls out. Never thinking someone's going 30 miles an hour. I think it's a really dangerous proposition to just leave it sort of in the private hands, and it's just my thought. Oh thank you. It's. Unfortunately, cars are kind of the same way. At least cars have their roads, but you know if they're not going to, let them go on the roads, clear on the roads that the bicyclists are already getting killed. So I'm just a little concerned: people are now getting a bigger vehicle and a more powerful vehicle. It just seems like the killing fields, will begin. No are you talking about the scooters? They belong on the road with the cars, but you know they ride everywhere. Okay, I'm just saying people will be heard. These people do not know how to ride and follow traffic rules. Not everyone in New, York City has a license from a car, so they're just all over the place. I'm just saying a future hazard, okay. Well, they have a driver's license. So I recommend I recommend Vicki. You come to the transportation meeting in November and asked why I do not want to debate life with Betty, I'm just telling her. I ride a bike and it's really dangerous, and here she is battling me just say yes, I agree it's a dangerous thing in New, York City. It is if they're in bike lanes, yes and they do not belong there. Definitely and then Cora from the council member's office reminds all of us that we should not be using Google to take a look at what a New York state Highway is that New York State D.O.T has an official highway map and that is actually what the law goes by. So we can certainly take a look at those in committee. Everybody else. I do not see any other hands up Betty. You always just want. I emailed you the article, oh thank you Francis and tammy the copy awesome. Thank you. Let's see, I think that takes us out of transportation. Thank you so much and move this right into quality of life right so officer, Nelson came to speak to us about policing from the first precinct and we were able to ask him questions. One of my questions was: we've all heard that, because of the changes with police and dealing with the homeless, I wanted to know what was what were their instructions, so they were told that they were no longer allowed to do anything about the homeless, but they he said that was not really true, that they still will if they, if they get a 9-, 1- 1 call which they ask everyone to call 9- 1- 1. If you see a homeless person who is either dangerous to themselves or dangerous to anyone else, please call 9- 1- 1 they respond. They will do what they need to do once they respond and assess the situation. They are not allowed to remove anyone who is not dangerous, acting in a dangerous manner. They can ask to cajole them. You know and try to move them along, but they are, can not forcibly remove someone who is not presenting a danger to the public. So that was interesting to hear. He answered a lot of other questions that the committee had and he will come back again forever. Everyone should know that on October 29th, I think this is Thursday at 6. P.M is the first precinct community meeting, which I think we're going to send out or post on our website for people to attend and ask questions. Then we had New York State Housing legislation. We are going to move to November it's a big issue. There are a lot of housing bills that have been proposed by both assembly member new and Senator Kavanaugh. We are going to review the housing bills, but, of course we need federal aid. We need money from the federal government before anything can be done there. You know we need to have both for renters and mortgage people who you know, are having trouble with their mortgage through the pansending. So we're moving that to November. Let's see number three walking while trans we're moving to November, also number four racism as a public health. This was a great conversation that we had with Al Tontai, who is from the Department of Health. They have developed a program that is called race to Justice's, educational programs called race to justice, it's about racial Justice, Social, Justice and gender justice and the health care system. They are getting all of their staff to take this training. They are it's they're offering it to some of the other city agencies and that's why we ask that it be included in the budget money to be found so that all city agencies can participate in this and take this training. Let's see what else have we got the number five we're going to move to November and then number six is friends yeah, and I am the your representative to the New York presbyterian, lower Manhattan cab, and this was a very long meeting, and it was unfortunate that this item was number six, because the chief of the emergency Services Dr, Brenner Pharma- was she stayed. Actually she got there early and she stayed the entire holiday for the entire meeting, which lasted until almost 10 o'clock sometime. But it was a lot of discussion in terms of number four that was and the housing issue anyway. Dr Brenner Pharma came to tell us about the lower Manhattan is doing a lot of wonderful things with their telemedicine. They have a wonderful app that you can actually use one of the first apps that I ever that I've ever been on that you do not have to sign up your life in order to get in to see what's going on with the app. But you know, if you have a minute, you should download it. It's it's. The Nyp Connect App and you can find you can actually get a pass to go into the hospital on your app and you can also find out a lot of the services that they have, but they do a lot of telemetrics now and they also have- and I will be sending it around to and you might have received a copy already of the full virtual health and wellness lecture series that they have, and I know we Covid-19 we're all on our computers and everything is being done through Webex and zoom, and this is just something else to go through one of those channels, but they have a lot of interesting programs that you know you can do at your leisure and it's for the entire community and everybody. You just look and see what you're interested in and you can go and take it to take advantage of it. But I want to try to get them to come back and do a more extensive visit. But when we have a shorter agenda, different topics anyway, right Mariama did you want to add anything? No, okay. Let's take this great she's got it. Actually. I had my hands up. Oh while we're on the topic of the racism that we've been working on. I just feel like it's important to point out instances of systemic racism and implicit bias, and one is in an item that was discussed earlier in the Waterfront Parks Committee Paul went over damages that had been heard at city Hall. It was not necessarily clear- or at least I did not hear it- that a lot of the damage that was caused there was caused by NYPD and it was caused to those own and in some cases permanent damage are more expensive and expensive than any of the graffiti, which was you know, took all of two days to wash off and the reason why I'm mentioning it mentioning it in the context of racism is because much of the community was in the uproar when we had the graffiti and understandably so. I'm not. I do not take that, deny that, but not knowing at all how this other damage was caused or by whom it creates an image that these people over here damage things and make a mess, and that that's who's responsible. For that all that sort of thing others do not. It paints a very uneven picture. So in the interest of equity and fairness, I just wanted the community to be aware that damage did not just pop up a lot of. It is from the police parking on city hall. It's an important thing. You raise Mariama. Thank you. Bruce has his hand up and vicki okay. I just want to thank the Committee and Mariana and Pat for taking on this subject and making us part of that conversation so kudos to you. Thank you we'll try to keep it up vicky. Did you have your hand up still or no? It's done so I think with no other questions or comments Pat. Thank you very much. As always. Oh wait. Bruce Miriama! Are you good, or did you have anything else? I'm driving? I keep tipping driving. It's just no problem, gotcha, all right. So without further Ado, let's move on and fern Cunningham is going to take land use, Sony and economic development Small business yep. It is going to be common, so we're going to go one and then two all right: okay, hi! So this I have to apologize. That was a very long meeting. It was the first one I chaired and probably will never be allowed to tear again, but I thought the topics were really important and everybody was really passionate and it was really kind of hard to cut people off. So if I'm ever allowed to chair again I'll try and be more ruthless and do not worry so I will find a tone for that, though, by speeding up this report first topic was EDC came to talk to us about policing and management at the South Street seaport, which of course generated a lot of discussion. Oh right, Diana's like showing the slides and it's basically there were a lot of you know, questions and discussions about that because of how the the community's idea of the marketplace lease versus Howard, Hughes's idea of the marketplace. Has you know their implementation or plans are very different than what the community originally thought? It's changed over time, so that generated a lot of discussion, questions and so on, and then we moved on to the future of 250 water street, which also generated a lot of discussion, and it's actually what led to the resolution that we have for you tonight and you'll. Hopefully you all read it, and if you have questions we can I'll, probably toss it to Paul the other, the other. Do we want to look at this now? Laura yeah? Let's do this one by one. So, okay, the first topic was the South Street zoning you've already done releasing an asset management report. Let's see if anybody has any questions on the new market or the asset management. I see one perfect. So let's go for the resolution. What Diana go ahead Joe? Why did we? Why did sick people abstain from this resolution because at the meeting they did not have a chance to see it? We did not have it up on the screen and so people said that they abstained until they could read. It was that you know I was one of the people who was abstained, clear. What I was voting on it- I was not quite it's so clear to me that abstentions, count as no votes is that correct in a tie it does only in a time the resolution did pass the committee. So it's before the board and Joe. Let's be clear. The resolution when it's voted on in committee is not the official vote of the board. The official vote of the board is taken at full board that is what's circulated. I understand that Madam Chair, a quick point of information with regard to abstentions. It does not matter whether it's a tie or not. They count more or less as a no vote, because it's no versus weighted against yes, so it does not they're not only counted as a no and a tithe. Thank you very much patrick. Is there any need for me to explain anything about this? Do you want me to give a two- minute summary of what this issue is so people understand, or does everyone get it? What was the committee vote Paul? I think it was seven six something like that. Well, it's very close. Well, I think it would be helpful for you to summarize the gist of the resolution yeah nobody answers back and forth because otherwise we're going to be here 12 hours, so the committee vote was six and six, which means the committee whatever voted against it. But thank you publicly. Can I finish yes and if not for the one public vote, the vote would have been defeated. So I do not know what's going on there? That's all! Okay! Should I go? Let's go through you go first and then I'm going to call on Colin and then I'm going to call on alice okay. So, as you heard from some of the people in the public section, this is a an important component for the Community Board to present an alternative plan for the seaport. As we all probably are aware, by now, Howard Hughes has come out with their plan that calls for two high- rise buildings of roughly 47 floors or something like that in the seaport historic district. This community court is on record saying no. We do not want anything above 120 feet so in trying to come up with methods to create an alternative plan. First of all, everything that howard Hughes is proposing violates the zoning and also runs counter to how the seaport has worked since 1972. in 1972. The seaport was the first area set up to have these receiving sites and it set a precedent in the city. The city wanted to preserve the low scale in the district and by in doing so, they created this system whereby property owners were allowed to move their property values or their land use development rights out of the district. So that's been on record and it's been working since 1972.. This board got a presentation in 2015 of probably a half a dozen or more examples of this working where hundreds of thousands of the square feet of these development rights were sold off to these sites outside the historic district. Howard Hughes is proposing something completely different, which is to move the development rights into the historic district, which would obviously create an out- of- scale building. So we're trying to suggest there is an alternative. In fact, we've already been approached by one developer at 72 nassau, who's expressed interest in purchasing some of these development rights. The City Planning Commission has the power and they have in the past, created these so- called receiving sites throughout community Board. One some still exist, but we think by creating additional ones. It would make it easier to sell off those development rights and we would even encourage howard use to sell off theirs or transfer them out of the historic district. So that's what the resolution is all about. It's something this community board already supported when they went on record supporting the support coalition strategic plan. That was part of it Lemmy and I and others have had meetings discussing this concept with elected officials. So this is really nothing new. This has been around, as I said since 1972. I just want to officially go on record saying this is a better plan for the seaport and it would preserve the low scale character while at the same time allowing for money monies for the museum and affordable housing to be built outside the historic district and other improvements in the area. Now I did also put a couple of very small changes into the resolution that I can present right now. If you'd like in responds to a couple of comments that were made by committee members and others. Do you want me to go through that? It's very it's pretty quick! You do. Yes, that is important, because we are on record from what was discussed briefly. So it's important that you go through the changes that were done since then, and then it's going to be Colin, Alice and ariana by chance. Do you have that resolution with the edits that I put in that I sent to you? I do give me one moment to pull it. Oh, what do you need? Can you repeat it the resolution I have it. I just had to go grab it. I do have it, but I'd like to show it to people all right. Let me quickly start give her a second she's, putting it up now. Okay, great! Is this it scroll down and we'll see if there's any changes on the side or edits in it? I keep going down yes, this is it okay, so the first change that I put in is in that, whereas, as you can see with the red lettering here, whereas the South Street seaport, Historic District, has long had a mechanism in place to allow for the transfer of unused development rights from the historic seaport district too, and I just added the word designated receiving sites just to clarify what we're talking about. I do not think that's very controversial. I hope not. Could we keep going down okay now I put this one in the last, whereas because a couple of people pointed out to me that the language that I had in the second be it resolve where I suggested you know, we should move the development rights outside the historic district to create additional, affordable housing, etc outside I want to make it clear that we do not oppose and would support. You know, affordable housing within the historic district as long as it's not built above the allowable zoning. Okay. So that's what that's all about and then going down to those resolve clauses. Okay, if anyone has questions, let me know and going down to the resolve clauses. I had some objections, particularly from alice with the word monetizing that I had used in the original resolution. So I changed that and removed it and I, as you can see, I used supports transferring development rights in these two resolve clauses. The resolution is pretty similar. I did also remove the other mentions of sites that could possibly be resaving sites, because I think it would be simpler to just move it along and not be so specific. Okay, let's hit the questions colin you're, first yeah, the only thing I was going to ask Paul's if this is really complex stuff and it took me a while to get there, but I just want to say publicly: I'm there I probably started the abstention for the best in the original vote, but I changed from extension to supporting it, and I want to speak publicly in support of this, but maybe I can try it for you. What you're essentially saying is the air development rights? Can stick generally in one region, but this would allow them to move it outside that region and we're in essence, taking a little bit of power away from Howard hughes to build a gargantuan tower. Is that a simple version of this well? The bottom line is they were never allowed to add, receive, put a receiving site inside the historic district or to add these development rights there? That's what Howard Hughes is proposing to do yeah, and we just think there are alternate solutions to move those development rights and pay for the needed improvements to the community yep. So I just want to speak in firm support of this. We need of the fight against. What's going to be a huge project, I think this is a very good one. Thank you. Awesome thanks, Colin Alex you're next Andrew. Oh, I want to thank Paul for entertaining some of this discussion and amendments. I think that I'm in full support of it. I think what we learned from this is simply that all resolutions- and this one was a particularly complex and important. One- must be discussed fully and written in committee. I think that is why we see the abstentions answer to Joe's question and that would have been avoided had Paul and all of us had the time to really review this and go over this. So thanks Paul and I'm in full support thanks. Thank you, alice Andrew. So it's just two questions and I'm not sure I'll. Ask the first question correctly, but is there a dispute between the current zoning within the historic seaport district and what can happen as of right on this location? And then my second question: is it implied, or is it explicitly stated somewhere that we're seeking to have those air rights transferred within CB1, as opposed to elsewhere in the city, or we do not care all right? The first question is those are the same things to build as of right or to build according to the zoning. They mean the same thing. So it's not the case that I thought there was a point in time where Howard Hughes was pointing out that, as of right allowed them to build a building higher than 120 feet. So I must have misunderstood that correct yeah specifically says 120 feet got it: okay, Andrew, you're good. Now my second question and what up do we care? If those are we thinking that those air rights, the transfer of those air rights, stay within CB1 or we do not care where they move to? I do not think we care, but I do not think it would behoove us to try to tell board 3 for example, why do not you take our development rights? You know from the seaport, so we could put a huge building in your community, so I do not really think that's a sensible strategy again. This has been in place since 1972. All the sites that exist and that have been used in the past are within seat one andrew. If I can just help no, I was just going to tell them air transfer rights have rules and it's hard to transfer them across town. They only really are supposed to work on the same block. So if we want to make a big change, you know it would probably involve other agencies well, just to clarify that there are a number of other districts like the theater district, like the Chelsea west district, like the Hudson square district, where they do have plans just like they have at the seaport where they move the development rates to sites not immediately adjacent so you're right, generally speaking, that's the rule, but they have these other special transfer districts and Tammy. Sorry, what was underpinning my question if the air rights were to be transferred to another neighborhood outside of CB1, while it would seem a long shot, I'm just wondering if it could result in someone making a claim that the financial benefit should also move into that community as opposed to stay within CB1. I did not think of that. Then again, we're just trying to solve one problem, not problems the city yep. I get it exactly: okay, Andrew you're good, then good. Thank you. You're welcome, mariama and then Bob, Schneck and mine is just a comment. This is not my wheelhouse Zoning and I trust and heal to you know my colleagues here on the board with regard to that, but I had a super thought to the resident that spoke earlier. I could not help but know how the void of black history memory slave was in the conversation, and you know we were in fact part of the commerce that used to come in through the seaport. So I think I'll always talk about historic districts that we need. What is foreign? What history are we talking about? We need to begin to tell the complete story of the history, and I would hope that whoever whatever entity ultimately is you know, contracted to build this area donated not rezoned it whatever that they would take that into consideration that the board would insist that they start to incorporate the entire history, the totality of history into the conversation with us, also to howard hughes with credit as a black woman living in this district. I can tell you preparations that provide specific programming to black people to Lgbtq community. If you want to go into functionality as well, I do not know what else could they do or do not do they could be otherwise horrible, but to their credit, howard Hughes does put on that type of programming. I can't go to let's say, brookfield and find that currently it is. Maybe they want to hear this and get started, but right now it's only there. So I just hope that from now on, thank you, hey, Bob, Schnick, okay, I suppose my concern is. I really appreciate the amount of effort. The Community Board won one overtime put in to put into the zoning for the special area of the seaport, but I have to admit I'm tempted by some of the perks that are available. So it's the idea that we would leave that this resolution leaves the parts on the on the table and we enforce these ideas here. Where did the perks go in this arrangement? I think the point of the resolution is that we can get the perks without the tower if we use the air rights outside the historic district, there are developers elsewhere in lower Manhattan. Who would want these air rightss and therefore we can spend? I think we should mark the money specifically for funds to benefit the thinking, museum and other needs of this district, and we could easily do that. I do not think you should be hoodwinked into thinking that the Howard Hughes plan is the only way to accomplish this now. I know your wife works for the council member who seems supportive of this Bob, but I hope you could take an open stance on this and look at it. You know as an alternative way to fund the seaport, but I think will work better. I think I, the thing is, I want to agree with you, but I have to admit that I would like to see other developers, you know kind of making offers or the thing in play or feel like there were really alternative possibilities, but that there had been a future, but there have been breeds all right hold on. I need to mute somebody who's out there making more. You can certainly check in with the council member who was there and their team. They know that was a you know. It's not a community board thing, it's the council member knows, and there were was a discussion that we were aware of. Okay, thank you. You're welcome, Susan Coleman. I just want to say I think Paul's point is well taken and what he just answered, Bob with and I'm in support of this. I think it's it's just a little clout and we just did not give it away. That's all sounds good, okay. After Susan, I think we are done with all the hand raise, and I think we should. I have a quick one. I'm up my hand is up. Very quick. Is that okay, bruce you snuck it in right before I could call the question man it was well. Bob was talking I'll, be very quick. I usually I'm aligned with Bob. I just think Paul did a great job on this extremely difficult issue. I would change in the be it further resolved that I would just eliminate the word after transfer. It's almost it's over the top. The other thing I want to say is that we had a discussion. I do not remember whether it was the executive committee. Perhaps so, just in terms of the seaport museum, it has been an ongoing issue since I've been on the community Board and at this moment in time it needs to be said that, while I support their existence, I do not think the world has to has to tilt on its axis because of the seaport museum. As we have said, I have said it is about the whitest Museum in New York City, the board is the the displays. Are someone mentioned at this meeting earlier? There's no there's no input about slavery or black dock workers. Nothing! It's just some kind of Williamsburg colonial conception of you know our seaport history. That's all I'm not condemning it. I just do not think we should spend another 20 years figuring out how this narrow little thing should get funded. Can I call the question? God bless you Susan. I second, that all right so with that in case everybody's hands are down questions been called. It's been seconded we're going to roll the way we did before. So if everyone is on the call mark, I see that you're back, which means you have to unmute and vote, because you were not here before as far as we know orally. So I will assume everyone is a yes, if you are a no, you me, you mute yourself, and you say your name and the vote. If you need to abstain, you must do the same. So in that case, are there any no's catching stains can't turn up stains. Are there any other abstentions or recusals mark? Are you back? Okay? But because you were not here before, we need to vote for your attack. You need to vote just because no problem, yes, all right so motion passes. Thank you very much Paul. It was a lot of work. I really appreciate it. Alice point will take him, will try and do drafts in committing with it up again, this goes back to land. Use is going to be one heck of a long meeting for the next four months. So buckle up, everybody burn. Take it okay, so the next topic was governor's island, lovely view of it there. But the presentation had about 85 slides. It was a really long presentation. So I'll just give you the highlights here. I just wanted to mention, of course, that they had come to Community Board, I think in September, and you know as a precursor to their plans, but subsequently, like a couple days later after you know coming to us, there was a more extensive view of what their plans were. That was in the press, so we asked them to come back, so we this and give us some more details, because that took a bunch of people by surprise. So today, when they came last week, it was really to present a fuller picture. There's a couple of other upcoming meetings as well. I think they need to they're going to come back and see us in November. There's going to be a special meeting for that. Where we talk about the things that we saw at the meeting last week, and then they will be at the land use meeting in no on November 9th, which will have and then present you know the more details, the review of their environmental impact statement and financial details. You can go to the they talked a little bit about the zoning of this out rezoning of the South Island proposal. They gave us an overview of that. Basically, I think most of you are aware of all of this stuff. You can go to the Diana and if not you have it and you know: you'll have the materials they showed the map in terms of the zoning changes. The current map versus the proposed changes you can go to the unless somebody wants to look at this a little bit longer background noise, and then they gave us the overview of the the list of uses allowed by the proposed rezoning, which I can not read, and I won't bother reading that all to you, since you will have the materials. Basically one of the things I'm going to point out is we have this. It is okay, everything is on our website and the presentations, but one of the things when you're looking at where it says allowed under deed or prohibited by deed. That's actually not accurate, because the deed restrictions expire correct. That's a major piece of brand new information that we did not have until this month right and we learned that they expire in probably 20. When was it 2062 or something that was yeah? That was a bit surprising. I think that was something that took everybody by surprise. You say that again Tammy. I do not think I understood okay, so we the deep restrictions. Diana. Can you go back where it says deed restrictions under use? I think it's once so. You see that there are all these uses that are allowed by proposed zoning. There were lots of conversations that were not allowed now go to the where it says: rentals market and affordable co-, ops and condos prohibited by deed, not allowed on. Let's use this, but only for a certain period of time. So if a developer bought the land, they could build condos or any of the other prohibited uses, potentially in 2016 or 2062 whatever, and while it they are limited. So you know residential is limited. It's still 700,000 square feet of residential, which is something that the Community board has long said. We did not want and that's a topic that needs to come up and it's a long discussion because we had always said as alice is infamous reporting. This is one of the greatest public amenities that this city has and we did not want to see it privatized, so we did not want it to turn into a casino and condos, or you know an island for the wealthy, because the public space gets squeezed out and that's to truly understand that the community has long fought for, and we need to include that into the dialogue about rezoning and anything that goes ahead on the element. Go ahead. Sorry, fern, yep! No, that's perfect! Thank you! Tammy! I mean that was. That was one of the reasons that the there were so many questions. I guess a lot of information came out that I guess we were unaware of, and I guess finally after you know after we have you know after that shocker this is the I think, the shot of what they think with the development of the South island. That Governors island could look like very different from the first slide. Yeah, so yeah lots of questions based on what they share. Andrew are you? Are you done because I see hands going up yep? That was the last slide I did not want to you know we did not want to go through all 85 of them so before and after and needed. The discussion so Andrew on the agenda for November 9th is a financial updater report. I'm wondering if that same report is appropriate for the special CB1 meeting on the second, it's a good question. The what the CB1 meeting on the second is is supposed to go over. They did not actually get to the financial or the resiliency at the last meeting, so the programming and other conversations about that are supposed to happen on the second. The reason why I think that's important. The whole genesis of this is to provide sustainable financing for the island, so understanding, I think their financial profile and situation, I think, is important at the meeting on the second. I have no troubles asking for them to add that in there that's completely fine with me. You know, for our purposes the most that we can understand that I've made that perfectly clear to understand what minimum density is required for sustainability over how long of a period of time those I have. I asked if there was anything on file at Scott, Stringer's office and with both not yet or they do not have anything. So that's those fiscal projections, I think, could inform a lot of conversation and I'm hoping to get those answers as well, and we can certainly ask for that for the creating case to come. Thanks, tammy you're welcome Susan Cole your hands up. I think we have to be very careful on this one that we do not get hoodwinked because we have to watch the city. We have to watch everybody. That's all I want to say we just have to be very careful. I do not disagree with you on that at all. Okay, any Susan I've got alice. Do you want to add anything by the way? I should announce that alice will be our new community board, one representative to work with governor's island. Thank you not at this point. I just want to thank you Tammy. I will do my best to represent the community well there, and just also in addition to what Andrew is bringing up in terms of the finances which is critical. We're also going to be updated on the north on the north part of the island, which we've yet to hear anything about, though it's not being rezoned. There's plenty of development. That's going to be happening so continued thanks. Okay, all righty! So with that fern, do you have anything that you want to add nope? If there are no questions, that's it! For me, this is Wendy. I had a. I had a question that relates to the the Harbor school earlier. Was there any linkage about the funding for the the pool and the diving site that they want for the harbor school, which you know, as I remember that came up with Brian Cavanaugh a couple years ago on a site, that's on the north side that they were proposing? I do not know what's happening with that. I think school construction was, you know, trying to get capital money, for that is that related in any way to the development? At this point, are they tied in any way, or is that did that not come out? I know there were parents there from the Harbor School who talked about it. I do not recall, you know, concerns fern, it's andrew, if I'm not mistaken and I might have been, but I thought in response to that question. They mentioned that there was a building, I think adjacent to or behind the current harbor school that was earmarked for their expansion and they were going to double back with the school construction authority to see if that all split, that's a different building andrew. So when so, there's a there's, an expansion building across the way from the harbor school, which is a which is a regular building that could be an additional school building, but the site that they were looking at for the pool was actually closer to the welcome center and closer to the. They have two sites on the island, it's closer to their current dive center. So it actually was not the same building. That's why we listed as two separate budget request items because they're not they're, not in the same building, so they have it as two separate their building that they currently have is classrooms only and the expansion was for another classroom building to expand their programming classrooms with the pool being completely separate. If that explains it all and andrew they will be coming back on November, 2nd as well and then f after hold on Vicki and then Justine well, I am good because it sounds like I just wondered if they're, if they're waiting on the funding as part of this development or if that funding is coming from a different stream. But we do not know the answer to that. Will be a future question? Thank you. Okay, Vicky my comments, my fellow CB workers. At this meeting. I realized you know following a couple of meetings that one of the things that was really perturbing me was the fact that the South development had a completely different architectural expression from the northern part, and what I mean by that is all this glass and you know steel, and do you use the word modernist stuff, whereas the entire northern part is masonry buildings, brick and stone, and so I just did long- term planning for me. You know this is this proposal of making this mini Manhattan like Vegas, you know one of everything, but if the future development had put into their need that everything that was built in terms of architectural expression should follow in some manner what has already been established on this island. I think that would not only be an appropriate solution, possibly something different for New York City would give us a better experience on a humanist level and also it would preclude in 2016 the rush to go out. There has built what I know what's happening in my industry as fast and cheap as you can do it just to get your profit out. So I encourage everyone to think about this, and it's especially evident when you see it in overall plants and Paradise views where you know the top part is almost belonging to a completely different place from what they're proposing on the back side. Anyway. That was my contribution. Thank you, Vicky. I absolutely heard what you said: Steve and Bob schneck thanks so much vicky. Thank you because you've got like the architect's eye on stuff as the rest of the people in your committee do, and I would not have noticed that so thanks for that. I appreciate it and also both to add on to what wendy was saying about the school building and the pool what the folks came on in the public section asking about can't we do besides the budget request. Can we do a resolution in that committee an abundant part of that committee, but I would suggest perhaps doing something stronger and sane- and we may have addressed this before but saying that we want this done on governor's island and maybe even throwing in there something about what vicky said. But that's for you guys in the committee to decide, but the school part of it for the Harbor School and the pool. I would I'm making a vote to. I believe I believe, Justine. I believe that was done already in youth in Ed some time ago. I think we need to do it yeah. I think we could cause. I do recall it as something that was talked about, but I think we need to do it again, but thank you, okay and I'm going to actually read you something that the Harper school folks had sent me. They, the Harbor School, had proposed to the trust that they get a 10-year option on the historic structure known as the hospital building which would allow them to get the necessary funding of an estimated 50 million in combination of public and private partnerships. That would include both DOE private foundations and the maritime industry, which assume the Dov's present promise that their current building is upheld and allow for the other building as well to support the structure of the growth of the school. So that is the update that I have from them, and I do think that will be taken up in youth and ed. It could be taken up next month in youth and ed, so it happens alongside of the zoning conversations and Bob Smith you're. Next, to that, I think we have our great White House doctors, traveling shawty, somebody's listening to cartoons Bob you're on okay. Thank you. I just wondered whether or not that whole space with those buildings on it is a is a separate campus and is the public allowed in that space? What's the how's, the public treated vis- a- vis, these developments, you can walk through and around the building, but you can't go in unless you got purpose will be private buildings it'll be either whatever they can garner for the island. So all of are those buildings, actually the ones as planned or they're. Looking for a they're looking for one or more interested parties to decide what they want, this is just an example of what might be correct, interested parties- okay and that and this, and that thing that looks a little bit like a marina- that the idea would be a private marina like that too. That's a great question. They have not said, but that's a great question that we need to ask- and I would say Fern has to put it on our list. Okay, thank you. Okay, wendy! You still have your hand up. Are you good about that? Okay, I hope everybody comes November, 2nd. If you care about the island, tell every one of your friends to come: November 2nd the most amount of public engagement. We can get the better off we will be, and with that note, I turn into a small business working group- hello, Colin, I I'll be super fast, sorry 9:30.. I wish we had more time, because, if you ask me, this is the most important thing we're all we all should be focused on right now, but I'll be quick, because sorry, 9:30. Diana did a really great job, getting some big wigs from the city. I won't go through all of them right now. I initially wanted to have a meeting that was about what's the next step, how do you recover? How do your insurance? How do you ensure long- term sustainability for businesses that got hit hard but survived and, unfortunately, what it turned into was a sobering roundtable on what these businesses are really facing right now and the failure somewhere in the 80 range of businesses in the next few months? So with that, we have a few resolutions we're going to push through for next month. Thank you especially to Tom Burton for some of his experiences on the ground with his own small business, but I just want to use two seconds to plead for people who are interested in this to come to these meetings. Everyone's voice is valued, but especially those who are on the ground getting hit by this small business owners. We need you, we need your thoughts, because this is a long way from done. Okay, that's it all right. We love that we're going to go back to youth in Ed and we're going to have Jen who was our office team present a quick update for youth in Ed? Please hi! Everyone can you all hear me loud and clear, perfect. Okay, I'm going to do my best to just run through it quickly, I'm going to go by order so number one updates on remote learning and planning for 20 and 21. I would say the first report goes hand in hand with the fourth item on you see there on the agenda, catherine merrow from DOE. She works with the division of specialized instruction and student support. She was able to join us and just really do a Q&A and respond to a number of the concerns that parents who were at the meeting had about their child's remote learning and some of the challenges that would arise from circumstances online instruction. I won't be able to fill in as much information as Trisha would, unfortunately, but I would say that the committee does not tend to carry on this conversation for the next couple of months, as the DOE continues to evolve their game plan for both in- person and online instruction for the rest of the academic year number two Senator Cavanaugh Tom Hall and young people's civic engagement. That was an interactive event held last month for teens and young adults to learn and find ways really on how they can become civic leaders in their communities, really was just an opportunity for youth to explore how they can develop and hone in their civic engagement skills so that they can partake in a number of important conversations, whether that be in a political space or civic space, and on to number three: a DOB review of ventilation requirements in school buildings. We had John Shea, who was a DOE chief executive officer. He works with the division of school facilities. He was able to join us and answer some of the specific questions. A few members and parents had surrounding school ventilation requirements. A few facts fun facts just throw out there. He mentioned how really air filters are being used as a medication measures, new things that we learn for example, and part of the air quality testing for schools, custodian custodians are provided with an indoor air quality, monitor and readings are taken outside of the school building. If a teacher notifies the custodian that they believe that their classroom is not getting enough airflow, then a reading will also be done inside the classroom with the teacher and students inside and then after that. Those two readings are then compared and if the results are within an acceptable range, then that consortium can confirm that the ventilation system in place is working. So that's the number three and the fifth item just to fit a recap of the news from last month. I believe it was also discussed at last month's full board. Pretty much saa has started construction that was put on hold for the chinese gold that it was put. It was put on hold back in March of this year and really the only challenge left is the funding the rest of the funding, which is expected to be approved by OMB. The status that was given last month was that they have acquired a contractor to mobilize the construction and at this month's committee meeting, the most recent update that was given to us was that they released the construction team to resume construction and that's about it. I apologize. If I spoke too fast. Okay, I think you're good. We have like any questions, any hands saying none. Let's move on! Thank you very much Jen for stepping in for Jeff and Trisha tonight we're going to move this. We have two more two more two more reports, two more items, two more committees is that it yeah correct coal and licensing are going to take us home and she has the last one will be a roll call which is proposed guidelines for liquor license on rooftops and terraces as new business. So all right here we go first, everybody should go here, see Pier 26., it's fabulous next 25 broad street and 95 South street are the two resolutions. If you read them, we can vote on them. 95 is bridge view, it's they're expanding it's temporary for now, so they can seat more people and put them outdoors and put them up. We had no trouble with it. The other was 25 broad, which was I'm blanking, the restaurant, the former restaurant's name. It's that whole area and broad and exchange place, and we did not have any trouble with it either, but we did so. Those are the two resolutions. We can take a vote on them very quickly unless anybody has any questions and I'll do my quick reports and then the third which will lead into our last resolution and a call for the question seconded. So again, this one is regular because the last one is roll fault. So, assuming that all are yays, are there any no's? Sorry, tammy, quick point of information. Are you grouping these? I am grouping them. Yes, thank you. That's only two. Thank you. So much are there any no's. Are there any abstentions, any recusals, fantastic Susan you're on for new business and well? No, I just want to. I want to go to the old reports that we get a lot of complaints around Noise and Marianne's and various places we tell people to call 3- 1- 1. Some of it is liquor. Some of it's not it's. You know this expansion people are not used to the outdoor spaces, so we've been trying to work on it and and street there's a new ownership. There's a change over and he promised he's going to change the music and make bet and make nice for the neighbors. So that's, basically we do listen to all the complaints and we try to respond to it. The best that we can. We do not have a lot of power at this moment, all right, new business. So on that we asked there was an alteration for 70 Pine street and we get a lot of alterations. We had passed in July of 2019 a which you have in front of you. As the last resolution we passed 42. I do not know there was a 42 in favor about guidelines for roof tops and terraces. When I called Jeff Erlick and we read it over, it was totally incomprehensible. So, in the light of what's been going on with people using terraces and drinking and all kinds of things we set up this, we cleaned up. Basically the old propose a resolution that we had done in 2019. We did the content, the whereases are basically the same. We did not change them, so I am presenting it to you. I hope you've read them the the committee. Let me rewrite it. They agreed with me that it needed to be redone. It was really incomprehensible. So that's what we've done and trying to give us a little more clout on terraces and balconies the end. Okay, Britney take us home, you're roll calling it tammy. I have, I put my hand up. One quick question: yes, sorry go for it. No I'm sorry! It was let late. So when we talk about rooftops and terraces we're referring to open air or necessarily well, basically, it is mostly open air if there are windows out Andrew, where it affects people who live around there and the noise and whatever happens and what are and we have. We walk a fine line on what we can do around what the SLA approves and what they do not, and that was the purpose of trying to write this. Thank you. You're. Welcome sorry about that Andrew. I do not see any other hands up, so I'm going to say, let's call the question. Brittany take us home. If you could say your last name, then your vote again that'd be great and mariso. Yes, you blank. Yes, Brown Kennedy Brown comedy yes! Thank you! Yes, cunningham! Yes! Thank you! Curtis! Yes, airman! Yes, yes, ah galloway, yes, James! Yes, hey, okay, yes, drink! Okay! He just yes more! Yes, sorry! I was included. Sorry thanks sung! Yes, we guess one, how do you pronounce it z? Okay, got it I'll, get that next time, Zelter Delter? Yes, any wines, no she's, not here! Okay, that's everyone! Thank you! Everyone! So I want to say thank you to everybody tonight. I think that if I have a motion to Adjourn, then awesome perfect, so it is 9:39 with some incredibly complex topics tonight, thank everybody for their participation and their time. I'm going to go, have a cocktail and have some dinner. I hope you all do too. Thank you very much and thank you for watching. Thank you. I'm going for the Ibm danny I'll talk to you tomorrow. I'm here.
