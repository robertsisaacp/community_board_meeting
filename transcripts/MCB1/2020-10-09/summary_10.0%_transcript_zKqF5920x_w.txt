This meeting for community Board One tonight is again with DSS and DHS and project renewal.
This is one of the things that I've been thinking about and working with my team, I'm on this shared vision, and so you know looking at policing versus client centered.
So we want to make sure that we kind of have a balance there, but at this site we did approve additional security staff for project renewal.
Our providers work with the neighborhood coordination offices to ensure quality of life at our permanent shelters.
So, a community advisory board for the shelter right, so the community board meetings with NCOS that I attended my neighborhood well You know certainly that continues, but at the shelter itself, in a permanent shelter, we have community advisory boards to really share information.
Our intention is, as I've said since last week, is to open a permanent adult family shelter in this location.
It's an in- kind, move from hotel to hotel You're, not decreasing the population, you're moving 235 people You know we looked at really being able to redistribute and use a site that we have, because we have the opportunity to turn it into an adult family, shelter.
This was already there, so we're able to move the men from you They are to your the site, down in fidei, less hotels, they're, only two down in the neighborhood, and so we were able to identify using the site and get the ability to turn it into an adult family, shelter.
You could have just as easily closed down the shelter at the Radisson Hotel, the quarantine, shelter, and you could have looked for a more permanent solution for people and gone through a lot appropriate process with fair share and found location.
We are a amazingly resilient community that will bounce back from the pandemic and the economic recovery, and we will work with the city to find a place that can be a good location for people to get back on their feet, a place where they're not on a tiny sidewalk, a place where your services can go and a place where we can help everybody.
The men that are currently in the Lucerne who we're moving, will continue to get the same services when they come down to the Radisson Hotel hotel, they're, also working with other organizations to look at job training project when you actually do have drop training so that there's opportunity to be able to be self, Our president talked about this.
That would be able to benefit from that our space that was found there, as well as around the money that was raised to help folks in shelter, and so that's part of that, and that we would be able to have other clients utilize that you know we have 17,000 in shelter who can certainly benefit a portion of them could benefit from that in terms of the emergency order.
You know, circumstance gives us, and so we should the emergency order, then bifurcate the need for fair share process in sighting of a facility.
The process of fair share requires from city charter, the acknowledgement and inclusion of all shelters regardless if they are run by DHS or not and all services, it requires a list of documents to be included.
Tell me so I'm asking about fair share in the sighting, because you keep referring to turning this one location into a permanent shelter, and my question: is: are: is this being done under the emergency order?
We, say hey, you know, commissioner, banks writes this letter goes out that says we're looking for optimal places to open shelters, send it to us.
If you know, if they're buildings you want to bring to us, certainly we will evaluate them and they may, instead of 52 becoming the permanent shelter.
What I'm saying to you is that we want to be able to have shelters at every community district in New, York City.
So the city registered the contracts pursuant to the executive order, 101, and that is based between the mayor's office of contract services and the comptroller office regarding contract registration during the Covid-19 crisis, and that is a goal to ensure continuing shelter services and our ability to work with service providers This is through office of contract services and the comptroller's office.
Let's start with the role of the Hotel Association sourcing, so available, hotel locations are identified by a Hotel Association of New York, and that is based on our capacity needs and the need to effectively relocate shelters in a way that accommodates our clients needs to provide a need: staff, services, security, so We're, providing the services making sure there's effective social distancing so that we can reduce the risk of infections.
Dhs's contract with the Hotel Association of New York City, was amended to increase the city's liability by the sum of nearly 222 million dollars in connection with the conversion of hotels to house hundreds of peoples experiencing homelessness during the Covid-19 emergency.
If we need to end the use, we will be able to do that, and so it is really same as any one of our Covid-19 hotels that we're using Any time before that we're able to return to the congregate sites and the city and the Department of Health Says it's safe for us to do.
I'll tell you that I mean it's through Apple's office, , will the contract be renewed until the emergency order is lifted or will another move be planned asking if we're to You know these are questions that came in from residents in the community.
Does, a temporary emergency executive order, suspend the requirements for fair share in terms of process, so the fair share assessment we want to take in is done for any permanent shelter.
We have a variety of shelters just because DHS does not operate, them does not mean they do not exist, and it is unfair and incomplete and inaccurate public information to continue to say that I'm sorry, Jocelyn , I understand that it is not your service that operates it, but it is exactly like.
Our intentions, is to have a permanent shelter in every community district in the city of New, York.
Covid-19 did create an opportunity for sites to be brought to us based on current use, so in terms of citing permanent shelters, right.
We want to make sure that we have opportunities for shelters to be in every neighborhood, not just in the neighborhoods, where they're You know where they've been concentrated in south Bronx in East, New, York and Brownsville, And. So we want to make sure that every community come together to address the crisis that we're in New York City, and so that's what our intentions, are.
Our intentions are to be able to open an adult, our family shelters with a provider that can provide the services, but even more in a community district where there's not a DHS operated facility.
One of this is an opportunity to explain whether or not there was a question that came up last time about the appropriateness of the building and asking if the water cooler, because the we had photos that were sent to the community board, that the water tower on top of the building has been open to the elements and whether or not it is therefore a safe building and how that's been addressed.
I'm, the president and CEO of project renewal, And I'm, also joined by four of four of my colleagues Jody Rudin, who is the executive vice president and chief operating officer, Katie Bauer and Kaydon Grinnell, who are both vice presidents of programs overseeing the shelters that these men come from and Charlie Mullam?
You know that's an important quality of life issue for the people who are surrounding that building.
This is not just about the community, but it's not fair to the people from the shelter either, and it would be appreciated if you can figure that out much like they have a place on the upper West side.
They, we moved multiple shelters to the space of town on the West side, and now we're looking to redistribute and being able to use this site, giving us the opportunity for Long- term site is where we have landed.
We heard loud and clear from you all that Williams street would not be appropriate and we completely concur with that assessment based on our visits to the location, so we're working on an alternative plan to provide primary care health services to our clients at the Lucerne.
One thing that I found from working with the public and pat through the quality of life committee is that many people still feel like 9- 1- 1 should be treated like the old days where you know there were reports that all the circuits were busy and people could not get real emergencies in because it was tied, up.
I was just going to say absolutely one thing that happened at the Lucerne Was that people from the community would bring games.
Metro cards are very useful, so there are small items like that which we can accommodate, which are which are really quite helpful, and and we will make sure that there are opportunities for people to volunteer in ways that allows them to actually get to know the clients themselves, because that really goes a long way to reducing some of the fear and concerns that people have about people.
You know what I'm hearing from you is that you really care about what goes on in your community, and you have spoken so much about the impact that such a move is going to have on the residents, which I think is great.
Now you know this is the first time that I've seen a community come to the aid in the way that they have with no funding they're, not a non- profit or anything like that and just say look.
So here at the Lucerne project, renewal has opened its doors to the community and allow groups like open hearts and programming, even from within, with their own recovery center to do services that did not even exist in the shelter and most of us, I do not think, is requiring any outlay of funding or anything like that.
If things like the I.T infrastructure, that needs to be in place is done after the fact is going to have a negative effect on the community, maybe not to the extent that it had in the Lucerne, because we aware of some of the states, some of those that need a higher level of care or need to be in other type of facilities.
We expect that if they're able to continue that we'll be doing the right thing in terms of getting us from the from the hotel to housing, but I do not think that moving so soon without that infrastructure in place is going to be a good thing.
You know what there's a link call the mayor, because these men need people to speak up for them as well.
I did hear you in terms of you know not having a voice for this to happen, but thinking about what your needs are and really putting out how your what your fears are when you go into a community really does resonate, and I.
Will people be able to go to congregate to smoke when they go outside Two other questions I just wanted to bring up is: Does the city have a signed contract for services with the Radisson Hotel, with project renewal and if they're in also is there any other signed contract obligating the city to pay for rooms at the Radisson Hotel, such as from the Hotel Association, and if so, with either one?
Think part of the question that I wanted to start with is a contract with the hotel is through the Hotel Association of New York and the city, the that's where the contract is at this point , there's no other contract for for the Radisson Hotel separate, and apart from the Hotel Association to have the project renewal residents move there.
The borough president does have a copy of the hotel contact and can share that for you to get direct information from them and in terms of why this was chosen, I think, on the same answer: I've, given you Thursday of last week and earlier tonight, in terms of we have been using this space And it gives us the ability to have hopefully an adult family, a shelter as part of alternative tide, plan.
Just does not seem like on paper at all that it is, and there's still no answer to our community on why that site is better than where they're located at the Lucerne.
Those things are important, but I do know in the area there are outdoor places like That May not be heavy- handed a therapeutic program, but it allows us to come together in a positive way with people with other people that can give us some type of inspiration or just be with us.
So I think, because we're having these conversations apparent or in advance, we can actually identify these places, identify these support institutions like say trinity, church and then help with Kidan to develop programming that could facilitate that and keep those of us at the Lucerne engage because you know sometimes boredom can get to.
If you got a hundred people standing on one block, that's just not going to look right, but I know that I engage a lot.
I'm interested in coming down beforehand and meeting somebody that can show me some of the things in the community, and maybe I can work with project renewal staff to try and identify how we could utilize certain spaces to make it a better situation for us, as well as the community.
It goes to an adult family shelter we go through the process of you know getting the shelter up and opened, and at that point the shelter provider, whoever that person is whoever that provider is, will then work with our Iga, which the governmental affairs are part of our shop at Department of Social services, as well as the community board leaders to establish the committee Advisory Board we do and Leilani's on the chat.
I personally, do not believe it is either, but before we get there, I think we need to address the issue that people are moved into off the streets and into shelters as they're able during a pandemic, that's been the guideline And, then they should stay put and people who are in whom similarly should stay.
If the Lucerne gentlemen are happy and healthy, where they are, and there's been accommodations made for them to remain that way, they've been given outdoor space, they've been given spaces within the building to congregate and to do and to be active and to exercise, and the community has at this point, welcome them and become comfortable and settled in with them as well, and they have a potential to have jobs, be learned from the borough president last week and from Kareem, who represented the upper West side, open, hearts.
They have an opportunity to work and to do other things there, and if project renewal is not going to be impacted, they're going to be safe and fine in either case whether the is moved down here or remains of town.
And, if it has just say so, and I'll find out later, but in terms of the security staffing will that all be in place by the time the 235 residents are relocated to the Radisson Hotel, yes Jody or eric What's really going on here when the project renewal folks stayed on with us and answered some questions.
So I just wanted to actually put that you know just because I did not want this to be continuous of hold on when you're answering that project renewal found out the 25th.
First of all, I want to thank you for taking the time to come and actually meet with us to engage with the community members and discuss something that.
We have the opportunity, like I, talked about to have a shelter that would be for adult families in this area, and so we're able to you know, really move towards that.
My hope is that when the men do come to fidei that they are given some opportunities to be seen as human and that there is some aspect of folks who says you know, These are people too, just like you and me, that's an unfair way to end, because we have first and foremost Said that we believe the way you are treating these men is unfair, so that is a terrible characterization to end on for community board.
We look forward to trying to support shems and the people there, and we already have neighbors from the community who are working with open hearts to because we are a compassionate community.
I, think project renewal has updated their information about all of the services that they offer and things like that.
I. Think that while it infuriated me that Jocelyn, that's happening, you know basically, you, the community, take care of these people, because it's not our job.
I'll just say very briefly: We expect to be able to transfer the full scope of services that project renewal provides to the Radisson Hotel environment, but you've heard, I think, quite eloquently through the course of the evening that there are ancillary supports that the community provides on the upper West side and obviously rebuilding you, know.
Some of these ancillary community supports, like the tremendous support from the open hearts, initiative, But From a project, renewal, scope of services, we're going to be able to replicate it downtown, but for the quality of life of for the gentlemen who are at the Lucerne, it is not going to be necessarily a better quality of life at the Radisson Hotel.
As far as like the other programs outside of what project renewal I deal regularly with open hearts here, and they have committed to actually come there and provide a lot of the same services there as they have been doing over here at the Lucerne.
And I talked to project renewal about this because we need we've got a lot of people on the streets already in lower Manhattan It grows every day and none of these options are open for that.
Two additional should be on within the next week: okay, but the people that the people who have been working with the men at the Lucerne are they moving with the group.
I was trying to see if we still could make that money available to service us or even a portion of it in what we do at But the other thing is that I am speaking to a number of people in the in the 50 district who are saying that they definitely would like to know what it is that we need and what it is that they can do.
You know once you've moved down what it's like to live in our community and what we can do to help you Jody and eric, as once again.
