We're doing the utility work running a long front, street.
Should go smoothly, we're assuming and then, as of right now, during this time between when we start that work, we're completing all the other work that needs to be done, which is just fedramp work, and some of the sidewalks on the intersection of Hudson Rescue street.
For, which the city is able to go after the contractor to redo the work or to get the money back, or do something.
The force contractors to redo their work, The cobblestone should the fill between the cobblestone and start to erode and the house are going to start to move or the substrate beneath the road to go bad or how I know this is not technical, but you've seen some of the other columns from the district.
I, assume you, You observed what Greenwich Street looks like between canal and.
I mean, They recently fixed the intersection of late in Greenwich, with, those, like, different types of cobblestones, not the belgian blocks, which don't look as nice.
Really inspect the workmanship of these Pablo Stone streets when it comes time to do the punch list at the end of this project, because we don't want to.
Work is done and a 2 way traffic was restored in October, 20, I, think 25, So now the remaining work on our state is.
It's, not an issue that was like, where to have to work.
We have to come up with a design to, you know, based basically have shallow feeders over there.
Again, We met with the operating groups that came out, They said, you know, we're going to try and figure this out, make it work.
Let's say, you know, further north of the intersection.
So, We would like to start the work.
Work in the streets, So I think that now is the best time to do this work.
Right yeah, because after it's been a complete finished, no closing of the street again.
Then he said, who would not allow them to work in the streets, so that's.
People who are applying to do the books, but it was testing, would not allow them to work in the street.
That, The contractor holds the permits and he gets to decide, but I guess it would the city coming in you'll be able to see.
They, They just got some I think something from they said, but it's still going to take some time to get the contract ready, but they believe by early next year, They should be.
So right now the tentatively scheduled for design completion, December of this year, and they're expecting construction.
We need to really think about how they're going to be doing trash.
You know, This is the design being done by the end of this year.
We're already getting complaints from people in our building regarding the early startup work.
I mean, What we generally request is that we, if we call someone in to the committee, we ask them to not start the loud noise that they will be making, You know, the 1st thing, but they're legally, right.
Before, say we ask them to also make their contract is aware that yelling is noise, You know, so we will try to work on it if we can be of help, Let us know.
So, from my understanding, You guys want to talk about a 10 0 t to 7, which is the eviction moritorium and our own council red bill, which is a 10 8 to 6, and, cabinets Access, voucher program, which is a 9657.
And on top of that, going into our rent and mortgage cancellation, bill, essentially, What our bill would do is it would suspend all retton mortgage payments for all residential tenants and small homeowners, for the state of emergency.
There has been a separate movement to pay the background and the continuing occurring rent, due to Covid-19 related disasters with the federal aid that we desperately need.
Contingent on the, We thought would be available before the pandemic hit so very different circumstances, but just in case, you guys wanted to know a little bit of the context of that.
Much federal aid will be asking for, A 100B dollars in nationally and 10b to be allocated to New York state, specifically for housing.
To be an iterative process of asking for funding, but our official ask has been since the hero's act, 100B dollars, nationwide and 10b dollars for New York, state, I, will, I will see I, don't want to miss.
The other program, the Senate program, If the Fed runny doesn't come until, at least January I, think, realistically, speaking.
I saw some upstate, I, don't know if that's New, York City, 2 or not.
For, better or worse, like, in lock in lieu of any real statutory protections that we have been calling for in the state Senate and assembly that has been kind of a saving grace for us in regards to addictions.
Several different eviction moratorium bills that are on the table that the Senate and the assembly need to pass.
We are, we are fixing the, we're trying to fix the legislation and we're trying to vote on this in the legislature as soon as possible, Although we don't know when we're going back into session.
You know, we, we've been pushing really hard, not only for housing legislation, but also revenue bills, You know, as you guys, know, we're facing a huge, huge budget deficit.
Until, you know, A new federal aid package is passed.
Essentially what the fund would do is it would help small landlords become whole by taking a combination of federal money and state money.
That is contingent on, you know, federal funding and state funding.
And, you know, where we're trying to work them into our legislation as much as possible.
I have to look at the billing, which again, but I believe right now it is the number of units within the landlord's portfolio, but, We have been discussing with certain advocacy groups, and some groups upstate as well.
In, their portfolio, so, we're, we're still working that out with center office as well as housing groups right now, Shortly, I just have to say that it seems to me as though the whole industry is going to be starving through this, Suffering, And, so I think a collapse.
But the, The thing here is all of this is balanced on the hope that there's going to be federal, money, but.
I look at this guy and the clouds are and don't seem to have big rain in if, If the federal government doesn't come through.
Then, how will the state of New York get to the 1st, 6 months of next year.
Generate revenue for the state to help essentially pay for these bills.
Moritorium bills that are being proposed, I, believe the 1 that you are talking about with the year between is Senator.
Kind of has been the premise of our perspective, that this narrative of landlords pitted against tenants is actually not the reality of a lot of the tenants that we've been seeing and the experiences that we've been seeing, We've been meeting with the group, a small property owners of New York, a coalition of property owners all across the state of who are, who are.
contingent on that federal aid, and needing to increase as much income as Peter said in the state, as well.
When, they happen, We really have to think through what we do for the people who face eviction.
Suffering, when everybody's suffering with the situation right, now, things decoded, but something that I want to call and make sure that it's on your guys radar as well.
If, these bills, the revenue, package, and other places to get funding for this money, to kind of fill in the shortfall of the budget for New York City, New York state, they don't pass or we're still stuck without any money.
Guess I got to tell you guys when you're, looking at whatever the Mayor Commission, and that evaluation of the taxes, When it comes to class 1 versus class 2.
Maybe we could put a resolution along those lines to support the idea of a things like a bond, because it's a very fair.
The, The small minded thinking, instead of thinking outside the box, to try and fix these things and just tax and expect federal, money.
For pre, existing condition of complete mismanagement of the state and the city is ludicrous and it's not gonna happen and more people.
I, couldn't agree more with what mark had to say there that I'm not going into, because I don't know how mismanaged our state city, is, But I do think that tax, deferrals or abatement.
You, know, I, don't want to cut you off, but we need to move on to get to the rest.
We are looking to provide the city with the authority to provide tax abatements for, for commercial landlords who are willing to settle on a mutual agreement with their commercial tenant, specifically, with small business owners to, to receive a rent credit for the landlord as an incentive to restructure existing leases for a longer term.
Because, you know, There is an issue with means: testing.
But, you know, like I said, before, we, We still are looking at the bill.
We actually have another state issue coming up with the transplant.
Don't have a new updates since I last spoke with you last month and the bills, and introducing the house in the Senate.
And I know that at the last meeting, we were asked about how the information kind of shows up in our district.
I mean, I will send that, I, don't know what's going on in the lame duck session, but I'm happy to stop by and give you an update the best that I can and anything added to the interim Mariam.
Respond that is working on, Oh, I was going to come, Monday, Tuesday, full Board.
I had actually emailed Lucian and Tammy, but the most important thing, that's happening, which we're really excited about, is that the is going to affect December.
We've built a lot of support in the Senate for it, and we hope we can get this done early in the new year.
Thank you for you guys too, for supporting this great work.
I think that if we look at the total public, good of.
But I, don't think, you know, like, in the, in the 2008.
That, you know, I, think, That rent is going to be forgiven like that, So, my, and bonds.
In, the state of New York, Governor Fomo had extended them, And I, think that will as the backstop for people who were out of work and couldn't pay their rent, that extra 600 dollars a week.
Paid summit and your landlord accepted partial payment, Unemployment, so, I think people most in danger of not being able to, to pay their rent.
Probably, I, don't know for a fact that we're covered by having additional 2400 a month, Typically, I, don't think everybody understood.
I mean, 1st of all people work and pay taxes.
And I, don't know what else is going to be on the agenda for the last hour or so of our meeting.
We really can't vote for against them in any way with any kind of intelligence, because even they, even the writers, don't know what they're going to say.
Already, and some of it may have given us suggestions of things that you would like to see, or not see, you know.
Let's, see people having problems with open streets and in terms of expansions and other issues.
Obviously, I, don't know if people know there's nitrogen housing work, gas has been turned off.
Don't know what they're doing with working.
They would work on all of there'd, be a centralized location that could report all kinds of noise and things that.
If you have a special need school in the building, you know, there are lots of different things.
They're working still to get people up to date with other functional trainings that they need to get through.
Well, If you can't have people live where they work, then they've got to get there somehow.
I don't want to misquoted, but they had a really interesting number about how many people work in lower Manhattan versus live in their catchment.
It was something like 3 or 4 to 1 work versus live.
Is that a lot of these people who work here, then they're, not part of the community board, and they can get involved, but they maybe should be invited at least to talk about stuff.
And, you know, as the housing.
And I think that we have many new members on the committee.
