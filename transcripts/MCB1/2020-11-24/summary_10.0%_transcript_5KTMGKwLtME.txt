Are we doing Diana for any kind of quorum from small business working group just to have enough people on I have to ask Colin since I.
Don't think I have a list of the small business working group, numbers.
You have come early for our executive committee, meeting, which will be starting with the small business working group with Colin, Mahoney and Elizabeth Lewinson.
Let's think about that way, instead of going through the whereases and the therefore be resolved, I want to tell you what those trial resolutions.
Okay, we I think, should be supporting I'm, not a member of your committee, but I agree as well.
I'm, sure I won't know the answer to it, but sure if the small businesses are open or if their revenues are severely depressed, Isn't there a correlation between that and tax liability, absolutely meaning if they're not meaning, if they're not open and they're, not jading, generating revenue.
Basically, for example, my my small corporate tax, which is basically the general tax liability, which is my ability to operate in New York City, Give you an example on that one they raise it on us, because every year I would pay a little bit extra into the fund.
Or everybody got that across the board, but at the same time, even I totally hear you saying, If you're not generating revenue.
That's a cool, sound okay, Unless you want objects, I'm going to move on to the final resolution.
Obviously, one of the bigger expenditures again Bill feel free to chime in here are obviously heating lamps and the propane that these things suck down all day long, especially with outdoor dining hand, especially with what looks like to be additional lockdown measures.
I forgot where I was in Tribeca, and these guys are just coming out and changing propane tanks, like literally every 20 minutes, because these things are just burning like all day long, so people can eat outside.
Sorry has actually funded a grant program for up to twenty thousand dollars for qualifying restaurants for both heaters and propane to keep outdoor dining going.
You're, going to get too many fines, because you have to keep it a certain fee from the space of business, meaning you have to give your door entrance on the sidewalk.
And, that would it gets a lot of players like myself, very frustrated, because every time we turn ahead, it's a new regulation, whether it's from the fire department, the building department or even the city itself, concerning how they're proposing it out there.
I mean in my mind, for the companies that need it to utilize or leverage the city's buying power to help them with those supplies, Because I, don't know one of the cleanest.
So, I, think and that to that end we should delete any wording about propane and specifics as to what kind of heating and just say you know that we're looking for support, we're looking for hosts to share in the wholesale prices like a co-op or something actually.
It's, not sharing the prices, I, think just getting reimbursed because you're not going to have the city go out there and buy heaters.
Guys, a quick question going back over what you just said: you've taken out the safety issue.
I. Think we need to do something to tighten up the resolve, for which one the actual resolution itself don't answer.
I think that's asking a little bit too much of the city and.
I know, but the city doesn't want to be in competition with businesses that sell these things after 9:11.
It sounds good to me and make it more broad, meaning not just heaters, right, the cost for actually building the structure.
I do question this idea of just any kind of equipment, because I do think to Bob's next point.
I think it sounds like we all agree on the spirit of it.
What you're asking the city to do to use its purchase power for negotiation, to be able to get at lower costs by purchasing in bulk to help the businesses.
These venues are going to go away, they're not going to have jobs when this thing is over I, don't know what that means.
So, Let's think about that kind of stuff, and if we can figure it out, I mean I will say you know.
Let's, take all three small business working group resolutions together and because this is not full board, we're gonna go the way we normally go.
We're, going to renew the street fair Task force and, If you're asking me why I'm going to tell you that we're hoping in 2021, because I'm an optimist that we will get back to the potential of maybe being able to have holiday, fares outside or anything and everything on the outsides.
It's really, basically how it rolls for anybody who can't read: it, I, will, The sponsorship of street fairs by CB1 in 2000 in 2021, to raise funds to support the work of the organization, extends the existence of the task force for an additional year, subject to appointment of members by the chair of CB1, provided by our bylaws grants.
This was a large dialogue that went through and we have received subsequent information since the meeting, which is why this has now come into executive, because the resolution as passed in committee was not complete.
Our vote is on record and with that, let's see where we are okay, I'm actually going to even call Jason and make sure if he has stepped away that he's back.
You wouldn't think it was that important, because it's a relatively small building, but there were issues when the presentation was made at the landmarks Committee.
I, don't know if we can do videos in the meeting, but it's like a four second video panning, the block which really gives a context to the map.
We just need to protect our voting rights here, but Jason I do want to say that the applicant is on the line.
Let me say that without casting aspersions that when you say you know in the distance, far away three buildings away from the maca on the corner of the street, which is a totally legitimate, view, Carter.
The independence closet building been built out to the street line, like all the rest of the community, has been built, but in this particular case, independence.
If, you were to bring up our rendering, you would see, is going to become red, Brick Party, Wall Brick, like everything else, and can I ask a question: Is the.
Get that picture up again, please well, Bruce did you have your own photo just to be clear about which photo you looked at before I would like to know.
I, think the next I want to recognize hands up to make sure.
We have no opinion on this at all, but just as a an owner on Harrison, Street I think any investment in our community is welcomed.
So I understand why line windows don't have legal rights or whatnot, but I guess what I'm concerned about is how they're going to attach to the building, because when seven Harrison was constructing their or regarding that entire building, it created a lot of damage to the East side wall of eleven Harrison and we're worried that they're.
If we could see like a final drawing that they're going to be filing with and to confirm the measurements and confirm all dimensions, I think that's something that hopefully they'd be okay, Providing us with.
So I, don't know like what exactly your detail is there, but we're putting up a louvered screen to hide air conditioning equipment, and we could very easily work with you to put a device outside to make it so that you can still see some sky from that window, but we would have equipment on top of our bulkhead.
Knowing that you asked us to work with landmarks, saying that I got ahead of it.
I would like to ask those people who are on the Landmarks, Committee, Jason and Susan I, don't know if anyone else on the committee is here and maybe Alice can weigh in as an architect.
I would like to ask them what they think we should do.
I like the idea very much of writing into the resolution, the part about making sure the staff people get off their tushies and come and see these things.
I mean I, just find it hard to do this without anyone having looked at the mock-up, which is impactful in a way that you know that's unusual, especially for such a intact block.
I have no further remarks except that, given what I'm hearing, maybe we should strongly amend the original resolution of the board agrees and Susan.
Obviously, You know those issues as well and also that we, since there was a major renovation at 7-9, Harrison Street a few years ago, with that, the building on the corner of stable and Harrison that negatively impacted our east wall.
We want to make sure, of course, that on engineering terms, that whatever is done on the roof of 13 Harrison, If there is something done, does not negatively impact engineering, structural levels, you know our building at 11, Harrison Street, that's crucial in terms of our West Wall anyway.
That last piece is the piece that we're trying to shrink now in advance of going back to landmarks, responding to Bruce's comment from last week's meeting, seeing what we can do to pull down both that's the bulkhead height and the mechanical equipment, and what about the actual size of the floor to seal.
You know, ambiguity about how the committee feels I think now it may be best to try to amend the original resolution.
Ask you to email, the Community Board office and speak with Lucian, Reynolds and I will have him, put contact you and send you a okay.
A letter that came to us from the property manager from the Warren Street Condo, that the bike corral is right in front of at 99.
Secondly, on the as you can see, If you scroll down on the picture, they forgot about 99 Warren Street, which is kind of a big oversight, particularly as they said that they did a traffic study.
I mean I may say something later, but I think it's time for the residents of this building, which are going to be most impacted, as well as some of the Ptas and other things to be able to speak.
And I will reiterate what Annalise said about this being an incredibly heavily trafficked block, because it's the main access for people going to the east for Ps 89 or coming from the east for the ball fields, as well as people going across the street for Ps234, and one of the things that I really want to point out for people who have or haven't walked around the building is that there are three large indoor cargo bays at this Amazon whole foods, location that are perfectly capable of handling this requirement.
Here tonight, because way back when whole foods first opened, their design included a large walk-in refrigeration unit at the Warren Street Entrance to whole foods, and that's when it was kind of a sleepy delivery service where people would put stuff into that refrigerator and be handled and delivered later in the day or by Vance whole foods, and now Amazon have refused to modify their space to reposition.
Think people need to take a very hard look at is the space that is fit for purpose for this particular use of using bikes or whatever they want to use being used, And the answer is it is not.
Street I strongly agree with the previous speakers, but I the different thing that I want to add.
The, two different things that I want to add here are that, with all the construction that recently completed on Warren Street, We resume the service of a number of bus lines.
And I have seen the evolution of our neighborhood whole foods from day, one where we were able to welcome whole foods as a wonderful grocery store, but is now turned into and transformed into another Amazon fulfillment center, which you know with all the political ups and downs of Roosevelt Island, has now found home on Warren Street.
One thing I wanted to point out is in the dot's letter they said they're going to trial this for six months, And. I, guess they're going to study what impact it has on local pedestrian traffic and the community.
Don't know if you're familiar with pedestrian traffic, but it's significantly lower than normal, so I kind of scratch my head and wonder what results you're going to get by studying it for the next six months.
I think it's fairly obvious, just based upon the location of ps234 downtown community center and the fact that it is the primary way to get to the try to the battery park, ball fields and the and Rockefeller Park I.
Certainly you know, and as some of my other members of the community and the residents of the buildings have mentioned, you know they do have you know the commercial loading dock on Murray Street that can serve as both incoming deliveries as well as a safe space for the delivery, bikes or vans.
You know the other, and so it's still unclear to me and sounds like it may be unclear to others as to why that space can not be utilized and why additional space needs to be built out on Warren Street.
I mean I, think that, with respect to the community being able to have a place to park their bikes, You know that there's plenty of that on Greenwich.
I think the whole foods you know has the space on Murray Street that they can, you know, perhaps alter a bit and then use it to for both the trucks vans, as well as the cargo bikes.
But, and then you consider Warren Street, which is flanked by schools and community centers and children, and huge residential buildings, whether it's in battery park or our building, I'm, a resident.
And, you know just kids everywhere on that- are one block on Warren Street than there are in the entire city.
I would think, and it's already too busy, as it is, with the traffic from whole foods and all the bikes already the sidewalks and everything else, as everybody said, and then to add all the other bikes going in the opposite direction on the one-way Warren Street all day, long, it's just an accident, horrible accident, waiting to happen.
If we, If it's something new great, if not please just repeat, we do need to do the business of taking a vote, and this is one of two things we have for DOT.
That is the fact that on Murray Street the ability to maintain social distances for the people who will be using the cargo bikes, the loading and unloading would be much more readily able to be maintained.
We have loading and unloading right in front of all the residential areas on scarce public sidewalks, That will make social distancing even more difficult to maintain for the families and children, the school children, the visitors of the community center and the people that are trying to get to the ball fields to increase both the foot traffic and the the you know, the the traffic of the workers for their safety as well.
We do think it's a good idea to get rid of the you know, vans, the white bands that they have that double park on Warren.
We can look at metrics that, for example, after December 31st, if there's loading or unloading of any kind from any vehicle truck or Van on Warren Street I encourage people to send take photographs and send it to the community board and submit it to the DOT feedback, because that's completely against what they're promising if they are causing, if they are blocking the sidewalks at all with the bikes and the bikes, are on the sidewalk or packages.
You know, obviously, the cargo bikes riding the wrong way riding on the sidewalk things like that, So that's the best that I can.
I actually heard an answer to the question that was asked, which is there anything community board.
We are going to ask for help from our city council person, as well as the borough president's office, and that is you know.
I believe their way of trying to prevent larger vehicles from using the area that aren't doing loading or unloading like, for example, It's confusing, because cargo bikes currently can use any commercial loading and unloading zone, and so the city has already accepted that risk.
I think it would be helpful to understand why we're taking away this space in a permanent way, as opposed to a temporary during working hours.
That I think that everybody on here going to ask if Lucian can provide a note to who to contact for DOT to make their position known.
That's come tonight and have it and have Margaret's office have a discussion with DOT saying you know you got the two big buildings, residential buildings.
So, let's see I, you know the list keeps going so.
So I'm going to ask that if you still want to speak and if you have something fresh and new that no one has said before, please put your hand back up.
The letter comes out saying that they're moving forward anyway and that, if they can complete this final by the end of November, again I feel like how do we know that this is indeed going to be a pilot and that they actually will take community feedback because it doesn't sound like they are or that they will agreed.
We're, moving forward towards a resolution, so we're taking notes all right, sorry go ahead and just for the record I do agree with what previous speakers have said.
Well, at this point, I'm, going to let Lucian on mute, himself, I tend to think it.
Firstly, I'm speaking more as a husband to a wife who uses a wheelchair, And I, think there's a assisted community living right across the street from us who tend to use Warren Street a lot, so I would like to add their concerns as well just from a traffic standpoint.
Some people mentioned that whole foods could use basically sidewalk space to basically do their cargo bike pilot.
Everyone said from the Tribeca alliance perspective in local small businesses going back to the small business committee, We don't get the same ability to use street space for loading and loading.
Would like to join with everyone else who was opposed to this cargo bike storage space on Warren, Street.
Think at this point we should do a resolution.
There has been zero representation from them, so you know not showing up, says I think we need the thing.
Okay, so am I getting the sense from the executive committee that this is going to be a negative resolution.
Up, but I think it would be good if we did include here the failure to properly notify and then to engage the community, because that's been something that we've asked for since our first meeting and in fact why a couple of us, my myself, definitely included if nobody else didn't even feel comfortable voting on it, because there was nobody from the public here when we had the first visit from them.
I. We want to be really careful and not talk about whole foods paying for it, because if any of our small businesses want the same then you're going to say, okay.
We asked D.O.T if they would be using any kind of robust public feedback and engagement for the community in terms of citing locations and what determinations were made on whether or not they were going to pause or not.
Residents reported that CitiBikes were being written on the sidewalk, including to and from the docks, which is one of the other concerns about putting the dock in the pops, and that sidewalk sightings implies that it's okay to ride in the sidewalk a practice an endangered pedestrians and is illegal bike lanes are not always present, as we well know in community board, one where the city docks are located, and.
I know that we had a lot of people who were concerned with the CitiBike process over the last several months, so.
If we're also passing anything that allows them to continue with infill, which was also part of our discussion, then I think you know.
You know they've done quite a bit of infill in various locations in what's called the historic district, Tribeca historic, district, And. I'm, really thinking of the bikes that they added on Lake Street bikes on anyway.
Okay, so I will read that as you're discussing and then let me just go on record for, like the four main things that I think sure people should know.
The community preferences that came out of the public engagement, which really was only at the last transportation meeting when D.O.T finally sent representatives, were that we wanted to minimize the impact to restaurants.
They were doing the proposal, They did not I, remember streets right, so we found that out after the fact, I had to work with sushi at the time and propose six other locations because they didn't know there was a fire hydrant there.
And, because everybody on the block said they didn't want bikes in the middle of Dwayne Street, We have taster Tribeca.
So, since that time, I've been as many of these meetings that have been called to remind people that we don't want to put businesses, restaurants out of business, and you passed a resolution back in September, which DOT wasn't really participating in and hadn't asked for.
They said they have is a requirement from a contractual obligation of how many expansions that you know how many docks and bikes and things like that they have to have that's part and parcel to the conversation of.
So, I'll, read that, but I do want to make sure that people understand that there has not been public engagement other than me coming and asking you and Betty he's been super terrific and patient, but DOT has not been responsive.
I just want to make it clearer that 90 gold street was not asked about this.
