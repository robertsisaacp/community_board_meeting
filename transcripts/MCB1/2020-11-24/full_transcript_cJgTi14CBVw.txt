up recording I see. it started. good evening. everybody, this is Pat more chair quality of life. Mary Alma James is on. she's the co chair. hello? Lucian Rentals is our district manager. going to be running behind the scenes, all of the muting unmuting setting up screens for us to see, like Mariam as so. welcome everyone. and everyone from D. C. is in here and. I don't know who else, but welcome, let's start with you. big 1St, on the table. Pat give me i'm just gonna pick this list. hi, Marlene, i'm going to start pulling people over, so i'm just going to pull over everybody. I know that's in D. C. I know, but you. kind of run your show on your end modeling. I still, we'll start with. we're a straight. yes oh, well, good evening everyone we'll start. i'm sorry. can you hear me? yes, yes. i'm the burrow outreach coordinator for Ddc. we do have everyone. hi. several representatives from construction management. I do believe we have Frankie Lao. if you don't mind if we can start with him is that okay? right. you want to do it it's your show. oh, thank you. I appreciate it. go ahead, Frankie, thank you. hi, how are you got? okay. are you doing? thank you. can you speak a little louder? it's hard to hear you. okay, so I have, the reconstruction of 1 street. downtown, so right now we're still on front. we finished oh, slip section and removing north. passed a little bit past the veneer intersection. we're still working on. utility layout again, we're finding shallow utilities across the board. i'm sorry to hear. is it better now? no, talk a little and see because you're talking about front street, you said? yes, yes front street. I heard you're in the good intersection. yes, so right now we're the intersection. we're still working on a lot of utility interference that we've uncovered so far. so, that's where we are now. we're still. working the plan is to work south to last. with the utility work, and they will come back and we'll do the trolley track work and then the catch basins and then the roadway and the sidewalks. Frank, yes, i'm sorry it's the Wall Street Front street intersection. I think you said go in here. yes. okay okay. it's Wall Street Wall Street, Wall Street Front street intersection. this is the Ccl for frustrate. great. we got it Wall Street straight into. yep, so right now, I think we're still on schedule. the project completion date is still June of 2022. we're so far out that I really don't know right now we're still sticking to that can completion date. and when is the work stopping for the winter season? they apply for the holiday and Baldwin was rented in bubbles. all they're planning on working through. through the holiday season. okay. no, no. no, we have. there's no, yes, we have. we've been granted the embargo from city deal. and they plan on working through the holiday season. so, as long as the weather is not too bad, you might meet your completion in 2022. correct right? hopefully good. if not, you'll let us know next time you can always do. thank you anything else. anything else, Emily you have anything to add. nothing on my end other than the same thing you said, we're doing the utility work running a long front street. okay, and so that's replacing utilities or putting a new or. no, where well, there's, there's new utilities Konedison. have someone else to upgrade some of their facilities. on top of that, we found some shallow stuff that we're lowering so to get them out of the roadway and not interfere with the roadway. so, it was a little bit of both, although we are upgrading the facilities out there now. right also next when there are lower you. whoops. I won't have to correct they won't even fear with. yeah. great. i'm just going to grab. I have my headphones, because i'm having trouble hearing. I'll be keep going. no, that's what I have. great thank you. Anki. we also have Gerald Australia and Sonia from the best street project. so I'll let them go next their update. can you guys hear me this? Gerald? you do a Gerald, I can hear better. all right, yeah, let me know if you guys can hear me or anything. so on the already for the best street reconstruction, as of now, we have the granite curb and sidewalk on industry street, both north side and south side completed. right now. we're currently installing the street lights for the Hudson Investory street intersection. we also have the fedramp on the northwest corner of that Hudson factory street intersection completed. i'm sorry, what was the intersection. i'd send Investory Street. yeah, so we have as of right now we have 1 corner of completed with the granite and sidewalk and the fedramp right now we're currently working on the southwest corner and so we have like, 3 corners left to install. we completed all the work for this project, which is cash base and clean out manuals that's been completed. so, the remaining of the work is the concrete road base placement and the cobblestone. so that is granted to take place. in March. we were going to try to do it. earlier, but we want it to be safe side because. this since the, for both on registry is going to be 7 inches, and then the cobblestone is can be 5 inches with the motor setting bed. that's gonna be a foot. so we. because of the winter season, we wanted to make sure that we were able to install the cobblestones. so, for safety cause, that would leave a 13 inch. gap that would be unsafe. so we're looking to do that in March, which is the concrete road base followed by the. the cobblestone installation. didn't have any questions also we're still our end date is scheduled for June 10th 2021, so we're still anticipating that. the couples don't work shouldn't take that long. the excavator, all the trolley track removal. we removed all the any possible utility interference as of now, when we dug the trolley track removal. so just the concrete road base and the cobblestone should. should go smoothly, we're assuming and then, as of right now, during this time between when we start that work, we're completing all the other work that needs to be done, which is just fedramp work and some of the sidewalks on the intersection of Hudson Rescue street. hey, is at the end of the report. yes, let me just ask mark. are you there? it's mark there, we're taking the 2nd on mute himself. Mark unmute yourself in the meantime does anyone else have any questions? I know mark is are. no, or of all things cobblestone. is he still there? maybe all right. still there. I know which one's him but. Mark, can you hear me? all right? we'll come back. we'll come back if he can be. okay. I just ask a question. yeah. yeah, sure. I just want to ask what i'm a wheelchair user. what is being done at the crosswalks. because I can't use cobblestone at all. I was wondering, what is the treatment that's being done at the crosswalks? also for the crosswalk, that's not going to be cobblestone. it's going to be a year of the plant. it's gonna be like a, it's a granite block pavement. DC did it at another project. i'm not quite sure I could send it to you later, but it's going to be a smoother surface. this is going to be like, highlight granite, but it's not going to be called the stone. so, at those crosswalks, both crosswalks that we're doing, which is going to be on the west end of the Hudson and Investory Street intersection, and also the east end, they're going to be a smoother surface is going to be granite blocks. it's not going to be cobblestone. the other question that we always get is for bike riders, because they can't write on cobblestone. so they write on the sidewalk and then the. we're gonna have a 3 foot proposed bike lane on this grant. on this cobblestones. I was going to be from our drawing. it's gonna be on the north side. so, it's going to be on the north as 3 4. of 3, 3 foot proposed granite blocks can be smooth that goes along street. okay, thank you Joe. could you send us at some point? maybe a. that shows us and lets us know that the crosswalks are compliant. please. okay. yeah, I can send that. I'll send it to Lucian. I'll have a yeah. yeah, I feel that this was I had a question as well. yeah, cool. so there are a number of the. cobblestone streets in our districts where rebuilt by D. C. a number of years ago. I venture to guess, i, I would say over 8 years ago and, some of them. are not in a state of good repair I guess it'd be a terrible way of putting it. 1 of the issues that were identified was that the, the amount of time that goes by. for which the city is able to go after the contractor to redo the work or to get the money back, or do something. had expired before someone raised the alarm. that is these streets are in poor pair. i've. since we've been talking about it, it sounds like the spec has been improved somewhat since. those projects, could you give us a sense? just so we. could be more vigilant at the completion of this project of along the city has to either qual, back payments or. the force contractors to redo their work, the cobblestone should the fill between the cobblestone and start to erode and the house are going to start to move or the substrate beneath the road to go bad or how I know this is not technical, but you've seen some of the other columns from the district. if it starts looking like that, what our resources do we have and what time period do we have to do those. so, typically, the insurance, another DC can answer that, but typically insurance is 1 year after the project completion date. oh. and it's a year and a half for trees. so, I don't know if I don't know if they. no longer. I could always, I could always check if another DDC personnel. I think they might know more about that. when, when they talk about their project, maybe they can answer the question about, like, typical the insurance after I. like, when the project contractor come back and fix those, what's the timeline that they can. and I believe it's a year. okay, I think the, I think the problem arose after well, after a year. I have a question about that. I asked mark. yeah, we wanted to. yeah yeah, it was there was, it was after year, but not well, after a year where the father started deteriorating with the horrible job that this contractor did. cause the city, the city has the ability to sue. cherry cover money to repair and refurbish the Congress. so, as, you know, just for the record again, we don't want these things to be taken away and then paved over. we want the cobblestones repaired. that was the whole purpose of this and it's not only granted stated some of the other streets. that are maybe a little bit less travel. he was starting to notice cracks and them as well. and interestingly, what? Investory streets cobblestones are like, what i'm. 100 years old, and they're actually quite and not that bad shape considering the age. so, what about the, the ability for the city to sue the contractor to get, recruit money to, affect repairs and hire more reputable? company to do to actually do the repair or what needs to be done. in terms of, like, city's ability sue, i'm not sure about that. I have to get back to you on that. that's more of a legal thing and i. i'm more of a, the technical side I have to look into that more and I can always like information and I could send it to leucine. yeah, but a technical perspective would, particularly Greenwich Street I assume you, you observed what Greenwich Street looks like between canal and. no, I haven't gone to that Greenwich Street. yeah, there's a cobblestone street, which is a new really bad disrepair. I mean, they recently fixed the intersection of late in Greenwich with, those, like, different types of cobblestones, not the belgian blocks, which don't look as nice. but and it looks like they did it right this time, cause they did it section by section and let the concrete properly I think. of course, they didn't they, it took a little while to finish almost a couple of months to actually just do the 1 2 section. but what is the, technical process? the actual process for. for repairing these cobble stones, are they, is everything have to obviously be dug up and read done? or are they gonna do it like, point by point locations? well, how would that be done? so, for this project, everything was dug up so existing because underneath every street was existing trolley tracks. so that was removed by the contractors. so we dug approximately cause there was also con, ed underneath. so we dug approximately 4 feet. on the top of the roadway all the way down to remove the trolley tracks. so now that's filled with, that's temporary paved right now. so there's a backfill and then a temporary paved so we're going to. take back the necessary depth to install 9 inch concrete road base. then we have to put in a 1 inch border setting bed and then we put in the call, the stones and that's the whole street curb to curb. and also, just west of history, I mean, just when they're back in the process is going to be. correctly done this time where the allowed to sit and your. and then you do have the street, and then you do the other half. yeah, that's yeah that's what we're doing. so, yeah, because then we also have to let the concrete settle 1st, and then after that's done, then when we install the. the cobblestones would also have to let that settle for quite a while. I might I think I believe it's 3 weeks before. I think i. yeah, cause then yeah, cause it up to. yeah, yeah okay. thank you. temperature. i'm sorry. yeah, did we just ask for this? because this is a good opportunity to. allow the community more to observe the way that which ddc. you know, does, it's, it's checks for this, you know, we're. we're, we're trying our best to get all the other streets re, rebuilt. because there in such poor shape, but, if you would just. take, and I know that you will, I would be. remiss if I didn't ask you to really take great pains, taking care to. really inspect the workmanship of these Pablo Stone streets when it comes time to do the punch list at the end of this project, because we don't want to. get stuck with falling apart cobblestone streets here as well. okay, thank you. I also will be using existing. Capstone, it's not going to be all new. we're going to be inspecting the existing ones that are in good shape and we're going to be using those. and if the ones that we can't, that are not good shape we're gonna be installing new. granted, I mean, new cobblestones. great thank you. okay, so i'm moving on. thank you, Gerald, we do have the Sean, he's the engineer in charge for both the Wall Street Project and with that. so I'll let him continue. alright, yes, good evening. this is project and also for the mobile as Plaza. so, i'm going to update regarding the 1st. the from her son to part grace out by closeout. on October 23rd last a month, we finish the as far paving. for, from a person state to West Broadway, including the intersection, that's the 1st block. and we start to wear traffic over there, and also from the Broadway Colorblind on what state. each side car blind to the, all the way close out. as far saving all the contract work is done and a 2 way traffic was restored in October 20. I think 25, so now the remaining work on our state is. between the Broadway intersection to all the way to Base Norway. East Card, blind on the wall, so, 2 blocks and. 2 intersection, and currently we are working at the intersection and, some of the appointed issue quantities and he's working on that. and we are very, almost all the work is complete except, very small, what our main work for the 1 day remaining and 30 stories and 3rd way. and, and, whatever during the restructure, and if the issue comes up that we need to take care of. so, after borrowing the section at the same time, we are working on the chart intersection. where are we have a water? me right now we're currently working on the guest. and then will be the same relocation then trunk main distribution water may. topics so currently, there are some coordination issues, and they are taking care of right now. so we are waiting for the, some of the design for the Broadway intersection. north of the state. and, we have some issues on the street also. ongoing regarding the feeders, so at this time, I would say, the project should be complete anticipated to be completed by July 2021. July 20. yeah, July 2021 it's funny. 1, and what was the issue on Church Street? you said you had some problems with Peter? yeah. so, yeah, so there are like, 4 feet out. those are on the end of the installation of the campaign and to do the city work. so is working on that 1 and, there is some gas man portion that has been exposed that Conedison has to decide whether. they want to have the new guest main or. just to back, fill that portion. so there are currently 2 issues at Charles. and so, tdc and kind of send is aware of the issues and more update. I think John Marcello is on the phone also. maybe he can update everybody. okay great. can you hear me? hi, John. hey, John. okay. all right. yeah, we always get along. it's not an issue that was like, where to have to work together. wow. yeah, I know. I don't know. it's more, it's more a matter of where can I set my, my utilities and where you could fit the water main and everything. so, but, as far as Broadway. do Shawn is correctly we have to come up with a design to, you know, based basically have shallow feeders over there. and we have to come up with a design to show how we're going to reinforce the roadway. and modify it, so that, you know, approves it and it also in the same, same. so, it, you know, protects our feeders there. and then once that's resolved, just explain to us what are the features for the feeders? do Jim. well, they, they're the ones that, you know, distribute the, their distribution means that's the transformers and then the transformers step down the power and then it feeds the customers. so feeders basically send the. you know, they, they run the higher voltage, let's say so they and they run it to the transformers, which the transformers step it step the power down. and then from there, it feeds the customers. that's basically what they are. they're, yeah, that's basically the gist of it. that's a good explanation. so, in that, you know. yeah, I don't want to go too much into it. anyway, so that's broadway, but as far as charges concerns to kind of piggyback off what Sean was saying, he reference theaters in the intersection of church. now, we. you know, as far as interference as he had mentioned, the feeders are. pretty much we move them to allow for the room to install the gas name that the contractors working on. so right. there is not an issue. it's just, I think what he was referencing was. we have a structure on Church Street that we need to be broken out and modified. and he was referencing that, but. again, we met with the operating groups that came out, they said, you know, we're going to try and figure this out, make it work. so the contractor can break out 1 of our, our mammals and then. they could proceed from there, the gas main work, as you mentioned regarding backfill. that that's more of an, in the realm of. let's say, you know, further north of the intersection it doesn't have anything to do with the interference with the water main, but it will in the future when they want to. switch the traffic flow to let's say the traffic will be on the West side, and then the, the contract will be working on the east side that may affect that in the future. so i'm waiting on an answer from. engineering on my end to say, yeah, the pipe north of the, the existing pipe is sufficient. you can backfill and proceed from there because it's an old main and. typically, it's from the 19 thirties, just to let everyone know. and it's very old, and when I expose it, I like to have, you know, generally we like to have engineering of someone like corrosion. inspect it and tell us yes, no is sufficient. can we leave it? and then just back though and then at a future date somebody, and it was in Canada, we'll decide to replace it or not but. but right now for the worst project. you know, everyone's just waiting on an answer. can we proceed backfill or replace. like I said, i, it's with engineering right now to resolve that. so, currently it's not affecting anything, but later on it, it may, but we're working on it. that's the gist of it. so, at this, we still completion date with. the completion date, even with having to figure this out, we'll still be July 20 of 2020. yeah, they're working on it. yeah. I don't. I don't anticipate the teams too much longer. okay, cool. and, of course, then, you know, just the case, whatever gets in your way, but. yes, any questions? yes. silence. okay, so I thought nobody has a question so I will move to the next project questions from the committee members, but we have. a question from a project in the area. so i'm going to bring over Robert Jamacia and Winston Wolf. I believe. Robert, is that right with the move? you're going to meet yourselves there. Robert okay. Mr. wealth is of you the person who has the drawings. silence. hello. I think you're trying to speak Mr. often. is anyone hearing me is it Winston will name keeps appearing as though he's speaking? yeah, I hear you. I see. Wednesday. but, I don't know, he doesn't light up. can you check your microphone? there's a. yeah, Winston here. okay. hello. hi, Bob, Bob Way this speech. i'm with Terry Studio architects. well, I can, I can you have some slides to show I can give you. yeah, so you can. go ahead and look those up. do you have. the surgical phone number to text them are gone. yes, was this the 50. 2 or 54 street. 35 worth street. oh, my goodness. yeah. okay, so the builder's. okay. sorry Winston, if you can put the proof, build this payment plan up where we have a vault that. that the owner of the building has been. shoring up supports for the past couple of years and. it's important that at this point, we undertake the reconstruction of the vault and the new sidewalk. as well, as along with that, when the street was widened it actually, the street, the curve is now 3 feet over the evolved line, the existing falls. so. as part of the, as part of the solution, they wanted that area skilled off and backfilled. so if you can go pick a detail on that section links there. yeah. so that's that area on the upper left. so, we would like to start the work and we think it's a good time to start. yes. huh. hello? yes, you have 3. for. all right. do you hear me? am I yes. okay, yes, we can hear. okay, so we went to the contractor met with the. Liz, but taste and the project manager for the street contractor. and he said that he couldn't allow us to. work in the streets, so I think that now is the best time to do this work while word street is closed. there's no through traffic there we need to work industry in order to fill the overlap of the roadway below. and we would like to also be able to convert the pedestrian traffic on the industry as well. so, you know, we don't know if the community board can, if this committee can help us, but you did help us with 173. we were the architects who did that come on the project. and I was helping that our client is helping that maybe you could help us with the would get getting approval for being able to work in history and also put a pedestrian lane industry as well. so, we would need 8 feet from the curve in order to do the work. so, who would who's. from the who is that show? yes, he was. yes, this is the center for. we, we will coordinate with the, and have our meeting regarding you apply for the for me by the way. and, yes, I i'm sorry again. yeah, I have the. yes, the the, the build this payment plan, the plans they're all approved and the contractor is trying to I believe he came to permit. yes, he obtained the permit and now he wanted to coordinate he spoke with Liz that taste and the project manager for the street contractor, and he wanted to coordinate the street access. okay, so we will have a meeting with. with your contractor and pasta, and, then we will go from there. so you have a list contact, so we will be in touch with you. and Liz will be the 1, will be in touch with you regarding the. that meeting okay. and so okay. do you have. phone number contact information I have Lizz's contact information, but not. the other information. okay, so, yep. were you on the email that Liz sent out this morning? no, i, I will find out from that list. I will have it. I will take care of this issue. okay, just give me just tell me your name. can you spell it? David, you umbrella shame. H, Y, Yellow and Nancy and T as in Tom. okay, got it. all right. I just want this came up. really, really recently, this is not something that we were sitting on or anything, but it just it was really good timing for the meeting today. I think generally this committee tends to want to minimize the amount of disruption to the pedestrian and. auto environment, and this project's been going on quite some time if this area where to be shut down for a sidewalk sidewalk. so i've taken up for this filling of the, the vault. I think that would, you know. 1 would ask questions why this can be done when everyone is already disrupted. so. I thought it was a good opportunity for us to, to discuss this at committee. right yeah, because after it's been a complete finished no closing of the street again. I will contact 1 another as well. thank you very much. you're welcome. good luck. okay, I have a question though, before we hang up. how long is this going to add time to? what's. to the construction onward street or is this just. it's going to be happening while other stuff is going on. i'd like to interject for a 2nd, this is Liz. can you hear me? okay so I love. from high from my knowledge, they contracted didn't want them in the street and i'm not. Claire, as to why so, simply from his end he denied the permit, because it's in his. review to obtain those permits and, so, from a coordination standpoint, we didn't want them in the street. I don't know, as you said, the shoulder, they would take care of that, but I do know. and he did apply, and then he said, who would not allow them to work in the streets so that's. I will not allow the books. the vaults people who are applying to do the books, but it was testing would not allow them to work in the street. when he has the permits there, I don't know if it's more than the permits. that's the issue. i'm not sure, but this is where the Sean would come in, but i, I wanted to make it clear that. the contractor holds the permits and he gets to decide, but I guess it would the city coming in you'll be able to see if in fact. that's all it is. or if there's some way that we can do a rider or whatever they need to do. okay, and also Liz, so this is so we will review with the. and then we will go from there. okay. if there's a problem which. again, as everyone said, we'd like this project to be completed. and we not have to close the street later. okay I know you will lose. I know. yeah. thank you. okay. thank you. you're welcome. good back. okay, so now, do you finish with we're not. yeah, yeah so, I believe nobody has a question regarding the worst state. so I will go to the 2nd project. that is the Plaza. yeah, so the, most of the work is almost complete. the only remaining is. the planting that will happen in the past week of December. we are waiting for some with a requirement to plant the trees. man, she's only remaining and the 3 plenty. we have to do a little bit, get some system part, but that should not take more time. the main. the main issue right now is the electric connection to the Plaza. and the city duty is aware of that they have to pay to the corner, the invoice, and is, has already requested. City Hall to have the fund April for the connection. and it should happen sometime in December. so, once we have a electric connection to the plaza, sometime in December. second third week I am not sure what time and then we can have the projects substantially complete. and then a polio to open the plaza for the public. what is the electricity? what's a do what's it there for lighting or. yeah, that's part of the electric connection is required for the, for some early lights in the plaza. also, that is i d system. also, also, there is the there is a connection to the clock. that will be installed by friend, regardless. so electrical connection is required to even to is the case and system also. okay, but right now the inside state lives are fed by the, the electricity's from the state light city state lives. so there is, there is some light over there, but it's not really to. call substantially complete at this time. so should we complete everything by December? okay, great. all right. does that make. and so when you say completed by December, you may before Christmas. depends on the how the can pay the. invoice to the Con Edisonison, because once they pay, then only will connect to the. connect will provide the connection from the domain all. so, at this time, it's hard to say. so drive 1, and we anticipate in in, in December, anytime. okay, great thank you. thank you now. okay. Committee. no questions. oh, okay, so I thank you. thank you is that did we talk about. with something on water oh, I don't believe will come in until. that might you tell me that a budget comes back? okay. is there any updates. on any future pipeline projects, I believe, frankly, provide some information on the Nasa Project project. Frankie. please yeah just to double back about water stream with the ABC work. Amelia. are you still around? we've been in touch. yes, i'm here. I think they're starting from correct there. they, they just got some I think something from they said, but it's still going to take some time to get the contract ready, but they believe by early next year, they should be. some activity should start early next year. not sure what month though. okay. a few months they should be out there probably, you know, starting to put out their stuff. expect to have come and give us, I write it down before that. okay. okay, so now we got a national St Loosen. you had asked about his meetings at all. they stop design when called it hit some old about March. they, they hold the design, and they just restarted design in about. the end of October, so right now the tentatively scheduled for design completion, December of this year, and they're expecting construction. I would say, 3rd, quarter of next year. so, December 2020. and 3rd, quarter of 2021 will start right? yes, and what is the scope of that? I forget we don't remember. this is still reconstruction of national street from. Pine to maid and lane. for construction, and how long as we expected to take. oh, i, I don't know I don't have specifics of it as of yet. I only have the plan. so, I don't expect that at least. i'm sorry, I couldn't that I would say, at least 24 months. okay. and it will update us 1 of the warning flags that come up to me because Nasa in such a narrow street. and so the reconstruction of that will dominate that street and. he'll be really important to bring a ccl in very, very early because there is a large amount of. activity and litigation that we can do by. really getting buildings to change the way they do things because I love rice and things. there is just there's this very limited area for you all to work and then the buildings to function as. all things need to do so we need to really think about how they're going to be doing trash. and the residents, and you can wrap their heads around it. so earlier you can bring somebody on to help us coordinate. outreach to all the buildings in that area, the scope, the project area that would be really, really important for us. is there, what's your timeline of bringing Ccl on. we don't even have it hasn't even been big yet. I don't believe so. okay. I don't even know what which consulting for a minute. so I really. I can't give it information as of now. okay. I don't even need a package. you keeping in mind. we'll know a little bit more and once I know I'll let you guys out so you guys yeah, we'll want to start immediately for, for Nasa just because of this. the uniqueness of those conditions there. american time yes horribly tiny. you said it was gonna go on for about 2 years and what's the anticipated? start date again? sorry I would say we start 3rd quarter. i, I don't have a specific date. you know, this is the design being done by the end of this year, then it's still needs to go out to bid. it has to go through a whole process.

I got to take it down. it took it down down. I found the guy. good. very good. thank you. okay. no problem. happy. Thanksgiving. you, bye Bang. so, Rosa, you have to keep us you have to remind us and please come back in January. let's see if we have some updates for you. okay. thank you. yeah, what time is what kind of noise and what time is it starting. we're getting complaints about noise starting at. around 7, ish in the morning 7, this Friday at 8. ish but 7 ish seems a little early. can you possibly if you can locate where the noise is coming from, we might be able to do something about it. I think no, at our last board meeting. we did determine that and i'm sorry, but my memory fails me on the details, but I'll find out and get back to you for sure. yeah, I thought that they weren't supposed to start construction or loud noises till 9. not really any okay. I mean, what we generally request is that we, if we call someone in to the committee, we ask them to not start the loud noise that they will be making, you know, the 1st thing, but they're legally right it's 8. I think it's earlier than that, I think we just have a good relationship with and they enforce the loud noise and a thing, but. they could do staging and work. 7, but that's not a hard fast rule for construction. and as you all know, you've heard me before, say we ask them to also make their contract is aware that yelling is noise. you know, so we will try to work on it if we can be of help, let us know. I have a question that's a little strange now that we're on this topic very high, pitched noise, like a crazy high pitch noise. it starts in the morning at, like, 630 ish. is that normal? do you have you ever heard anything like that before? the only hype I have is the, and that's over at the, the greek church. oh, this event. do you have some preventing. system near your building I don't believe. so. okay. and I sorry I didn't want to take up any time with that. no, that's fine. I mean, you know, if you go if your walk, if you happen to be out around 630, doing your power walk, maybe you can locate where it is and let us know. thank you. okay. thanks so much. where are we what's next? what what's going on? oh, we've got guests, so I assume that we have Lizzie. think housing was next if i'm correct. yeah. so, who do we have? we have Lizzie Care. Senator Cabinet and so do we have for, you? yeah, Peter and when you leave office a night. quality as well, I see Claudia and here. bringing over Lizzie I bring you over as well. i'm going to go ahead and record. Hannah, I'll bring you over, just because i'm on a roll and he let me know if there's anybody else that. you have for your office and I need to pick up 1. note just me tonight. okay. bye. yeah, hi good. how's everyone hanging in there? and so it's just you, and then who is from you link. hi, everybody, this is Peter Chromosome remember News Office hope everybody is doing well. we are how are you? good. i'm good. been by relaxing, ever since the elections. yes, we're all a little calmer. so, we have, we're going to discuss the, you've had to. last me put it off until, you know. to night to discuss the housing, the. legislation or anti eviction legislation. so where do you want to start. I guess I can start. so, from my understanding, you guys want to talk about a 10 0 t to 7, which is the eviction moritorium and our own council red bill, which is a 10 8 to 6, and, cabinets Access voucher program, which is a 9657. right. can you type on that until the, well, it's made again so, are you saying, like a like, apple or 8 like number 8. hey, like apple? yes. oh, definitely. right so 810 8, 2, 6 and a 9 6 5 7. yes, got it. thank you. sorry. Mm. so yes, I will quickly go through the provisions of. both a 10 0 t to 7, which is the eviction moritorium and then i'm gonna go over our very own retton, mortgage cancellation, bill. and then I'll let Lizzie take over the access voucher program, which is center capitals, bill. and then, I guess we can open up the floor to any questions. anybody has then go from there. so, the eviction moratorium bill is held by assembly member rays and send her. and from my understanding of the bill, it would prevent convictions. for a cover for the Covid-19 covered period. so the covered period is basically. from March 7th to the end of the state of emergency, plus 1 year for all residential and commercial tenants. so essentially it bars any court from authorizing the execution of a worn of eviction or order any monetary judgment for red. to the landlord, so that's in a nutshell. what assembly member raises eviction moratorium bill does. and on top of that, going into our rent and mortgage cancellation, bill, essentially, what our bill would do is it would suspend all retton mortgage payments for all residential tenants and small homeowners, for the state of emergency. and for 90 days. after the end of the state of emergency, in a nutshell, it also provides tenants and homeowners with a right to relief. so pro prohibitions against any fines fees, eviction and it also prevents the curl of any suspended payments and adverse, credit reporting. on their credit reports as well so that in a nutshell is what our bills do if Lizzy wants to take it from there. we can do that and then open up the Florida any questions. that's beautiful, thank you for your time as you all probably know by now, this is and the narrative is definitely not a 0 t sum game, but there's some alternative, aspects to how we can approach, the accruing background and the threat of eviction of course, as Peter noted there are the eviction moratorium bills that are being presented and should be voted on very quickly. there's also a, as. assembly number, you lean passionately spouses is to cancel that movement. there has been a separate movement to pay the background and the continuing occurring rent, due to Covid-19 related disasters with the federal aid that we desperately need. Senator Cabinet has been on that aspect of the perspective. since this is all streamlined and to vital services that we need property taxes, pay some of the most crucial and critical local community resources. so we do have the bill. it's Senate Bill S as in the Senate 8, 1 4 0 t b and we continue to advocate for federal funding for that comprehensive rent relief. in essence, this bill is going to provide rental assistance in the form of emergency housing vouchers. it's going to subsidize rent that exceeds 30% of the household income for household that suffered a significant loss of income during the pandemic. and as you guys all know, there has been the emergency Retton relief act that was passed and the department of homes and community renewal. has distributed 40 m of the 100 m dollars in the federal Chairs Act funding that it mobilized. there has been justified criticism of their not to speak enough. and the senator cabinet is revising the legislation to make the eligibility criteria less restrictive so that more applicants can benefit. but again, this is. this is 1%, and when we, when we made this into statute, this was 1% of the need, even less of the need that we have of now proportionately. so, i'm really into perspective that we just really do need that federal aid in regards to the housing access voucher. this was a pre pandemic, which seems like years ago from today. but if you guys wanted to have the bill number, this is. assets and set it 7, 6, 2, 8 a, as an apple. this is modeled after the programs like section 8 where it would allow for people to have the, rental assistance in the form of housing vouchers to eligible families who are experiencing homelessness, or are facing an imminent loss of housing. and this would be to designate the public housing agencies and state to administer that program. there are several housing voucher programs that are available through the city as you guys are all aware. and this would be important to the state level. contingent on the, we thought would be available before the pandemic hit so very different circumstances, but just in case, you guys wanted to know a little bit of the context of that. right? for the moment, questions. yes, I have a question. oh, sorry. how much federal aid will be asking for. yeah, the figures are a little bit. it's a big difference. so, in the beginning, when they were discussions of the Heroes act, being past, the carries act, 2.0 t, we were hoping for. a 100B dollars in nationally and 10b to be allocated to New York state specifically for housing with that said that was months ago. now, which is hard to believe and the need for this has been even exacerbated because of the lack of action, and only to worse. and so we're continuously having this. to be an iterative process of asking for funding, but our official ask has been since the hero's act 100B dollars nationwide and 10b dollars for New York state. and so you haven't increase that ask. we are constantly talking about it. I will, I will see I don't want to miss so. that's fine. you'll let us know. yes. Mary, i'm a yes, these suspension that Peter reference as such time as it's lifted. for how long would tenant have to gather the funds and to pay. could you say the suspensions been lifted today? how long did you have to. so you're talking about either the eviction moratorium, or are you talking about the, the, our cancel rent bill? yeah, I think it was your cancel rent bill, right? so, for our cancel red bill, it would not make tenants liable for any payments that they've missed. so the pay, the rent would not occur overtime. ok, and I guess for. the other program, the Senate program, if the Fed runny doesn't come until, at least January I think, realistically, speaking, that's the earliest we can expected. that's when the legislature goes back for New York state. and that's when we have a new president that may be willing to do it right? so, if we have to wait until then, but what happens in the meantime, what happens in December if predictions have already started in New York. so, a little bit have they started. I saw some upstate, I don't know if that's New York City 2 or not. hello can you guys hear me? okay? yes. okay. so the state of affections currently, while they are permissed permitted, there's a huge backlog of fiction cases. a hold of our cases have been proceeding snails pace and relation to. the massive eviction rates that we saw before the pandemic. so. for better or worse, like, in lock in lieu of any real statutory protections that we have been calling for in the state Senate and assembly that has been kind of a saving grace for us in regards to addictions. but again, not sufficient. we need this to become law. there's several different eviction moratorium bills that are on the table that the Senate and the assembly need to pass. with that said the emergency rental relief act, you're a, is as wholly insufficient as it. is was to mobilize as any money that we had in the New York state budget to try to address, at least a little bit of the problem. but again, this is something that is. it's, it's a difficult, difficult question, but as we're moving forward, we're going to try to make sure that. anything that we can mobilize during that time before January that we can again. we are, we are fixing the, we're trying to fix the legislation and we're trying to vote on this in the legislature as soon as possible, although we don't know when we're going back into session. everything is quite still very much so in limbo despite our relieved anxieties about the federal election. so, as that ongoing crisis continues, we will make sure to mobilize anything that we can again. I don't it's a difficult question for sure. but I hear you, Mariana. keep us when you. of course, so, do you what I read sell from a fee of some help. can I minutes happy Friday so yeah, it definitely wouldn't hurt. okay. so, i, I think it would help. so just to also add on to what, what Lindsay said. and so we and the assembly. you mean, it's been pushing with other assembly members to call. have the speaker call us back into session? by the end of the year, unfortunately, it doesn't seem like that's gonna happen. you know, we, we've been pushing really hard, not only for housing legislation, but also revenue bills, you know, as you guys know, we're facing a huge, huge budget deficit that's coming up next year but it seems like. state leadership seems to be holding off until a federal aid package is passed before they call everybody back in a session still. even after the elections, so we're, we're. trying to do what we can it would be definitely helpful. I think. that if you guys passed a resolution, in support of these bills, because they're. really it's really important for us to go into session as soon as possible. not wait until, you know, a new federal aid package is passed. cause, you know, people are losing will be losing their homes very shortly. so, we need to add some more sense of urgency to everything. and so, Peter again, i'm sorry did you were you able to put the. I'll build that. yes, I am on my phone, so i'm trying to figure out how to do that. oh, okay. oh, you just. shoot loose in an email email. yeah, that's yes, I will shoot him an email. right? and Lindsay also please. problems different red cells 1 for in support of senator cabinets bills and 1 in support of assembly woman, news bills. so, if you would yeah, just shoot us emails, questions from the committee or. we have Justine Data. that's all I see. and then Taylor and that order. yes. okay, I just had a couple of questions, I think. i, I think that these, these laws are really a central, and they. are really meant to help a lot of people, but i'm worried about whether or not they're balanced. and so my understanding of no eviction. of the eviction Moritorium was that no, 1 could be evicted for 1 year. what could be evicted for the whole period of the state of emergency and then plus 1 year and that the. the rent program, if you can not pay the rent, then. it's the whole period of market phase. so my concern is to the. the small, the small owners that have to pay for. heating oil have to pay to fix things. how does how did this balance out? I mean, is there any way that has the legislature. thought about how to protect those interests or how to keep those payments going. so that so the. so, that the owners also have a balance here cause that's the whole that's already been an amazing 9 months. it'll easily run through March or April next year. so it'll be a whole year plus a year. these are very long periods for little operators to survive. so. is that under consideration in this? yes, so that is under consideration in our council rental. another section of our bill also establishes a small landlords fund. so essentially what the fund would do is it would help small landlords become whole by taking a combination of federal money and state money. your mark, a certain amount of those funds into the small landlords fund, and essentially. any landlord that has tenants that are covered under. our council rent, bill would be eligible to receive. an amount of money up to the amount of dollars that they've lost. from miss payments so that is for our bill. there is a mechanism. that is contingent on, you know, federal funding and state funding. I can't speak for, assembly member raises bill, but I will say that, you know, the bills that we introduce, you know, many of them are not in their final form. yet when they go into committee, there will be amendments. once they get to the floor, there will be other amendments. so, this is, or it could be included in a package of other bills as well. so, you know, by all means, just as the bills are introduced, it doesn't mean that. they're the final versions of the bill we are very cognizant. we've had several meetings with small landlords in our district and, you know, they've brought these concerns to us and, you know, where we're trying to work them into our legislation as much as possible. because we do understand that there are a lot of small landlords out there that are also financially suffering as well. so, we're gonna do what we can to make that whole as well. yeah, I have a question on that. what's the definition of that you're using for small property owners? so, as of now. I believe it is ranked by. I have to look at the billing which again, but I believe right now it is the number of units within the landlord's portfolio, but, we have been discussing with certain advocacy groups, and some groups upstate as well. about possibly changing the definition of a small landlord. because, you know, even though a landlord might have, you know, x, number of units in their portfolio, you know, it, it doesn't mean that they're not running at a loss or, you know, they're, they're generating income. if they have a large number of properties. in their portfolio, so, we're, we're still working that out with center office as well as housing groups right now. so. we will be updating that language. shortly, I just have to say that it seems to me as though the whole industry is going to be starving through this. so, even the fairly big players would be. suffering and so I think a collapse there is also. possible and important and so but the, the thing here is all of this is balanced on the hope that there's going to be federal money, but. I pray for it every day, but i'm not sure that it's coming. I look at this guy and the clouds are and don't seem to have big rain in if, if the federal government doesn't come through. then, how will the state of New York get to the 1st, 6 months of next year? yes, agreed agreed. so that is also something that we've also taken into consideration. so, another thing that we're working on with a coalition of lawmakers is a revenue package. so, you know, this revenue package is comprised of several bills, you know, a ultra millionaires tax stock buyback, et cetera, Et Cetera. so that's gonna. essentially help us raise revenue on the state level to help pay for not only the budget deficit that the state is spacing. in the next year, but over the next several years, and on top of that lean is also working on several bills. that would tax, companies. essentially tax companies for the sale and use of personal data. so, that that's something that's on the back burner right now that we're still working on, but that's in the pipeline. so, we're hoping that these items will. generate revenue for the state to help essentially pay for these bills. yeah, that was a really great synopsis Peter, but also, just to follow up on Bob your 2 questions, there are several different eviction Moritorium bills that are being proposed. I believe the 1 that you are talking about with the year between is Senator. Bill S8 6 7 excuse me? there is also Senate bill S8 7, 8, a, which suspense proceedings to recover real property state wide until January 22021 and essentially is a shorter time period again, senator cabinet as a sponsor both of these bills. so these are not 0 t sum and Bob in regards to your very, very valid concern. kind of has been the premise of our perspective, that this narrative of landlords pitted against tenants is actually not the reality of a lot of the tenants that we've been seeing and the experiences that we've been seeing, we've been meeting with the group a small property owners of New York, a coalition of property owners all across the state of who are, who are. many of them are mom and pop or have a very limited definition are limited. a safety net that they can also fall on to who pay the property taxes that pay again are essential services. so, that has been the, the basic, fundamental idea of the bill and, you know, this is a. contingent on that federal aid, and needing to increase as much income as Peter said in the state as well. I just wanted to end my comments with just the 2 big concerns here. 1 is even if you hold off convictions for a long time. when they happen, we really have to think through what we do for the people who face eviction. that's a terrible thing. and how we respond to that even if we can stop them I think even from my own point of view. if I failed to make a payment in 1 month and 2 months, and 3 months, I can't even imagine how much I pay in a year. and i've been pretty fortunate. so, for people who aren't working who have kids. that they never will have enough. to make those repayments, they won't ever have enough to overcome eviction. and i, I don't think that they could ever have enough to pay their rent. however long. you. you make them into paying it so those are my concerns. question. if I could pipe in, this is Tom Burton. hi, Tom well, we had a list. we have an order. yeah. Mary. Justin is next. okay. sorry, Tom. i'm going to go and my question's going to kind of follow up on Bob's question. in terms of funding 1st of all I support these bills. i'm really glad to hear that you're focusing on the small landlords, the landlord's as well as the tenants because both are. suffering when everybody's suffering with the situation right now, things decoded but something that I want to call and make sure that it's on your guys radar as well. is that. if these bills, the revenue package, and other places to get funding for this money, to kind of fill in the shortfall of the budget for New York City, New York state, they don't pass or we're still stuck without any money. what has been the fallback as i'm learning as i'm researching this has been to increase. property taxes, real property taxes on class 2 homes, which. kind of hits in the pocket of Manhattan and particularly, but there are other places because class 2 homes are condos and co ops and I have to tell you that while we're paying attention and we should pay attention to keeping people who are renters in their homes. we also have to be aware that people who are only in their homes and owning their property can be forced out of their homes from ridiculously large increases in their taxes. something that's happening in New York has been that there's been a cap on class 1 homes. in the tax situation, the class 2 homes there is no cap and I know that there was a discussion and there was some review as to what was fair, what was not fair. and I guess I got to tell you guys when you're looking at whatever the Mayor Commission, and that evaluation of the taxes, when it comes to class 1 versus class 2. if. your conversation is, how do we get 5b dollars or whatever it is? if the pie stays the same from real estate taxes all you're going to do was pass the pain between class 1 and class 2. if the pie has to shrink so I guess what i'm going to say to you is we need other ways to get money. it can not look to revenue. you can not look for revenue and shortfalls in the budget from your property taxes, because you will put a homeowners out of their homes. and that's what I have to say and I just, I don't expect an answer particularly, but i'd like to keep the discussion going. well, that's duly noted, thank you. just. next. running back to my I had to answer my I think data took her hand down, but I don't know if that's because she's no longer see that his hand. so then maybe Tom. and then Taylor, that is hand is still up. oh. hello. hi. okay, my question was already asked, so I won't ask me a question, but I can offer some clarity about real estate taxes. class 1 homes have 1 type of cap on them. class to a, to b, and to see also have a cap, but it's a little higher. but then class 2 have no cap. class 2 in that role club. yeah. well, cost 2 is any building 11 units and bigger. whether it's rental, whether it's condo or whether it's. and, yes, those taxes are calculated on an income approach instead of an estimated value approach. they tend to be a lot higher. and task 1, taxes begin with plus they don't. correct and just for the record here in battery park city. i'm not even talking about the ground rent. I want to make that 100% clear. this is the property tax, and i'm talking about. yes, that's what I was referring. okay, thanks, Eva. thank you. for Tom. we lose time. stop let me just so you didn't lose me, but I had trouble with my fat finger. I am a. I was going to ask about issuing a bond. and if that has been floated at the state level of. similar to war bonds we are in a situation that I think. parallels that level of mobilization and i'm wondering if, if that idea is being talked about and how we could get some, some. Covid-19 bonds issued so that we can self help. as a, as a state, so I believe I heard something like hat several months ago. in terms of whether, or not, it's, been taken, into our revenue package. I don't believe so. but i, I can definitely do some research and circle back with you guys on that once I figure more. information out, but yes, not. I can definitely take a look at it. where did you where do you think you heard it in government or just you heard recently? no, no so essentially, we've had revenue meetings and if I remember correctly, the idea was floated, but in terms of it materializing into something, i'm not sure that it has. so i'm just going to have to look back and see in my notes. where that is right now, is there any. any depth on that we could, you know. either receive, or like, what would the process be? you know, any, any. anything beyond what you just. shared with us now? no, not that. not that I know of right now. I would 2nd, that I am not sure if anything if there's any movement behind that. I would just like this to speak with Tom and say, that's a pretty good idea. and maybe we could put a resolution along those lines to support the idea of a things like a bond because it's a very fair. way to exceptional need. yeah, I would support that. okay, we'll talk about that after we get through all of our same. I think it's a really good idea. so, after Taylor, we also have a caller. 91778 3. well, let's say I'll go 1St Taylor. I get. Taylor, i've muted you. thank you. and I wanted to just thank the committee for bringing these topics up. i'm so excited and thank you to the speakers are presenting them. I support this as a resident CB 1, and I also just wanted to note that it sounded like 1 of the things we can do. with the is also ask that they be that the bills be brought. to the floor before the end of the year. so I just wanted to add to see if you guys have to be willing to include that possibly as a line item. thank you. when we start to write the resume, bring that back. Taylor. for sure. sorry, i'm muted. I would say state city, we should ask for it everywhere on federal, you know. okay, keep somebody keep a note of that so we can add that. and who was the caller posting? we have somebody on the phone. from you going. hi, identify yourself with. it it's mark ever, so. yeah, yeah. okay. so I just have a comment. I don't have a question as, it, what I want to say, i'm, i'm perplexed at the. suggestion and the continuous mindset and of a millionaires tax companies. why don't we just get more? why? why don't we just get people to say this leave just leave. you know, leave New York, they're leaving in droves. why don't we get more people to leave. what the state should be doing is. to help landlords and all the businesses is to defer taxes and stop nickel and diming them on every g*** regulation and summons. and then for these things, particularly with restaurants. the, the small minded thinking, instead of thinking outside the box to try and fix these things and just tax and expect federal money. for pre, existing condition of complete mismanagement of the state and the city is ludicrous and it's not gonna happen and more people leaving. and i'm sorry to say the place I grew up and is never going to be the same because of this meant mentality of. continuing mentality of tax and that'll be fixed and the federal bail us out. it's not gonna happen. these people are ruining our city. it's disgusting. and i'm pissed off about it. that's my comment. thank you mark. all right. i'm not opposed to including tax department in that list of. proposals that we would just put in here. yeah, I would add that to create ways to do. it makes sense. because i'm a small business owner. I yeah, i'm down. 95%. I still have to pay my sales tax on the shackles. I do. I have to charge late fees on everything. I chose not to clean my income taxes last year for 2019. which were substantial I had a good year in 2019. because I needed the money to continue talking about it now to be to continue losing money this year. so, and spending it on my boats and on my business. so. and I still have payroll taxes and, you know, so. I couldn't agree more with what mark had to say there that i'm not going into, because I don't know how mismanaged our state city is. right but I do think that tax deferrals or abatement. and just giving us a break if you tell us, we can't work and we can't make money. then you can't charge us for the rest of it and I think that's just. that's just the an obvious thing and then we have to come up with alternate revenue streams and. you know, I don't want to cut you off, but we need to move on to get to the rest of. yeah Barry now, let's go to Betty. bye thanks. I want to speak. actually, i'm in favor with. a lot of the things said that want to pull them together. there are a lot of people hurting. I am not for just waving wrench the stop eviction, unlimited amount of time, whereas the phone is ringing. yeah, it's mine, it's there is so much need to help 1 group stay a year beyond the pandemic. I had to move out of New York at one point because I couldn't afford to live here. I wouldn't enable people to just keep adding onto the debt that they owe because it's a whole they'll never get out of. that's just my opinion. and I don't think this I agree with mark, the feds aren't going to bail out the full amount. so we can't squeeze the small business owners. we can't squeeze the people who own the buildings everybody for the sake of just 1 group renters who aren't paying rent. maybe some of them should put on, move on. maybe should just move to a different place with the New York around the new patient they do find, but it needs to be a much more balanced approach. not for any 1 group. cause everybody's hurting, that's all upset. yeah, if I can speak to that, buddy, I took and mark, I hear your guys. 1 thing that we are trying to balance in your group. this is Lizzy. can you guys hear me? okay. better thank you. okay, great. so, here are your guys's frustrations and, you know, it's a different it's a very, very difficult. time to be balancing so many interests, but we are, that is the prerogative that we have in 1 off the small business recovery lease carried in the Senate by Senator, Brian Capital and an assembly by assembly member new. we are looking to provide the city with the authority to provide tax abatements for, for commercial landlords who are willing to settle on a mutual agreement with their commercial tenant, specifically, with small business owners to, to receive a rent credit for the landlord as an incentive to restructure existing leases for a longer term stability as well as a deferment on some of the payment. in a way that is balanced. again, the states. responsibility in this would be to authorize the city to make these changes that need to be made to taxes to tax structure as says a very specifically city issue. okay. then he comments, I also wanted to make the distinction that I asked Peter earlier specifically the question as to whether or not the people would have to catch up what they meant later. like, it was going to come back. and that's not the case. I think that was inferred by 1 of the recent. comments that how are people going to catch up? they're not going to have to catch up according to it's being canceled, right? that's the state is paying for it. essentially. it's assuming that's assuming. there's money from the feds to do that, and that doesn't help anyone who owns a condo or anything, because they can't get those kinds of breaks. they don't pay taxes. they just lose. who does in place that anyone who owns a condo or. other property, if you lose your job, there's no bail out for you. no, you just look at the home. yeah, exactly. that was my point of my, but that's why I said, listen to everybody. that's reality. yeah, no, it's true. it's all connected. you're right and it's very, very convoluted and we've got to figure out a way to function get money from someplace else and I don't know where it's coming. right. i'm going to answer. this discussion for 1 reason and 1 reason only 1st of all. are there any other questions for Peter and Leslie? and then Peter don't see any more questions and I know that we go to a resolution 1 more. I had 1 more question which was related to the, the current topic of rent and. and trying to find some equitable way at this. it has there been discussion. of people that can you hear me? sorry? has there been discussion? of people that are, you know, that there'd be a test that you have to have been affected. you can't just decide you're not paying rent if you, if your income remained. stay the same and your input, you didn't get laid off, et cetera. because I assume that there's that going on as well but so that you have to prove. on a in a basic way, or at least testify. to the fact that you are Covid-19 affected within a certain parameter and then. and you get the money, and then afterwards, you know, there can be an enforcement afterwards that make sure that you were telling the truth. something has that been discussed or a part of this. so, yes, it has been discussed. I want to preface this with the fact that, you know, as I mentioned earlier, you know, the bill goes through any bill goes through a deliberation process, you know, there's negotiation back and forth between certain details of the bill. so the bill that we have now might not look very similar to the bill we end up with. so I just want to preface that real quick. but in terms of having a means test for whether or not a person is, in need of rental assistance, there isn't a mechanism for means testing in our current cancel retton, mortgage bill. because, you know, there is an issue with means testing. you know, Covid-19 affects basically everybody of us citizens to undocumented immigrants so, by implementing. tests essentially, we'd be leaving out those individuals that may not have documented income. might not have, might not be U. S. citizens. so we wanted to make an inclusive bill that would include those groups as well. but, you know, like I said, before, we, we still are looking at the bill. we still are looking at the language, and then when we go back into session, we're gonna have further discussions on this. and then, you know, we might end up with a different bill. okay. all right. i. end this topic, and go back to it to discuss the rest, but i'd like to end it right now. so we can move to. unless someone else has a question or again, Peter and Lizzie, if you have anything else you'd like to, at. I don't see any. okay. cool. great, Peter. thank you. both so very much. if you don't mind, and again, which just shoot those bill numbers to. motion, so we can all come up and we will write a, since you're not really going to you don't know when you're going back to session. we'll discuss the committee, but try to get that out to be approved that next Tuesday's. full board meeting, or whether they will wait until December, but we can talk about that and committee after later on feel free to stay on. we actually have another state issue coming up with the transplant. I was going to that to was so good job was okay I was hoping we would move to number 4. because we don't have a speaker for number 3. so that Hannah can go if she'd like to, so I will want us to do number 4 next thing anti racism. Mm. okay. hey, Pat i'm so sorry, it's listening to. Tammy Sorry, I tried to stick my hand up, but I was having computer issues on my side Peter, and the team from Central Lizzie, and such be able to send us whatever they have on potentials based on the last conversation. do some kind of written follow ups so we can track it for you to do a. it's email. yeah, and Peter, and kind of can send us or anything that they have that we can follow up by email for the last fiscal. rejuvenation, I'll call it. what do you mean an update on the bill since. yeah, that makes start it. yeah, Peter Lindsey. all right, well think about it and then if you have something, which you please shoot it to us. the other question I had actually was, do you know how much money. is old both between mortgages and rent. have anything not off the top of my head, but something that semi related I believe. is, the budget deficit that we will be facing in terms of the pandemic? I believe the figure that was floated around was a 100B over the next 5 years, and that's only going to be growing, so that's why everything that's just New York, right? yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah and that's that. okay. which is another reason why the bonds are a good idea. but wait so the 100B that includes also Mta. I believe so that was the number that I was given, but I can double check on that. okay because we don't have a breakout number for just rents and mortgage. I do not. okay. okay so please send anything that you have, including the numbers so that we can follow up with this. and in the meantime, thank you both so much for. spending your thing with us and have wonderful holidays to come and be safe. thank you everyone for and again feel free to stay if you want before we move to the next topic. I have a question. is it my headphones that i'm having trouble with? or is everyone having trouble with the sound breaking up correctly? yeah, I think it's you have your headphones. okay i've taken off these headphones. it's Friday. so, let's move to the, the racism in public act of 2012. hi, everyone. I will be very recent 1st of all. I just want to started to tie rabid around the last conversation. so the is still stalled obviously in the Senate. I will keep you posted if anything comes of it. I know that the sentence end date their session tonight. and they'll be back after Thanksgiving, so we don't have an update anytime soon. there's a lot of things kind of up in the app and I didn't get any information. I will make sure to update you on that in terms of the anti racism in public health. so, I don't have a new updates since I last spoke with you last month and the bills, and introducing the house in the Senate. but it has not been assigned to committee yet. so we're going to keep. kind of working on that and keep a post, keep you posted on it. I will say that the, and maybe American Medical Association had a special meeting, and they recognize racism as a public health threat. so there is some traction around this and some conversation around this. so I can, I can send out that link of just the press release that they had sent out. I know that I was under warranty it out so hopefully, that urgency to move forward, but I don't have an immediate update. so, again, I am sorry and I know that at the last meeting, we were asked about how the information kind of shows up in our district and so i'm working on getting that data free. so, hopefully by the next time we meet. what we'll keep working at that so, if there's any specific questions about the bill or about how it's moving and you can feel, I can try and answer the best that I can, I can also ask some questions for our legislative director in D. C. and get back to you as well. so, can we continue to put the item on every month until we. get to it, is that okay sure. I mean, I will send that, I don't know what's going on in the lame duck session, but i'm happy to stop by and give you an update the best that I can and anything added to the interim Mariam. I'll make sure to email you. I know that you've been really pushing this measure and just thank you for that. so we'll keep it that. and of course, you can always say, i'm always happy to spend a Thursday evening with, you. we, we enjoy having your thank you. so, anything else that I see a question from Taylor. 11, hi, thank you so much. sorry about that i'm just so excited to hear the statistics that are, I guess specific our district. so, I hope that if it comes to the community board, I can, I can learn it there. i'm also trying to advocate for, in other spaces. I know. it's, it's a really important and important 1 so I think having info. available like, how locally, could really help with local advocacy thank you so much. thanks Taylor any other questions from the committee. Tammy, your hand is from before, right? yep, sorry about that. no problem. okay, so Hannah oh, I was asking though, is there anything else that you the update. respond that is working on. oh, I was going to come Monday, Tuesday, full Board. so i'm happy to give you a specific update then. sure, I was just going to I had actually emailed Lucian and Tammy, but the most important thing that's happening, which we're really excited about, is that the is going to affect December. 1st. so, after years of advocacy, especially for lower Manhattan, hope, hopefully, we'll see the benefits of having and that split toll and that the traffic on canal she will start to dissipate. and then also, I mean, we're, it's a busy season. so, we're trying to hopefully plan for what's coming next. we'll see what happens with the elections in Georgia, but that's kind of our focus at the moment. I will if there's anything else I'll make sure to I'll be there on Tuesday. so, I'll make sure that as well. okay, great, thank you. all right so who's sending you an email? oh, you 1. so it's not a problem. can everyone. okay, any other questions. all right, then Hannah, I can, we'll see you Tuesday, but if somebody will say it sure. let's say they say, and thank you for. with always behind and i. okay, so we're going to move on to the last item, which Barry on so oh, yeah it's very comprehensive. very.

I didn't even print it out, but I told him I have your email. yes, Joe so there it is. okay. and oh, before we start testing that you get it. that needed it, you want to have it.

Burton are you still there? yes. so thank you for coming and enjoy your holiday. we've passed the Resa. we'll present it to the full board on Tuesday. if you'd like to join in that meeting. and you say, thank you very much. you too. thank you. good night. okay, so let's circle back to. 1st of all remember everyone next month, the 1st, half of our meeting, we're going to do resume writing. and now, not only do we have Betty and listen to help us learn how to do it but we now have. Mary, okay, so let's circle back to the rest that we wish to write for the New York State Housing. it's very complicated. 1st, I guess we should decide. how lots of. input from the committee, just now, like the bombs and not necessarily everyone's in agreement on where the money should come from. solution you have some suggestions on how we should tackle this. yeah, I guess the 1st, thing that comes to mind is that we can use this as a, as our subject matter for December. if you'd like, we're going to once we get the. information from everyone, an email, you can make sure everybody can read up on the what bills are out there. and then I can create, like, a menu of items that we can kind of go through and. assemble it that way he cares about. like, bullet points yeah and then putting together the resolution in December. so, and so I have a suggestion. remember I said to everyone who was you were throwing out ideas? can you please just. send a, even if it's just 1 bolt solution. you know, Tom, you want, you were interested in the bonds. Betty, you were interested in. sorry, I lost train of thought there was most of what was said, the tax deferrment. that the co ops, the condos. oh, yeah, Justin, you were talking about class too, but is Betty still on the call she's there I see him name. that's shared sacrifice. share sacrifice. exactly. that makes sense. they'll have you if you could send the bullet point solution. so he can make this menu. someone. i'm happy membrane who was let me just look can anybody remember. what else you were adding to it? looking at the notes? i'm looking. Bob talked about, are they balanced? they might want to make sure that the whole approach was equitable. yeah, and actually serve the entire economy and not just segments of it. so can you bullet point and to send that solution? somebody said something about the landlord the landlord. that's great. especially this loan. let's call landlords. somebody Tom. well, I started out with the small landlords, but i'm also concerned even about the bigger landlord just because the whole thing has to be balanced and I feel that it's fair for everyone kind of like Betty believes everyone has to tear the pain of this. it's more like that. well, if everyone would send that regard, it's kind of already unbalanced because a lot of these larger corporations got the p, a loans that the smaller people didn't get. but that's a conversation another time, from my point of view that isn't equitable either. that's part of what I mean, it's already in balance. so, maybe, I mean, the thing is, there's lots of imbalance all over the place. and so, and for example, the person that was compare concerned with whether or not people could cheat, lots of people cheat on these things that everything is really important. but I okay, i, I didn't follow up on that because I thought it was not. that useful at the moment, but in terms of trying to stop people from cheating. I think that if we look at the total public, good of. of doing something. that's good. and there's a few cheaters. i'm really not that concerned and we can try to clean that up afterwards that people are grossly violating the public trust. then go after them later with civil or criminal penalties but. but I don't think, you know, like, in the, in the 2008. savings and loan debacle, or not savings alone, but the, you know, the housing mortgage backed security bust and then housing slide. that we didn't give money to homeowners, we didn't give money. we, we. basically, build out the bank and then went and foreclosed on everybody and you didn't get a lot of foreclosure assistant. so I thought that was a real error. all right, so come up with some bullet points, though. yeah. okay. so I just, you know, I think that. basically, I will on I still does bullet points solution will be used as whereas is. well, a little bit of both a little bit of both I think I'll use the opportunity to kind of take a part. the where to use as a, whereas and where to use as a therefore and we just put them all together and then kind of sorted out because that's part of the process of threading the Nico 1 coming to okay. and voluntary you. and I will listen, we're available to help with this. could i, I wanted to make 1. sure, on the on my suggestion about the bonds. is just that I wasn't pegging them only to the real estate issue. I think that. you know, maybe there's a number of different bonds that are offered initiate and, you know, or. or an overall bond that then can be earmarked in lots of different ways. I don't throw it in there and let's hash it out in December. yeah. so everybody in December for the 1st hour and a half. so, it's as possible let's throw up time we will do. our resume writing tutorial, and as a solution said we can use our bullet points as our starting point. okay, does that sound? is that agreeable to everybody. yep. can I mute yourselves and disagree. no, I agree. and I think that makes sense. thank you. okay and then. I just wanted to throw out something that, you know, I think. thinking about this resume for. some time 2 parts 1 is how realistic is it that rent is going to be forgiven like that? you know, so my, and bonds I think are brilliant, but that's a long time coming. is part of the solution to put the pressure on them to do that supplement right away. to the unemployment insurance, which is, I think, is what kept so many people. from defaulting on their rent to begin with and have that. as a realistic immediate buffer. throw it in as a bullet point, let's see because when the federal funds for the unemployment expired. in the state of New York Governor Fomo had extended them. for an additional period, so that is something they've done it before. that is something that they can do without the feds. right? and I think that will as the backstop for people who were out of work and couldn't pay their rent that extra 600 dollars a week. right and as. paid summit and your landlord accepted partial payment at least you weren't as deep in the whole well, that was an additional 2400 a month on top of the base. unemployment, so, I think people most in danger of not being able to, to pay their rent. probably, I don't know for a fact that we're covered by having additional 2400 a month. i'm just saying is something that can be done immediately, because it has done immediately in the past. it's been done before. absolutely. and there were a number of mechanisms. typically, I don't think everybody understood. like, for example, there was some people who are, in fact, not employed. they were working from home, but the unemployment was paying a portion of their salary whereas the company that they worked for was paying the bandwidth. so when they were folks screaming about that unemployment, saying that we shouldn't have it. I mean, 1st of all people work and pay taxes. so you'd, like, deserve that thing happens to you to be covered. but there were people who were still actively working every day that were on those unemployment roles or as, as part of that money. yeah, no, I agree. and it kind of deals with the immediate issue of fairness. the landlords are hurt by this, it comes out of the taxpayers may, but it's spread out over the entire country. so I think there's a lot of benefits. all right, did everyone so everyone, that's what we're going to do and I don't know what else is going to be on the agenda for the last hour or so of our meeting, but we'll get back to you with the agenda. great. i'm kind of confused. what is the resolution about. which I don't see if we can write some resolution in support of different aspects of the housing bills. that both senator cabinet is proposing, we may not agree with everything. like, you know, you all brought up different things that you might not agree with. well, they also said they expected to change dramatically when it goes to our house next year. so i'm kind of listening to Jill. what she's saying is, we don't know anything about those bills, so we really can't vote for against them in any way with any kind of intelligence because even they, even the writers don't know what they're going to say. okay, so, but let's do that premature solution for money and maybe go after that because that's. something we can say, wait, let's just say something, because I see it as I agree with you. I hear what you're saying. hope you and Jill Betty, but I also think that it would be a good idea to give. some ideas, some ideas and some input to legislature so when they're actually going to go argue about it, at least have community board 1 saying, okay, we like this. we want you to do this. we want you to do that and whatever happens happens. but at least we're smart, we're weighing in on it. that's what I should changes also changes his value. so rather than being in support of their bills, not genderless, we are adjusting is saying, this is what we would like to see in the state legislation. yes, yeah, that's the idea of having bills at all and i'm not against the idea of us supporting the content we want to see in those bills. correct because I think we all types of changes in there. right those particular bills we don't really care about. it's because we know they're gonna change anyway. it's more talking about what CB 1 believes would be good to be in a bill. right and it may be in their bills already, and some of it may have given us suggestions of things that you would like to see, or not see, you know so, and it's also our way of doing this exercise of writing learning how to write a read. so that Lucian doesn't have to write them all in time and we can all contribute to writing the rest of all. right? I just wanted to say that the idea is to support the spirit of legislation. that too yes, Bob correct. but don't be bound down by those numbers. exactly. all right. so, if anyone has any suggestions for the other hour, or we may. meeting yet, but let's put back on again. yeah, let's put Hannah back on to see what's going on. and this could take the whole darn time because look at that's talking. still. well, I think it's good for us to discuss this issue in particular is good out of it. and we don't have guessed that we're holding up just half time committee to talk and any of our guests please come know anyone else who would like, to come back. alright, Rosie is still learning a lot. no, good. well, come, I guess it up. all right let me know. does anyone has anything else to bring up? nope, Tammy. are you still there? I am thanks for having me tonight, Tammy. I am here, thank you for having me sit in on the meeting. would you like to include, or give us any update on anything? is there anything you want to share with us? oh, so much it's been such a well that you can do Tuesday at your 2 persons of? yeah, I will give you a quick quality of life update from other. Cbs, if you want yeah. yeah, okay. okay, so it was interesting on board to know that there are many community boards who are struggling with the same quality of life issues that we have clearly as we all know the housing goes cross everywhere. the rise of homelessness goes everywhere. the lack of N. Y. P. D. Enforcement is seen everywhere things to note is that the quality of life concerns that have come out of open streets tend to go very prominently around outdoor dining. lots of people concerned about basically restaurants building sheds now, which. don't seem to be socially compliant social distancing Compliant, which is really interesting and also keep yeah, they're kind of enclosed. right? they're basically indoors. it's like they've made outside inside. yeah, exactly. they're basically making temporary. locations yeah, CB 6 has the same problems that we do when it comes to temporary shelters, the CitiBike expansion bizarrely if you take a step back after sitting in that entire meeting, it turns out that many of the cds along the east side are experiencing sync calls, I didn't talk about ours, but 2 of the others on the East side spoke about sinkholes being specific. I mean, we happen to have them as well. it's just what's over. over by the South Street seaport, they're saying calls. everybody it always comes, it comes and goes. and so there are some significant ones over by 61st street over by the and other places where it seems like you question, whether there's been water intrusion, which is interesting. let's see people having problems with open streets and in terms of expansions and other issues. have come through. sanitation goes part and parcel with open streets. there were like, for community boards. what all the same there were a couple of community boards who felt that there's been a rising crime and a general feeling of unsafe by their constituency. not necessarily. data driven, but, you know, trying to understand. yeah, how that's happening. obviously, I don't know if people know there's nitrogen housing work gas has been turned off and it's bitter cold. so people can't cook going into Thanksgiving. they've got no gas to heat. so, that's a problem lots of boards. all saying the same thing about how frustrating it is that they didn't bring parents to the table and include all the stakeholders with the schools because people don't have places for their kids and people don't know what they're doing with working and yeah. all banks have left Roosevelt Dial in. on 3rd to it. yep. they lost their last bank. there are only 2 out there so they're trying to and Cornell, those even have a credit union so they're trying to figure out what to do over there. I think, because rents are too high or. nobody uses file, or what was there a great question? great question. lots of people saying that they'd like, coven, 19 measures to be more up to date on the city's website and for the city to be really targeting zip codes for help and not making a 1 size. this not federal solution. as you can imagine, let's see what else to teach you quality bucket. I mean, quality of life is kind of where it is everywhere. Gail pointed out where this is why she thinks we need a public rooms are. what would they do? they would work on all of there'd be a centralized location that could report all kinds of noise and things that. and isn't necessarily going to follow up on and 3, 1, it gets lost. and so, is it something that we should do a wrestle on? and who would we present it to the mayor? so. that's a great question. I can ask Gail and find that out. Gail, talked about the funding for schools and Ben Carlos's team talked about that about getting the complexities of trying to get computers to kids. I mean, it's just. shouldn't be this hard and internet access out for everybody the helicopter noise. and not only it continues childcare cuts apparently were on evenly done. so the childcare cuts have come through the budget effect Manhattan more than other areas. she specifically said that and got screwed. that the did not understand micro zones of poverty, because they look and see 1 gentrified island and didn't actually look and say, oh, well, this community board may have a high but they also have night to housing. they have and they just slice Manhattan off. schools do not want to be early voting sites. fine. safety security and. have always been voting sides. what what's the difference between being a voting side or an early voting side? because of the number of days that it was open. 2 outside people oh, you mean doing it? they don't want to be. voting sites, they don't want it during Covid-19 and they don't want to going forward for safety and security if with early voting because it's just it's. very difficult to secure the school. so it's an interesting idea that we could certainly take a look at places that could be pulling sites. this could be a really good boon for. other places that are under utilized. yeah, I mean. kind of agreed, but, on the other hand, I mean, Margaret's was appalling side same instance, to do was fall inside my school high schools around the corner polling sites. me why are they harder to secure than St Margaret's. it depends on if St Margaret has a nursery school there. none doesn't it? and whether or not kids are walking outdoors if you have a special need school in the building, you know, there are lots of different things. but so that was a conversation to look at. interestingly, the topic of implicit bias training that we have come up, came up. and Justine will be so happy to hear this. there are working on a. bias training sessions for Saturdays and Sundays for weekend. thank you. they will not be able to get them. they won't be able to do that until Q1, but they heard loud and clear all the conversations we've had and God knows how many times we've emailed them. they're working still to get people up to date with other functional trainings that they need to get through for the year and then they're going to restart those in the beginning of the year. which is great. yeah, I was going to be partial. yeah. I want to ask you 1 of the things that Justin brought up was that they hadn't. recorded that training, and I said, well was because of privacy with the committee members who attended could you find out? I think they may have been the privacy of the host, but yeah, it is a good question. well, interestingly, they learned a lot of really good lessons from that training and found that. they need to revamp it, so it can be functional and what it was, because they, as you said, they could have gone on for another 2 hours. there was so much more that the need was so great in a variety of ways. so, they're going to work, they're tweaking it and then redoing it. so i'd rather have them. yeah, I well, i'd rather have it come back. and be great then have them rush it. of course. have it recorded. yeah. yeah, exactly. even when it's great. we want to record it. exactly. yeah. and then interesting. Alieta can't from CB 8 is doing a gentrification survey and I volunteered to be 1 to be involved. which is something that I'll talk to, you guys about as well as jumping on board with that. because I do think that part and parcel to many of the issues that we have, including quality of life on the top is based on the large drive for gentrification, without the pursuit of services or the pursuit of understanding that. well, if you can't have people live where they work, then they've got to get there somehow. so don't talk to me about overcrowding, trains and overcrowding cars and overcrowding buses because you haven't made a path for people to be able to live. you know, we are so unbalanced in CB 1. in terms of live work, it's. you mean, most people live and work here. most people do not. yeah, most people, most people do not they can not afford if you are a teacher in any 1 of the universities who are down here, the local, small, private schools, the public schools, it's hard to live down in community board 1 there's not enough diversity within the mind of housing stocked down here. so I think downtown alliances numbers were that we had. you have to hear that I have to look back and see what the report is. I don't want to misquoted, but they had a really interesting number about how many people work in lower Manhattan versus live in their catchment. and it was something I want to say. it was something like 3 or 4 to 1 work versus live. I remember years ago they had said it was 300000 come in daily to work of course, and the population of residential downtown in 5 guys specifically this was for was 60000. so 300000 versus 60000 you got to understand that does not include any of the government buildings. it doesn't include anybody north of chambers. and so their attachment is not that big. exactly. so when you add all the government buildings and the other office buildings that go further up from chambers up to canal, it gives you a much wider diversity of what we're talking about. and I think that it's yeah, so as soon as I hear back from Alina and Cba, I'll put a shout out to see who can volunteer and do that because I do think that it is something that we should be looking at as well down here. that's fascinating though, Tammy, because part of the deal is, is that a lot of these people who work here, then they're not part of the community board, and they can get involved, but they maybe should be invited at least to talk about stuff. if they're not going to be board members, but if they should be for quality of life or some other issues, they are invited to join right by the borough president. so yeah. they are. absolutely but also they're people who maybe they are involved in their own neighborhoods or whatever, but there might be issues. we have people who are on the board who do not live here both public full board members. yep. that's really cool. but I do know that. yeah. that's cool. yeah, I think that's a lot when I was very impressed with when the people from pace University were speaking about the impact. their school and their students in their arms, and that's, it was with regard to the, the shelter, but it was great to hear what they had to say, and how it impacts them. and I think they're important part of the community. so, yeah, so that's kind of my update quickly for quality of life related to Burrow Board. thank you for the time. that was very sweet of you want to go back, come back to with some of these and have a further discussion about them. yes, I welcome to me dropping like that. public realms are number 1 and I think the other 1? yes. oh, well, you'll ask about recording of the bias training. and send me an email, because I do, I do much better by email, looking through my emails in the middle of the night when I wake up going. oh, I didn't respond to that. 1. yeah. well, this is, this will be yeah, I mean, you can't do anything about it, right away. did anybody else have anything else that wants to ask Tammy about? no, see, I did. yeah, this is where I was wondering, because I feel like we danced around this before, but why. can't we encourage people who work in the community, like police officers, or like teachers or whoever. that our integral parts of our community and allowing it to function nurses, but that might otherwise be economically. they're challenged to live here. to be included in some a housing support system I don't even know how it would be defined, but. so, we have teachers on our board who live here. yeah, so we do have a, we do have that police officers are not allowed to live in the districts in which they work or. that is a city regulation, so. condensed belongs yeah. the finance. yep, so we do have people Rosa, who both are part of city government who are on our board and we have teachers who are on our board and live in our district and work in our district. but you can't have a police officer live and work. and God knows no offense if I was a police officer by the end of the day I thought that anybody that I have to work with the solution. there's also a set aside for when there's new housing that, is part of the. mandatory inclusionary housing or the voluntary inclusionary housing. whatever units of income restricted housing that are generated from those programs. there's always some set aside for municipal employees. to live there, the problem is, is that it's very little opportunity for the generation of those types of housing in Cb. 1. as those are usually create as part of a larger rezoning. there's just aren't a lot of develop a little lots. so that's 1 of the reasons why this committee is. is looking at ways to kind of create a. and affordable, because there's very few new units coming online the next. the next potential cache that is sure almost a sure thing is probably 5 world trade center, which is. we, at least before the pandemic seem to be on track. for a very generous number of before the units. however, that's the same. well, we don't know. yeah. and we don't know now, we, we actually really want to do advocate for that. I mean, i. it's so much what we don't want to. so much of what we want, it has, it would make such a major dent. it was. really I mean, pat you and I both opined on it. yeah, and i'm not totally in agreement with it, but we'll discuss that what time cause because we don't have infrastructure to support number 5 is housing and my little area of the world. you know, if they open the street grid and put a market at the bottom, we'd be in great shape. yeah. open a streak. right exactly. let us be able to travel back and forth over and granted south. but, yeah, I just want to add that. this is something Tom. you know, had thought of and fought for to have 1 of the new buildings, be affordable housing from way, way back. and so I think it's, it's something we should be behind. and we count on you to. I told you to kind of bring topics and we'll pursue them and, you know, as the housing. the housing person, you know, we. we certainly do want to get behind trying to help get some afford. many of us have said our kids can live grow up in this community, but they can't afford to live in this community after they leave our homes. yeah, I guess i'm just wondering what that what incentive there is for private development to include affordable housing that's strong enough for them to actually move on it instead of avoid it. right? they do get tax. you know, statements, they get bigger far. they can they get something dropping right now. there's like 30000 empty apartments in New York City. there are people giving rent, landlords, giving several months for free. because a lot of the apartments were rented and are owned by foreign dignitaries and stuff. there are people that have gone. they're not coming back here that they don't want the apartment. yeah, but Marianne, but I think that like, in my building, a lot of people moved out, they were only giving free rent for like, a month or 2 and then they shoot right back up to the market value that also those people rent, they're playing games with the rental income, and it's a problem that they're doing that some fields we should be raising as an issue, because it becomes preferential rent, then it goes into some nonsensical financing as well just 1 quick thing going back to the affordable housing and 5 world trade center. and it's kind of a touchy issue. but private equity is insanely. going overboard, happy, investing in affordable housing. I have a lot of issues with private equity, owning affordable housing. however, it's an extremely deep pool of money. they love affordable housing because it's usually guaranteed by the government. but then they come out of it. no, no. they build it. they collect the rents. it's a good investment for them. so. they can be a, a public private. it's an opportunity in terms of development that I think is out there. people hate private equity is part of the issue, but it's a huge pool of money. and I kind of think it's an interesting way to explore. building something that's not just. I mean, I think, yeah, maybe we should late January right now as our, as a, as the housing meeting. because that would be great the other day that years ago when Michael. i'm having a blank Michael. Tammy. Michael. Levine Levine, thank you. I was going to say learner. Levine was on staff. he gave us a photo and also, you know, who. that it's Paul gave us and housing tutorial and so we learned about, was it for 21? a b. c. we learned about far we learned about yeah, we learned about all kinds of terms. and I think that we have many new members on the committee. now, it might be time to. revisit that as a, as a topic for. 1 of our meetings, maybe January and Pat, if I would ask is that 1 meeting focused on the rental situation and 1 meeting focused on the real property situation? well, let's talk about how we construction January's meeting. yeah. okay. all right. so. Tammy, anything else she wants to add for us. no, we're good. you guys it was a great meeting. listen. thanks for having me. you know, calming, we enjoy having new thank you for bringing us. more food for thought, so everybody.
