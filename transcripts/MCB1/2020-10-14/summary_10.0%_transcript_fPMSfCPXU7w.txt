We do this model of basically a couple of hours once a week for the kids to go, who chose hybrid, to go for social, emotional and for advisory, so parents freaked out and everyone went behind it, based only because we were told we are not going to get our next teachers, which They said the chancellor said it in one of the calls- The other thing was some of the parents who are outside of New York City, who, whether they're on the slt or on the PTA.
What is starting to make parents unhappy is seeing the Brooklyn tech model, which is their two full days from 8:30 to like 2:45 in schools like one week and salt and they're going in there, Full time, they're Nobody's, getting different teachers, they're, all their own teachers, whether it's in Brooklyn tech or salt, And they're, not getting any new teachers and what the teachers what happened ends up happening Is they're just having the remote and the hybrid kids are getting the same teachers, but very different schedules, but they're getting the same teachers.
It's, two full days from two full days, a week: okay, and is the two days a week, a hundred percent synchronous learning, or are they in the school remoting into classes somewhere, else?
It's a school program And we the way we work on that is The kids have class until 12:20 and if they can't get there by one the one day, a week, they come that one day of the week, they're allowed to miss or all or some of their last period class and leave their house at 10 of noon.
They have now more focus going in two days, a week, and that has made a lot of difference for the parents and the kids for having kids from, like it's a full.
We're talking about item four okay about the effectiveness of synchronous, online instruction, And I do not see millennium or any schools changing their model.
There's two things happening, here: Jeff, and it is the number one concern of at least the people that are reaching out to me in terms of youth and ed issues in our community board.
So, whether or not it's reading that way on this agenda, which I I'm saying that it's not And we've just heard from Sarah, thus far about the different experiences our families are having acrosss the schools in terms of remote versus blended, learning, also.
Families are more concerned about the lack of time in the building, and I think most of it was that they're trying to adjust from what they were told by the chancellor in his communication in July about the fact that our children would be going back to alternating three days a week and what especially our high school students are finding is that has turned into as little as two hours a week, literally like a half day, they're, going in for two classes.
Some schools are staying in the afternoon and working on laptops remoting into other classes, which then keep them in the building.
You know a lot of them also were concerned about the fact that if they chose blended learning they found out after they got there that they do not have the school teachers that it at beacon, for instance, where my daughter goes.
Some of these are school- based because you know, as we just heard, we got variances at our schools, which allowed us to not do what the plan the city provided was going to do, but at least we'll start a discussion, because I'm getting massive amounts of questions and emails from parents having a lot of concerns.
You can't make them come in the city accommodated the terrible time of living in which is simply just being ignored, right now, in this conversation It's no way to go back on it, because the uft and the city agreed to provisions where faculty members could file paperwork to be off- site and the average school is well in the 20 percent.
This is the reality of there's just so many humans in a building that can do the job safely and that's where we're at, So it's to me very frustrating as a teacher, to hear this because we're working very hard to learn new platforms, new technologies to do things.
If that happens, we're all set and the old model that many schools are laboring under right, now, they're going to have a hell of a time moving to full online synchronous instruction, which is what we offer all of my classes, are online synchronous instruction every single day and that's what kids at William are experiencing.
What are the numbers for the different schools in our area, of how many kids are blended and how many kids are remote, And I know it's probably different between millennium to urban assembly of emergency management.
I'm sure it's a lot different from all different schools, but I just really want to know what exactly is happening and what we can do moving forward, because I know that this administration does not want to go fully remote, but at the same time parents who are very concerned about having babies having people that watch their children or to have a schedule or something like that.
What is what are the numbers from Stuyvesant millennium of their teachers and their students that are fully remote to be able to kind of make a more sound decision based on the community, because I can give my opinion, But I think we have to.
I, do not know if they're learning remotely or if they are indeed If they're, going to school out, there.
You have to pardon me, because, with three kids at three different schools, I may get it mixed up a little bit, but it's basically like the one at Hsn goes in one afternoon a week.
And, that's really important and The. Other thing that I'm happy about is that school is starting at 8:30 or 9 A.M, and it's on structure like that has made all the difference in the world, and I know that you know that sort of continuous structure is like not what some of the elementary skills kids are getting as I'm hearing.
You know situation in that the schools that I think a lot of referring to that maybe are not in the New York City Public school system that are 100 in the building have a different situation.
So I think that I think you're right Judith in talking about transparency, which is why I wanted to have katie here, and maybe this is a good time to break and let her speak and after hearing some of these things, katie that you've heard just sort of you know, give us an idea of what it's like to be at the DOE right now, and maybe you know, help us understand why we're here Obviously, That at some point you know, blended learning will get canceled all together and We'll go fully remote, like.
It's really important to us, as we continue to make improvements and as we continue to make updates that we're hearing from the field, it's paramount for the work that we do appreciate, having the chance to come and speak to you in these in these forums, It's things like this, that we kept hearing from the spring that there needs to be more peace, as me came to figuring things out with the unions over the summer and that included all of the health and safety negotiations that included what the changes and we were making to our school schedule.
Is you know, building a schedule for students so that they are having this time with their teachers, either through zoom or through teams?
We've asked elected officials to lobby on our behalf, because not all of that was not continued by everyone through the fall, and so we know that we do have students and families that are having connectivity issues at this point in the year.
We, gave an opportunity for students to have a credit, and that would show up on their report card, and we made no one happy, and I think what we've seen you know with the remote and the blended is something similar that we want to give people an opportunity by people.
If we just all moved to remote or got rid of blended learning, I in a system as large as ours and in a system is decentralized as ours, where we really trust our principles , We said you know your school community.
You know when we've been in school and seeing students happy to take action, and we appreciate that you know still going with the when we are remote.
Of course, my son is actually at Ps 150 and we are enrolled in the blended learning where we go for you, know, alternating between two and three days a week, And he's in second grade, and I guess may be the only one having a positive experience.
You know, as they may have some regularity to their schedule, So it's actually worked out really well for our class, At least, that I'm, aware of and for the for the other parents in the school that I've spoken, with.
I. Think a lot of us were frankly relieved because it gave the schools more time and the administrators more time to get ready in something that you know is a dangerous situation, but it was the lack of notice and having it just drop on us.
What happened last week, where you know what we were seeing was what happens when there are areas where we're seeing that are that are hot spots, and so that's we've worked with the state, So, the idea being that you would be in a yellow zone before you would be in a red and orange zone and Red and Orange would be when your zone or sorry your school would close.
We have a pretty huge agenda, but I can say what I know that no school there's definitely not a system- wide plan for what would happen if half a staff got covered.
If I got sick, all of a sudden there's going to be issues, so Is a one class for grade School Is that people are having a lot of different experiences.
Again, not criticism, but we just want to have these important discussions and Jeff shows us how tenuous the situation is and how much the teachers have put on the line, how much faith they've just thrown into this situation, as has the DOE, so everyone's doing their best, and we hear that I think the parents concern I, think it was to do this point about transparency.
You know what is the DOE doing to make sure these things are happening and that also I'd love to hear at that same time?
If you know, we do not want students just printing things out, so we put them into Google, slides, which our teachers have said are better for putting them putting into your Google classroom.
During these remote learning, times, she's only available for five ten minutes for Check- in because the school is utilizing her at whatever capacity they need.
They have not started the random testing at our school, so this is obviously an isolated incident, and when I asked the principal it was not, it did not seem like they were too concerned, which I just do not think that why I do not know why they were not concerned.
Not all of them are, for our school's, been able to hire, who, I believe, full- time subs, to work around the hiring space in order to have remote coverage for our grades.
We are getting a lot of attention when our kids are their lives, and I think that the remote learning folks have had a positive experience so far as well.
I really do appreciate the feedback, and please know I'm going to be my boss, the chief academic officer into our first deputy chancellor, who oversees all our exec superintendents and superintendents issues that are more school, based, And I know there is a a teacher I'm following up with offline and a a parent, Would be my pleasure just shared our emails and we will connect with you with about them as well, and thank you for being open to hearing from us super helpful.
You know I'm, not seeing that a resolution of any sort is needed at this stage, but I'm happy to hear from any committee members that so do they disagree and if so If there are major concerns about what's happening at school.
We might not have all the ventilation we want, but we can provide air filters that can filter the air, that's being circulated in the classroom and feel safe there again working with the health department everybody's on board with that plan, as well.
I do not know if the window's open or not, but I'm, going to guess- If there's a central system and it's working And we're providing either 100 outside air or And we've had this conversation with the SCA in a number of buildings, where they're doing construction outside They've done some cleaning on the scaffolding and moved equipment to another side of the building, so that they're not getting as much.
Think this is something that's going to get a bit more air time over the next few weeks.
That, since we represent, you know families and youth that it would be a good idea to reach out to them at this time and just connect with them about what's happening and what they can tell us in terms of increased homelessness during Covid-19, because I think it should be part of this discussion.
Because I think there was a list that was going around with the school Then we can decide whether to put this on our agenda.
