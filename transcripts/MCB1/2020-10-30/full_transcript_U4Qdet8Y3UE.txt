Okay, we're now recording and we're all set Colin welcome. Everybody I am your host and step in my chair for tonight, due to some unforeseen circumstances, so I think we're going to start the meeting off tonight with a review on 250 water street and the brownfield Glam program with Laura Dodge, who I'm informed is here and ready to go. Is that right, Diana, hi, Laura I, see you? Are you ready to go? You may be muted. Let me get in and unmute you hi Laura. Are you there she's, muted, okay, I think we've got it: hey laura hi. How are you? How are you welcome? Thank you. Thank you. So absolutely thank you for asking me so where we stand now is I think we reported the last time that the field investigation, all five phases that were scheduled, are completed. All of the soil gas groundwater. Analytical results have been received by langan provided to the DEC and the DOH. They then provided them to myself and Tom facillo. The consultant for the blue school we've had at least two meetings or you know. Virtual meetings conference calls regarding the soil, analytical results which were the last and the groundwater analytical results. I'm sorry the last batch of data that came in and there's a tremendous amount of information, so the last phase of the data review has been to try to take everything. That's been generated to date. You know all of the original geophysical results. The salt vapor results, the soil analytical results from the thermometer factory footprint from the historic fill from the former underground storage tanks, and then on top of that, the groundwater analytical results, groundwater level, measurements and then try to put it all together and evaluate whether or not the site has been fully investigated with respect to all the different media. So the call we had with DEC and DOH last Thursday. We discussed the fact that the agencies are still working their way through all of the results, because there are so many data points that came in after the last several rounds of investigation. We provided our insight as to what we thought the data indicated and how it looked. We talked about having difficulty sort of synthesizing all the results, because there are so many data points and trying to make it more user-friendly for everybody to get through and sort of process. So I think the agencies are requesting some additional figures from Langan and HHC to try to help with that process so that it will be a little clearer as to whether everything has been defined satisfactorily to the point where a conclusion can be made regarding whether the RI is in fact complete for all media, meaning for soil for vapor for groundwater, and they do not know exactly how long that process will take. At this point, I think they've made some requests and some new requests, perhaps last week or possibly today, and so I'm not 100 sure how long the process will continue to take, because Langan will need to speak to HHC and come back with the requested information or with a response regarding you know their take on the request, but we're getting close to having a determination as to whether or not there needs to be any additional investigation at this point or whether conclusions can be drawn sufficiently so that the RI can be deemed complete and a proposal for the next phase of work, which would be the remediation and a remedial action work plan can be designed. So that is essentially where we are. There were three days of geotechnical testing that were done October in October I, believe it was the 10th 11th and 12th that was a Saturday Sunday Monday outside of school hours. The community air monitoring plan that was developed as part of the remedial investigation work plan was implemented and there were no air quality issues of any kind. That data is being used for purposes of evaluating building foundation, design parameters for the you know related to the proposed redevelopment and those data. Those daily field reports were posted on the project website, which is one thing that we had asked of the agencies to ensure that was the case and I think they already had gone ahead and realized. That was something that they wanted to do, and they did do that again. No issues with respect to air quality, so the only other piece I guess is that we talked about you know whether or not there needs to be any test pit work done, because that is part of what's mentioned in the revised remedial investigation work plan is whether any of the results from the first five phases of investigation suggest the need to do any additional subsurface investigation of any kind. Whether there needs to be any additional soil samples, collected or subsurface investigation to determine the cause of refusal, for instance, of any of the soil borings, and that discussion we had with the agencies and they're. Taking our you know, comments into consideration and our perspective is really one of understanding what the implications of the RI data would have on whatever mediation and redevelopment scope would entail and how you would correlate the air quality data from the RI to what would be necessary or appropriate during a remediation that would then transition into a redevelopment. So the comments we had sort of centered around you know that dialogue and so the agencies are, you know they took our comments and thoughts and then they're going to be circled back with lankan and HHC. So again, we're not it's not clear whether the timeline will be a few weeks or maybe a little longer, because there are just so many data points to evaluate, but that's basically where we stand great. Thank you. What's the timeline on that by the way, the next stage yeah as I, said it's I'm not 100, sure colin. If it's going to be a matter of weeks or possibly a little longer, because you know the DC and DOH have to have the discussion with Langan and HHC, then they have to respond back with whatever it is that they feel is responsive to the request, for you know a little bit of a additional work to sort of help. Visualize the results. When you have so many data points like there were collected here, it's sometimes difficult to visualize what these data really are indicating and I think it would be helpful to have some more visual representations of that, so that everybody, the professionals, the agencies and the public. You get a better idea of what the results show. I understand, I, see a lot of people are on the phone, so I would imagine a lot of them are related to this. But let's start with the board members: do we have any questions from any of any of the CB1 board? Members I see no hands. There's got to be something yes use your hands. Guys I can't believe. There's a simple question: there you go, I got a question: Hi Richard, Corman Laura, thanks for that I was not clear from what you said. Did you draw any preliminary conclusions from the data that you wish that you shared with them, or is it too premature? Well, I? Think Richard, it's a good question. We did conclude that vertical delineation, defining the depth of impacts in soil was largely complete. There were only three borings where they hit refusal vertically and in each of those instances it appeared to be some type of timber, but everywhere else they were able to get vertical delineation of the extent of so any soil impacts. So that process, I believe is you know, is- has been largely complete. Laterally, it's a little bit more difficult because the number of samples they took in the vertical profile and then going out laterally from let's say the Thermometer factory area. Some of the samples were collected at different depth intervals. So you have to look at whether or not laterally horizontally going out from the area of the former Thermometer factory footprint itself. Whether delineation can be deemed complete. Is a professional judgment that we relate our thoughts to the agencies and they're, taking those thoughts, and that's one of the reasons why they're asking for some additional graphics to help sort of visualize how Langan is interpreting achieving lateral delineation there's a lot. You know mercury is the primary driver for that, because there are a few other constituents that need to be discussed, but those are not related necessarily to operational history. More to historic, fill likely thanks. Let me just follow up with that. Is your contract? Does your contract extend to this the evaluation of the next phase when the assessment comes out from DEC in DOH yeah? Our work scope goes through the issuance of the draft Remedial investigation report, which will be the document that will be generated after this and then also the final remedial investigation report, which we obviously would just review to ensure that the draft changes were reflected as anticipated, so that process will be similar to what we did with the remedial investigation work plan, where we reviewed a draft provided comments and had discussions with langan and HHC, and then the agencies, and then they the agencies would decide what they wanted to require of Lincoln or HHC. And then after that document is issued, is the end of our scope of work right now, work great thanks, Laura appreciate it absolutely Michael Kramer! You were next hi Laura, two questions. One question is about that remediation plan. Could you just give us a range of best case worst case of when that would be finalized difficult for me to say right now, Michael because I mean I'm not 100 sure what the timeline is for Langan's anticipated issuance of the final of the draft and final RI, but generally speaking, I would say best case for a draft RI might be within a month and a half and worst case it could take longer. You know perhaps another two months, but it again I'm really did not get into that discussion with the agencies. So that's just my best estimate it could it. You know it really is more of an update that langan will have to provide once their discussions with DEC and DOH are over, because I think those discussions are still going on. So I think you know they're I believe because they already did do the geotechnical investigation that their intent would be to try to get the RI draft. You know wrapped up sooner than later, I mean it is a lot of work to reduce all that data and to put a report together, but I believe they likely have been working on it for a while now getting all the pieces that they could before. Even all the data came in, they were getting all the field procedure, parts of it written likely. That's what you would typically do, so my guess would be anywhere within the one or two month, time frame by the end of the year. All right, I think that is that's I, think that would be reasonable yeah. My other question is about the vertical borings. Are you satisfied that those borings are deep enough and do you know how deep the foundation will be to make that conclude to reach that conclusion? I do not know how deep the foundation will be, but the borings that have been conducted, except for three of all of the borings that were done, did reach a point in the vertical profile that was clean. Assuming that I would assume that the depth of the foundation may come close to where those depths are. Where they reach clean were in some cases, but I can't really speak to that, because I do not know exactly what the design will look like. So are we talking five or ten feet or we talking 50 or 100 feet? Oh no I mean I. Think I do not have everything right in front of me in terms of the total boring depths books, but actually hold on one second I do have a summer. I could just take a quick look at generally speaking. It's either shallower than or no deeper than looks like 15 to 18 feet in some cases you know in most cases shallower than that, but they have reached a point at which there was nothing in the soil sample of concern at a depth of you know, from the looks of it again, just generally speaking, around no deeper than you know, 18 to 20 feet, and that would even be in most cases it's much shallower than that, because the yeah, the historic fill I, think ranges in depth depending upon where you are on the site and outside of the thermometer factory footprint. The you know, any impacts in soil are relatively shallow and or related to historic fill, so the historic field does not extend. You know that deep, it's I think the deepest would be maybe 15 to 16 feet depending upon the location at the site. I'm just thinking because we're talking about water lots that were created through landfill back in the 17. You know late, 1700s and 1800 early 1800s. What the depth might be because, obviously, once you're going to put a foundation in for a very large building, it's going to have to go down 50 60 feet, yeah I mean I. Think the structural foundation typically would be deep for a large structure. So again, I'm not a geotechnical engineer, so I do not really want to speak to that, but all of these details will come together when the remedial action work plan is prepared, because the intention would be to integrate the remediation into the redevelopment. So in you know, if they need to excavate to a certain depth for purposes of the of the foundation. The question then becomes, if that is deeper than the impacts of soil, then they're doing that excavation for foundation purposes and how they manage the excavated soil will depend on the quality of it. So some of it may have to be managed a little differently if it has higher levels of contamination or certain parameters in it. If it turns out that, for some reason the structural foundation is shallower than the depth of impacted soil, then looking at what's in the soil will drive. You know whether or not there's a need to go any deeper and again the soil will still be managed the same way based upon the quality of it. So soil, that's impacted, let's say within the Thermometer factory footprint and has concentrations of mercury that would where that material goes, will be dictated by the concentration in the soil and should we be concerned and discussed, I'm sorry should we be concerned about the footprints of the old buildings that are now falling in. Well, that's one of the things that we've talked about with the agencies is, for you know our concern whether or not there needs to be any additional investigation relative to air quality, as you would correlate the air quality from the RI, which was really not nothing to speak of with respect to mercury, just no air ambient air quality issues, just occasional detections of mercury when they were screening the cores. You know the actual samples that came out of the ground that was very close to the soil. It was not in the ambient air, but how do you correlate that to a full-scale remediation that will have open excavations and are you going to encounter debris that might be associated with the former thermometer factory? So these are things that the agencies are taking a look and again this will all be discussed in the context of how you interpret the data from the investigation. Yeah. Just please be aware that there's you know the potential of cave-ins right now, so it keeps getting worse. Yeah, I'm aware that there's subsidence concerns, and you know the debris, that's out there. You know. Obviously, if you look at where these sinkholes are forming, some of it may be related to shifting of debris. You know whether that debris is associated with just a remnant structure. That's not of environmental concern. I think is the question. There's really in the areas where the subsidence is occurring. The data are not really showing anything with respect to mercury concentrations being elevated in soil. So whether or not that would be those that debris would be of environmental concern. I, think is something that will be discussed in the RI report, because that's kind of one of the points is trying to correlate where debris was identified, where the geophysical survey found the footprints and remnants of structures and then, where the soil and groundwater investigation would have pointed to anything, you know of environmental concern and trying to link those two together. It's basically, you know the whole purpose behind you know taking and synthesizing. All of this information is to be able to relay this story. You know a picture. It should be clear that this was the history. This is what the geophysical survey showed. This is what the soil investigation is showing. This is how the two correlate. This is how they do not correlate. You know this is what we think is going on. This is what needs to be done. This is how it's going to be done. How it's going to be done comes into play largely in the remedial action work plan which will come after the remedial investigation report, but you know there's already discussion and thought about. How do you? How do you link one to the other? You know making that transition, I'm just good I was going to say long if you do not mind Bob schneck you're up next pal I just wanted to ask the question. I just wanted to thank Laura for the terrific work you've done so far in interpreting all this and I was wondering if there was any beginning to the continuation of your contract or any discussion started so far. I think it was raised briefly on the previous Epc call right now we're really focusing on finishing up on the RI data reduction, so I have not been involved in any further discussions at this point. Is there any need to move those things forward, or are you happy with the way things are going? We still have to review. You know finish up our evaluation of the discussions with the agencies and then review the draft remedial investigation report. I. Think at that point you know the discussion with respect to how best to proceed. You know, can start I think it might be a little too early right now, because I think the you know, HHC and Langan are still generating data. You know they just finished their geotechnical investigation, I think there. It might be just a little premature to have that discussion, but you know I'm happy to continue to assist the community. If that's something that you know the community desires and how to go about. That is something that still has to be. You know, discussed I, think I just want to make sure that there's no break in the continuity of your work with this right. My impression is that the that the field study is actually complete with the possibility of a couple of a couple of additions, if the, if there's a need for so mostly this is done and in your opinion, was it done extremely well or done well or done professionally? Yes, I mean language, did a very professional job, all of the procedural aspects of it and the methods and procedures were all adhered to. The remedial investigation work plan. You know they were very receptive to the times that you know we had an environmental scientist come on to the site and the data have come back. You know looking very good and with high quality of reliability. So the question just becomes synthesizing. All of that, and you know we would we're still looking to see. You know maybe a little bit of a different representation of it in a manner that might be easier for everybody to get their arms around and DEC and DOH still have to do their final assessment of how they feel everything looks so we're going to reserve judgment until they have their say in it. Thank you so much yep, absolutely okay. Hearing no more questions from the board. I see two people on the regular attendee list. Megan, I'm sorry, I do not know your last name, you're up, hey it's Megan, Malvern hi! Thank you for hosting everything and thank you laura for all your work. I had one question before you said you were talking about the borings and I think you said all, but one of them reached clean phil. No, they all they all did other than three that hit a refusal at a timber, a piece of what appears to be some type of wood or timber, but the vast majority of them did reach a soil sample point that was clean. So all but three reached those hit, refusal and that's where then they go out laterally to try to figure out if stuff is clean or what do they do in that instance? Well, in the areas where you hit refusal, I think they you know they make a judgment as to whether or not there would need to be any additional investigation vertically based on the data around those boring locations, they can pull that knowledge in and then on the lateral delineation. That's where you know, if you have. Let's say you have an exceedance at you know eight to ten feet or six to eight feet below grade. If you're boring to the North, South, East and West is pr approximate to that depth, then you would have delineation if you're boring. Sorry, if your samples at those locations are at distinctly different depths, then you have to interpret the data and present what you think. Your rationale for having said you're delineated is, and so I think that's right. That's what we're looking to see is. How is that and going for any of those three that I had refusal? Were there were those near any of the thermometer factory footprints I do not believe so one might have been megan I just do not remember off the top my head, but I, think I, I'm not 100 sure if it was near there or in my recollection, is that the areas of refusal reports on the south? Well, if you call water, Street south, going towards beekman, where you kind of or even sort of south central, so I apologize I do not have that that's right off the top. My other quick question is so there's all the tests have been done for all these weeks and they've been extra extrapolating and looking, and then they sent them to be verified by another outside party. Will that data has it that's the data they shared with? You is that have you gotten that back yet, or is that still being sort of verified and looked at yeah? No, we have been working with preliminary data that was prior to validation. Typically, you know in my years of experience. Typically, it's unlikely to see or unusual to see anything significantly different when the validation is conducted, but we will be following up to ensure that you know the validated data are the data that are ultimately relied on and those will be the ones that will be presented in the report. Well, that's great so of that preliminary data that you've already seen nothing was. Were you worried about or asked DEC or Dea to look into more or where does this turn so is there anything that can cause any concern? Our pointing out to the agencies was something that they were already looking at, which is essentially, how do you synthesize all the data and come up with this achievement of delineation, primarily in the lateral, a right on the horizontal basis? You know how do you interpret because there's so many salt borings that were conducted and many of them were to delineate mercury in the thermometer factory footprint the depth at which these borings were collected? Some of them are not completely in line with where the elevated concentrations were reported, so they need to look hard at how they achieve delineation laterally, but none of the numbers are alarming. I'm sorry, none of the numbers are alarming. It's I'm not sure what you mean. The data from the testing for the stuff, that's being independently verified. None of that information like mercury Elemental. Any of those numbers are not coming back with something that you are concerned about well they'll. Definitely there are exceedances and those will be drafts as part of a remediation work plan, but the data was showing very little in the way of elemental mercury. There were different types of mercury found. It was not primarily elemental, which fits with the fact that there was not a lot of volatilized mercury present and they were not seeing any major issues with mercury and vapor. So I think this is where the whole synthesizing of the data comes in. It's really important to not take one piece of information out of context, but to keep it all together and have that thorough story and character, and that is really the case. The whole idea behind RI is to understand and characterize and then present what your findings and how you interpret those findings. So it's really important to take things out of context. Okay, I hope, I answered your question. I! Guess it's more of a waiting until we see this I just want to know. If there's things that were you know for us to be paying attention to specifically and I guess, we'll find out more when all the data gets pushed together right yeah, it's important that we do not get ahead of the report. I mean I! Think that's because the report is going to be so holistic. There's going to be so many pieces to it. Okay, I'm Colin! I'm not hearing you! Thank you! Okay! Colin! Can you say that again grace Lee there she goes hi Laura. How are you good grace? How are you I'm good I just wanted to so I just to pick up where Megan left off. We had some conversations very early on with some scientists who had talked about how difficult it is to separate mercury like Elemental versus Methyl mercury. So how I mean you said it's extremely difficult, so how accurate do you feel that those measurements are? How do we gain confidence around those measurements actually really being representing? What could actually be in the soil? Well, the analysis that was conducted was a speciation analysis, which is a specialized analysis to look at the form of mercury that was reported in the soil samples and they adhered to the remedial investigation, work plan and the data. In my experience you know there are reliable methods for speciation and I. Think the data from my review made sense in the context of the total reported mercury concentration. What was reported in the field with the Jerome meter, screening and, what's being found, you know, generally speaking in vapor in the soil vapor, which is really very little, if anything very little. If anything and then also the air quality issue data, so everything that we looked at seems to jive, which is one of the other ways in which you can feel more confident that the data are reliable. So again, this is why it's important not to get ahead of the report, because there's been so much data generated. It's really important for this to be all synthesized together, so that you can understand the reason and the rationale for the conclusions: okay, great and- and I'm sorry if I did not pick up on this as clearly as may have been stated by you already. But in order for the for the in the remedial action work plan, are you expecting that the developer by that Howard Hughes is going to be? You know the their plans for the site will be part of thinking about how that how the cleanup occurs. So, as you know, Michael Kramer was saying about. You know the depths of how deep they will be digging a foundation and that sort of thing that will all be part of how you're thinking about the work plan and how deep they go to clean out the site. Just how do those two work together, yeah well I, know that the intent you know from in the remedial investigation, Work, Plan, Langan and Hht state that the intent is to integrate the remediation into the redevelopment, to the extent that they're going to lay out what depth they have to excavate for redevelopment purposes. I'm not 100 sure that will be outright stated in the work plan. The fact that they did do the geotechnical investigation already sort of suggests that they're looking to see if that would be possible to do, but I'm not sure how far ahead that design element will be before they actually generate the remedial election work plan. It can go either way. You can either have a remedial action work plan that focuses on what you need to do for remediation and talks more generally about how it's going to be integrated into redevelopment. If you're farther ahead with your redevelopment planning, then you can talk more specifically, so it really depends on where they are with the redevelopment planning when they get to the point of the remedial verbal action work, plan, preparation, I, think, ideally they likely would like to be able to integrate the two completely. But again, it depends on you know where they are at that point with their redevelopment design. So I can't really speak to that specifically. But you know that will be the next document that comes out after the remedial investigation. So, okay, thank you for clarifying that and then I have a general question for the community board. I do not know who might be able to help answer, but I was just curious who, from the community board, is interfacing with with Howard hughes regarding Lara's contract and what we can do as a community to continue to. You know, push for a conversation. You know to happen sooner than later about you know, continuing her contract through the remedial and that work remediation, I'm not sure how to answer that. I'm just a substitute chair, but you have any thoughts on that. Do you know, do we know who's howard hughes, these kind of matters yeah lucian Reynolds, who is our district manager, has been handling all the contractual stuff along with Tammy as chair of the board. So that's something that we can definitely raise with them as a potential to identify what the next steps are and make a plan for that and of course, alice has been working with Tammy on that as co-chair of the board and chair of this committee. Okay, great, thank you sure, great one last question and for this question I'm sorry I should have said this earlier, but let's keep it to one follow-up, we're already 45 minutes into the meeting. We got three more items to go. So I'm follow-up, please Ryan! Sorry you're the last person to do it too, but one follow-up, Ryan you're up no problem thanks, Colin hi Laura! Thank you for all of your work. Just a quick question on your interactions with DEC I know: komorowski, retired, and now we have heidi. How has your working relationship been there and I guess? My concern is, you know: you've been on the emails about the depression on the lot and they indicated they would be sending out an email or instructions to HHC to put additional cones out to prevent laz from parking on the depression, but that still not happened and I think it's been a month now. So I'm just curious on your overall working relationship there and, what's being done to address the depression, specifically yeah, no they've been wonderful, I mean I, know it's. You know difficult with Mike. You know he was so intimately involved, but Rafi was as well along and heidi. You know, is very senior and very experienced and we still have the same folks from DOH. You know Scarlett, Mclaughlin and the crew has been. You know the same people there, so there really has not been any hiccup or anything like that. From my point of view, you know they they've been great with our ability to you know, Tom Facility's ability to you know freely discuss you know any insights. We have or concerns that we have so with respect to the subsidence. I mean I, understand the concerns that they're not reacting and maybe as quickly or in the manner that you had suggested or had requested so I will follow up with them tomorrow. I meant to do that today and I just not did not happen because I got pulled into a million different directions. Unexpectedly, so sorry, my kid but yeah zoom meetings in the time of Covid-19, so we're but I will follow up with them ryan. Tomorrow to see you know to make sure that we have some, you know response yeah and just to come. You know, Heidi herself said she would be instructing them to put cones and not park on that, and you know that was I think something you guys had previously agreed to so just wanted to clarify it's nothing. I'm suggesting I just want them to do what they previously have told us. They would do right, no, absolutely correct and I'm not I do not know whether there's been communication directly with Lincoln and Hjc or not. That's, you know I. We would not be in that direct loop, but if you're still not seeing anything done, then I'll definitely follow up and ask great thank you tomorrow, but they've been very responsive, great all right, laura you've been great and unless I hear anything else, I do not see any hands up. Was there any other questions before we move on to number two excellent, laura we'll talk to you soon. Thank you for the update. All right. Great all right, take care everybody. Okay, all right number: two on the agenda: lower Manhattan coastal resiliency, quarterly update for the mayor's office. Diana. Do we have someone from the mayor's office here yeah we have. We have a couple people we have Jordan Salinger from the mayor's office and will fisher from EDC I know they are here with a bunch of their colleagues and including in that group is some some folks from the Battery Park City Authority, who are also giving their quarterly update as part of this so will or Jordan I'll. Leave it to you to to direct your team sure so I'll start hi everyone Jordan Salinger, with the mayor's Office of Resiliency. Thanks for having us tonight, I think this is the first time that we've been able to present to this committee since January of this year. Obviously a lot has happened since then. You know we've had some of our projects on hold for portions of that time. Luckily, a number of projects we've been able to restart and you'll see some of the progress we've made. You know trying to make up for some of that lost time this evening, but you know very clearly, you know challenges remain, and you know I think this. You know we'll be able to demonstrate some of the significant progress, but you know very clearly with a changed economic climate. You know there are certainly challenges ahead, as mentioned before, you know, joined by our friends across a number of agencies, folks from emergency management, City's economic Development, Corporation, Battery, Park, City authority, I. Think folks from parks are also with us and kind of behind the scenes. You know we certainly work with a number of our other agencies, including DOT and many others, we're also joined by Mary Kimball from ARCADIS. You know: we've certainly heard in the past from this committee a desire to hear directly from some of our consultant team and so she'll, be speaking a bit to our progress on the master plan work. So with that I wanna hand it off to will to give a bit more of a background for us thanks Jordan good evening, everybody will fisher here with the New York City Economic Development corporation, it's nice to see everyone hope everybody is doing well. I've spoken with a lot of you in the meantime, but, like Jordan said, we have not had a chance to come in since I believe January to talk about the project says you know in any great detail: I want to give a quick update, just sort of on kind of the overall status of the of the city operated projects, not to speak for the Battery Park city authorities, projects which they will catch on later, but really quickly. I just wanted to give an update on sort of how these projects and how Edc's budgeting and project prioritization exercises have been happening in light of the fiscal situation caused by Covid-19. So, as all of you probably know, in early to mid April, the governor signed an executive order, halting capital construction city-wide due to obviously the dangers proposed by Coronavirus there were. There were no none of the lmcr projects. The capital projects were in construction at the time, but you know this was a chance for EDC and for the other city agencies that are implementing capital projects to sort of pause, the work that was being done both on the capital projects that were in construction and on work that was sort of in design and along the way. So because of you know, sort of the dual challenges of fiscal uncertainty. On the revenue side, the mayor obviously announced that there would be a budget hole of several billion dollars between fiscal years, 20 and 21, which obviously we're still dealing with and then in addition, you know there was quite a lot of new spending on the emergency preparedness and response side. So EDC, for its part, was working on setting up testing locations, doing dredging for the usns comfort at Manhattan cruise terminal, producing ventilators, producing a number of other types of PPE, Et cetera. So in April, just to sort of set the stage we had sort of new spending, as well as the fiscal challenges associated with significantly lower revenues. So, given that we paused at EDC all projects that were not related to Covid-19 response in Mid-April, so what that looked like through the summertime and in springtime was sort of waiting to see until the the budget passed in July, which obviously happened, and we sort of have a better sense right now. As you know, obviously, as Coronavirus has slowed down at least to New York City of Sort, of what the short to medium term impact on the cities and on Edc's finances will be, it has been so you know, since the budget passed for the fiscal year, 21 beginning on July 1st, we've been working closely with city Hall and OMB to sort of unpause projects as best as we can and as often as we can you know. Obviously, the city is trying to be conservative, as is EDC in terms of you know, maintaining enough cash on hand to respond to potentially a second wave or you know any other associated difficulties. So you know in being conservative, there are some projects that have restarted. There are some that have not so we worked quickly and we've been working pretty closely with OMB and City hall to you know, figure out where we can. You know what the prioritization scheme is in regard to getting projects started. Folks here are familiar with the Brooklyn bridge to Montgomery coastal resilience project, which is in community district. Three in the two bridges neighborhood, so that project has is, has a significant amount of federal funding that has a spending deadline attached to it. So, given that spending deadline is in place, that project has been has been restarted. We were lucky that the financial district and Seaport climate resilience master plan, which is for the more or less the study area between the whitehall ferry terminal. The Brooklyn bridge was greenlit as well. However, I do want to make sure everybody understands that right now the additional coaster resilience work that we had planned for at the battery in terms of raising the wharf to prevent sea level rise and daily inundation of battery park. That is still, unfortunately, on pause. So we can talk about what that means in a little bit of detail later, if anybody would like, but generally all of those projects are still funded. It is just a matter of current cash flow and OMB, asking various city agencies to sort of pause and kind of hold on in terms of in terms of restarting these projects, so we'll get into that a little bit more, but I wanted to make sure to give that background on the city and Edc's fiscal situation as a result of these projects, and we can come back to that that topic at any point within the conversation. But with that we can start the presentation. Perfect thanks will so to set the stage going back to spring of 2019 mayor made an announcement about this area and the projects specifically that you know many of you were part of that process, and so this may be familiar and I will zoom through it, but essentially that we had done a comprehensive climate risk assessment for this neighborhood looking at climate hazards. So not just you know, surge like many of you are obviously familiar from sandy, but increasing sea level rise and more intense precipitation. Then we looked at kind of all the latest engineering available and the sort of coastal resiliency tools that we have at our disposal: flood walls, deployable barriers, raising streets, hardening buildings and looked block by block to see what might be possible in this neighborhood and as part of the announcement, we were able to unveil about 500 million dollars worth of on land capital projects, and so you know looking at the map, that's working in two bridges. The battery project mentioned before, as well as the work that battery Park City is advancing. We were also able to announce that for the financial district in Seaport, where we looked at on land capital projects that we were unable to find a project that the solutions were not deemed viable, and certainly we can kind of get into a discussion later on that piece, but that next phase of work was necessary to look at in-water options, specifically for that neighborhood to protect against surge sea level rise and increased precipitation. So I think this is always important. You know this is not the only work that has gone on that study that I mentioned at the beginning of the previous slide. You see the image there, the lower Manhattan climate resilience study. You know first of its kind, comprehensive risk assessment looking well into the future, but that, but that all built on top of significant work, that this community has been involved in and helped to support and further. You know dating back to the Sur report that many folks are familiar with from the end of the Bloomberg administration, the big U, the rebuild by design effort. Looking at a series of on land options, as well as the southern Manhattan coastal protection study or Seaport city, as many of you are familiar with kind of back of the House study of feasibility, of exactly what we'll be discussing a little bit later, some of the in-water protection necessary to protect against these threats. So that's the background. We're now going to jump briefly into some updates from our friends at emergency management and their interim flood protection measures and then we'll pick back up with the long-term work in a second thanks Jordan. This is Susan Rosen from New York, City, Emergency management. Most of you know, I'm the deployables program manager and I oversee the interim flood protection measures program. So before I update you on potential projects in lower Manhattan I was asked to provide a brief summary of our deployment at South Street Seaport for tropical storm Isaias. As you can see on the Timeline New York City Emergency management was monitoring the storm as of July 24th, when it was a tropical disturbance in the atlantic over the next six days. It continued to develop and move west until it became a category one hurricane on July 30th and was forecast to move up the coast with potential impacts to New York City, the timing for zero hour or the arrival of tropical storm force. Winds was estimated to be sometime on Tuesday August 4Th Nysum continued to monitor the storm and convened the coastal storm steering committee on July 31st. These calls are held to bring all the involved agencies and organizations together to provide the latest forecast information, discuss components of the plan such as sheltering or the Downtree task force. What steps agencies and organizations are taking to prepare for the storm, such as delivering extra meals to the elderly or relocating movable assets? Ifpm is one of the many pieces of the plan as part of New York City's emergency man, New York City Emergency management's continued monitoring. We looked at the worst case, flooding models. These models are based on thousands of previous storms tracking in the same direction with similar forward speeds, and they consistently showed that South Street Seaport was the only IFPM site that was at risk under the predicted conditions. So, following the coastal storm steering committee call the Internal Nysem IFPM team discussed the models and options for an activation, and we reached out to our local, just-in-time, vendor tully construction, letting them know that Isaias might impact the city and we discuss the timing and the actions that would be needed. The forecasts remain consistent into Saturday, August, 1st and IFPM received instructions to activate at approximately 6:20 P.M. We immediately notified the vendor and all our agency partners, and we held a lead team conference call and a traffic management call that Saturday night and then, although the turnaround time from receiving the go-ahead was fairly short, tully was fully staffed and ready to go at 7:00 A.M Sunday morning with over 82 laborers additional supervisors, four men and skilled operators. Just to give you some background laying out and connecting the Tiger dams is the most time consuming and labor heavy part of the deployment and the first day was devoted just to that activity on Monday, August 3rd work started again at 7:00 am and by 11 pm that night, all Tiger dams and just in time, hescos were in place within the targeted time of 12 hours before zero hour, as directed tully returned at 7 am on Tuesday, with a small crew to address any issues that might have arisen overnight, and this check was completed and the crew departed at 10:15. Am the storm arrived in New York City in the early afternoon with very strong winds, causing a great deal of damage and power outages across the city, but the potential surge impacts did not materialize. This was mainly due to an earlier arrival time, avoiding the high tide and the fact that the storm development happened relatively quickly, preventing it from building the energy that pushes the surge. We began demobilization at 7 pm by removing tiger dams from the entrance to Smith houses, and we also opened all the valves on all of the Tiger dams along the rest of the alignment to allow a slow dewatering overnight. Crews arrived at 7 A.M Wednesday morning to start the demobilization and continued on Thursday when all of the measures were removed and roads were reopened by 1 pm please. So these are some photos from the deployment the picture on the left is under the FDR just at the Promenade and Wall Street. The next picture over is looking down catherine slipped towards South Street, so this is the Tiger dams outside Smith houses and then on the top right picture. Those are some just in time, hescos being filled at the corner of Wall Street and then the Tiger dams, Crossing Wall Street there in the bottom picture, on the right, as I mentioned. This was the first time that we have deployed at any IFPM site outside of our annual exercises, and it was a tremendous opportunity to review the plans and assumptions that are the basis for the IFPM program. As with all niceum emergency responses, we follow up our actions with a deep look at what went well and what lessons can be learned from the experience since the deployment we've conducted, internal and interagency hot washes. These are conversations designed to gather a wide perspective and information across all aspects of the deployment we're still in the process of analyzing and organizing that information and feedback for isaias, but we'd like to share some of those achievements and items for future consideration with you as the most public and heavily trafficked site. South Street Seaport is certainly the most challenging deployment and again this activation provided a great many observations that we can use to improve across the program. I would say that one big achievement was that we were able to validate our expected time frame. We completed the deployment as we expected. The total work hours was about 27 hours and then the D-mode took about 20 hours, so that was just a really a good exercise for us across our whole program to be able to validate our timeline, I'm going to say again art there were no injuries or property damage. Obviously, this is always the standard, but at a site, this big and this public in particular, there are many challenges to say: site safety, it's very difficult in New York City, to make people understand why they should not put themselves in danger when they want to go somewhere and they just are determined to go the way they want to go no matter what so many people were ignoring all the safety warnings from our uniformed officers and our contractors etc. Another achievement is that the interagency cooperation just went very well again. The lack of injuries is a testament to that. Everyone was really amazingly helpful and really on board with making this happen in the best way possible. Some of the future considerations. This activation happened in the absence of an evacuation order, and this is, you know, a new scenario for us. It was not something that really had been part of our plan. We always had talked about only doing this in the event of an evacuation, but this limited impact that was predicted really only called for you know us to protect the site and not really call for the evacuation across the city, but it did bring complications and we are looking those very closely to see what we can do if we are asked to do this again in a limited way at any of our sites, it increases our ability to respond. If we're able to do this, but it does have impacts, especially the residents at Ms. Smith houses were impacted. Some businesses in the area were impacted and again we're looking at ways to ameliorate those impacts. If we should do it again, you know site safety and traffic management like I said, even though we achieved this without any injuries or any damage. You know we understand that this can be a major inconvenience to the community when we have to shut down streets and it's absolutely necessary, but we do want to try to be mindful and think about if we can do this in a way that has a less impact on the community. So we're looking to try to think about that for the future. Just to mention you know the the end word on traffic management, of course, is with the police department, but we do want to try to plan as much as we can to try to ease that restriction communication. We do see a lot of room for improvement in communicating with the community on what would happen during the deployment and putting out more messaging during the deployment and we're already starting to implement that into our plans. I do just want to say that one great way to stay informed about IFPM or any emergency in New York City is to sign up for notify NYC, which you can google at notifynyc or call 311 to sign up for that. So please. So I'm just going to give you a little bit of an update on the potential IFPM projects in lower Manhattan. So, as most of you know, we have been working with our engineering team to look at South Street Seaport, to evaluate alternative measures in the hopes that we could find a just-in-time measure that might be more efficient, cutting the time we need to deploy and also with less impact to the community, as well as mitigating the everyday presence of the current measures. We had been focusing on a measure called aquafence, but in late winter and early spring, our engineers provided some feedback that raised a lot of concerns as to its suitability for South Street Seaport. These concerns mainly revolved around its ability to withstand potential wave action, as well as issues with the need to anchor the Aqua fence. The subsurfaces along much of the alignment of the of South Street Seaport, would not provide sufficient anchorage for this measure. So as we review the Isaiah, the Issa Hey Activation and review with our engineers, we will continue to consider either alternative measures or perhaps changes to the current alignment. If there are gains to be found in shortening the just-in-time timeline, mitigating the daily impacts or improving the alignment, I think that will gave us a very clear picture of how Covid-19 has impacted the city, agencies and programs and IFPM is no different. I would have to say. The biggest impact for impm is probably on the progress on the analyses for the Tribeca and South Street Seaport extension areas. These analyses were paused in the spring as non-essential work was put on hold and emergency management staff, and all of our city agency partners were pulled into work related to the Covid-19 response. Ifpm budget allocations do not carry over from one year to the next. We are funded each year prior to the onset of the Covid-19 emergency in New, York City IFPM had made its budget presentation to the city and fully expected to receive continued funding for the remaining analysis and possibly potential designs. However, when the budget was allocated in June for this fiscal year, our budget as all budgets across all agencies and programs was cut dramatically. At the moment. Our priority must be the operational requirements of current sites. Emergency management, the interim flood protection measures program and the city fully understand the criticality of protecting these areas and the importance of finding solutions for the community, but as we evaluate the South Street Seaport deployment and extrapolate the lessons for other neighborhood sites, we are also taking this opportunity to re-evaluate how best to protect them and to find the appropriate balance between the measures and the daily life of the area. It's also noted that the long-term capital projects are in flux and it's extremely important that we, you know design and have our timelines for IFPM tie into the engineering for those sites as well and be able to work around those plans. Just to let you know, we do typically have opportunity opportunities later in the year to revise our funding requests and we will be requesting that we be able to restart these analyses, but at this time we have no way of knowing. If and when that might happen. Thank you thanks Susan. So let's go to the so now reorient reorienting yourself from the day-to-day and then the interim flood protection measures back to the long-term work here, as mentioned before. In the financial district and Seaport, we were unable to find an on land, a capital project and so have started to advance a study looking at in-water protection for the neighborhood. As part of this effort, we have brought on a tremendous team and will be joined by one of the members shortly, but just to give folks a reminder of the goals of this work, we're really trying to determine the extent of the shoreline extension as part of this work. I think this graphic does not always do us justice here, but it really it really. It's trying to show the potential extent by no means is there a scenario where we, you know we're going kind of all the way out across the project area, but just really to give you a sense of you know where we're looking at and the extent of the study area by 2021. You know the summer, you know about a year from now we're hoping to develop a conceptual design of coastal defense infrastructure to protect this neighborhood and a preliminary design of a first phase project. We are also looking at implementation plan for the financing, construction and governance. We realize this is a unique effort, and so the sort of you know specifically in terms of financing, construction and governance. You know we will be looking at kind of new models that help to support these efforts. Certainly, given the in-water aspects of this work, we've already started to work with our state and federal agencies and will continue to do so. They are truly the decision maker as it relates to this in water work and will follow their lead in terms of deeming what is and what is not possible in efforts to protect from flooding. Also, as many of you know, and has been focused of a number of presentations before we're planning to create a drainage plan to upgrade the sewer system in response to these risks, we know that capacity starts to become very constrained, certainly in the future, and so drainage is essential and will be part of the plan, and you should be expecting significant detail on that in the future. So, with that we'll hand it off to Mary Kimball from ARCADIS to get into the details of what we've been up to Mary, we can't hear you I, do not actually see you but either I see I, see that Mary's unmuted yeah I see her and she was speaking, but I do not see that she's, muted, either yep still can't hear you Mary. If you can hear us it's on your end. No, it's not just me right, Dana! No, it's not I see that Mary is unmuted. We just we can't hear you Mary I, think the best option, if you can't figure it out on your computer Mary, is just to dial in and while we wait, Dinah will sing us a song, terrible will or Jordan do you want to move on to another section, while Mary figures out her tech issues, yeah I mean I. Guess. Are there any questions in the meantime about the content we covered so far? There is. It is quite a long presentation with the with the multiple agencies. Yeah well I. Do not sorry I do not I can't, oh sure, okay, no problem, Elijah or Jocelyn. Do you maybe want to kiss off through this question or through the I'm sorry through this? Otherwise we can hey. Can you can you all hear me now there? She goes okay, nice, okay, great all, right! So sorry about that, I'm I do not know. Webex sometimes I have issues with, but anyway, as I was saying, my name is Mary Kimball, I'm the urban planner with the firm ARCADIS and we're the lead consultant on this project with a lot of other consultants with us, leading all various aspects of this project. A little bit about me too, I'm an urban planner. I've been working on coastal resiliency and waterfront planning projects in New, York City for about a decade. I actually worked on the comprehensive waterfront plan that was issued 10 years ago, not the current one, that's in development, but the prior iteration of it- and it's been, you know, very excited to sort of bring all that experienced. Bear on this very exciting project too. So, in terms of the team, ARCADIS is leading on the engineering design of all the resiliency infrastructure, including from in water and maritime perspective, as well as upland and tie-ins we're also working with matrix new world who's. An expert on maritime structures as well as transportation, maritime structures and Sam Schwartz engineering is also supporting from an engineering planning perspective. Arcadis is also leading on the drainage modeling, as well as the hydrodynamic modeling, really to make sure that we understand the existing drainage system and incorporating any strategies into the plan that are necessary from a drainage perspective and then on the hydrodynamic modeling, making sure that we understand what the potential impacts of the project could be on the habitat and ecology of the East River, as well as potential impacts on navigation and water structures. On the permitting environmental side, we have a very experienced team with scipadget resell at Akrf, as well as matrix new world. We've actually begun doing the habitat and biological sampling to inform the permitting and the design, and then from an urban design standpoint. We have scape on landscape architecture as well as one architecture and we're also looking across implementation from financial analysis, Djh advisors and Ernst and Young are working on financial modeling and then a lot of different everyone really on this team is involved in the stakeholder and public engagement. Scape is working with us on the website and really the intention is to bring all of the various expertise from these team into the public conversation and bring all the information that we're doing and we're analyzing so that we're all working from the same information. And so what have we done so far? We you know, since we had this four month- pause, really kind of now making sure we're hitting the ground running, and you know really trying to make sure that we're able to accomplish everything that's needed to be done within the timeline for this project. Our focus recently has been really diving into the existing conditions. To make sure we understand the opportunities and constraints looking across the board at the coastal defense potential alignments, the drainage system, transportation and maritime infrastructure, ecology, urban design ideas, as well as the funding and financing pathways part of this has been, has been looking globally at innovative precedence, making sure we're understanding really what could be innovative and potential for this area and for this project. We've also begun working directly with the regulators through an aquatic resources, Advisory Committee, to make sure we understand what are their questions and concerns about the project and we're starting to advance the habitat sampling in order to set that understanding of baseline conditions. I mentioned some of the hydrodynamic modeling we're doing of looking at the range of potential options, what the potential impacts could be and on outreach. We've held a climate coalition last year at the end of last year and then earlier this year before our pause, we had a public open house just really begin to share all these materials and we'll be doing more of that in the future, and right now we're shifting to a remote engagement through meetings like this, as well as the engagement portal, the website and other virtual workshops as well. So I mentioned the harbor sampling. That's actually been going on right now, it's really exciting to start to see like actually beginnings of implementation happening and really it's an exciting opportunity to really get a better understanding of the baseline conditions in the harbor. Nothing, there's an existing information like we're gathering. Now that's been done in this modern era, so really kind of a critical process to make sure we're understanding what are the existing conditions? What are we working with in order for us to understand what the potential impacts of working in this area may be? So here's our schedule as we you know we mentioned with this four month pause. You know we really now need our to. You know be working on on all's name to move forward and meet the overall project schedule. At the same time, so we've been working on developing our evaluation framework to understand how we'll set up sort of that criteria that we'll be using to evaluate options been doing the hydrodynamic modeling as well as interior drainage, modeling and then really looking across all those project systems, transportation, maritime drainage, bringing all that information together to understand. What is the what we call the solution space? What is the space that defines what is possible for this project and for this area? What are the sort of guard rails, things that are that are not possible, making sure that we push on that to make sure that we're not eliminating solutions that are feasible, but also taking into account things that are just not possible and we're using our understanding of that. To begin, then, developing the initial options for both online and in-water options, and then we'll be coming back to the public and to you all next year, once we sort of have a sense of what those options are, and we can begin to refine and evaluate those we're also thinking about place, making opportunities in the in the area and, first understanding. You know what are our urban design, principles and goals for that, and then on implementation mention the habitat and biological sampling. We're also doing a lot of research into potential funding and financing options. Thinking about what are the potential scale of different options and what will we need to advance in order to make those options real and I'll pass it over to will to talk about the engagement yeah, so do not deal with what Mary was saying. I think you know. One of the key points we want to make sure to get across today is that you know we were. We were very lucky to have the this. The Friday Seaport master plan continue to be funded during fiscal year 21, but that also means that we have to do you know the same amount of work that we were intending to do before, which is already quite rushed and constrained, I think in a shorter amount of time. So you know we have a. We have an excellent team on board. We want to continue to bring the control the consultants themselves, so these and other meetings so that you know the public has a chance to interact with the experts who are doing this work in this research. But we also, you know, do need to make sure that we stay really closely aligned with the Community Board and with public in general, as we continue to go through the process, because there is you know. Quite honestly, there is. There is a lot of work still to be done and I think you know one of the biggest things that we're looking to beginning to kind of tease out over the next few months and into next summer is like looking at the looking at the very real alternatives and I mean those sort of trade-offs and decision-making that we'll have to go through to figure out, like Mary, said with all of these various work streams, as well as the sort of question of financing for this project and what is actually implementable. You know those are going to be things that were that we're going to be discussing with the public quite a bit. So you can see here at the bottom. On the engagement touch points like Mary said we had. You know a few events to be spoken for earlier this year, but we're really looking forward to the second meeting of the climate coalition, which is our sort of small stakeholder group which generally we're meeting with them in advance and meeting with the public and we're also looking to launch a remote engagement tool and website, probably in the next month or so blake. Can we see the please so just to rECAB I hope that folks here were able to make it I know that just looking through the attendance list that many of you were able to make it? But you know we really try to set the bar high for ourselves in terms of you know getting this information to the public. So we had. We had an event in February at pace's downtown conference center, where we had sort of a kind of two-room museum, exhibit type set up for our engagement here. So there was one room related specifically to the risk. So what does unmitigated climate change in lower Manhattan? Specifically look like so we talked about sunny day, flooding, tidal inundation. We talked about storm surge. You can see val from community board three here with the with the Vr goggles, so we had a you know, sort of virtual reality simulation which is still available on YouTube, and we would love for everybody to be able to see that you know showing what it would look like to stand at the corner of Wall Street and South Street if the city and if we all do nothing about climate change, so we're really glad to have hundreds and hundreds of folks turn out. For that again. Have those you know, touch points directly having the public interact with the engineers who are doing this work for us, so we really want to. You know: try to get foster that really in-depth conversation as much as possible. So we got a lot of great feedback there and I think we want to continue to sort of engage with the public in a way that allows this feedback to flow. I won't read through all of this, but you know: there's definitely the desire to get more into the more into the nitty-gritty and the kind of engineering details. So as we continue to think about pivoting from in person to Online engagement, we're going to be releasing a engagement tool, a new website here in the next month or two, which will really provide not just information out to the public but really provide a way for those two-way conversations to happen with you know, sort of like ask an expert feature, commenting features, you know, sort of place-based, individual comments on the project you, etc. We heard that the public really wants something to the public does not just want this to be another study. They you know we want to together, come up with something that is able to be implemented and able to be funded, and then we also just talked about sort of down the road. You know what are the decisions that we're going to need to make in the trade-off, so we talked about the potential to use this as a way to create parks and open space. We talked about the need to handle drainage capacity issues in lower Manhattan, and you know making this something that's accessible to the neighborhood and sort of respects. The various urban contexts from the very dense financial district to the to the historic South, Street Seaport, so I think with all of that. You know we want to make sure that at the core we are really designing resilience infrastructure, but we do want to make sure, obviously that the rest of those priorities are taken into account. Blake. Can we go to the please so again? I won't read through all of this, but I think as I've touched on I think you know, the community board meetings are but one way that you know we want to enable the public to engage with us. You know we're. We frankly can't do a project that is so big and important just alone and sort of in a silo, so I think in terms of connecting with all of our different agencies, both at the city, level, state and federal levels. There is a lot of sort of regulatory framework in place that we need to to work together with, but you know, there's also a lot of chances and we want to create those chances for the public to give input. So we hear a lot about transportation and making sure that lower Manhattan remains accessible for people who live and work. Here we hear a lot about historic preservation and respecting the South Street Seaport. We hear a lot about making sure that communities at the table- and you know not just the most engaged folks, but also folks who do not have access to the internet. Folks, who are you know outside the typical engagement processes and also young people, we've had some great conversations with blue school and with the Harvard School and peck slip school, so we're really excited to you know, be reaching out and engaging more to the young folks that are really you know, going to be experiencing the threats of climate change most acutely and I. Think you know more than anything. What is important to restate here is you know we want to be partners with the community here we have sort of this multi-tiered engagement approach with the climate coalition, which has representatives from a number of the sort of community institutions that we work with, as well as city-wide resilience. Folks. We also have a number of touch points with the elected officials and community boards we've committed to coming here. Quarterly we're also looking you know since there's just frankly so much content here into getting into individual individual subject areas so over the next few months, we're working on sort of an idea to come up with smaller, more bite-sized workshops on individual portions of the of the study. So there are, you know, for example, like Mary said the transportation work stream, the historical preservation work stream. We want to make sure that you know for the folks who have interest in contributing to one or just finding out more about one of these kind of bite-sized pieces of what is a very large and complex project that we provide those opportunities and with that we can go to the oh sorry, I forgot about this last slide, but yeah. So this sort of sums up kind of what I was saying last but I think the you know ongoing meetings with the number of layers of groups that I've talked about. Our new website is going to be debuting next month. We're also again, we've heard a lot of strong feedback to make sure that you know in the time of coba it's important that we do not just rely on the internet as much as we're all getting used to using Zoom and Webex Et cetera. You know we still want to be creative and try to get try to get in front of folks as much as possible with physical materials, whether that is you know, posters and flyers up and about in the community. We've used link, NYC smaller meetings, walking tours that kind of stuff, and with that we can give the great so I can I can deliver this slide really quickly. Like I mentioned earlier and like Susan touched on in her in her part regarding the office of Emergency, management's interim flood protection, we are unfortunately not able to restart the battery wharf project, yet as a short reminder that this is a project to raise the existing wharf, so you would actually walk up a few steps instead of down a few steps access for battery part. Essentially, you know looking towards the future. The battery is slated to be subject to nearly daily or monthly title inundation, depending on how far out you look so this is this project is really an effort to protect the park and the infrastructure around and beneath it from those threats. So like I mentioned for now, we are unfortunately still on pause. This is something that we continue to get updates on every week and every month, from the city's Office of Management and budget and from city Hall, but unfortunately, this project is still on pause. I do want to make sure to mention that does not mean the project is not funded. There is still funding in the long-term capital budget, but we just are not able to move on that right now. So you know in the meantime, we are doing what we can in-house. So we did begin design in November of actually that should say 2019 we begin design with with stan tech in November of 2019. We also released a procurement and selected hunter Roberts construction group for a to actually construction manage the project once you know, once we have a project designed and I do want to be clear that you know the timing of the pause with all of this. We were just about to come out to Community Board one and to the public regarding sort of the first touch points with designing and brainstorming around this project. So I do not want anyone to fear to feel like. We are kind of rushing ahead behind the scenes. We are really just getting started with design on this and really hope to get back to work soon, so that we can begin speaking with the community and with that I think I saw Nick, Spordone, but I know Gwen Dawson is on and Jennifer is on and others so we'll turn it over here to Bbca hello. This is Gwen Dawson. Can you hear me hi? My name is Kim hi, hello, everybody! It's nice to be with you this evening, thanks for asking us to participate. I'll give you a little bit of a of an update on the battery park city projects and it's good to hear about all of the other projects that are moving forward. There have been some developments and I'll go through them each project individually, but just to summarize on the South Battery Park City project, which is depicted on the illustration here. We have made a decision to switch from an environmental assessment to environmental impact statement, and that is something that we decided over the course of the past several months. We are at 75 percent design on the project right now, I'll go through a little bit more of the schedule expectations as we move along on the slides here, the North Battery Park City project. Last time we had an update for you that project was moving forward at about it was coming up on 30 design. We have 30 design. Now we have had identified an alignment. We have likewise decided to move that project to an eis rather than an ea. One thing additional thing that has impacted that project is that in the spring of this year, Battery Park City Authority received design, build authority from the state, and we spent quite a bit of time really looking very closely at how we might utilize that authority to the benefit of our projects here, and we were looking specifically at the north project and the West project, which we were about to begin design on this year and have concluded that combining the north and the west into a single progressive design, build project is going to be the best way forward for those projects and then finally, our ball fields, resiliency project. We have a contractor ready to go and we're working on revocable consent that hopefully, will allow us to get underway very soon. Our objective is to get this in place before next next year's storm season. I can move forward now on the south, as I mentioned, that we are at 75 design and we are going forward with the eis that process has started. We've also begun a more concentrated design. Effort for interior drainage, I heard a couple of people earlier talking about the need for interior drainage, that's something that has been an an added complication for this project and has factored significantly into the to the decision to switch to an eis since we are. We are expecting at this point that, with the interior drainage work, that our construction period will now exceed two years, we're hopeful not by much, but we do expect that it will exceed two years. We are anticipating the completion of our Eis next fall in November. We will be getting to 100 design in the spring of 2021, with our target of final pdc approval at that time, with construction spec expected to commence in November of next year. We anticipate that we will be completed with construction in early 2024. Okay, you can go to the okay on the the north project, as you can see in the illustration. We that this project has identified a preferred alignment that extends along the North esplanade of Battery Park City up the west side of route 9A across route, 9a north to North Moore, where it would proceed East to Greenwich Street. That was arrived at after a couple of public meetings and preliminary design, work and engineering work by Ecom. We anticipate that, although we have now decided to combine this project with the West project, that the work that's been done by e-com at this point will inform the project moving forward and for those who may not be familiar with what progressive design build is design build, as many of you may know, combines the design and the contract and construction functions with a single contractor. Progressive design build is similar, except that it provides a little bit more flexibility and leeway on the front end for design so that we can have a lot more in the way of community involvement in formulating the appropriate design response. Before we get to a point of an actual commitment on a price for the construction. So we have, we felt that it provided us with a significant amount of flexibility, which is something that we felt was really important for our project such as this. That really we want to have a significant amount of community interface on. We can go to the next one. I know that we do not have a. We do not have any. We do not have a an illustration for the west, but let me just let me just tell you a little bit about the West. The West project would connect where the north project terminates on the west end just about the west side of Stuyvesant around north end Avenue and Chamber Street along the waterside edge of battery Park city to connect with the northwestern terminus of the south project on first place, and the objective at this point is to procure a consulting engineer, which will who will act as the owner's Rep for Battery Park City Authority. As we proceed through the procurement process for the progressive design. Build contractor. That RFP for the consulting engineer is going to be released in the next 30 days or so. And then we expect that we will have requests for qualifications issued for progressive design, build contractor in the spring of 2021, an RFP following that and a a progressive design build contractor under contract by the fall of next year. That will then move forward with design and an eis in parallel, and we are anticipating that once we have a the progressive design build contractor on board that there will be some time and schedule efficiencies that will allow it to to move forward at a rapid pace. At that point. So, moving on to the ball fields, project we are, as I mentioned earlier, about to begin construction on this project. We have made some design modifications in response to some comments from the Public Design Commission are working with New York, City DOT on irrevocable consent. We just discovered that SBS now has to be an additional signature on the revocable consent, so we might get pushed back a little bit on the starting point, but our endpoint. We are really focused on having this in place by next summer for the 2021 storm season, so that is all I have for the update tonight. Thank you, so I think we have one more slide just to wrap things up for folks. I know that we went through a ton of material, but just to give you a sense of some upcoming engagement for these projects. I was talking to Nick earlier tonight from the authority and there's an upcoming meeting for the south project in December. Coming to this committee, as mentioned before, a lot of work on Fidei Seaport, including the interactive community, Portal that we're hoping to roll out next month, the Brooklyn bridge, montgomery project outside of this, this community board, but still chugging along, went to pdc today and having an upcoming meeting either in November or December, and so with that I think it's a good spot to open up for questions. Okay. This is Colin Gerry and Committee, so it does not look like. We have a lot of questions just yet, but in preparation for such a long presentation, I'll just ask everyone to ask one question: please, on the first round, and if you have another one we'll get back to you, anyone from Community Board, one members have any questions. Please raise your hand, digitally Jeff Galloway go ahead, hi my question's for gwen. Could you just elaborate a little bit on the difference between an ea and Eis and why the decision was made to go from one to the other sure and I will I will also open it up to for assistance from our director of Design Jenny Dudgeon, who is also on the line? The environmental assessment is a an environmental review mechanism that is chosen when there is not there's not significant impact anticipated, which was the case when we first started this project. We had. We had some concepts in mind that included a lot mostly deployable elements for storm protection. We had a an expectation in terms of what the ultimate design flood elevation would be, that we wanted to design to that turned out to be lower than what we actually need and which then created the need to switch from a deployable, focused solution to a more passive focused solution, and that created some additional footprint that was impacted by the project. Once we were looking at adding in the the interior drainage, which also became clear, that was going to be a much more significant element of the project after we started and that was going to further expand the footprint of where we were impacting and also would likely increase the construction duration. We had originally expected that we would have a construction duration of less than two years with the addition of the interior drainage that we are expecting that to be slightly over two years, so the eis provides a much more robust review that looks at alternatives. There is a an expansive scoping of the project. That's done. There is a a very robust opportunity for community public involvement so and a variety of studies that that we are expected to complete to determine what, if any mitigation may be required for any impacts that we would have on or around the site. So it's it's a more complex lengthier project. Jenny! Is there something else that you want to add to that Jenny here? Can everyone hear me yeah, okay, great, no gwen I think you covered it very comprehensively. I think it's, the added complexity really required a much more holistic and comprehensive assessment to ensure that we are obviously covering all grounds and in terms of the timing, I think you said that at least one of the ais I think for the south project was projected for November of next year. Is that the final one? After all the public comment, or is that when it will be released, that would be when it would be completed? The final Eis would be completed. Okay, so there will be. There will be a very you know, active process that includes public engagement between now and then we will I know. Aecom is working on an updated schedule to to make sure that people are aware of exactly what is happening. When so, do you have a target date of when we would be seeing the preliminary or the draft Eis? And it's a and sort of a corollary question? Is it going to be on different time frames for each of these projects, or are they on kind of a parallel time frame in terms of the eises yeah I? Do not I do not have a date to give you a target date for the draft Eis, but that will be coming shortly. We'll be we'll be getting that out to you very soon. As far as the timelines for the Eis is, the Eis for the south will be proceeding in advance of the eis for the north, the combined newly combined north and west project, which will likely be starting sometime in the latter half of next year. Okay, all right! Thank you. Thanks Jeff, I'm actually going to ask one quick question myself. I know this is a long way off, but I asked this question last year and I never got an answer to it, but in terms of the extension of the shoreline, do we know yet how that would be zoned, and can we get a guarantee that it would not be zoned residential, hey colin? This is this is will and the project team can conjunct if, if they need to so yeah, it's a good question. I think you know we are to. You know, be very clear. We've said this before we are considering. We are looking at development as one of the potential options, but I think you know, what's important to remember here is that this is a resilience first project and I think we're looking at the development from the lens of you know what could potentially help pay for the project. I think you know we're all curious. What's going to happen with the with the election here in a couple of weeks, I think we do want to leave. You know all options on the table in terms of creative financing and creative ways to get this thing built because we do need to protect lower Manhattan. You know sooner rather than later, and that is something I think that we are going to be looking at, but as we get into the sort of preliminary options with the public, probably you know sort of in the spring of next year. We'll have all that laid out really clearly in terms of what those trade-offs might be if we think there even is capacity for you know if there even is capacity for development to help pay for some of that, so it is on the table, but I think I do want to highlight that you know, in contrast to you, know some previous plans and some previous studies that have been done. We are looking at this from Resiliency first and you know: how do we get the resiliency project done team? Is there anything else that I should add on that Michael Franco after this Michael, but I can speak only for myself, but I could never personally support anything that had anything driving it related to that I mean I, think we need more green space and every time we have green space, so we keep getting it gobbled up, whether it's 250, Watt, Street or Governor's island we're losing it so I would just ask you guys to consider that very strong, great thanks, colin yeah. Thanks for the presentation, everyone, it's good to hear from everyone again so I think my question is probably it's probably for you will or your team at EDC I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on why you were not able to find a viable option on land for the Fidei in South, Street, Seaport area and I know you've spoken to that before. So you do not have to get into all the details, but if you just like summarize that again, yeah of course good question, Michael and I think we are going to be. You know. We have heard that question as well. As you said a few times so I think as we continue to roll out sort of more of the in-depth and technical material next few months, I think we're really going to be focused on that I'll turn it over to Mary here in a second from ARCADIS, but really quick. Generally, we looked and saw that the sort of you know nothing is totally impossible. Necessarily with you know, with with a project that is expensive enough, but I think you know we're looking at what is actually able to be permitted under the current regime. What is able to be financed in the current regime? You know just speaking of construction costs and that kind of thing there is a significant, obviously a significant amount of sub-grade infrastructure with the various subway tunnels, the the battery park Underpass, the elevated FDR. You have sort of a unique confluence of sort of complicating factors and infrastructure. If you look up the river towards the east side, coastal resilience project, for example, they had a you know they have. They have a wide park area to deal with. In terms of where to put the coastal protection infrastructure in the two bridges neighborhood, we are able to fit the sort of deployable floodgates of the appropriate height beneath the FDR, but, as you get closer to the harbor, the the projected surge heights get higher and higher. So you know we were not able to fit with both the FDR sort of. We did look at that as an alternative that, with both the FDR sort of decreasing in grade toward the battery tunnel and the increasing risk, as you get closer to the to the mouth of the harbor, there's frankly not enough space to fit deployable gates beneath the FDR. So there's a number of factors like that, but you know obviously understand Michael that we obviously understand Michael, that you know the public does want to hear what those alternatives are, or you know what those reasons are Mary. Is there anything that you'd like to add on that from your perspective, because I'm the engineering team, yeah I, mean I, think you really covered it? Well, though, I mean it really is about the space spatial constraints. You know the underground infrastructure is a major reason and major challenging factor here and then I think with the both the higher flood elevations and lower ground elevations, and just that sort of clearance questions with the FDR drive. You know it was really sort of part of the initial analysis and initial reasoning behind not being able to find an online solution or strategy here, but it is still something that you know that we're working on analyzing and want to you know understood that we want to share that analysis and that information with you all. It's also it's very critical to the regulatory conversation as well. Yeah. Thank you, Mary and yeah. So I will put Michael in the chat if diane or whoever's behind the controls would not mind saying get out the original lmcr report from from March 2019, which has sort of some of the things that we looked at but like Mary, said and we'll continue to have this conversation with the public as well as the regulatory agencies. But quite frankly, we can not build, or you know the shoreline extension will not be permitted by the state, DEC and by army corps, etc. If we do not have a compelling reason and sort of unless it's the only option, so we will continue to sort of make that case with the regulatory community and we'll share that feedback with you all as well. Great thanks and one quick follow-up. Sorry, I'm getting some feedback is that for me, cool I'll, try again so I keep hearing the FDR seems to be a primary reason why you guys were not able to come up with a viable online solution. I'm curious. Did you look at any possible solutions that involved like getting rid of the FDR, perhaps below, like the Brooklyn bridge and I? Do not know if you had any data on what the expected lifetime of the FDR is I know they're having a conversation across in Brooklyn about the same situation with the bqx running through Brooklyn heights, but I also am not as familiar with. You did mention underground infrastructure, so I do not know if that also complicates the issue yeah of course, and Michael I got. To be honest, it's great to hear you know the this is the sort of big thinking that we're really excited to be doing during this project. You know thinking about. Does the FDR need to remain? Obviously there's a lot of there's a lot of other agencies and other stakeholders at the table when discussing that. But you know this is an opportunity to ask that question and sort of look at what alternatives might be. We have not proposed any alternatives, yet we're still sort of in existing conditions, analysis and we will be rolling out. You know sort of the beginnings of alternative next spring, which we'll be obviously discussing with you all so right now we're sort of in existing conditions mode and, like Mary, said earlier, you know sort of defining what the parameters are so like. What's the bare minimum that a resiliency project here should do what would we aspire for it to do, etc. So we're sort of setting the guard rails and the guidelines right now- and you know the FDR- is certainly something that we're looking at. We do have Sam Schwartz on retained on the consultant team for their transportation expertise. So that is something that we'll be looking at and looking forward to discussing that with you more yeah, great fantastic yeah I, look forward to continuing the conversation thanks: Mike Bob you're, up Bob's, back okay on hello, Bob, hello, I, just wanted to thank everyone for a really remarkable presentation, because my memory, this is the first time that we've gotten a kind of comprehensive look at the whole project of southern Manhattan and I. Think that's an important start to all this, since I'm limited to the when I think about all this. The word that comes is urgency and that we never can tell in any particular storm season, as we face another sandy anniversary. What's going to happen so always from my point of view, there's an urgency in getting these things done as expediently and economically as possible. But if I'm limited to one one question here, my concern is community input we had a meeting last winter and then there was a community open house since then, and there's one community open house coming up and I really think that that's insufficient, so I would like to encourage more interactions with community Board one and the Environmental Protection Committee and I wanted to find out. Is that possible and the other kind of inside this is the question: is the shoreline extension the same project as the Friday Seaport climate resolution plan or resiliency plan rather or those two things and is? Are there more opportunities for the community to kind of get involved and discuss these really important changes in our downtown world? Great? Well, Bob. Thank you for your question. I. Think me. Since my line of work is community relations, I'm always excited to hear people who are excited about that and who are interested in discussing in greater detail to answer the second question: first yeah, the shoreline extension sort of broadly the shorthand for the fight is support. Climate resilience master plan, which we also sometimes just call Fidei Seaport to abbreviate it but yeah, so that all refers to the same thing: the the study project that we're doing with ARCADIS between whitehall and whitehall terminal and the Brooklyn bridge. So it's a great question regarding community engagement, the sort of order of operations, because there's a lot of folks to talk to that we've been working on in regard to community engagement, is sort of at each phase of the project of which there are that we've sort of roughly divided into speaking with the regulators with the climate coalition and then speaking with the public and sort of doing that in a sort of evolving way. We've also committed, as of the March 2019 announcement to briefing briefing all together, the elected officials and community awards one and three who are in the project area quarterly. So we're doing that as well with elected officials and staff, as well as Community board staff and leadership, and then we've committed to do an update in well. This update for community Board one once a quarter as well. So, unfortunately, because of the way that worked out with the Covid-19 paws, we had planned a climate coalition meeting in April, which was to have been followed with a public meeting in May or June. Overall, the contract has I believe four or five large public meetings, of which we will be doing the second in in January, so or excuse me in our next year so Bob to your point. Unfortunately, the it the timing sort of it was. It was bad timing in terms of when we were forced to pause the project and now we're getting back up to speed. But you know we do intend on continuing to do the same amount of work before the end of this administration. So that said, we probably are going to do at least three large public meetings next year. In addition to all of those additional touch points, and then last but not least, we're you know recognizing that the you know in person and other traditional forms of engagement are not viable right now and may not be viable for some time. We're also going to be rolling out a new website in the next month, which, like I, mentioned before it's really important to us that it's not just a one way flow of information us to the public, but rather that there are clear and transparent opportunities for the public to leave comments there, whether it be you know, an exchange of questions and answers with the engineering team and for individual members of the public to see what other members of the public are thinking. So we should be rolling that website out in the next month and then probably will have three large public meetings in addition to the one that we talked about or early next year, we'll have three of those, at least throughout the course of 2021. and I thought we would love to hear. We would love to continue to hear any feedback in terms of ways we could be reaching more or different audiences, Et cetera, hey Bob. Before you go with your follow-up, let me just get to Wendy first, if another one will come back to you. Okay, I just wanted to I just want to make a statement here, and that is that these large public meetings are. This is one of the most impactful things that's going to happen downtown into the next into the next decades, and so I think that we need a lot more input. The number of ways in which this is going to influence everyone's lives down here is unimaginable and also the amount of the city is really changing a lot and really not sure of what kind of city we're going to have so which direction this goes in is a really important. Lots of really important issues are raised and a few meetings kind of coming up, we'll just get bulldozed under that and I, do not think that's really enough or even close to fair. So that's my comment. Okay! Well, thank you. Bob, we'll take that into account and I think we're continuing to look for ways to be to be as inclusive as inclusive as possible. There's something that we're working on right now, just to note really quickly that I mentioned earlier, which is you know, there's always so much information. We always have like how can we, possibly in one meeting to your point, update on the transportation part, the Maritime ecology, part, the environment part, the climate part, the open space part so over the next I think, three or four months we are working on an idea right now to break those down into some smaller bite-sized workshops, so to have one topic specifically talking about what could this you know the? What does this project? What is this project looking at in regard to maritime ecology or historic preservation, for example? So we are, you know, understanding that, like you said this project is the scope of this project is quite large and talks about a number of different subject areas. We are looking for ways in addition to those larger meetings that I discussed, which is sort of opportunities to get a holistic update and ask any number of questions. We are looking for ways to sort of like separate the subject areas out so that people can get more involved and give input where they, where they're most interested or curious yes, I just wanted to, and thanks for the presentation, I just wanted to see how closely you're working we're going to have a meeting later on this month with rebuild by design and I. Keep coming back to my dream project, which I know is a far thing out there, especially with the financial crisis, but it was always going to be a public park, private partnership plus pool which has built so many great relationships with water keepers and river keepers, and you know all the other non-profits, and you know they certainly have worked closely with you know their projects in terms of river quality and their great education outreach. But how much are you partnering with the rebuild by design folks and the plus pool folks, and the I mean there's a lot of other non-profits out there? That are, you know, talk about community engagement, that's really what they do all the time right and so I might tag you in Jordan. Here as well, hi wendy, it's nice to hear from you so yeah, it's a it's a great point and I can actually I might defer to Jordan in regard to the rebuild by design part on the plus pool piece and Diana recently asked me for an update on this, which I have not yet provided to her. Admittedly, so I owe you all that, but yeah I mean wendy I. Think it's really important. You know we hear a clear cry from Community Ward one as well as others throughout the city, for you know where we can provide additional green space, additional open space, additional community space, etc. I think you know I do want to emphasize that at the core of this project is to Bob's point. You know: how can we implement resiliency infrastructure to protect this neighborhood in a way that is implementable quickly? You know diligently, but you know in the relatively near short to medium term, so I think with that at its heart. I do think that the you know the discussions of of recreation and what other possible public benefits we could see as part of it, water, cleanliness and drainage, etc. We are definitely looking at all of that in terms of having consultants on board to do the you know, surveys of the urban design, kind of work of the recreation benefits kind of work, but I do think that we are going to be getting more into that wendy as we get into next spring, because you know the core of the work right now is focused on that resilience piece, but definitely want to keep that conversation going and appreciate you chiming in on that Jordan. Would you like to speak really quickly as to how we yeah and are you going to participate in the rebuild by design meeting that's coming up later on this month? Yes, so I can take both of those. So yes, Janie Bavishi, our director is joining. For that conversation, my understanding is kind of an overview. You know some of the information we're talking about tonight, but you know very clearly giving the city-wide perspective as well so yeah we're so we're part conversation and generally, you know we stay very tight with rebuild by design. You know there are kind of fewer advocates in this space than you would imagine. You know kind of the in the sustainability world there's certainly a lot of organizations in the resiliency space. There are not as many you know, they were. You know very instrumental in helping to pass the restore mother. Nature bond act. I. Imagine a number of you are familiar with that. Unfortunately, because of you know, the state's budget issues was pulled off the ballot and so we're not going to be able to vote on, but you know very clearly, you know a very instrumental organization and rallying folks towards funding. You know a number of these projects because we know that the need does not stop here that that truly this is a crisis that is, you know, city-wide statewide. You know something that we have to face across the country. Yes, I see. No new questions from CB1 I see one question from the general public. Bob want one more shot. Well, I'm happy with what I said. I think that I would like I'm interested whether you're interested in interaction with these agencies, because you know, if you could you even name another project that has so much influence over downtown? Is this one? It's really a very major thing and at a point where the city really does not have money, it's really a sacrifice, and this requires even methodologies for extremely tough choices, about how we're going to spend money and how we're going to finances a large city just really major projects. So you know I mean I'm just the infrastructure problems we have without Covid-19 that we have without resiliency, are tremendous, but add to that the tremendous challenges of storm surge and these kinds of projects you just kind of go wow, do not you want to do not you want a piece of the action of kind of helping to direct those or being able to draw the public in to at least at least not be unconscious. As these things go on. Are you asking you oh yeah, I'm furious about it. I think the extension project is well my personal opinions, I'm not going here right now, I think I'm very concerned about how that's going to be zoned, as I mentioned earlier, I'm concerned about who's interested in it and who wants to spend money on developing it. That's a huge concern to me: I think everyone. This call knows that I've developed I've personally developed over three gigawatts of renewable energy. I'm obviously committed to the cause, but I have real concerns about how this can be developed. I have real concerns about governor's, island and I. Think these are two massive projects that we have to keep an eye on, I'm just trying to move the meeting forward, so we do not approach nine o'clock. All I'm saying and I want your agreement on. Is that one or two meetings that are kind of big giant gigantic public meetings are not enough to even get into the into a feel of direction and that, in the same way that you and I feel strongly about this, that people would not be on resiliency committees if they did not care about this and that everyone cares and wants to say, and we want others to have a say and the kind of the kind of nice thing called the community open house really is not a learning or really input kind of opportunity. From my point of view at all, because nothing ever changes. Yeah I agree with that. I asked my question and my position on this yeah bob you and I are in alignment again as acting chair for the evening. I'm just trying to move the meeting along I personally, removing myself from the acting chair role. I think there should be special committees for both governors, island and the extension, and that we should just focus on those issues alone, including a special committee on removing major roadways, which is a concern of mine as well. But again, my concern is not letting a meeting go late into the night. At this point, oh moving it back over to will you know you can see that we really care about this stuff and that's really there's a there's, a tremendous stakeholdership involved in this, and if we fail to have a voice in this, what are we here for and so I mean. From my point of view, this is an existential question, because everyone's life is on the line with Covid-19 everywhere every day anyway, nothing, you said absolutely and I think you know I do want to you know there are with the sort of various commitments to meetings that we've had I think you know there are dozens and dozens of conversations that go well beyond the three large public meetings and I. Think at that public open house that we had before with the 300 attendees, and all that you know there were there was an opportunity to get the you know. I think 20 members, at least of the project team in the room- and you know somebody from the public who wanted to talk about drainage infrastructure- could spend that time, and you know talk to that engineering consultant for 30 or 40 minutes and leave a lot of feedback behind, but Bob I totally hear you I mean I think it is. It is hard for all of us frankly to grasp the size of this and I think you know any recommendations along the way as to how you know how we can best interface with the community board. I think and the broader public is really important to us. I do want to also highlight that the that the climate coalition group is co-chaired by Tammy, Meltzer, Alice and wendy as well as Patrick Cannell, are all members of that group. We also have I think Michael Kramer is here tonight. Michael Kramer is in that group. So you know there are sort of multiple touch points and multiple levels of stakeholder engagement here and I. Think it's really key and I do also want to be clear. You know during the arc of this project we are going to be we're going to be proposing a project and an implementable first phase project by the end of this administration, but we're also not going through environmental review. Nor are we going through et cetera, so you know this is really sort of the ideas and the brainstorming in the big ideas phase. We do want something, that's implementable and does not just go on the shelf like another report, because we do need to obviously implement this urgently, but you know, in addition to the the work that we're doing now. There are obviously all of the formal procedures in place that you know we would all expect from from a large land use project. So let's keep that conversation going and I appreciate that. Obviously it's always good to hear that people want to be more engaged with these projects. Hey well just one personal note for me: I would love to be involved with that climate committee. I worked in renewable energy, I'm also on vice President Biden's policy committee for energy, so I would love to serve. If you would have me great yeah, let's have a conversation: yep, okay, Jocelyn you've been waiting patiently, go ahead, Diana she's on the phone, if you're going to meet her. Oh I'm sorry that was from much earlier when will was asking if Elijah I would jump in for the presentation when I was on mute. So thank you, hey, Jocelyn, hello, okay, so hearing no other questions from the public or for the board, are we ready to move on great? Thank you. Will this has been comprehensive? Informative I really appreciate you being as transparent, especially with my hard question as you've been we expect on going. Yes, we expect to ongoing engagement and I'm looking forward to hearing what you guys have next great. Let's talk. Let's talk soon, thanks so much everybody nice to see everyone. Thank you. Take care of yourselves bye! Thank you! Okay. Finally, on the agenda, we have a night I think you're going to have to leave this one, but we have a capital expense budget items for Fy22 Diana. Did you just want to entertain some thoughts on this without getting too far down a rabbit hole or what yeah that's exactly right and this kind of culminates at the end of this month at the executive committee meeting and then the full board meeting? This is our annual discussion and voting on capital and expense budget priorities. It's been all the on all the committee agendas for the last two months. Maybe two weeks ago, I sent the committee a special email resending, what lucian sent in August there's a dedicated community board webpage with a bunch of information on this process, but the next step or if alice, were here. The next step would be to discuss any new, any new ideas or a change in what was there, and you know, alice kind of takes that under consideration and brings it to the executive committee. So if anybody has any particular ideas now that they want to discuss, I'm happy to hear them and pass them along to alice, otherwise I think everybody should feel free to email, their thoughts to alice and- and we can- you know- have that discussion at Executive Committee this month. Look at that I see. No him bob your hand is still up. Did you want to talk about this, or it was not just still up your muted I just wanted to mention one thing: that's been important to me for a while, and that is we are CB1 and our border goes all the way to the end of up to canal street from Stuyvesant high school, and so that is not where the city's need to protect things ends. So I would like to encourage that we stand behind building something from slivers in high school north and then trying to find ways to interest the city and protecting whatever needs protection along the West side of the island, because you know just to stop at stop at North. Moore Street really is not far enough, even if, even if there are administrative constraints, that kind of lead us in that direction. So I would like to add at least some budget item that looks at least reaching our own border at Canal Street, even though that is not where we should stop our interest, but we are responsible for that and we should really see that through in terms of resiliency. So I would like to add that, as an item to the capital budget list, that's great I think that's a matter of putting a little more detail into what we already have I know for years. We've had both short-term and long-term requests for capital funding for resiliency projects. So if it does not already stipulate that comprehensive component I think that's something great to consider, adding I agree with that and I would emphasize- or at least mention in it a point that Bob alluded to that for it to be meaningful, it needs to link up with protections north of Canal Street, since Canal is itself kind of in a valley, so won't do any good to end right there. But presumably people above us want to have a project, and we should link up with that great right and I'm sure you know we can put that into the context of that. You know that we lost the army corps of Engineer Project. So that's the thing that has to be with the detail that you know better than anyone. Diana in terms of all those points are good, but the big other point is without the Army Corps of Engineer, which was supposed to handle that everything north of Stuyvesant. You know it's a it's, certainly a city and a state issue, but it's also a federal issue. So you know that's at least where the direction was supposed to be coming from the tri-state study that was taking place so I do not know. If, in your notes, you can reference that we lost that tri-state study yep and that we need to have something more specific, that's just state-led to protect temporarily with you know, Hasco barriers or whatever it is in Hudson River park, which will be ugly, but we need something or whatever it's going to be, and, of course, what Bob's alluding to, which is the long-term real protection on the whole West side. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else all right, I just have one question about the process. I've always been interested in looking at all the wonderful design, that's happening in Battery Park city and with the Bc Bpca has worked on. I'm really interested in whether or not it's appropriate to think about simplified barrier designs that can be executed very inexpensively and kind of built in these kinds of things. Can we suggest that there be an investment in design and engineering of simplified barriers that can kind of be built out in our own community and also used in other places across the city and they'd, be a real interest of simplification, a real focus of both simple simplification and economics so that they can be easily implemented and cheaply built, but are very highly effective and just fit the needs that we have in lower Manhattan and meet wendy's requirement that they're all manufactured in New York Bob? Are you talking about short-term protection? I'm talking about the kinds of barriers to what there's one kind of barrier that was in the battery Park city project that was going to go north along the West side highway there and that had some little sections and I could see those same little sections being applied, possibly in Wagner park, for example. But then they could be. Then you could actually use that you could use them instead of something bigger along the battery park itself, rather than kind of take out all those all those bike paths and things to actually simplify that with just a line of these kinds of barriers that can kind of move up and down, but that would be easily implementable for us and anywhere you needed them, and so they would be echo barriers or of a certain height. This is of the this is this is in the range of between where Hesco ends and say 12, feet or maybe even higher. It depends on what's engine, what is possible in the engineering. Well, as Bob knows, I've mentioned many times that this is a if anyone has a it's a growth industry. If companies can come up with flip up barriers and other things it you know, it should not just be the dutch that are known for their barriers. We, you know we could figure it out too. We have so many great engineering schools in the state of New, York and Bob I gave up and get you gave up on New York, but you know sit in at least in the tri-state region versus Texas. Well, I'm not giving up on New York and if there's ever a time we need some industry, it's going to be coming up. Yeah no I did not mean I'd, give up on New York, it's a bad quote, but to say they need to so what Gwen, Dawson and other people said about buying flip up barriers that will be permanent is that they also need to in order to contract with the city. They need to have a record of past success. That's why it's so hard for the city to contract with startups. So if we put in there something like to the city and state could build up, you know these engineering designs and taking some risks and chances with startup entities for this. The hardest part is that you know they have to they have to contract with these big companies that have a proven track record, and this is you know, we're in new territory. Here to your point, Bob well, I. Think it's important to I think that this should become an innovative city, an innovative society again, so the impetus is always toward new design, new engineering, new discoveries and then making all that work. I mean to some extent. This is the discussion we'll have on the eis. Now that there's going to be an eis on the battery park city things, because that's fundamentally in an an alternative analysis, is a key component of that. So the only reason I mentioned this is to see whether or not Diana thought this was an appropriate kind and style of project for fitting on to that list. Well, it depends if I think there's a renewed focus on self-reliance for the city in the state. We've seen a lot of that with various manufacturing throughout Covid-19. It depends on how it's worded, if the board is open to supporting you know as an expense, a study of certain things or you know, capital funding for resiliency is so tight. We need a lot of capital money for infrastructure, but if it's worded in a way, you know to support to support that as an industry in New, York, City or as a specific type of infrastructure. You know we can incorporate it into a request that we already have or or create a new one I'll. You know, I can't tell you definitively, that's not at my discretion, but I'll include it in my notes to alice for sure. Thank you, you're. Welcome with that, and hopefully with no other questions. I was proud to serve as your temporary chair tonight. I hope it was kitchen I, hope, I was efficient. I hope you I got you all back to your families tonight. These all are all important issues that I'm extremely interested in and I would encourage the actual chairs to, and hopefully the chair of, the board Tammy to commission, as I said to Bob special groups to keep an eye on both the Resiliency, Project and governor's island. Two issues, I think are very important to us, but with that I'd like to Adjourn sounds good night thanks. Everyone.
