I am your host and step in my chair for tonight, due to some unforeseen circumstances, so I think we're going to start the meeting off tonight with a review on 250 water street and the brownfield Glam program with Laura Dodge, who I'm informed is here and ready to go.
We discussed the fact that the agencies are still working their way through all of the results, because there are so many data points that came in after the last several rounds of investigation.
So I think the agencies are requesting some additional figures from Langan and HHC to try to help with that process so that it will be a little clearer as to whether everything has been defined satisfactorily to the point where a conclusion can be made regarding whether the RI is in fact complete for all media, meaning for soil for vapor for groundwater, and they do not know exactly how long that process will take.
This point, I think they've made some requests and some new requests, perhaps last week or possibly today, and so I'm not 100 sure how long the process will continue to take, because Langan will need to speak to HHC and come back with the requested information or with a response regarding you know their take on the request, but we're getting close to having a determination as to whether or not there needs to be any additional investigation at this point or whether conclusions can be drawn sufficiently so that the RI can be deemed complete and a proposal for the next phase of work, which would be the remediation and a remedial action work plan can be designed.
So the only other piece I guess is that we talked about you know whether or not there needs to be any test pit work done, because that is part of what's mentioned in the revised remedial investigation work plan.
If, it's going to be a matter of weeks or possibly a little longer, because you know the DC and DOH have to have the discussion with Langan and HHC.
For you know a little bit of a additional work to sort of help.
Our work scope goes through the issuance of the draft Remedial investigation report, which will be the document that will be generated after this and then also the final remedial investigation, report, which we obviously would just review to ensure that the draft changes were reflected as anticipated, so that process will be similar to what we did with the remedial investigation work plan, where we reviewed a draft provided comments and had discussions with langan and HHC, and then the agencies.
I mean it is a lot of work to reduce all that data and to put a report together, but I believe they likely have been working on it for a while now getting all the pieces that they could before.
So again, I'm, not a geotechnical engineer, so I do not really want to speak to that, but all of these details will come together when the remedial action work plan is prepared, because the intention would be to integrate the remediation into the redevelopment.
Is, for you know our concern whether or not there needs to be any additional investigation relative to air quality, as you would correlate the air quality from the RI, which was really not nothing to speak of with respect to mercury, just no air ambient air quality issues, just occasional detections of mercury when they were screening, the cores.
I, think is something that will be discussed in the RI report, because that's kind of one of the points is trying to correlate where debris was identified, where the geophysical survey found the footprints and remnants of structures and then, where the soil and groundwater investigation would have pointed to anything.
You know maybe a little bit of a different representation of it in a manner that might be easier for everybody to get their arms around and DEC and DOH still have to do their final assessment of how they feel everything looks so we're going to reserve judgment until they have their say in it.
Well, in the areas where you hit refusal, I think they you know they make a judgment as to whether or not there would need to be any additional investigation vertically, based on the data around those boring, locations.
The analysis that was conducted was a speciation analysis, which is a specialized analysis to look at the form of mercury that was reported in the soil samples and they adhered to the remedial investigation, work plan and the data.
You know the depths of how deep they will be digging a foundation and that sort of thing that will all be part of how you're thinking about the work plan.
Well I, know that the intent you know from in the remedial investigation, Work, Plan, Langan and Hht state that the intent is to integrate the remediation into the redevelopment, to the extent that they're going to lay out what depth they have to excavate for redevelopment, purposes.
The fact that they did do the geotechnical investigation already sort of suggests that they're looking to see if that would be possible to do, but I'm, not sure how far ahead that design element will be before they actually generate the remedial election work.
You can either have a remedial action work plan that focuses on what you need to do for remediation and talks more generally about how it's going to be integrated into redevelopment.
You know, joined by our friends across a number of agencies, folks from emergency management, City's economic Development, Corporation, Battery, Park, City, authority.
You know we certainly work with a number of our other agencies, including DOT, and many others, we're also joined by Mary Kimball from ARCADIS.
I want to give a quick, update, just sort of on kind of the overall status of the of the city operated projects, not to speak for the Battery Park city authorities, projects which they will catch on.
The capital projects were in construction at the time, but you know this was a chance for EDC and for the other city agencies that are implementing capital projects to sort of pause, the work that was being done both on the capital projects that were in construction and on work that was sort of in design and along the way.
As you know, obviously, as Coronavirus, has slowed down at least to New York City of Sort, of what the short to medium term impact on the cities and on Edc's finances will be.
It has been so you know, since the budget passed for the fiscal year, 21 beginning on July 1st, we've been working closely with city Hall and OMB to sort of unpause projects as best as we can, and as often as we can you know.
It is just a matter of current cash flow and OMB, asking various city agencies to sort of pause and kind of hold on in terms of in terms of restarting these projects, so we'll get into that a little bit more, but I wanted to make sure to give that background on the city and Edc's fiscal situation as a result of these projects, and we can come back to that that topic at any point within the conversation.
We looked at kind of all the latest engineering available and the sort of coastal resiliency tools that we have at our disposal: flood walls, deployable, barriers, raising streets, hardening buildings and looked block by block to see what might be possible in this neighborhood and as part of the announcement, we were able to unveil about 500 million dollars worth of on land capital projects, and so you know, looking at the map, that's working in two bridges.
We were also able to announce that for the financial district in Seaport, where we looked at on land capital projects that we were unable to find a project that the solutions were not deemed viable, and certainly we can kind of get into a discussion later on that piece, but that next phase of work was necessary to look at in-water options, specifically for that neighborhood to protect against surge sea level rise and increased precipitation.
You, know first of its kind, comprehensive risk assessment, looking well into the future, but that, but that all built on top of significant work, that this community has been involved in and helped to support and further.
It continued to develop and move west until it became a category one hurricane on July 30th and was forecast to move up the coast with potential impacts to New York City, the timing for zero hour or the arrival of tropical storm.
So, following the coastal storm steering committee call the Internal Nysem IFPM team discussed the models and options for an activation, and we reached out to our local, just-in-time, vendor tully construction, letting them know that Isaias might impact the city and we discuss the timing and the actions that would be needed.
These are conversations designed to gather a wide perspective and information across all aspects of the deployment we're still in the process of analyzing and organizing that information and feedback for isaias, but we'd like to share some of those achievements and items for future consideration with you as the most public and heavily trafficked site.
We always had talked about only doing this in the event of an evacuation, but this limited impact that was predicted really only called for you know us to protect the site and not really call for the evacuation across the city, but it did bring complications and we are looking those very closely to see what we can do.
And, it's absolutely necessary, but we do want to try to be mindful and think about if we can do this in a way that has a less impact on the community.
As most of you know, we have been working with our engineering team to look at South Street Seaport, to evaluate alternative measures in the hopes that we could find a just-in-time measure that might be more efficient, cutting the time we need to deploy and also with less impact to the community, as well as mitigating the everyday presence of the current measures.
The alignment, I think that will gave us a very clear picture of how Covid-19 has impacted the city, agencies and programs and IFPM is no different.
We are funded each year prior to the onset of the Covid-19 emergency in New, York City IFPM had made its budget presentation to the city and fully expected to receive continued funding for the remaining analysis and possibly potential designs.
It's also noted that the long-term capital projects are in flux and it's extremely important that we, you know design and have our timelines for IFPM tie into the engineering for those sites as well and be able to work around those plans.
In, the financial district and Seaport, we were unable to find an on land, a capital project and so have started to advance a study looking at in-water protection for the neighborhood.
Is there a scenario where we, you know we're going kind of all the way out across the project area, but just really to give you a sense of you know where we're looking at and the extent of the study area by 2021.
You know we will be looking at kind of new models that help to support these efforts.
I've, been working on coastal resiliency and waterfront planning projects in New, York City for about a decade.
To make sure we understand the opportunities and constraints looking across the board at the coastal defense potential alignments, the drainage, system, transportation and maritime infrastructure, ecology, urban design ideas, as well as the funding and financing pathways.
You know be working on on all's name to move forward and meet the overall project.
So we've been working on developing our evaluation framework to understand how we'll set up sort of that criteria that we'll be using to evaluate options been doing the hydrodynamic modeling as well as interior, drainage, modeling, and then really looking across all those project.
And I think you know one of the biggest things that we're looking to beginning to kind of tease out over the next few months and into next summer is like looking at the looking at the very real alternatives.
And I mean those sort of trade-offs and decision-making that we'll have to go through to figure out, like Mary, said with all of these various work streams, as well as the sort of question of financing for this project and what is actually implementable.
You know a few events to be spoken for earlier this year, but we're really looking forward to the second meeting of the climate coalition, which is our sort of small stakeholder group which generally we're meeting with them in advance and meeting with the public.
We would love for everybody to be able to see that you know showing what it would look like to stand at the corner of Wall Street and South Street if the city, and if we all do nothing about climate change.
Have those you know, touch points directly having the public interact with the engineers who are doing this work for us.
And I think we want to continue to sort of engage with the public in a way that allows this feedback to flow.
So, as we continue to think about pivoting from in person to Online engagement, we're going to be releasing a engagement, tool, a new website here in the next month or two, which will really provide not just information out to the public, but really provide a way for those two-way conversations to happen with you, know, sort of like ask an expert, feature, commenting features, you know, sort of place-based, individual comments on the project, you, etc.
You know we want to together, come up with something that is able to be implemented and able to be funded, and then we also just talked about sort of down the road.
We talked about the need to handle drainage capacity issues in lower Manhattan, and you know making this something: that's accessible to the neighborhood and sort of respects.
We frankly can't do a project that is so big and important just alone and sort of in a silo, so I think in terms of connecting with all of our different agencies, both at the city, level, state and federal levels.
There is a lot of sort of regulatory framework in place that we need to to work together, with, but you know, there's also a lot of chances.
We were just about to come out to Community Board one and to the public regarding sort of the first touch points with designing and brainstorming around this project.
Right now, I'll go through a little bit more of the schedule expectations as we move along on the slides here, the North Battery Park City project.
That project is that, in the spring of this year, Battery Park City Authority received design, build authority from the state, and we spent quite a bit of time really looking very closely at how we might utilize that authority to the benefit of our projects.
Coming to this committee, as mentioned before, a lot of work on Fidei Seaport, including the interactive community, Portal that we're hoping to roll out next month, the Brooklyn bridge, montgomery project outside of this.
Think you know, what's important to remember here is that this is a resilience first, project.
You know all options on the table in terms of creative financing and creative ways to get this thing built because we do need to protect lower Manhattan.
You know sooner rather than later, and that is something I think that we are going to be looking at, but as we get into the sort of preliminary options with the public, probably you know sort of in the spring of next year.
Necessarily with you know, with with a project that is expensive, enough, but I think you know we're looking at what is actually able to be permitted under the current regime.
If diane or whoever's behind the controls would not mind saying get out the original lmcr report from from March 2019, which has sort of some of the things that we looked at but like Mary, said and we'll continue to have this conversation with the public as well as the regulatory agencies.
It's really important to us that it's not just a one way flow of information us to the public, but rather that there are clear and transparent opportunities for the public to leave comments there, whether it be you know, an exchange of questions and answers with the engineering team and for individual members of the public to see what other members of the public are thinking.
There's, something that we're working on right, now, just to note really quickly that I mentioned earlier, which is you know, there's always so much information.
We always have like how can we, possibly in one meeting to your point, update on the transportation part, the Maritime ecology, part, the environment part, the climate part, the open space part so over the next I think, three or four months.
We are looking for ways in addition to those larger meetings that I discussed, which is sort of opportunities to get a holistic update and ask any number of questions.
Coming back to my dream, project, which I know is a far thing out there, especially with the financial crisis, but it was always going to be a public park, private partnership plus pool which has built so many great relationships with water keepers and river keepers, and you know all the other non-profits.
I. Think you know, I do want to emphasize that at the core of this project is to Bob's point.
We are definitely looking at all of that in terms of having consultants on board to do the you know, surveys of the urban design, kind of work of the recreation benefits kind of work, but I do think that we are going to be getting more into that wendy as we get into next spring, because you know the core of the work right now is focused on that resilience, piece, but definitely want to keep that conversation going and appreciate you chiming in on that Jordan.
I think that I would like I'm interested whether you're interested in interaction with these agencies, because you know, if you could you even name another project that has so much influence over downtown.
We do want something, that's implementable and does not just go on the shelf like another report, because we do need to obviously implement this urgently, but you know, in addition to the the work that we're doing now.
I think that's a matter of putting a little more detail into what we already have I know for years.
I've always been interested in looking at all the wonderful design, that's happening in Battery Park city and with the Bc Bpca has worked.
If we put in there something like to the city and state could build up, you know these engineering designs and taking some risks and chances with startup entities for this.
