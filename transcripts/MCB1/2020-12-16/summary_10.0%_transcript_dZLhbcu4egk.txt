This is one of the capital projects to keep going forward, and so what I'm going to do tonight is give you a status report of that construction, but also talk a little bit about the conditions in the park and the sense of where is the battery conservancy, which is totally a non-profit and is dependent on private gifts to run this park.
We really want children to have an accumule accumulative science experience as they move through the park from coming to the urban farm, going on a ride on c-class.
Some will have back some won't and then the tree houses that it flows into all surrounded by gardens, and many of these areas are for water retention and like little mini creeks and as the architects on the project said, The most fun time to be here is after a big rainstorm, because the way the water moves through the space is very much a part of this environment.
Any of you were in Madison Square car part for the Taraceta Fernandez art project, which were all these mirrored elements and a wonderful channeled feeling through the park, these kind of aren't, You know inspired, but these are very organic kind of bean shaped elements that will give us the shade we want and.
But, As we see you know, their everything is closed for the winter, which is normal, where we saw a lot of overuse and kind of owners that weren't maintaining their dogs in a good way was in the labyrinth and in the forest farm is our edible farm and we do classes there with students.
I, don't know if it's, because these are right on the border of battery park, city.
And, it made a little bit more convenient to just stop off and then go back to the southern part of battery park, city or what, but we have seen a devastation here that we've never seen before, and it's kind of beyond repair.
This point we are going to do our best, but I also want to let you know we do not have the resources we had over the last 10:20 years.
We have maintained this park, but I'm coming to you tonight to ask you to be a partner in helping us maintain, but also think about ways.
The other is communicating with all dog owners the need to respect fragile landscapes and that you know that to stay on a hard surface and get a good walk and a lot of good exercise is profitable.
We would like to make the forest farm labyrinth gardener a dog-free, zone, There I know in battery park.
There are various dog-free zones, but we would like to make this area because of the edible garden as well as knowing the scale of it, makes it very inappropriate for overuse and in by too many dogs.
We have no agreement with the city to do this work and receive funding and, as you know, We do everything in the park.
Think the quality that we've set by the way this park has been transformed over the last 27 years is testament to what our hopes are for it going forward.
By coincidence, The community board last month met with the person who helps us do outreach to try to attract volunteers to our local parks.
We are going to work with parks to try to publicize the need for volunteers to get involved in helping their neighborhood parks.
I. Think, most dog people, haven't, you know.
I, don't know the battery Park City, Dog, Association and.
Obliged to you know make this something that is not about just a non-profit and a partner with parks, but really that we are part of this community and when we design things we're thinking about programming, what can serve the community.
It becomes a collaboration of work to keep the park in the best prop possible condition, and this is something we believe will help us be able to maintain this for the children to be able to continue to use it as the edible farm and for people that need a quiet place of walking.
Okay, so I was a volunteer at battery park city for about 15 years, as a gardener, I haven't seen anything out, there.
I think you have to distribute something also as well find places where you can put posters up or whatever, but you know, I'm, ready and willing and able to volunteer once again for garden.
I have this idea that it should be actually a sandwich board, as people are walking around and especially during the you know.
What's, going to happen with our great city and our in our parks and that type of thing.
You know volunteering at the park on the up on the update, because I think those are people who are already you know community and civically engaged, and so it might find a good audience to try to get the participation.
I know nothing about dogs, but it might be something that is worthy of you know having a resolution, but I was just going to take advantage of the moment, and this may not be the right moment, but at some point it would be really helpful to know and get an update on some of the other critical aspects of the battery.
What's going on in terms of the resiliency plans, pure a I, think you might you know, there's we've heard things you know.
Many years ago, so I immediately called the National Park Service and said: hey, you know, you're.
I know the park service is interested in education, doing more in the building for education, for some sense of understanding, All the other parks we have in New York state that are heritage.
So I think if we can come up with a creative way of utilizing the space for the community as well as for a you know that there would be some money coming to the authority.
Our new Chairman Frank Bisignano is incredibly believes in the history of the site and thinking of the castle bringing a national board because it is like Ellis.
It was before Ellis and there are more people that can trace their ancestors back to Castle Garden than Dallas, because it was predated them, so he's very enthused about building a national board for the castle and working with you know, We already have a partnership with the National Park Service.
It's kind of exciting, because I've always only designed knowing how we were going to use the space.
And, he said he's the new secretary of the downtown dog NYC group, and he just wanted to let us know.
So, For the last two years, we've been working with a team of collaborators which you know the different companies and organizations are up on the screen right.
You know we see our role as architects as kind of making the space as proposing and finding the space for this park and how that space is used.
Then third, We are very interested in adding people to our team who have expertise complementary to our own, so we'd like to collaborate with others who have expertise, working with city, agencies, building and operating non-profits, and developing funding and operational feasibility models for the park and the surrounding areas.
This is the location, the determinant of the Holland tunnel entrance to Manhattan in New York City in the early 19th century, the space was a park.
You know, as it is more or less and then excavates below it in order to create that connective space that allows you to move from one street across the park to the next street.
You know everybody to get kind of get right up against the not unlike what the park that we were just seeing in the battery, which is beautiful.
So here again, is the you know, close-up of how you get down into the park, and you can kind of see all these components.
You find yourself in a colonnade which is just like an open air circulation space where you can, you know, have refuge from the weather.
We saw it as an open air breezeway like this, and as for the park, itself, is reminiscent of Rockefeller Center, where you have it's kind of a an activity.
That would show how the unique way that the new walls of the rotary can and frame kind of give you a special view of the city, so we'd like to talk you through the parts that make up the proposal.
We think that these parts will be programmed kind of uniquely in different ways for each one, But this is an idea for kind of a hard, A hardscape, piazza, park.
So right now we're just collaborating with this one school, but we hope to expand the collaboration to many more schools in the area, and this is just a picture of the kids up on the pedestrian bridge, Looking down at the center of the site kind of dreaming about the big possible playground that could be there, one day.
Okay, So we're going to run you quickly through a couple of technical aspects of the project, very preliminary, but just want to kind of let you know one of the couple of things we've been working on and that we see is kind of potential avenues for the project.
So what's interesting, is that the site actually is on a kind of peninsula right here in the middle of this flooding, and the question is, as we excavate, is there a potential to somehow serve the surrounding community as a way to help manage that water.
So, the you know, the walls, the sidewalk parks, the kind of sloped parks, the Central park, the interior spaces.
Over the course of the two years that we've been working on this project, We have run through many programming possibilities, and you know.
So again, thinking through these are just created, Some visuals to I don't know help the process along.
That's meant to show that, if there's something kind of large scale, whether you know annual or seasonal or monthly, or all the time happening in the center, that you still have space to circulate around and go where you need to go.
This section is showing an idea of having a planted park in the center with a playground and again interior spaces on either side.
You would get interior seating inside and you could use the arcade to do kind of you know indoor outdoor seating, so outdoor seating, that's covered, and then the seating could spill out into the central space where you then are adjacent to something like a playground.
This is a reference of San Marco Piazza in Venice, where you know seating from a restaurant is spilling out into the center into the outside, and this might look like in St, John's park, where we've got the restaurant here, This outdoor seating, spilling out, You, know parents having lunch or coffee, while sitting next to you, know, being able to watch their children play, which we think would be a pretty incredible experience in New, York.
That is because, especially if you're going to create an access point right by the police precinct, You know that's something that they should be involved.
So if you're standing on the street, you view that and actually is quite pretty, but the way you envision this plan, if you're walking, I mean, perhaps you can see the trees right when the weather is nice.
But I think that you're, seeing since you're sinking the park, I think from street level, I think you're not going to have that same view of greenery, like you would the way it currently exists, and that might be something that the neighbors might push back.
Seeing, all the way through to you, know it being clear versus like how much protection do you want from the car.
You, know communicating stair area that goes from the sidewalk down into the park.
You know on in the buildings and get some meeting started where you talk to them about these ideas, because I think it's even more.
Don't know if that's gonna obstruct anything that you're planning on doing well our plan because we're basically creating a way to connect through the park we were.
What you've put into this thus far has been your own time and effort, and you know what you've come forward with an incredible vision, so kudos for your time and energy and addressing what is an absolutely critical need in lower Manhattan, which is just park.
I like when we come at things from you, know, thinking, big and putting forward aggressive or ambitious plans.
You know we have a couple of different people that we've been working with to brainstorm on these ideas, we're on the fence, whether how big we want to go with the ideas.
There is actually very doable and very achievable and works very and really just at least you know, helps the operations of the park, kind of pay for itself, right.
We work with resiliency and the way that we do the structure, The two are related to one another right, because in order to design the structure, you have to understand hydrostatic pressure, which allows you to kind of dig into the available water, and all of that, So the two are very much related and we've been very hesitant to push any of our let's say, partners to that level of design without getting a substantial amount of support, not even just financial, but.
You know kind of moral support right now that I have this feedback from you, guys.
Yeah, like I, mean it's basically like a brand new typology for the city and every engineer that we talked to their brains, just kind of explode with the potential for this thing.
I mean we could start it kind of any time after you know.
So they know about the project, it's being circulated, but we kind of made like a push with them before your guys's meeting in November.
Yeah, so we've yet to hear back anything official from them, but they are, as far as we know, they're talking about it internally, right, now, examples that you used I didn't notice, but were any of them exits to arterial roadways or tunnels or any park that you will use examples of that.
It's different in the sense that it's kind of on the outskirt of town, whereas this is like right kind of in the center of a you, know major urban metropolitan area.
The space can be used in some way, but not specific to this, And, I, hope we, You know board members individually, wanted want to do it, but as collective as a community board and as a committee.
Yeah, We see benches as being you know, just like the you know, Washington Square Park in the center, like that space was successful because you can go and sit down and watch people, and that to us is a really important part of this piece.
Finding air trying to find areas in cities that needed to be rehabilitated, And. In particular in school, did a lot of projects like that.
Just curious, You, know, I think it's really critical, that these kinds of ideas come to fruition sometimes and the idea of a park in anywhere in New, York City is a great idea.
So I would absolutely turn this on its head and reconsider the way you want to advertise it as it were, and, frankly, to really look at it with engineers and designers of this kind of sister and idea, because when I saw it I thought oh they're, You know this is brilliant.
You know somebody about the financial modeling, And I think that people have called for some good suggestions that were maybe you're not building up and doing quite as much as aggressively as what you're seeing here, But rather looking at you know, other possible ways to go about.
Agree with mark that we don't know what it is, but that something starts to come from this, So just some thoughts, but I really applaud the resiliency feature and really think that you could really sell it to the city that way.
Resiliency is a good sales pitch, but in the end what we want is a park that could be wonderful, and this looks like it could be with all of the hurdles yet to occur.
You know, building a park.
Okay, So if I could be helpful with the neighbors, because I did live there for 10 years, just let me know.
Cheryl's feedback which has been fantastic, is to spread the word you know, and so that, because we feel like there are people in the neighborhood who can help us define the vision and because, even if we do get the resiliency thing figured out, There still is a programmatic component that needs to be figured out, there's still a weight right, so an opera there's, still maintenance that has to be figured out, there's still funding.
Think again, What we're looking, which is, I, think what I don't know at least I'm hearing is that the community is really interested in something happening in the space, and you know whether and also interested in it providing like resiliency for storm water in the area, and those are all things that were completely 100 behind.
Okay, so could I suggest to the committee and see if there's maybe we could take a straw poll how about a resolution conceptually supporting doing something with this space to turn it into potentially a usable park and a resiliency site for the neighborhood.
The point is that we support the concept of a park and resiliency resource at this location, but before the board can make any definitive or comment on any specific details or any specific proposal for design, etc, that the board would want to see more engagement with the local residents, including something like a town hall event, right.
You, know, people that are working on resiliency and cisterns.
I mean New. So, we'll put that in the resolution, The community board is happy to try to be helpful in spreading the word on this and enabling many more people to get involved and be helpful in on this project.
It would be helpful, though, to specifically state that we want to encourage them to study specific aspects like the resiliency plan further and to come back with us to us with further information so that they have a document to go back to their consultants with to be able to move that forward on their end.
It's, not saying when I mean it's a massive project that will require that at some point, yeah I personally, don't think we need to go deep into a procedural discussion at the moment, but if the group feels strongly I'll back off, I, just.
I mean I think that they would want that kind of ability to start to.
You know, modify the project as, however, They would like for discussions with some of the city.
I mean for the community board to take action on something I think we said we support it, Conceptually I, don't know I Paul.
I, don't know if they're, if that's their preference, either I think we'll take any of that to get all right.
I mean, We I do think that we have taken things a bit as far as we know we're a bit.
It's, like I, think everybody needs to start talking to each other.
Okay, All right I want to thank you guys for coming down and for all the work once again, thanks to the committee and let's try to get through that last item.
We know the battery park is opening in June
