Carolyn Mahoney is taking minutes now, as our secretary or Vice Chair, Alice Blank, and some of our other elected officers like Brittany Wade, who's going to help take votes and roll call.
So, At the start of the pandemic, controller, Springer launched an investigation into the city's preparedness for and response to, Coba 19, with the goal of hopefully learning about what we did and did not do in those early days and weeks, and to keep in mind that we can have better policy outcomes when now, when the second wave comes.
We can respond better as a city, Mr Stringer also wrote an op-ed this week on a topic which I know is close to this board, which is on the about greater transparency and accountability for police misconduct.
Would, you like us to post your report in the chat for people to click on the link, I think we'll go that way, and so we'll move on to Lizzie Lee, which is our representative from Senator Kavanaugh's office.
You know we're continuing to work very closely with quality of life committee and the small business working group.
Lizzy, very much happy thanksgiving if the governor, if the senator does come later in the meeting, just please text lotion and let him know.
So, just quick, things, February, 1st 2021 seems like a long time away, But that's when the community board applications or reapplications are due number two.
I, know we're all working on governor's island, we're all working on South, Street, Seaport.
So first, The congressman has been working on getting two-way split tolling from the with the Verrazano bridge for about 20 years now, and so we're really happy to announce that it's going to start December 1st.
The proposed project by DOT is that okay, yes or I am happy to have you speak when we review it in executive, session.
We want to make sure you all know that council, member Chin has been a strong supporter of the school expansion.
We always want to have the community get the chance to express their concerns and their opinions about any proposed changes to the neighborhood, but with this special project, it's unfortunate that they didn't get enough time to express their concerns.
I will continue to work with CB1 to make sure all these questions got answered and the issues got addressed and I expect to hear from everybody in the next six months about this at least six months.
It's been closed since we opened there in 2013, but, as many of you might know, the Murray Bertram campus is both windowless and doesn't have immediate, accessible outdoor space for our students, So particularly right now, during Covid-19.
So just in general, like opening that space up would really allow us to have some substantial access for outdoor learning in the foreseeable future and just for programming for our students going forward.
I am a long time resident of New, York City and a member of the local group.
Their report just issued to the governor, concluded that safety insurances for 5 g have cloak come into question because of the thousands of peer-reviewed studies documenting deleterious health effects associated with cell phone radiation.
I wanted to thank the trust for governors Island for updating their website and making a lot more transparent, as well as user friendly in regards to the real estate and the south, through zoning and the rfps.
Next, yes, I can oh thank you, Hi, folks, I'm, Roger, Manning, a long time down downtown Manhattan resident and a frequent visitor to governor's island since 2005.
Two quick questions is where to find the actual uniform land use review procedure publication for governors, Island.
I mean the actual wording of it, and the other question is roughly how many people have managed to send in comments regarding governor's island to the community board more stuff.
We will still be accepting public comment through December and all the board members will be able to review that as well before we vote in December, sorry for the public comment, and that has a link to some of the materials for governors.
I said that appropriately I apologize, if I butchered that okay also on the topic of governor's island I, might be at the end of her availability for time.
Let's just stick with that class one homes have caps on the amount of annual increases that the tax can be every year, You know, look at their whole old age if they want to and actually have something that they can know and understand what the costs are going to be from the day they bought it until the day they sell, it, 50 60, 70 years later, or whatever they decide to do differences class two homes in Manhattan.
So, If I'm out of time go and look at my written statement, but the point of it is that this is a something that all people in Manhattan need to come together.
It was a great system that worked to keep our parents in their homes and keep the roofs over their heads for a long time that same benefit and that same consistency of payment and understanding what your costs are going to be as you age and as you grow needs to be in place for condo and co-ops in Manhattan, and it needs to remain the same for class 1, homes.
I can thank you, hi my name's Dylan, I'm, a former resident of 13 Harrison Street, and it's recently come to my attention that there's a proposal to construct an extension onto the roof at this address in Tribeca and I feel that the proposed project is a pretty major threat to the long-standing architectural history and culture in general of the neighborhood, The extension which has been proven by the mock-up.
I know that the rooftop communities and villages that are there and still exist today are really integral to New. And I have countless memories personally of growing up on my own rooftop and learning to garden from family on one side and also forging a pretty strong relationship with our neighbors on the other side and their two sons, Spencer and Thomas, who we're still in contact with.
And I think these buildings are lasting, standing to remind us of New, York, City's history, and these plans disregard that history and culture and threaten the communities founded in the small scale.
Thank you for coming, and thank you for speaking up and with that we're going to go to Jamie Sikorski, who is representing 99 and 101 Warren Street for those who are not at our executive committee.
Last night and then after Jamie were going to carry Davidson thanks, Tammy, I'm, joining on behalf and, as Tammy mentioned in blue of all of the residents of Warren Street and the other community members that have expressed their severe concern surrounding the Amazon cargo.
I just want to thank Tammy and the rest of the exec committee for their time last night and as Susan mentioned at the top of the call, certainly everyone's patience while they heard from quite a few concerned.
So take us home, okay, well, I'll, piggyback on what Jamie was saying, because we have a similar issue with regard to the CitiBike infill and expansion plan and again it's lack of transparency, lack of regard for the Community Board, Transportation, Committee and lack of regard for the community that we all love.
Looks like Cora, has had to go, but I will continue to reach out to them, and I will continue to rely on this group to represent the community in the process of prioritizing how we are using open space in community board, One. That means how we are using curb space.
So I appreciate the time and and on Carrie Stick on don't go anywhere so fast because believe me, you may think the conversation started, maybe in September, but I, think they've been happening way longer than that, and this is not the first time, for example, that Madeleine came from Dwayne Park Patisserie to talk to us about any inequity in sighting of things in equity and approval.
And I really want to thank the staff of the Community Board one office for really supporting us and me and Ej, and the family for allowing us to do this, and also especially Tammy for blocking off and running interference on lots of other things that keep them from landing on my plate.
It's going to be a longer process, but I'll keep trying to push on that also want to report that Dick Bach, who is a housing excerpt expert I, had a conversation with him today and he'll be joining the quality of life committee meeting in December for an open discussion about affordable housing, preservation.
Basically, building off of Tom Goodkind's legacy his work in collecting data and then seeing what best we have to do to take moving forward and trying to get the city and other groups to enforce what affordability is left.
Well, you've heard we have a vote coming up an executive, so I'm going to go over things there with the next patterns and the next steps.
Any physical things, The city does not believe that includes working forward on design, plans.
We have an applicant that will come before us for landmarks for land use issues for SLA, We have applicants that don't come and don't have any community input and yet to do things like cargo bike, areas.
There's, no two-way street I find it rather strange from a mayor who talked about governing from community base up, So we're gonna executive committee for the next couple months with the district manager are going to take on looking on alignment of engagement for the agencies and this kind of goes cross and every single committee, which is why we're going to take an executive.
That's one of the things looking ahead and you can tell we participate in budget the capital program, the district needs which includes ulurp and scoping and seeker, review, etc.
This I, think the language might be in the city charter for this, where regards to community boards, but it's somewhere, and it's states that the city, agencies or others agencies can not be arbitrary and capricious and ignoring our resolutions, even though it's only advisory, but it's advised but can not be dismissed outright or the language.
Take that as a no all right, let's rock and roll, So the next one we're going to in executive committee is the cargo bikes.
We got a letter from commissioner Pinkar, which we shared last night, that I received on the 23rd of this month, saying they're, going to move forward with the cargo bike.
This is about engagement, and we wanted them to bring the applicant to answer questions before installation, because I think it's totally fair.
They believed that the loading dock would have been a better place for them to use and why they couldn't is not something that you know was answered to the satisfaction of the community by DOT or even answered at all by the applicant.
This is why we're voting on this today we will post on the website and in the newsletter, because what we're going to have to do is actual observations for those people who live around or anybody who travels through this has now become, unfortunately, in the purview of and the responsibility of the public to take photos and email them to DOT and CB1.
We can track all and any issues that exist, which include loading on the sidewalks, any delivery trucks, because they're they, if DOT claimed in the letter that there would be no more deliveries either in going or outgoing on the Murray on the Warren Street side of the building.
Words today makes me frustrated when people could run a con on me, like they're, Doing me a favor with some money and of my peers and my friends and my family members who pay the bulk of taxes in the city by the way who are paying for it.
Okay, So let's pass the cargo bike, one as it is, because we've already done our roll call to help Brittany out here and to make our meetings more efficient.
We asked them to come back at executive with a bulk of data because, as was asked to transportation, We wanted to understand what the saturation and usage was and what the master plan for Community Board won, which is something we've asked for several times.
What, we don't want, is the same situation we've been with in the past when it comes to CitiBike, where we have a restaurant tour who has reached out to the community board for help.
I, whether it's a separate resolution, whether it's this resolution is made stronger, it's time to contact all of our officials and said that we can no longer stand dot's manner of operation, So that is going to come up on when we do public engagement in executive committee per Agency, because what we want to do is have it aligned.
So I would like to know specifically where Betty do you remember: Dr k, sorry, I, don't mute; no, they just give the intersection, but again people have to realize they're putting them where cars currently park, they're in a parking lane.
Trucks were at the end of spruce on the corner of gold right, but I think where these bikes look I, don't care either way to be honest, but it's also important people know that there's bikes at the other end of spruce as well.
We can certainly ask and find out, but I just want sure everyone knows what I'm talking about.
Okay, they're, not gonna block any of that, because they know that I mean reasonableness has to apply.
Many of the people who spoke in favor of the resolution don't feel that way, but it kind of comes through that way that this is a nuisance that you know, we've got to make sure.
So, when I'm walking, I hate the cars and bikes when I'm biking, I hate the cars and the pedestrians, and when I'm driving I hit the pedestrians and bikes, that's say, and it is indeed very difficult to cram in all of those different methods of transportation and any kind of sensible, safe or aesthetically pleasing way in the city, but I think I'm going to abstain on this motion.
You have a huge chunk of the street taken up by CitiBikes, like I, said I bike everywhere, but I have my own bike and there's a school now right below at 90 John and the amount of congestion and traffic when school buses come and block the entire road and then honking begins.
Okay, Betty Sorry, to interrupt you, Keep going I just wanted to say.
That gets it to be less pejorative about the sighting, more factual, I'm happy to take them, think it through, and then let me know, but not rewriting the whole thing, because there are concerns that need to be addressed.
S, Let's I like the way you're moving things on Tammy, let's vote or not or vote up or down, and we spoke a lot about it at committees.
We have these conversations, I think it would be really helpful to have a map of our community board area and where the bikes are and then a sense of how many more bikes.
They think we need and a kind of like really analytical presentation of the issue so that we could work with them and kind of like I.
Yes, hopefully on the hospital block, where it's sited, which makes sense because CitiBike is giving the memberships to the people that work there.
Residents reported as well as the one about suggesting that you put bike lanes wherever you have CitiBike docks, because although I certainly like bike, lanes, I do drive a car and ride in a taxi from time to time, and I'm, not sure that I want every single street to have a bike lane that happens to have a CitiBike dock on it.
I think it's supporting the business to have a CitiBike thing, nearby, not in front that prevents them from being able to have sidewalk seating, which is a throwback to what has been happening on Duane Street right, because if they can't open their restaurant because they can't go onto the sidewalk, they can't have any business.
We all know that the people who come to meetings are the ones who object to something, not the ones who favor something, and there may be just as many residents who favor it and for the very reason that it's conveniently located.
I'm, okay with prefer, because we have you know instead of objected to, we prefer, if you say certain residents, subjected or something like that.
Ask that's part of the discussion we're going to have, but if we're talking about what some residents prefer or don't prefer, then I think it might help to quantify the just the group if it takes two sentences.
All right, why don't I suggest we just vote on the resolution, but also I wanted to remind everybody that Joe made a motion.
As noted after the presentation, It was widely discussed and determined that a new resolution was not coming through executive that they would make a friendly amendment to the one that comes to landmarks and with that done, and thank you so much.
We essentially want to be able to leverage the giant the gigantic buying power of New York City to try and lower the percentage of on hand.
However, We please, you know to city state federal whatever the case is going to be, but this one was a FEMA program as part of the individuals and families.
What I did find was a report on all of the FEMA programs at the time by the Gao, the government, accountability, office, and so, If we want to really like get into the weeds, we can find it.
Okay, So let's call the question seconded fantastic, I, think everybody's with us who was with us before all in favor.
They assured us and what we put in the resolution is that it's only temporary at this moment in time and they have to come back to us if they want to extend it.
People know that used to be one of the greatest lobbies in the city in New, York.
We had a hell of a time chilling with it and discussing it over more than one meeting at the Landmarks Committee, and we do fear just like the pilot program of the ot on.
This is kind of a little bit of a nuance that we got to look out for because once this you know the virus is over they'd, be able to expand the expansion space, be able to have the reality of the true public, assembly.
I, think it says in the resolution, through this period of time, through this temporary in response to the state's executive orders and has agreed to come back to the committee if they wish to add more seating after the Al alteration is lifted.
We can't speak when it goes before the SLA, but everybody is very concerned about this and we sent the negative resolution that we voted on in February and additional documentation and we're trying to be on top of it, Susan and I will say.
First, so, first of all, or last of all number five, the state of 421a and 421 g affordability in battery Park City Lucian gave a great discussion and summary of both programs for the committee and afterwards there were questions about what buildings are still subject to or have has 421a or 421 g available to them.
What's going on with the time of Covid-19 with the seniors, things are okay.
One thing I want to note: Is we at the Valley Park City Committee are trying to create a more robust dialogue between Allied Universal and the community.
Member meeting was the first step and it's evolved into more of it, but we're looking to have allied, explain and provide a clear picture of what the ambassadors can and can not provide in battery park city and what the community's expectations are and with the discussions, how to bring them more in line with each other, because there's frustration on both sides and I'm hearing a lot of it.
You can't go in and out of it, but it's the commentary on kind of inclusion and race and all sorts of stuff like that and the authorities addressing it in a quiet, way, I, think I, said: everything, Any, questions, I, don't see any hands.
I should note that these are items that the community board has supported through its budget process in recent years and we're just making a push for them now, because again, we're fairly desperate along the east side to create spaces, additional recreation, spaces, additional open spaces, and we think we have some good opportunities.
The long and short of it is that you have a resolution before you, basically urging DOT NYPD and the city to work with us to create spaces that we think could work for.
We do plan to try to have a follow-up meeting with D.O.T over the next week or two a smaller one, since they didn't want to come to the committee.
Details of this resolution were not known at the meeting at the time of the vote.
In fact, This resolution doesn't even acknowledge that one exists in 2020 when it's already gone to the DOT, with our recommendations were some of these same very areas, so I actually would wish that you would withdraw this whole thing and wait a month as I asked before and work out, so that it works with the other resolution that was already passed by CB1 before promoting another conflicting resolution, which will only look worse in front of the D.O.T. Oh you're still talking about it, because in general, I don't disagree with many of the things that want to be done, especially the skate park.
I will say yes, but next time do me a favor, don't you know just I'm trying to keep you.
Got where I'm going, And I did review it and to see specifically if there were any conflicts or areas of overlap, and so the three points in the Manhattan side that they were touching with their proposal were number one.
When we discussed this resolution, it kind of looked like.
We were going to have a vote and Joe Lerner interrupted and said: asked.
And, we passed I know a resolution in full support of reactivating this area.
Just wanted to point out that you know we're talking about tens of thousands of square feet of what was park and was then stolen away by who not sure, but.
We really want to try to encourage people and groups and people from our district who are interested in helping a park near them to come.
Okay, so I think we've gone through all the questions that we've got.
Yes, sir, The no vote means you're, not supporting, therefore, be it resolved, urging the LPC to ask the project to reduce its mass and height.
A no vote means you that you do not agree with the application pretty much in anything because we're saying yes with the pro.
Wouldn't either you would vote yes, but that doesn't make sense because you're saying yes, if you reduce the height, that's why I abstain, because I think it's okay, the way it is well, Then you abstain.
Think, because Bruce's amendment is more than just a friendly amendment and does substantively change based on subsequent information, the vote of the committee with an operative piece that wasn't a part of the resolutions they voted on.
So, Moving on to the zoning for coastal flood resiliency, it's definitely something people should are going to want to read through if you're interested, Allison, Brown and Genu from DCP came and presented.
So here you know, for there are some floor area exemptions, and this is something that again on governor's island is going to be somewhat important.
For that 10 feet that you're now going to flood proof can be then lifted on top of the building, making it simple and so, which I think was pointed out during the meeting.
If you have a specific question about any of this, we're going to go over this in much more detail in our next meeting, which should be December 7th, where we're going to take some time to look this over more carefully together as a committee and then again at the executive committee, So you'll have your shot at trying to understand this more.
I just want to make sure that when we, you know, actually write a resolution about this, and this some of this came up during the meeting.
You know it's fine to have a standalone zoning resolution text change, but it really has to come hand in hand with some, maybe in the sake of like landmarks staff, level, changes to the laws because, as a building, for example, in the Seaport, you know.
You know, builders that can just do whatever the hell they want, because money is cheap or whatever, but more like the small condominiums and co-ops that line these neighborhoods on the shores of lower Manhattan, Tribeca, Seaport.
Small projects like this I mean imagine, adding a story to a five-story building in a co-op of four people that you know don't make 20 million dollars a year.
It's really going to help people that, just you know, money.
You know, within the community board, to talk about the implications of this for the smaller buildings in the Seaport happy to have whatever discussions.
You know: land, use, landmarks, zoning things that we've had in front of us in a while and change all the parameters by the zoning text.
I. Think I won't go over everything because it's late, but they talk about working with certain companies that you know, do self self-contained composting bins which were interesting that they wanted to place in bowling green park.
Last year, like a shred-a-thon and textile recycling and they've partnered with other companies to have more tech, access, the one thing that they didn't answer that we're going to ask them to come back, and they will I'm sure, sooner than later, just really to talk about resiliency in terms of actual property owners and what they were doing in lower Manhattan.
I know that we still have land use, which includes governors, island.
Remember back in December of last year, CB1 passed a resolution in conjunction with the youth and Education Committee about Trinity School, which is here in the blue area, and they wanted the extended sidewalk space for gathering of children and families before class, which is the area marked in Brown.
This is extremely I'll, say it disrespectful for the people who live in this Little Greenwich, South area and I, Don't know if bill wants to chime in, but I think.
And I wanted to let people know who aren't listening.
Just you know, again, like I hope that what I saw continues because it would be very little.
I mean I'm talking two cars in 50 minutes and the only thing I saw on that street was the parked scooter.
You know I, think you're, all aware of that, and it's and the use is basically to extend it on the the South island as well.
That was a big focus of, and you know of questions and discussions at the meeting, keep in mind for everybody on the call sorry to interrupt you fern everything that happens in the Z zoning for coastal Resilience text.
We can take I, don't know good question, And, I, think you're talking to a vice chair and chair who would agree with you on that Colin Sorry admitted just super quickly.
So please put up that resolution that we're going to vote on Bruce.
And, as I know, people are going to want to jump immediately.
My best to you and all of your family members don't go visit, but if anybody needs a friend to talk to, if anybody is one you know just text or call all right, so walking.
