I. Think what I'd like to do is start with our guests from the Harper School.
As we know, millennium, has been approved, but the construction has stalled and Covid-19 has created a lot of problems with the Sca's budget, so, along with making sure that millennium's construction stays on schedule and that trinity's construction stays on schedule.
So I want to say that in advance to the harbor school as they come in that you have been on our radar, we have not forgotten and I was really happy to hear from you.
So, welcome and and Nan Richardson is with us who will talk to us a little bit about what they want to do with the school and some of the challenges.
We have pointed out to both the DOE and to our sympathetic elected officials that to us expect a school to train students for a lifetime working on the water without teaching them.
I mean they had to go all the way to Bushwick for swimming lessons, and my daughter, who was on the rowing team, actually left the school rowing team because it just wasn't enough to support the rowing team.
So you know I would hate to see the talent keep leaving the school because it's not properly supported right.
We could get a gymnatorium through the mayor's fund for gymnasium since we're a school without a gymnasium, and that then, once we got that space allocated to us that it would be up to us to raise some additional private funds to accommodate the pool, then we were told that there was no space, that the trust would make available that was sufficiently large to accommodate even a small gym and so back and forth between the trust and SCA, with both of them saying it's, the other party that is unable to allow this to move forward, which is why your intercession at this point, when the trust is about to make a very large and serious commitment to every piece of space on the island, is so important.
We've seen plans for a hotel and the ironic part about it is the hotel is going to have a pool, but to your point, I, don't know of any developer.
We did go around and we spend a lot of time with Margaret Chin, with Gail Brewer, with Brian who's been totally supportive, as has Mrs Chen, as has Gail Brewer, and also some you know not directly related public officials such as congressman Nadler, whose people came out and they all signed a written statement that was widely reported in the press that was directed at the mayor.
An open letter to the mayor saying that they supported the harbor schools need for an aquatic training, center.
So I mean, as you know, we're completely supportive of you guys getting a pool.
And I think we've done a resolution before, but Nan I would like to reach out to you tomorrow and work together through the points and gather some whereases from you.
I won't do it now, while we're in the meeting, but if I can reach out to you, tomorrow, I've taken some notes with what you said, but I would love to have about 10 minutes of your time, so that I can develop a resolution that we can send out to the trust and the SCA and the DOE, with these important points and remind them of their commitment to you back several years.
So if a hotel goes in there is there any way we can say in the resolution, something like if a hotel goes in there, that hotel needs to make a pool that accommodates these students.
And I mean there's literally hundreds of pages of information on this, but to try and give you a very short summary they've put forward a proposed rezoning of the southern portion of the island to allow for expanded permitted uses that would allow for lack of a better term commercial development framed around a center of climate and, again.
The reason I'm, bringing it up in the context of this discussion, Harbor School, has featured somewhat prominently in the community engagement in this point about an aquatic center and I.
That's important information about the rezoning, which is important to consider here, I'd like to hear from Nan as to whether or not you know the way Stuyvesant's pool is used for the community is very restricted.
Think that it's just like it's really important for all of our students to come out of ninth grade, let alone graduate knowing how to swim for our Cte programs, they're out on the water they're learning in vessel operations, they're, professional, scuba, diving.
They have not built a school from scratch or a facility from scratch in a long, time, they're always looking for other people to do it to Andrew's point, and maybe it's that if this goes into the hotel, you know they build two pools and one pool's.
So I'm just trying to think creatively to get something done before then, because you need to have a pool on the island as soon as possible.
I'll, just jump in just first did want to say thank you, and you know it certainly seems like you.
But you have to tell us where this is going to go so getting all the parties at the table, including Jeff, and his amazing staff and teachers getting representatives from Harvard the trust from the SCA and hopefully the PTA to participate in that conversation with your efforts and your advocacy to make that happen would be a tremendous help, because your resolutions will help, but also actually getting the players at the table will hopefully make a big difference.
So I, think that's also part of a discussion that we'd like to have in the near term, with the trust and with the SCA to move that forward, because that's something that can happen much quicker much more quickly and add.
I know it seems crazy to be talking about these kinds of plans, but it feels like it's.
Two of them are going to meet and talk soon to see if the two can come up with an actual plan for a barge pool that would fit exactly right where the diving system and all the aqua culture like it's, the pier that is connected to the building that does belong to the harbor school.
They're doing things with fish and water and systems, and the barge that we're talking about is something that could actually handle a lot of different ctes, which is what we call these different topics or programs at the school.
So, the barge is actually exciting, but I would Nan. I think the container if we are allowed to just plop down the container, pools right now on a hospital on the hospital parking lot.
We can I think that the well-defined ask of the harbor School is that we broker a meeting between elected Eoe, SCA, harbor, school governor's island and whoever else just the key stakeholders bring them together for faith, not a face to face a zoom call or meeting.
And you know anything would be helpful at this point, because we still hear nothing and, of course, I understand from March on, but even before that we weren't getting a lot of communication from SCA or from well.
And you know, I mean Jeff, went to a lot of trouble too to work out a much better safety plan.
There was no a lot of those early days were rough going and and that one of the things that Jeff worked out a couple of years ago was a really good safety.
I think you know the harbor school could be a big assist in governors island trying to figure out the next phase of development.
Anybody else was on that meeting yesterday with the the landmark I wasn't on that meeting, but I think Patrick might have gotten confused with the classroom space, which has been said over and over again, that the classroom space directly across the street from school is, you know, even the trust says, that's going to be an expansion space for the harbor school, but I have not heard anything in the last couple years.
While we have you all here, you know we're about to discuss how things are going with hybrid schooling and in and out of classrooms.
We also have a tonight, but I want to be clear about what what we're going to be discussing tonight in terms of this issue right now before us and on a community level.
Also one of the co-founders, I'm happy to be with all of you tonight to share what I know regarding the screen: schools, gift and talent.
You know, certainly in Manhattan many in district two, where I think all of your schools, are.
In terms of you know what is going on regarding school.
The mayor I think last fall after the stag recommendation had said that he was going to take this year, to you, know, figure it out and decide, and that's really.
You know I'm sure you'll be getting it from the middle school guidance counselors as well as parent coordinators, but that was shared with me.
It sounds like at private schools, I wouldn't know, since we keep getting turned away at the door.
It be online like people right, so we know about the contract versus that.
We actually place met with the DOE over the summer to to kind of make sure that they were thinking about all of the accommodations that would be needed for social distancing.
That does that, and we talk through all of those suggestions in terms of spacing more schools, I mean looking at Stuyvesant and Brooklyn.
I just remember things being pretty late in terms of what you find out, what high school and what middle school you're going to be in, like in terms of working backwards, how much time everything takes.
Because I think you know, the DOE has has told parents that they would give parents adequate time to register and to prepare.
This- is why we're under a lot of review in terms of our screens and I again, I would like to have this discussion, but I think it's best had with more representation, but I just want to say.
With that said: yep, teen I, do think that, in terms I was shocked, even though I wasn't shocked about hearing the conversations about screen schools in general and about what the future of them is and the ongoing discussions of how we might be able to as a city desegregate our schools without throwing out the things that parents love most about our schools, and they surprised us with the comment the other day that they want to implement.
Schools, then I would think it would be very important to have a plan b fully in place, something that ensures that we will not lose everything that we build.
It sounds like a zero to a hundred change and we would like to write a resolution tonight that is focusing on that, leaving out the parts of whether or not we believe in screen schools as parents, because I think again.
We had agreed that you're going to focus on just saying changing any school model.
Whereas it talks about the effectiveness of screen, schools, I, think your points are excellent and that would be the only feedback I have on it.
Let me digest that a little bit because I do feel like it is a factual point that the screening schools have higher attendance, better gpas and higher graduation rates.
Think, that you know, diversity is an important thing, but I have to bring up again.
Remote, kicking in at 3 percent and whereas, as NPR reported on September 27, 2020 quote the Executive Board of the union, representing more than 6,400 of New York City school leaders, passed a unanimous vote of no confidence against mayor Bill, De Blasio and schools, Chancellor Richard Karanza on Sunday, for what it's called, what it called officials, quote: failure to lead, New, York City through the safe and successful opening of schools.
Quote: This is an unprecedented move by the leaders of the city schools and shows how little faith our mayor and Chancellor have sorry to fix.
Just saying now is not the time to make a change to anything about screens, get your plan together for next year and we'll talk about the longer term plan when there's a newly elected mayor of the accountable of the electorate, you're, not sneaking something through to editorialize for a moment, which is what they're doing and that there's been a chance for people to really face each other and have a conversation.
You know the fact that they went ahead without the discuss their full discussion with the teachers union about how blended learning was actually going to happen and.
The fact that schools were unable to open on time because the DOE and the chancellor and the mayor were unable to do what the thing that they said they were able to do by the time.
Now of the mayor and the chancellor like what you just said, Trisha about that they have just come up with these policies or plans, and they just put them out there.
So I, don't know what that would have to do with this resolution as it is, but I think it is related, because I think for people who are happy that you know that they want to go to a high, achieving school or focus that they will.
Do think that it's an issue that you know for sure about at some point for sure.
Anybody know if, at any point that the mayor or the Chancellor talk about that schools can individually do their own tests.
You know what I mean it's like.
But I wrote the New York City daily on the leadership of Mayor Bill De Blasio and Chancellor Richard Carranza failed to prepare for the reopening of schools in the fall and have continued to push through policies and policy changes little or no input from the public or even school leadership and teachers, including delaying guidelines for admissions for the 2021-22 school year and changing the policy of students opting into blended learning at various states throughout the year italian families that November 15th 2020 is their last opportunity.
I'll cut the quote if you like, but I, don't want to cut the point that the unprecedented move by the teacher by the S by the New York City's teachers.
Okay, I just want to make sure we're just asking for no change, right, well, keeping it in place, but it just sounds like he's really trying to dismantle it.
And I think we can make the same point by saying by describing what happened with the last time.
We want to take out the word long term, because you know my fear is: Are we saying that we're okay with changing something in the short term, and.
That's the point of the second one Judith and the first ones to say, don't even think about long term right, now.
Think it's important that we say that we don't want them, making a long-term plan change right, now.
I. So I, don't know if exactly the second one addresses that it says to develop a plan for admissions that includes screening schools, the second world dresses I think it might be a bit confusing the way we have it.
I really feel like it needs they're still going to have to lead until they're out of business, I mean out of office, and so what is that saying.
This isn't saying: I think it should be included, because you know part of it is that also the question's been called and seconded.
So I think the answer is going to be both and one other point.
I. Think Trisha would agree with me on this one too, there's something in there that says about either adding or expanding a high school in our community, and I'm really scared about that wording, because one of the biggest things that you know I know that you fought harder for than almost anyone.
