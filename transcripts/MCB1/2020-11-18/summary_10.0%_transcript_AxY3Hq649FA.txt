Let I need to walk you through them, but we actually are going to rearrange the order of items we're going to start with what had been item two, which is encouraging the formation of friends of groups for parks in community district.
Like I said before we are private public partnership, where we have a non-profit society and a prophet side and me being the outreach coordinator, I bridge that gap between the community and the parks, Department and the city parks foundation, and vice versa.
You guys know your community's better than we would you guys live there so forming these friends of groups so just forming a group in general, a group of people who may just want to clean the park.
Really slim and lava parks took a big hit and, as you guys can see from the trash accumulation to when we got hit with that that storm where the trees went down and there were trees, everywhere, I know me living in Queens.
And I know other parts of the Bronx that my other colleagues live was out of control and especially just in Manhattan me coming into the city, just to see how things look hectic as well.
So if the community board were to send out information to or offer to help different people in our district who are interested in forming these types of groups, you would be a person who would assist and work with them and give them the know-how of how to go about doing what they want to do.
You know district one is my district that I don't get a lot of groups from, because this just depends on how things are placed like I.
This fall with various recreational activities that we put on for baseball and softball, and no surprise, given the inability to bring on the seasonal resources, combined with the fact that the ball fields were sitting idle, pretty much all of the spring and through a good part of the summer, when they did start issuing permits that the parks department, the fields were just really a lot of to bring into a playable state and that's not a meant as a criticism at all.
I know we, as a league are coming forward with helping to purchase maintenance, equipment, doing some painting of the facilities around the fields, and it's just been an incredible community experience for our kids.
So the fact that we're able to get community residents, people who you know care about their part to step in and help that's big, and we hope that continues like you said throughout this pandemic, and you know after you know, it's over.
You know, think about that, but we're right now we're working on a map to map out every single district and to map out every single friends of a group in the parks in which they are.
Once it comes out, we're going to make it available to everybody to have access to, because we feel that be a great tool for people who not only want to know about the friends of the group might want to get involved, enjoying that friendship group just to do like a volunteer project with them.
I was wondering if you were aware of the daffodil project and okay, and is there any for those of you who don't know it's not going offer from the Dutch to provide daffodil bill, bulbs, free planting in the parks and commemoration of 9:11.
I will look into that and to see, if there's any updates that they might have, because on our end, because we try to work hand in hand with them, because a lot of our group utilizes utilize, the daffodil project, to get that for those especially around the full time, and we usually try to understand when they're going to do their distribution.
And I said: What are the plans for the broken banks and what would be a realistic way of getting life in the state parks in New. I.
We understand probably walking that night Tom can be a little dangerous in some areas with you know, without having no power and all our parks do offer power with our power lines and our light posts.
I, know right now, due to like I, said anything when it comes to a comfort station being closed and not being open.
We took it from gravel to you know where how where it's going, today, I think Brooklyn.
And I think you know, especially now you know New York's, taking a beating, left and right on a public level.
You know what type of working group to your point before it's something that I'm pretty passionate about growing up in the city and I.
They are great resources for the map, for the whole entire park manages Manhattan but parks in general, but I'm going to put my email in the chat so that you know once if I can't answer the question, here, I can try to answer it after the meeting is done.
It also had other recreation spaces in it as well, but the parks department I mean D.O.T closed it in 2009, and at that point they indicated it would reopen in 2014.
Don't hesitate to think this over and try to talk to your neighbors, about supporting our local parks.
Let me give a little background for people who are less familiar with the Brooklyn bridge banks, as well as the other area that we're looking to take and reopen as recreation spaces for the community.
But, it's true, the east side of Community board one is not, does not have a lot of recreation, space, particularly active recreation space, particularly for youth and others that are a little beyond you, know, toddler and playground age, people who want to ride a bike or fly kite or ride a skateboard or do any other activities, basketball, Et, cetera.
We need to do on the bridge, which is going to necessitate the closure of the space, and at that point they were telling us, or they were estimating that in five years it would be reopened.
As, you know, the city closed the area at the Brooklyn bridge, unofficially known as red Brick park in 2009 for construction and security.
The space provides access and staging for work on Dot's bridge Brooklyn, bridge rehabilitation contracts which seek to keep the iconic broken bridge.
These crews perform daily work from bridge preventative maintenance to roadway resurfacing that helps keep the city's transportation network moving forward, D.O.T plans to add additional operations to the space in the near future, including contractor operations to minimize our footprint within other areas of the community.
And Rosa is probably the one and the reason why we have over a hundred participants in this meeting tonight, because she reached out to some people who want to see especially Brooklyn beach banks reopen, but with that.
We just don't have, as you said, space in our neighborhood for kids to go out and play ball or soccer or bike or skate for people to just you know chill out near the water and what makes this bridge, maybe not as great for a a standard, park.
Well said Rosa, and we definitely need you and people like you and your enthusiasm to try to make this work.
So I guess my question: hi Rodney, hello, is what are the security issues because to me when somebody says that the Brooklyn bridge is a security issue, I'm thinking, well.
Why is the underside of the bridge more of a security issue than the actual bridge itself and couldn't it be planned with or dealt with in such a way to maintain its secure ability, while still leaving the bath vast area underneath it open for public use.
We will be able to have security more in depth and also when it's time for opening to reopening the park, the NYPD would do a security assessment of the area and see what it looks like right.
This is the way it was 10 years ago, but I am pretty sure that the Brooklyn bridge is considered a terrorist target and so putting any park underneath it, or at least in vulnerable areas, could open up the bridge to potential terrorist attacks.
And I want everyone to know that the NYPD will do a vulnerability assessment of the park in the area because it, the pillars of the bridge, are obviously near the park and the major roadways are above the park, but that will be part of it.
I think once we let them know that it's on the horizon, then we'll be able to push for something like that.
Is there a plan b strategy where perhaps we use this as leverage to identify other areas and push parks and the city to focus on building those out to meet the needs of the community.
I think we want to try to go for this space again and somebody who knows the spaces in this side of town.
Around here, I mean unless Howard Hughes wants to give that space to the community and build a park.
You know if any development plans or drawings for what could be in that space were ever prepared from a park perspective.
First, the Brooklyn bridge banks had been a park area, so it already, you know, had a layout of basketball and other courts, and obviously a good portion of it was used for skateboarding as well.
I. Don't know if it's tonight or next time or whatever, but you know, I, think we need to get the electeds on board with what is obviously a really frankly obvious and great idea and has a great deal of support.
Let me see it looks like I've called on all the members of the community board who have their hands up.
Most people in New York know me: I've been skating, the Brooklyn bank, since I was literally 10 years old, so I went to school for architecture.
You mentioned the Brooklyn bridge forest and it looks interesting, but if they're going to try to take out the just, no, the reason why the Brooklyn banks are so special, which is how it's naturally made for skateboarding kind of a tough kind of stuff deal.
I mean there's any way that we can try to get it going so that we can get the space back to the skateboarders.
I mean the arches has always been pretty much closed and there was never really access the whole time that I've skated there for, like the 10 years.
There could be a way to get this back to the public and maybe do something amazing for not only skateboarders but for like the whole community, without taking away the skateboarding aspect of that space that because in reality the skateboarders make it really special.
I think that this is not only a landmark for New York City, but an element that's being lost here is that it's also a cultural landmark for the skateboard community, so I kind of wanted to take a moment to talk about that when.
My family actually owned a skate park in Westchester Pennsylvania, so I feel connected to the Brooklyn banks, even though I never skated there, because it is so iconic and for all the reasons that Richie and Leo just said.
I'll echo what Rosa and everybody else said like there's no work that happens there on a day-to-day basis, I walk past the space, every day.
I'd like to also add the high school there that my school is in has no windows so having a physical space right across the street would be essential for our students, many of whom skateboard or many of them play.
I like actually greet students and look at the Brooklyn banks as they come in every single day.
I'm sure there's hundreds of other skateboarders and people on here who would be happy to organize to make sure that this thing opens because I don't think that it's going to happen, if we don't have people putting pressure on the local elected officials and coordinating as a community.
I think that if you want to bring back Brooklyn banks, you know arguing with the D.O.T about what they do with their trucks is pointless.
And I want to just thank you, Paul and the community board, one for being such positive advocate of this opportunity to grow the Brooklyn banks.
The Pablo Ramirez Foundation is willing to be an advocate to help bring skaters in New York City together to make this dream possible to bring back and save the Brooklyn banks.
And I know that the department of transportation likes this free parking and the possibility of more storage space, but considering local school leaders.
I, just I, guess just to finish, I mean seeing the banks fenced in this way, pains skateboarders across the world and wastes additional public space that could and should be open to all New Yorkers.
The Brooklyn banks would once again provide a safe space where like-minded people can get together to skate and to rebuild community.
An awful skateboarder always have been, and unfortunately, never grew into it, but I think the thing that set the banks, apart from every other skate park in New, York City and continues to or could continue, to, is, its ability to be a mixed-use space, I loved skateboarding and.
I would often go to the banks and it was an opportunity for me to sit and watch and be a part of skateboarding culture and see my favorite pros, come to town and watch all these people and be a part of the community in the same space.
And I got after my own passions in that space, which was drawing sketching one of my own talents and the connections that I made at the banks and the work that I did there and the things that I learned.
I would just say if you're, basically going to repeat, what's already been said, I, think you get the sense that our community board is rather supportive, but we will call on you if you'd like to be heard, but try to make your comments.
Love, Park, San Francisco had a marcadero, but these places are gone, now, they've been torn down and the Brooklyn banks is one of the only spaces left like this in American't, just New York City.
It's inspiring to see everyone here who wants to help save the banks, and you know just the fact that this conversation is on the table is really great to see.
Think that there's a lot to learn from using that as an epicenter for people to get to know you New York as well.
Think the most important thing about this is that the community is willing to work with DOT and whoever else needs access to the space.
It was then, and always the spot to go to in New York, City, Steve, Rodriguez, I, also know, and at one point years several years ago he asked me in a text message, what's the most famous skate spot world and without hesitation, I fired right back a text that said the Brooklyn banks.
But I know when other people saw them taking bricks out of the banks, they were pretty much tearing at the fabric of New York City skateboarding.
You know the Brooklyn banks is the melting pot under the bridge, but.
I would like to suggest that you know wave for the skating community, as others have suggested, should be at the forefront of the agenda and also I want to talk about the vaults I did some research into the history, and.
I went, and it really helped me really get to know what New York is kind of like, and it's a really great melting pot and cultural meeting point for the city of not just skateboarders, but.
Let me know, because I really think Brooklyn banks should always be there for everyone to come.
I think you did provide a lot of very good information for the community board to know those arches by the way.
You know, the Brooklyn bridge banks and that's on the North West side of the of the basically the three blocks that this area runs under, but it there's actually four acres in those combined three lots, and.
The speakers here were or users of a space that had served this community for many years and great rare collections, but we're trying to create another space as well in that dugout area and I, don't know if anyone has any questions on that.
So you heard the element largely that we want to put in it basically urging DOT NYPD to work with the community board.
You know things need to be done, procedurally correct, but it seems non-controversial which is a plus I, don't think anyone's going to vote against it, but maybe just go through a little bullet point there to help us out all right Diana, since you've taken better notes, probably than I have do you want to.
Is, like you, said that we want the the DOT NYPD parks, department, to the extent that they're involved.
Are elected officials to all work towards this common goal of returning this space with Brooklyn bridge back to the public, the Brooklyn banks and the state park has been talked about.
A lot tonight, but we're talking about you, know space.
You know what I'm going to throw in parks.
You want the full Brooklyn bridge bank recreation and open space area restored to the community.
