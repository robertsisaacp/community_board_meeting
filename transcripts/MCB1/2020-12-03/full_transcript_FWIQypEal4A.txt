And I think it looks like we're on yes, okay, so this is the battery Park City Committee for Community Board one. My name is Justine Cuccia and I. Am the chair of this committee? Kathy Gupta is the co-chair she's not on yet and I. Don't know what the deal is, but I'm waiting to hear back, but we also have a number of other members on the line right now, which are Betty K, Bob, Schneck, Judith, Weinstock, Sarah Cassell, and we have other board members who are not part of the committee but Ahi and Jill Goodkind, and we are going to start so. Robert's rules is the way this meeting runs, which means that we have people raising their hands to ask questions. I will call on them, people to speak and everybody will get their turn. I'm looking to have everybody speak I know: we've got a bunch of people in the attendee section and I want you to pay attention to the agenda order, so we can go through that and pay attention to the order in which things are going and our first line of business sorry distraction behind me. First line of business is going to be talking about Allied universal ambassadors, so I'm going to want to introduce Patrick Murphy, Nick, Spordone and Eric Munson Patrick Murphy is the head of Allied Universal. He comes to every meeting and reports up to us as to what's going on with Allied and we're going to want to engage in a dialogue with Patrick and he's been very kind and agreed to give us his time and attention to kind of explaining what the role of the ambassadors are as they understand it, as they've been hired to be engaged and they have been hired to be engaged by the battery Park City Authority and Nick Spordone and Eric Munson are here from the battery park, City Authority, so they can also kind of give color to it. I know that from email exchanges and some in the next door, neighborhood chat, there's been a lot of conversation going back and forth. I'm going to insist that everybody be respectful, I understand that there are people who are angry and I'm frustrated part of why I wanted to have this dialogue tonight is because I want allied to be able to explain what it is. They are have been hired as our private security force to do for us in battery park city. They are hired, they are a private security force, but what does that mean? What does their contract say? What do they understand that to me, then, I want to hear from the community with questions and I want to hear what the community has in terms of their perceptions and their expectations, for what a private security force is for them and what they expect from allied, and then we can see where that balance is out where the expectations meet the reality and we go from there and perhaps have a conversation and dialogue to move forward with to say, okay, this is what they're doing, but this is what they're contracted to do, but we want them to do this, we'll see where that goes. But first I'm going to turn this over to Nick and Patrick and Eric Cronson. So you guys, if you're unmuted, if you're not here, I, think just submit yourself and go in the order in which you want to speak. So maybe Nicole you want to introduce. Yes, thank you! So much Justine and Lucian, and members of the committee thanks and for the intro, as well as Justine, had noted. Patrick and I have the pleasure of being here every month to the committee to report out all sorts of happenings within and throughout battery park city and important parcel. That standing report is kind of Pat's update on security matters each month. So thanks for the intro and what I wanted to do tonight, given that I know, there's some questions and we kind of went through a little bit of this exercise. Last year with allied when the contract was coming up for bid, I've asked Eric Munson, who is our chief operating officer as well, and who kind of oversees the general security posture for the battery Park city authority to join us as well. So if it pleases the committee we're going to hand it over to Eric he'll, give a short kind of presentation just setting a little bit of a framework, so folks understand kind of what allied is, what they do, what they don't do and how they function within the overall general framework of security and at a larger level law enforcement in the first precinct. With that, we work very closely with the New York Police Department's first precinct on, of course. So with that I'll turn it over to Eric, who's I think should be teed up and Lucian. Thanks for getting that presentation up for us, he'll drive and Eric will give the cues as he proceeds. Okay thanks everyone. Thank you. Justine thanks Eric go ahead thanks! Nick thanks Justine Lucian, maybe for changing of the slides I'll like pull my earlobe or something like a symbol like you should steal third base, or something like that. I'm watching, like a hawk great. So thanks for having me I'm Eric Munson, I'm the chief operating officer at the authority, the security portfolio at the authority reports directly to me. It's important to us and I managed not just the prior allied contract, but also the procurement of the new allied contract, which took effect last November 19th and so did a bit of a road show. Last summer with members of the committee and then presented to the committee, both before and after we entered into that contract with Allied to solicit feedback on the future of the program and where folks wanted to see it, and so I took that deck. That I used back last December, which was 363 days ago and just updated it a little bit with some additional information I had in reading the description of today's meeting topic. I had seen that one of the topics that you folks wanted to cover was what's really in the allied contract and so I plucked some provisions from the contract which I have on a slide here. So we can go over that and then I'm really here, along with Pat and Nick, to listen to your feedback again. This is I, see it as part of an ongoing dialogue that we have together. I think you know, Pat really works hard to be accessible and I know Nick and I feel the same way that we want feedback, both immediate and often so, to the extent that you see something, tell us right away, there's no need to wait until one of these community board meetings. You should feel free to reach out to any of the three of us and we'll work to make things better again. Our work with regards to securities is never done, but it's also never perfect, and so to the extent that we flip, you know we want to do things better and so we're here to listen to you on how we can do that. So with that I'll give my first feel third symbol. Here we go so any security discussion in battery park city really has to talk, has to start rather with a discussion on crime fighting, and so that is really with regard to the first precinct and part of the reason why we shifted our focus last year. With regards to our approach with Allied has been the advent of community policing at the NYPD, and so the four folks who are mentioned at in the bottom bullet. There are neighborhood coordination officers. Many have attended this committee meeting in the past and have made themselves accessible. They share their cell phone numbers with us and when I say with us, I mean publicly. They encourage you to reach out to them directly, for you know not to observe to report crimes in progress, but rather to mention quality of life issues or to provide Intel on recurring incidents that take a more nuanced approach to calling cri to fighting crime, but the first that one of the things that I'll say in the context of this slide is to the extent that you witness a crime or are victim to a crime. Again, don't call the command center at Allied Universal Call 911, because if you were to call the command center and report a crime, they would call 911 and so cut out the middle person in that instance, and really call the NYPD. We have a great relationship with the first precinct. They do a tremendous job. There's a neighborhood Coordination Council meeting tomorrow evening, which Pat will attend like he attends every month and Nick attends most of them as well. I think, maybe all of them so again, I would just encourage you to start with the first precinct. I'm sorry, it's Nick Spordo, just to jump in a second apologies. I, don't I say this only because that was the case in the process of repairing my report. I checked back in with the first precinct. In fact, the first Precinct Community Council meeting this month is now looking like it's going to be December 17th. So that's two thursdays from tomorrow- apologies I, just came in it's in my report as well, but so same idea. It's just two thursdays from now. Not tomorrow, it's not tomorrow night, isn't two Thursdays. Thank you. 17. Sorry about that Eric. Thank you, Lucian. If you could go to the please so, as many of you know, prior to 2015, we worked with the parks department on policing exclusively in our parks, but to address some shortcomings that we had heard from the community and also that we had identified ourselves. We did a public solicitation and ended up hiring allied to do a more expanded scope and that scope expanded, not just geographically from parks to outdoor patrols, but also provided some other services that are outlined in the bullets there at the bottom. So this is the start of the ambassador program, the idea being that these folks are the eyes and ears for both the authority and also the NYPD notifying patrons if they're breaking parks, rules running a command center, that staff 24 7,365 to monitor our camera network, to field calls and complaints and reports from the public and also to coordinate with Pd on safety matters. So the idea wasn't just that they were writing tickets for dog violations, for example, but it really a more holistic and proactive approach to security in the neighborhood. That was the vision that was the idea. Next plot is fine Eric. I've got a quick view on that, and maybe it's going to address but eyes and ears of the neighborhood and kind of like a liaison between the police or the community and the police. What does that mean in terms of what I wanted into the weeds of? What is it that they do in situations because I think? Sometimes people are frustrated, they expect the ambassadors to be doing Xyz and their level of engagement is ABC. Thank you and expressing that yeah. Sorry, yes, my Selsa water. Thank you. Sorry. So here are some excerpts from their contract. I should add that the contract is a super long document. I didn't include the whole thing. I also didn't include the whole scope, but I thought that these are the salient points, so you know, first and foremost, the roving patrols throughout the site. The idea is that we don't just have folks sitting and watching the cameras that are in the neighborhood, but rather we have folks that are a visible presence that are in assigned locations that we agree upon mutually and that they're proactive in safety, security and community engagement issues and so I'll. Let Pat get into the specifics. If you have individual questions about this incident happen, how would you want an ambassador to respond but to the extent that again, they witness a crime in process I want them to call Pd to the extent that they witness the violation of a parks rule. That's the second bullet here is we want them to contact the person who's violating the parts rule and inform them of the rules and ask them to stop. We also, as we've discussed a bunch of times with the committee before I, have the special patrol officer program, and so this was created as a way to provide ally the ability to issue tickets to folks who are unwilling to follow the rules so to the extent that we have recurring incidents in the neighborhood oftentimes. It's with regards, frankly to dogs, but there are also a handful of other violations. We've worked with the Pd to provide them special patrol officer status, so they can issue summonses for those violations and then on a few other items. You know they issue real-time reporting to us. We also can track them, as they are around the neighborhood to make sure that we actually have the staff deployed as we've requested them to be. So. If somebody says I'm in teardrop park right now and I don't see an ambassador I. Can you know, while lying in bed at night, look on my phone and see where the ambassador is in teardrop park or identify the fact that there isn't one and address the situation and then just a quick shout out to pat at the bottom here, but we wrote expressly in the contract to make sure that we have someone who has law enforcement experience and ties to serve as a primary contact, not just with local law enforcement, but also to be a main point of contact with members of the community and to attend meetings like these Lucian. So here's the special patrol officer again I, won't dwell on this, but you folks asked for special patrol officer status. We worked with the Pd to develop that status. I will mention that as a result of Covid-19, the police department put a bit of a pause on the licensing division, allowing for us to submit additional names. So we have some special patrol officers, but we're not yet at full special patrol officers strength. Yet it's a goal for the year ahead, Eric. How many do we have now and how many are we aiming for we're aiming for 11 and Pat I? Think we have five now is that right and how many are working each shift and I'm assuming and what's a shift every eight hours, every 12 hours we operate on three shifts and I won't share right now how many we have at all times, but you're, not sharing it for the sake of security right, I'm assuming that's right, yeah! We don't want to tip people off to the fact that x time is the right time to have your dog on the lawn break, breaking the pooper scooper law. But one could can could infer that there is at least one spo on duty, 24, 7. I, don't necessarily want to say that we really deploy them based on the need. Okay, I think the vast majority of the time there are special patrol officers working but I don't want to make a blanket statement that we always have one on staff all right and where do they well? I guess this is another one: that's gonna be security, but they're roving, I'm assuming they're, not in the office. All the time right, that's correct! No! The idea is that they're in the office as little as possible: okay, Lucian onward. So again, here's just an example of some of the technology that we have as a result of the contract with ally. Just because oftentimes we hear concerns about the lack of visible presence in the community, which again is what I see is one of the primary issues that we're trying to address, and so this is just a screenshot of what I pull up if I want to identify. You know where someone has been over the course of their shift in one of our parks. There's teardrop and Ambassador Martinez has been at various locations in the park over the course of their shift, and I could right now just pull up again on my phone to see where folks are, and so some of the technology will often see ambassadors on their phones. That's a another issue that we hear, often which I again, we want ambassadors to proactively engage members of the public, and so, if their head is in their phone, the entire shift. It's really challenging to do that as you might imagine, but we do want them to scan geotags, which we have to make sure that high traffic areas are caught and addressed by the ambassadors regularly, and also that they're submitting their reports, which they do via their phone. And what's a report saying no trouble saw five dogs or just you know, had a fight with or had a disagreement with the resident about their dog off a leash and that's the kind of report yeah so there right below that map. There is an example of what a report looks like okay, dog violator, okay yeah, and they tend to pick their clients yeah where it is and the photos and what the resolution was and I will say and I'm sure that's going to be people by the way Kathy Gupta is in the attendee mission and I, don't know if anybody else is, but I saw Kathy one of the things I think some of the people in the attendee list are going to mention are going to be. You could walk on the esplanade at any given time of the day and go I mean I know for myself. I have gone from 200 rector, all the way up to Stuyvesant and beyond and come home, and you know granted that's a bit of time, the coming home part too, and never seen a an ambassador. How was that possible? I, don't know how could you be more visible, I mean and that's a regular thing that people are saying so and I believe that the geotagging is occurring, maybe they're behind a tree. Maybe I'm not paying attention, maybe they're. You know, and it's fair enough, that I'm not seeing everything and I'm not looking for them, particularly except sometimes I, am just to know that I've seen them yep I will tell you, that's not the outcome that we're looking for. We want the ambassadors to be visible over the course of the day, and so I will tell you that the expectation is that the ambassadors are patrolling. We check the data to make sure that they are patrolling regularly, but I'll. Just I'll say that you know it's. That's I, don't know why. In those specific instances the ambassadors aren't visible and where they are, but it's our expectation that they will be and that's why we've hired them so from your I guess from your looking at the geotagging and the performance dashboard and everything else, you're looking at from you, do not see an issue with where they are at any given time, I mean and is there a way for you to check like I know, you said you could look at your phone now. That's the point in time: randomly is there a way that people's people could be evaluated or a shift can be evaluated to say where were they and how is it working and is that done yeah? So this is an example of Ambassador Martinez's like a period of time and where she was in teardrop park over the course of a set period of time. It's not over her entire shift, but it's over a period of time and so I won't again we've hired allies to provide this work and so I. It's not my expectation that we'll be micromanaging their work. At the same time, it is my expectation that they'll manage themselves and that's you know that's what Pat does on the daily so to speak, and so he you know he works with both him, his own staff and also the staff of his subcontractor to make sure that they're doing their job. I guess that might be something that I'm going to keep the back of my mind as a thing is that perhaps there needs to be more follow-up with them from on Pat's part, not necessarily the authorities and I. Don't know if that's a true statement, but perhaps that's what we want to see in a report is how is it being done? I'm not sure. Let's let the community talk before I jump in and let them you know, anticipate too much of what they're going to say but go ahead. Eric, I'm sorry, I think you're almost done with the slides right. Just yesterday, I have a quick question: yes, Ted Justine, can you hear me yeah? We can hear you pat okay, just to step in to answer that question the iphones they all have GPS on it. Okay, so you can log in and basically even at the command center. The safety ambassador. That's at the desk can even log in and see where a safety ambassador is. We also have it what we call what's technically called geofenced, which means that if they go, let's say, walk to the other side of the West Side Highway or West Street. Okay, we get a notification on it. Okay, so we know that they're out of their zone. Okay, so we know if they leave the area. Okay, all right so that that's the other backup with it all right as part of the technology and the other thing too is they have regular tours and by hitting or scanning the geotags. Whatever way you want to phrase, it stayed in timestamp, so you're, knowing that at that moment in time that they've tagged it they are there where they're supposed to be and one's going to assume they've been in the area. They're not like right quickly from place to place, I mean right and that occurs. You know where, let's say something happens in Rockefeller Park, which is big and being that we're in the winter time we're down personnel, so one person will be assigned to all of Rockefeller Park. Okay, so let's say an incident happens up by down by the irish Hunger memorial you're not going to see it right. We can see okay when it happened. The safety ambassador was up at Stuyvesant high school. He you know he scans the geotag on the life ring at the date and time that occurred. So you know it's, you know and at the same time it can save you and it can hurt you because you know yeah, you were down there. You could see that you were down there. How come you didn't see it? Okay, so where I can address it with the safety ambassador on a follow-up, and is that done regularly the follow-ups and the checking of things? Oh yeah when things are cut when things occur and they come across, you know. Definitely, for instance, there was a communication to Nick the other day and it was always safety ambassador getting into a confrontation with a resident okay over by the Marina. Okay, so I went into the system and I knew where all our people were, and we don't patrol the marina right. You know- and you know at the same time and I also know that Brookfield has another security company there that now they wear the same type of uniform that we do yeah. So you know yep. So this way I could say to Nick when it got flipped to me: hey Nick. This is where all our people were at the time. Nobody was there, you know walking through at that time that this incident you know, occurred interesting, so I want to keep that incident in mind, because I want to follow it through I want Eric to finish and I want to give the community and then and the board also a chance to talk, because we've been going for a while now and I know, the community is online and they do have things to say, but that's an interesting thing because good to know that your guys were not involved in whatever that incident was, but I also want to know what happened after that go ahead. Let's not talk about that. Yet, okay, I'm going to be super quick with these last two slides, they're super quick one is I just wanted to mention that, in addition to providing the conventional security services, because we have a significant allied staff presence in the public Lucian, could you flip to the thanks just because we have them out about they observe maintenance and other issues in the neighborhood and flag them for our maintenance staff, as well as provide some support on some other services that are not security, related or maintenance related, and so just flagging. The fact that this 7000 number was from last year. I'm sorry I didn't pull the number from the past 12 months, but it's a lot of incidences where they've noticed. You know in this instance that we have on the slide, there's a masonry issue where there's a missing hex paper that you know where someone could trip and injure themselves. We have when there are street lights that are out, that creates a security issue. Those issues are flagged for us. We have unsecured property. The when you see something say something mantra, helping folks with wayfinding issues and lost and missing persons. I'll just mention that seems to have recurred quite a bit over the course of the past few months. But there was a missing person last week that Allied helped connect with his parents, and so just there's added value there beyond just the security elements, and then just this last slide Lucian. If you don't mind just flagging that this has been, as everyone knows, a heck of a year. Allied are there for us, essential workers, and so they've been at full staff throughout the pandemics since before it started, and now through it, thankfully they've been in good health, but you know throughout it. All they've approached members of the public who haven't been wearing masks and ask them to change their behavior, which sometimes results in confrontation, and you know that's a challenging thing to do in you know April and May of a pandemic, given the circumstances and they've been truly tremendous in that regard, we with the thanks to the city and health and hospitals provided them with masks which they now distribute in the community they've distributed some but frankly, they've been getting turned down quite a bit. Over the past few weeks, there's been there's a tropical storm back in August Isaias, where, as they have after other major storms like snowstorms and other weather events, they've done a full review of the neighborhood and caution taped areas and flagged areas for our maintenance and horticulture teams to address safety issues that have arisen as a result of weather events. We talked about both the lost children that have been reconnected with family and their caregivers, and also the special patrol officer program that they've been working on expanding, but I just wanted to take a couple minutes to mention the important work that they've done over really challenging circumstances this past year, it's been heroic in many instances. So, thanks to them and again, you know this is my last slide here. We really are here to listen, but again, I just want to mention that, if, after today's meeting, if something comes to mind that you know that you didn't mention over the course of this evening, feel free to reach out to Nick, Pat or myself and be happy to have a longer conversation with you about it again, our work to improve the program is never finished and, with your help, I think we can make a lot of progress. So with that I'll hand it back to the chairwoman thanks. Thank you, Eric. Thank you, Patrick, for jumping in with the explanation, and thank you. It was a great question. It was a great review of what we have been presented with before. I am not going to speak anymore. I am going to ask Andrew Zelter whose hand was raised he took it down, but I'm going to give him the floor first. If he doesn't have anything to say then Bob Schneck, then Alex from the attendee list and then Taylor from the attendee list and Sonia from the attendee list after that so Anthony. If you want to speak Yup thanks Justine thanks so much sorry, I joined a few minutes late, so I might have missed it. But the issue of lack of visibility is that line of questioning a result of continental receiving from the community that they're incurring problems in the park and they're having difficulty locating a pep officer. That's one and then my second question is what happens in the event of a community member initiated confrontation with a pep officer. Are there any follow-up actions and I? Ask that question, because I can just speak during our little league season when the pep officers correctly ask people to relocate from the lower level to the upper level for safety reasons at times, I have to tell you it's appalling, to observe the behavior that our community displays when dealing with these pep officers and I'm just curious. If there's ever any action or follow-up, that's taken two things. So let me answer your question first and then I'm going to pass the second one to Patrick what I have heard from the community at large, whether they're emails or phone calls or texts, or just people bumping into me on the street plus my own observation. I am not necessarily looking for a ambassador and not finding them. I know where to find them if I have to I know who to recall I know go to the office so whenever I have needed, an ambassador I have managed to track one down pretty quickly. That's my personal experience. I'm hopeful that the people in the chat can add in their two cents. My comment was solely that I don't see them and that I don't notice them, which may be good and may not be good. I, don't know, but an answer to your second quest, oh and there's something else too you're calling them pep officers, no pep officers that was their old contract. These are allied universal ambassadors, so I caught myself when I said that thanks levels of people, but anyhow Patrick, if you don't mind, answering Andrew's second question about: what's that, what's the timeline and what happens Andrew yeah Patrick? Would you answer what Andrew said? Did you hear it? Could you hear me? Okay, sorry about that? Yes, I, understand the question. Really, if it's negative, if the experience is negative toward you know the safety ambassador toward the general public, that safety ambassador is no longer assigned to battery Park I move them out, okay and it has occurred where a safety ambassador used the wrong word and that safety ambassador was removed from our site. Sorry Mike. My question, first of all, I think it's been a dramatic improvement going from cup to ambassadors, so I just want to put that out there. But two. My question was: if the poor, behavior or negative interaction is a result of behavior displayed by the community member, not your ambassadors, yeah! That's what I want to yeah. Can we do anything to address that behavior and that might not I, don't know if that's a question for you for battery Park city authority or the community board, I'm not sure where that sits. Well to be honest, Alex Andrew, you know, I appreciate your coaches because there have been times where your coaches have walked over and addressed the individual. You know because of their reaction with the safety ambassador. I commend them for that, but to say that we does any follow-up on our ends with that community person. No there's not you know. After all, I don't know who that person is the safety ambassador doesn't know who the person is. All they know is it's probably a parent or a relative of some child? That's on the team: that's as far as it goes, but I have to say some of the coaches that you have. They have addressed it with the parents, so I like that yeah we try and apply zero tolerance level to our dlo parents if they're in the area and they just go off on an ambassador. We do take action in that regard and I, don't know how you do it more broadly. I, don't know that you can, but I was just curious if there was anything in place. So thanks for that, okay, thank you for your support. Alex, all that I appreciate it. Bob Schneck next and then Jill I want to make you wait until after the three public attendee members attendees, but then we'll go back so go ahead. Bob, okay, I just want to discuss a range of issues and I'm happy to reduce them to writing and send them in if we want to treat them as a whole bunch of special things, but I just wanted. I've been involved with this for a long time and I have some very general and developed opinions and, firstly, I'd like to say, like Andrew, I, really agree that it's better than pap and I have I actually handled a number of genuine dangerous encounters with pap, and they were more disappointing than my encounters with the ambassadors. Also as a follow-on to the general discussion. I also have often seen times when there were I walk five to ten miles a day now and I walk along I walk in battery park territory for most of that time and I often don't see ambassadors. So it's pretty common for me, but then I do see him sometimes and I appreciate it. But I want to talk about how those interactions work. So in the general discussion, I want to say that I really am pleased with community policing and I'm really glad to know the names of some of our local officers and I really think that they try to interact on the first name basis and they actually have business cards that they can hand to you to make contacts. And so that's a really good thing, the only interface problem that I think continues between battery Park City authority and the real 911 police. Is they still don't really know the area very well I think they can't even the ones that I know the names of if I could give them geographic tests and they couldn't pass them, which is interesting, and so in emergencies we should make sure they know where they are. I'm not sure if the ambassadors know where they are, but I presume, because they make all those interactions with those life preservers that they actually have a good sense of that. The other thing is one would hope the ambassadors know where they are. That would be that's it. We might want to get to that as a question. The other thing is, you have the police on one side of it. You have the downtown alliance on the other side, how these things kind of work together, as Pete, says, incidents cross over from one to the other. I think that's important. So then, since these guys are called ambassadors, then I in listening to the facts about the contract. What do I really expect about ambassadors, the first difference between pap and the ambassadors is they're, not armed and I. Think that's terrific I think 45 changes my relationship with anybody, holstered or not, so I'm really glad that they are unarmed, but I also feel as though an advantage of community policing is I actually know the names of some of them and I would I think that the actual guy I really love Patrick. But I really think that we should raise the stature of some of the normal people that actually do the work, so they could go to as themselves introduce themselves to the build the block meeting introduce themselves to the neighborhood, our community board meetings. So we actually get to meet some of these guys and they even could they could, even you know, maybe be stand-ins for Patrick every once in a while, because they really are community policing kind of guys. The next thing I wanted to mention about them is I often find that they really don't know much about the neighborhood. I've mentioned this before at meetings, but I think it's worth mentioning again that they really should know something about the activities, the geography and the people that are here, and they should actually strive as ambassadors to develop relationships on a first name basis with the people who work as concierges with the people who sit on the benches and are part of the community with the battery park, seniors, etc. So I think there's an opportunity there to grow. The relationship. I think one of the things I heard that seemed to be an opportunity is in the contract that said that the community could work together with the ambassador team to kind of find the assigned locations. So maybe, if Justine is interested, we can actually look at the routes that they cover and the timing. You know kind of how that stuff is set up and actually weigh in on saying yeah. That's really the best the bet given the limitations. We have that's the best way to cover it or give input to whether or not those things could be adjusted a little bit and work a little better. So I think these are good ideas. I'm cutting you short, because I really want to get to the other people on the attendee list, but I think that's a good idea. I! Think Patrick's answer to what you just said is that that's not going to be for public consumption, but that might be a working group so that, for you, know certain eyes to look at that and get input and then be able to have that information to add color, I, suppose and depth to what the how the ambassadors are being evaluated and their performance not personally like I, don't care performance review but how they are serving us as the public. So that's a conversation, one more quick point that I wanted to make a little question could be thrown into that. It's real, quick I think it's an important one. They there have been there's been the idea of the development of the special patrol officer and we I think as a community board might want to direct that and talk about what they do and how they do it and have a better understanding of what tickets they can issue. What the police is, what responsibilities the police are willing to yield to them in the future and kind of how that could develop so that there's actually community input in that and I. That's my voice. Thank you. Bob now and I appreciate that and I think that if the people in the chat do speak up, I think you're gonna hear questions along those lines: okay, so Alex, Lucien, first unmute, Alex and then Taylor, then Sonia and then we'll go to Jill and then Kathy no problem shuffle some of these windows around so I can find them. Yeah, that's okay. You said Alexi, first, okay, Alexa you're good to go great! Thank you. So, first of all I thank Patrick for his great work. That's point number one and I'd like to reiterate the visibility issue that we might not see many ambassadors around. So I've observed that as well, and so there was a question of what's the. What are expectations- and you know, suggestions so I would say that one could have ambassadors set good examples by their own action. So let me explain some negative sound issues that don't set good examples. So, for instance, safety ambassadors have had been seen walking next to each other, say two three ambassadors together without face coverings, which is against the New York state regulations. Unless this member, they are members of the same household. So that's not a great example. So another instance they have been seen entering the 200th raptor place location without a face mask, and so they put they possibly endanger Patrick, who shares the same office with them. An ambassador was seen smoking in teardrop park, while smoking is not permitted in any of the parks and ambassadors have been using their personal cell phones while on the job so I think. By not doing these things, it would be. You know they would be set in a better example. So these are my comments. Okay, I could just please to the extent that there is a record I want to say that ambassadors need to be wearing a mask at all times, right in the course of their in the course of their duties and in compliance with the governor's executive order smoking in the park. It's something that an ambassador would instruct. You know another parks user that they can not do and they're. In fact, you know the police have issued summonses for those violations. So again the issues that you're raising Lexi are important ones and again, to the extent that the ambassadors have been safe throughout the pandemic. You know, is, you know, I feel very fortunate, but it relies on mask wearing and those types of precautions and so I. You know to the extent that you see those things happening and I direct this not just to you but to the rest of the attendees today we want to know about it because that behavior isn't acceptable. You know, but everyone needs to be wearing a mask right now, so the numbers are increasing and it's nothing could be more important. So that's good to hear Eric and I appreciate that and I guess what I'd like to say is I know: Alexi has been speaking to Patrick. I, know that he's very good about taking pictures and bringing springing stuff up and I guess what is concerning to me is what's being done about it and I'm sure that that's the part of what he's not saying and I don't know. If there's an answer, people Patrick can give us or not give us but yeah. The answer pretty much is if a safety ambassador is going into 200 he's on break on the inside, so he's going into he or she is going in to have their meal. Okay, there's usually no more than two safety ambassadors inside on break at the same time and they're split up because there's a kitchen with a table and then there's the back room: okay, they're permitted to take off the face, mask to eat and drink, while they're back there and they're in there for about a half an hour and then they're back out on their post. Okay, so that that's what happens there? If you see three safety ambassadors, I'm not happy hearing I. If you see two one is usually a supervisor inspecting the safety ambassador out on the site. Okay, so three, I'm not happy about hearing, but you know I, don't know what day it occurred. So if- and this is what I've always put out there, if I'm notified about it as it occurred that day, you know and at roughly your time I can bring it up and find out who it was and then I take care of it through you know, Allied has progressive discipline and that's what we deal with excellent, that's good to hear Patrick. Thank you and yes, people certainly have to take their masks off to eat, but in coming in and coming out, they should be wearing masks, especially inside, and you know, but the people sitting at the desk should have their masks on unless they're eating or drinking right. That makes sense and quick question what about ambassador smoking himself? Smoking smoking's not permitted at all. It's a park and you're not supposed to be smoking in the park at all, because that's some of the rules they're supposed to be enforcing is to keep people not smoking, so they should not be smoking. I mean that might be just a notice that you send out Patrick because I'm assuming they're doing it. If Alexi is saying, he's seen it so it just might be a refresher to say: hey, listen, it's illegal to smoke in the parks. That means you too anyway, but that would be great all right. Thank you, Alexis! Thank you for speaking up Taylor. Can you hear me? Okay, hi? This is Taylor a resident of battery park, city and I. Guess I just wanted to share quickly that I've had positive experiences with the ambassadors myself and have seen many ambassadors in the evenings along Esplanade, so just to add a little I guess: I have an alternative point there or side and have been able to get assistance from ambassadors from having issues that was really helpful. So I really found ambassadors really useful for me, but I had a quick question on two shoes that are really serious in my opinion or serious to me down here. Luckily, they're not as serious as many other neighborhoods face, but they bugged me in one smaller one: the noise of car exhausts even on South, End, Avenue I, know there's not much. We can do about West Street, but on South End Avenue like really loud cars off sometimes like these weird altered cars that can push fire out of the back of their vehicle. The other is NYPD not wearing masks. So I was just wondering what the ambassadors could do for those two things. What I can do and then the third one was dog owners allowing their dogs on no dog grass areas in the evenings. It. You know it's not a major issue. It just bugs me and I have mentioned it once to an ambassador like a year ago, and they kind of walked away from me and I was like well, okay, I guess they can't really do much. So I was just curious like on those three things: I guess what can an ambassador do? What can I do as a president? Thank you so much thanks, Taylor, I'm the first person to let Patrick talk to the third one. They should be telling people to put their leashes on and get off the grass, but go ahead Taylor at night, which park are you referring that the dogs were on the grass? Are you over by Wagner Park or where I was one of one night I see that often, and then also on Rector Street, the oval parks on the two oval lawns on rector place like right outside of shore and then down the other one? Okay, just as a question, do you recall roughly what time just so, usually like after nine or ten it's in the evening? Okay, it's when the sun's down I can see it out my window. Obviously it's not a major issue. It just bugs me having dogs and not going on there and growing up and playing there. It's like oh gosh, I know the babies go on there because I know it's dog free, so yeah, not a problem. I mean okay, I'll have them out there around that time, especially in those two locations, and if they see someone you know doing it, I'll have them be issued a ticket. Thank you so much I appreciate that and for the car exhaust one on Southern Avenue. What is the best thing for me to do? I'm just curious. Can an ambassador do anything at all when you're saying car exhaust I think you're, meaning the revving of the engines or the yeah? Sorry yeah I don't know cars that well, but that sound when they speed up break. It's like a popping sound, a really loud sound. It's often in the evening and like I, said I know West Street. We can't do much about that, but it's happened multiple times on south end, one car I've seen many times now and even parks here and then drives off. So I'm just curious. Can an ambassador do anything about that, not really other than you know. If they happen to see it is to speak to the individual, you know about revenant, but you know if he may continue to rev. You know rev the engine, but his there's really no teeth in anything to it, even a police officer. If he was there, he'd have to sit and watch the guy. Do it for three minutes before he could write him a Solomon's and then it would be in Ecb summits and environmental Patrol Board summits, okay, so my question then is: does our neighborhood have a sound limit like I've seen that in other neighborhood signs, for you know, excessive sound and car honking and stuff I feel like this would definitely fall into that category if our neighborhood had something like that for, like ticketing for excessive sound use of it from a vehicle, I'm not aware of anything like that. Yeah I mean and also the whole concept of ticketing. Only the as it was at five. We have only the five special patrol officers can actually give out the tickets so part of the deal as Andrew noted, the difference between the ambassadors and the pep officers, as the pep officers had guns and the pep officers had ability to arrest and had an ability to issue tickets, which the ambassadors do not so when Patrick says no teeth, that's kind of what he mean, not that he's looking to shoot people or whatever. That's hitting me in the background like what are you talking about? That's not what I meant, but in terms of enforcement, it's a lesser level, so there's a lesser level of enforcement. So that would be the issue and then hearing what about the three minutes? That's kind of crazy. It is disturbing. Okay. Thank you. So much, that's really helpful. I guess my last question would be if this committee would at all be interested or willing to put forth a resolution asking for a you know: NYPD official sound limit I know I've seen it in other neighborhoods, like I, said about like no honking here, five fines over this amount and it could apply to these sounds as well and while maybe not many people could actually give those tickets I think some friends are a deterrent. So anyway, for all you do. Let's make a note of that because that's an interesting concept, it's not a bad idea. We could put the list who you would have to reach out to is the first precinct to the community. Affairs office speak to them. Okay, they usually handle, if there's protests, and they have the louds loudspeakers and little horns. They usually deal with the noise complaints dealing with that, but they can direct you as to what can and can't be done with it. Okay, cool! Thank you all right, thank you. Taylor Sonya's next and I just want to let Andres know that I'm going to go to the board next, because their hands have been up for a while Jill and then Kathy and then Andres so go ahead. Sonia there you go. Oh hello, yes yep. We hear you hi, I'm a resident since 2009 I have two school-age children and I first wanted to comment on Patrick's, I'm the one who reached out when that I think it was a few days ago with respect to the ambassador, throwing something at two passerbys. They had ambassador written on the back of their jacket. Now I walk like five to seven miles a day: I walk through the marina all the time. I'm well aware of that. Brookfield has security in who those security officers are. This person had ambassador so I know. He said that they hired a new security team. Do they have ambassador written on the back of their jacket too, because this one had ambassador on the back of their jacket, but he says it was Brookfield. Security So Brookfield has been separate so before Patrick. Then you can answer this they've always been separate. They patrol the Marina area, so they're, the ones who will be telling you get off your bicycle. That's right, I, it yeah I know who they are. Okay, that's who he's talking about, but now Patrick. Please answer because that's considered, he was throwing things at people. Why, or do you know throwing he was throwing like it looked like crumpled I had just approached as they were arguing and a couple was passing and he was his back was turned towards me. So I saw ambassador on the back of his jacket. So that's why I reached out to Patrick and Nick, but Patrick is saying that was Brookfield Security, but to my knowledge, field, security doesn't have ambassador written on the back of their jacket. Nice go ahead. Paddle you start out. So thanks Sonia, it's Nick Spordone. How are you I had a chance to? Thank you a little earlier. I want to be clear. I, don't think that we're saying it was Brookfield security. What we're saying is it wasn't an ambassador as far as we can tell, because we don't patrol the area and it wasn't an ambassador walking to or from his or her post through the area. What we did say is Brookfield has a uniform presence in that area. It doesn't mean who you saw was Brookfield. It means we don't have any indication to think that it was any one of our ambassadors. I'm not that's different than saying it was Brookfield I, don't want to point it forward. Brookfield, but I did send you information about Alex at Brookfield, who should be able to look into it further for you and whether it was his person or not Nick. Can we help do that because that's disturbing the board to look into it? Is that something that could be done just to see I? Don't like the idea of someone having that interaction with the community member, whether it's Brookfield, whether it's? What can we do with this I mean I, sent it to I sent Sonya the information I can send it to Alex as well. You're welcome to do it. I know we're all world busy folks, not that I want to give this short shrift. You know it's I, don't do it. You don't need to contact Alex in addition to Sonya, contacting him review contact but you're right. No, I'm going to try separately because I know nothing but Sonia. Maybe if you reach out, please copy me and I'd like to be just I mean I'm just commenting here, because they did have ambassadors on the back of their jacket and it was someone who was obviously stationed there. It wasn't someone that was walking by he seemed to be. He seemed to be at a post. So that's why I reached out to make a package yeah when you say at a post, I'm curious as to where exactly was the person who's. The safety ambassador at oh, like at the bottom of the ramp, where Pj Clark's on the Pj clock side like when you're coming out when you're passing Pj, Clark's and Pj Clark is on your right and you go up the ramp to walk west towards the river. He was standing right there and he wasn't moving as he was throwing something at them. He just had his back towards them. He just was throwing something as if he was stationed there, so he was on the bottom of the ramp, like with a sign that get off your bike. Yes, exactly right. There, okay I'll end up interviewing everybody that worked that day to find out. I just would like to know and I guess. I'd like part of what I find so valuable about. Allied is the fact that we have community police. We have like a neighborhood police and community police in our community, and this kind of accountability is just exactly what is wonderful about what I would be getting out of Allied. So thank you, Patrick and thank you Sonya for bringing it forward. This is a follow-up that I think is important. Just to get down to the bottom of it and figure it out find out what it could have been. The people's fault. I, don't know, yeah, no I, yeah I, don't know I mean, but you know the person is working and supposed to be a professional. So it whatever, even if it was the people's fault, it's still something that's not really acceptable, correct and yeah the reason. One of the reasons why I asked specifically where it was is because I know the supervisor and a safety ambassador was dealing with somebody who they had a bicycle incident on the esplanade and the person was busy swinging an object at everybody and cursing at everybody as they were going along, so they had to ask them to leave, but that would be two of them. So you should have saw two people in a jacket, but that was on the opposite side from when you're telling me this occurred, so I'll end up interviewing everybody that worked that day on that shift and find out, and you have that information the day and the basic time from so now, yeah, there's post assignment sheets, I know everybody that works. Oh yeah, and you know when Sonya said well. Sonia. Thank you yes very helpful. So I'm hoping other people who have something to say please speak up. Please raise your hand and speak up, but go ahead. Tell me we're going to say something else: I also just wanted to comment quickly on the I think it was Taylor who spoke about the dogs like at night. I mean I've. Seen dogs when the parks police were present. I saw them telling people your dog can't go there. You're done, you know telling people they can't smoke. I, don't see that anymore. I, don't see people telling people. This is a park you're, not a lot of smoke. I mean people are smoking. Weed people are smoking, cigarettes, dogs are playfully running on West, tames turf, you know all hours and then I also with another member of the community, helped to clean up dog feces. A few weeks ago, when ambassadors three of them came out, one of them said he was a supervisor they had no masks on. They were about six inches from me. I had a mask on and he's telling me that kids should not be going in the garden bed. I, don't even know my kids weren't in the garden bed, but that's not really an acceptable. You know response to someone who's just trying to like clean up, because it was being smeared everywhere on the turf. What would well okay? So this is a combination I'd like to have. What would you expect the ambassadors to do and what would be I mean- and I'm asking that of you, but also of Patrick, and what can we do to solve the problem? I'm assuming it's dog feces and yes, the kids. It's gross that someone will let their dog go there and not pick it up, that's disgusting and wrong. But what can we do with that? Well, they told me they were calling maintenance and they told a few other residents who went into the office that they were calling maintenance, but maintenance wasn't picking up and finally, three hours later, two and a half hours later, we just decided that we had to clean it up ourselves because there were all these little kids running around and you know it's a health hazard yeah, it's close I mean it's disgusting. Maintenance did show up they and they told us that maintenance left, but maintenance did not leave. They came when it was too late when you just cleaned it, took them up hours to get there, and this was during the daytime, so they were on when they were late afternoon. So I just have to answer that because they did quote, they did call for maintenance. Okay, it's documented and they did email maintenance and there is a report. Maintenance showed up approximately 40 minutes later from the time of the email. Okay, no, they didn't. The time of the email might have been later than the time of the report. Yeah well I, I'm just letting you know what it is and what we have as documented. Oh yeah, I'm not doubting that they didn't call maintenance, I'm just telling what happened that it was over two hours and we finally decided we have to clean it up. It was getting dark and then mate and then maintenance did show up about 7:30 or something like that. I, don't remember the exact time it was dark when they showed up. We were trying to get it cleaned up before it got dark because kids were still running around and it was a warm day. You know I didn't say it was their responsibility, I'm just saying you know and I, don't doubt that they didn't call maintenance, I'm just telling you what happened, but I guess, but I did I was not happy with the way these three ambassadors came out, not wearing masks. Approached me and this other mom and said kids should not be running across the garden bed and then said to me you're a resident. You should be telling people that they shouldn't be walking their dogs where they're not supposed to be walking their dogs. That's what he said to me: no, that's what so, just for the record Patrick! That's what we're asking the ambassadors to do if they're around, to tell people not to walk their dogs. That is a certainly within their job description and shouldn't fall on residents unless they really feel the need to do that. Sonia. Thank you for speaking up sure I appreciate that I don't know that I have a solution, but what I will tell you next time is call me. You have my phone number I believe. Okay, thank you call me next time and yeah I. Will I'd like to be involved in real time, so thank you. Okay, you're welcome, so next would be Jill and then Kathy and then Andre hi yeah, my camera's, not working so I apologize two-part question. The first part touches a little bit on what Taylor had mentioned. It's a question about scope of services for the ambassadors and has to do with a lot of the traffic issues on South End Avenue a little bit less since the pandemic, because there's less buses, but does it fall within their scope? When you see a lot of buses and double parking and idling for us to call 311, it will take forever and it's just not a process that could be done in the moment. Does it fall within their scope of services to tell those buses to not double park and not to idle I can take the first crack and then Pat can follow up with what happens on the ground, but the vehicle and traffic law which govern some of the like the moving violations and the parking violations are not part of the special patrol officer's scope. The police department did not give the special patrol officers that ability, at the same time something that the ambassadors do regularly is to simply ask for folks to move along. It happens a lot at the southern end of South end Avenue that cul-de-sac there, where folks often sit or idle there- and you know I- see reports almost daily of them simply just asking them to no longer idle there and nine times out of ten I would say they move along. So to that extent, it's within their scope to ask folks to stop breaking the rule, but in terms of actually writing a ticket for it. It's not okay, but in terms of I've seen buses parking. You know double parking at the bus stops and after one of our neighbors was killed by a bus, because her the view was obscured by two buses. I. Think it's a major safety issue in this neighborhood. Is there a way for people in this neighborhood to know how to contact an ambassador in such a situation or another one? Is there a way to have a phone number to contact the Ambassador office? Put on the signage you know, battery Park city park parks has signage all over. Would it make sense? Would it help the neighborhood would address some of these issues when people can not find an ambassador and need? One here is the number of the office. If you need an ambassador call, this number- yes for sure, and the number is 945 safe or seven, two three. We try to post it as ever everywhere we can wherever we can find, but if you wanna to jot it down it's two one, two, nine four five safe. So if we get that make sure it's in all of those whatever you call the signage things they have all over for the park. Is that something we might do and that might help people yeah I can speak to Craig Huron, who manages those times and will next year, so we can advocate to Nick in real time but including the ambassador's numbers. It's certainly something we could discuss in time. Okay, the second part of my question has to do with the ambassadors themselves and oftentimes, especially in the you know, part of the winter I look out my window and I see the ambassadors in the freezing cold in the snow on the esplanade, and you know checking in and walking I'm curious to know, because also just thinking as for you know, someone who had employed people who in the past is I'm curious. What is the turnover? What is the length of import employment for the ambassadors, and I'm particularly talking about the you know the folks who are out walking the parks in the streets? Also? Is this a minimum wage job? What does their salary look like and what kind of incentives do they receive for doing good work? Pat? Do you want to take it or can I can take the first crack? If you want, or since they're your employees, you can take the you can take the first crack good. All right with regards to tenure. I would bifurcate the roster. There are some folks who have been on our project since literally the first day of the project back in I, think it was 2016. and those folks in many instances have been promoted to supervisor or to special patrol officer as a result of being great at their jobs and sticking around. So to the extent that there's opportunities for growth in the role, that's one way that I think that I don't again I, don't want to speak for him and he's right here. So we can speak for himself, but one way that he's retained, talented folks, there's also some folks that, as you just mentioned, you know it's a really tough job that you know if it's bleeding out for four days straight and you you're required to walk the streets. Some folks decide that it's not for them and they may choose employment elsewhere, and so there's some folks who have turned over relatively quickly. But then they're I would say lots more if I remember correctly. The last time, Pat and I pulled the numbers. It was like the of the allied staff separating out the subcontractor that works for allied of the Allied staff. The mode tenure was the full duration of the project. So if you were to just randomly encounter an ambassador, the you would more often than any other instance encounter someone who's been on the project the entire time and then, with regards to sorry here you have a last question and I'm now blanking on it. Oh, it was about wages, it's a prevailing wage position, that's governed by a city mandated prevailing wage schedule, and is that minimum premium minimum wage or is it just different levels for different positions? It's different levels for different employees, but it's published by the comptroller's office. You could see, but it's higher than that of the homework. Thank you very much. Pat. How did I do you did excellent? You got the job, all right cool! Thank you for your questions, Jill all right! Next Kathy Tammy, unless you like wave at me somehow and tell me you want me to break you and make you go first, I'm gonna go with the order that of people who come in order, so it would be Kathy, Andres, Sarah, Amy and then Tammy, but will you wave send an evil message to Lucian and he can first thank you. Go ahead, Kathy, okay, so I was late and I apologize if this was addressed earlier in the meeting, but I'm wondering if there is an overall communications plan of any kind on the work that allied does were just public information. You know I'm I've lived here for a while, like I'm at these meetings. Obviously I know to keep the allied number in my cell phone I would bet that no one else on my floor. Does that or knows you know I hear comments like they're, always looking at their cell phones and they don't know that that's kind of a way of checking in and reporting. It would be great following up on what Bob said to have an occasional meet officer, Rodriguez or some kind of a profile in the local paper. If you have a story like helping a lost child find their parents, you know what a great profile some good work they do and just you know we had a lot of discussion about allied when the contract first flipped. But since then there's been almost nothing out there lots of new people in the neighborhood. You know the signs, don't necessarily they should be in the parks, but why don't the doormen's desks have a little tent. That says, if you see something in the park, you know call this number, for you know a little while, and so I'm just putting it out there and to think about and wondering how you see it. Yeah on the public affairs front, I would want to defer to Nick, but I will say that I'm trying to think through the is there a frog on the line. Are you folks hearing a rivet that might be me, mute myself? Okay, you have a pet Matthew, it's those wonderful gateways! Okay, exactly go ahead, got it I think it's important for us to try to strike the balance between. If you see something again to the extent that it's an urgent issue, we want the message to be that folks should call 911 and so I wouldn't want to do anything that could detract from that overarching message. At the same time, I take your point that there needs to be a greater understanding in the community about allies role, which I think I again commend the chair for having this meeting to discuss, but also, maybe you know, maybe Nick. We could reach out to property managers and provide some information to the buildings on. You know what exactly they should be contacting the command center desk for and that we could align that better. But I wouldn't want someone to say. Oh my gosh, you know I'm witnessing a crime, I'll call the command center and they'll address this issue right. No, that's not their role. That makes sense, but that's also part of the communication of once. They realize it's not their role. People are told that that's not what they're going to do. Yeah I think that's right, so yeah we make it a point and thank you Kathy and Jill. So I make it a point. Every month, when I'm here in front of the committee and as a standing item in my report, I have information about the first precinct, the NCOS and about allied and every month is printed, the phone number and the email address and the physical address. Now again that just gets us to the point where people who are attending these meetings regularly or checking the reports see it. But again, every little bit helps right. Every time I get an email from a member of the community. Hey there's an incident going on in the neighborhood about issue a b or c I. Will you know oftentimes be sending that to pat unless he's already copied on it and reminding folks that, thank you and then you know thanks for reaching out to me, you can always reach me because I'm available, obviously, but for quality of life type issues like this. Please call email or visit in person. So, every time I get the opportunity I try to push that out and I'd be very surprised. I'd be very surprised that building managers didn't know how to contact ally, but that's just me that doesn't necessarily mean that that's so we're in general contact with the building managers. Anyway, we can make another pass and ensure that they are the building manager. What ally does and how to contact them, and you know I, don't know that we can tell them to post the sign that we can compel them to do it. But it's not a bad idea. Sure again, just like Eric said, though I don't want to I, don't want to think people think that calling allied is a substitute for 911 right, a crime in progress or an emergency situation. First move should always be whether it be Justine, Coochie, Nick, Spordone or Allied, or anyone else. Your first move should be 911 for that best gray area. Where you know, I can use an assist with something: I need a walk home or there's a dog on the lawn or there's graffiti, or you know, quality of life type things, noise, complaints that are not an emergency of nature, then sure Allied is the people allies, the number you should call or contact, and then they can be there and assist and kind of make that determination, whether or not it needs to be escalated to the first precinct or elsewhere. So yeah we can we'll take a pass with the buildings as well, and you know we're always happy to give exposure to the great men and women are valid, who are doing their jobs, but we also you know they do their jobs with or without the recognition. So it's a good point, though, there's an opportunity to get a profile for someone who does a great job, then we wouldn't want to. We wouldn't want to look past that yeah I mean in your report, where you have like the you focus on the person for the month. That would be a good thing, but also I suggest that beyond just the building managers who don't always talk to the people, maybe perhaps the boards that and I notice in the attendee list a few names that I recognize from boards of buildings in the neighborhood, maybe that's a conversation that they want to have with their boards to say, inviting the Gary, Park City Authority, to come to a board meeting and say: hey. Who are you what's going on and have Patrick come and they happen once a year? So it's not like it's a lot, although I guess with 18 buildings that might be 18 more days of your life, you know whatever and not everybody would want to do it, but that's you know what we do it's. What we do if boards want to invite us we will. We would be happy too yeah. So that's thank you and schedule. Sure I mean that's what we do. We want to be we're here to serve the other thing that I wanted to mention in regards to that Justine, we do what's called the emergency residential radio checks. So all of these builder managers were issued radios. You know the authorities okay, so that when something happens so that when something happens on property, the authority can transmit a message out as to a direction as to either what's going on or what their response should be like, for instance, the terrorist attack yeah, a transmission was put out to the building managers, to seal your doors, to lock up all your doors until the police had the area sealed off and then the arrest was made and then their message went out to the all clear for them to open up. That's right, that's excellent! Pat! You know: I had been in the office so sporadically due to this. You know this pandemic. That I have totally forgotten about that. But yes, that's a very good point. We would be sitting in the office and periodically I think it's once a week or more. We would have just regular radio checks with the buildings to make sure that they all had their radios and they all you know, yeah. You know for short distance communications or like that and some years ago now, I can't believe. It's this long already, maybe a year or so ago, or more Patrick and I worked with some of the schools as well to make sure that where there were gaps for buildings that had radios or for schools that had radios, so we got them provisioned with radios as well. So that's another excellent point. Thank you pat yeah. Now that is very good. That is very good, but that doesn't address the individual people who live here, but that's a very good point because it's nice to know the buildings are connected. Okay, thank you. I'm gonna jump to so Andres took his hand down and disappeared. Andres are you there? Do you want to speak? Is he still on online I? He chatted with me. I think he's going to raise his hand for item four. Oh okay, I really promise we're gonna get there, so speaking of which we do have other things to talk about. It's 7:30 we started late. I want to give this 10 more minutes or so, but I see that okay Sonia spoke already, we've got Amy, but I did say that Sarah and Tammy and then Amy. If that's, okay, just I'm doing it in the order of hands raised so Sarah, first Sarah Cassell hi, I'm just curious about subcontractors. You've mentioned subcontractors several times so battery proxy authority, hires, allied and then Allied hires subcontractors. Is that what's happening? Yes, so as part of our minority and women-owned business enterprise and service disabled veteran-owned business goals, we have goals as an authority across the board for prime contractors to subcontract with organizations that fit those criteria and are certified by the state, and so, as part of the procurement that we did last year, we required a 30 goal for M/ WBE and six percent goal for service disabled veterinary businesses, and so they ally presented their project team with us when they interviewed with us, and so you know, 30 of the ambassador hours that you encounter in the parks are run by a minority and women-owned business enterprise city, safe partners. Okay, are they trained by Allied or do they come trained? I was just curious as to the standards yeah pat, you can speak more to this. I will say that there they all are required to take the state's security officer training, but Pat. Do you want to speak a little bit more to what city safe requires of their employees? Oh yeah, when a city safe employee, they have to take the 8 hour and 16 hour state test and they have to maintain their license, which requires them to take an eight-hour course every year. Also, when they come on site, they go through desktop training. Basically, at the start of the project, the authority set up training for Us upper management and the first set of safety ambassadors, and what we did was we created slides I did that training after video in it and that's a desktop training, it's about approximately six different presentations, including the history of the park and all the park rules and the breakdown and then when they go out just like any Allied safety, Ambassador supervisor goes out with them when they're new shows them. The posts shows them where all the geotags are located. I believe that they're trained I was just curious and the way they were referred to instead of being allied employees but as subcontractors was confusing, okay, but put it this way, our supervisors supervise them. Okay, and if there's any issue, the issues are taken care of right away. Great. Thank you. You're welcome thanks, Sarah, all right Tammy, thank you for being patient and then Amy. Yes, thank you. I will be on video, but I've got the background because we're cooking, it's a question for Patrick and for Eric, who may jump in when I asked about staffing levels in the spring, because we were told that staff there wouldn't be an uptick in staffing due to Covid-19 and the reduced usage. It was staying at the plan at the time in March and April I believe was to stay at stat levels. So I'd like to know if the new contract is seasonally adjusted and is that, based on the labor levels used for 2019 versus 2020, looking ahead in the budget, that's my first question. My second question is: there was an incident a couple weeks ago, which 76 was alerted from not only a citizen's app but also from another one of the schools that there had been a man with a knife walking up and down towards the end of South Bend Avenue I wondered what the alert system looked like between Allied and the schools. If I could find that out in terms of alert and then you know denial of what is happening as well, so they can be released and then thirdly, the next when was the contract up and renewed this year, because I have a follow-up question for that. So thank you. I will take questions one and three since they're contract related and I'll just mention that I remember getting alert about that. Rather frightening incident on I thought it's battery place, not south End Avenue, where that incident happened. Right Tammy, yes, yeah I'll leave Pat to respond to that specific incident. So, with regards to the contract, we the contract is for, did I wish you there or did I lose others. No, we hear you I, think Tim. You can hear me. Okay, I just got an alert on my webex that my connection was slow, so I wanted to make sure yesterday, okay, so the contract is for five years and it's what we call a not to exceed amount. So it enables us to basically to flex according to what the budget is. So the board of Battery Park City Authority approves the budget for contracted security services annually, and they allowed me to work with Pat and his team to set staffing levels, not just with regards to the seasonality, but also depending on the needs that are arising in the neighborhood. And so you know, if we, if a holiday arrive, you know arrive, and it turns out that the kids are going to be out of school and we want to make sure that there's sufficient coverage in one park or another park or at the ball fields or etcetera, then we can adjust that way at the risk of sharing what we would. Rather not we. You know, we've introduced split shifts over the term of the contract to allow for some additional coverage during certain times of day, where we have found that we needed more coverage in certain areas of the parks, and so we have a lot of flexibility and again, though, I won't discuss the actual numbers. I'd be happy to hear from you folks about where you see the greatest deeds in the parks both with regards to geography and with regards to time of day- and you know that's something that we as a team has been working on over the term of the contract to make sure that we're calibrating the staffing right. The just the last note that I'll say on that is that it's, though Allied is a large organization that can draw on lots of resources, including on their subcontractors, to Sarah's point. We do train the staff to make sure that folks aren't completely approaching their job de Novo, and so it sometimes can take a little bit to ramp up or ramp down. But I will say that this year, as a to answer, your first question more directly, I believe that we ramped up a bit in the springtime. Even you know, even despite Covey, just in light of the fact that we had more folks in our parks. I don't know if you remember it feels like a decade ago, but we were really concerned about the park being overrun in the early spring, just because folks were so eager to get out of their houses. You know after the initial lockdown I apologize, because I dropped the laptop in the middle of it. But did you say that the future contract is based off of more or less staffing levels from 2019 versus 2020? What I'm saying is that it's a five-year contract and the amount of the contract is set for the entire five years, and so we can flex within the five years the amount that we spend on security is set by our board as part of the annual budget process. So we make a proposal to them based on what we perceive our security needs to be, and they approve or ask for changes to that, but we're up until were there up until 2024 were able to flex within the not to exceed them out of the contract and the contract. Was there a contract review? Just this year was last year that we did a fresh procurement in 2019. It took effect on the 19th of November in 2019, and it expires in November 18th of 2024 got it okay. Thank you very much and then I. The last thing on the middle one was the incident on battery place, but I do see. You've got the spos there and I assume on Justine's note that there is the same number, if not more, of spos than we had existing from the prior contract. That's correct, so I was mentioning earlier. The licensing division at NYPD took a bit of a pause during Covid-19, but thankfully, before that took place, Pat was able to get some sbos trained and appointed by the police department. So we don't have the full roster that we've been seeking, but not for lack of trying, and you know in our contract it explicitly states the expansion of the program and it's our goal to be fully staffed up as soon as the licensing division reopens the floodgates. But I would imagine there'll be many in line Eric said earlier. We have five now and we're looking to staff up to 11. Manny. Thanks. Sorry about that. No thank you all right. So then Amy did Amy. You took your hand down. No Amy should be speaking. Amy speak your turn. Take her off. Oh yeah, hurry! I'm still up! Sorry, it's just not showing me so Amy is next! Please Sonia spoke already solution on me. You name me! No I did take my hand down. Can you hear me I can hear you Amy, but why not you've got stuff to say so. Please say it come on no I. Don't think this is the appropriate forum for the things I have to say. I am glad that Sonia spoke because she has witnessed some things and raised her hand. I'm I think it's unfortunate that she did not get the response. That I think she is due, but I think that's representative of the neighborhood, which is why I said I mean there should be more people on this call. As you know, Justine I, post I, don't know stories, because people complain in social media on a regular basis and not they do two people. You know so I only posted today's meeting. The fact that people did not attend I'm disappointed by but I think that's representative of the lack of faith in the response by either the authority or the allied or the community board. I don't know to whom. But it is not my role to be the voice of it. I'm just saying for someone like sunny who did speak up and who I knew about the incident immediately because she was very concerned. She says and reports to the authority and to the allied responsible people that a person with a jacket that says, ambassador and I specifically asked her that when she wrote to me and said this happened and the incident and I said yellowjackets, you know it might have been security. If she says it's ambassador, it's an ambassador. The answer is, we will look into it. Yeah and I. Guess in a former life I had a business and I had contractors who I outsource products to. If my client called me with a complaint revolving an incident or something a transaction with my vendor, my answer was I own it I'm sorry, I will look into it and we will get back to you with a resolution. Yes, it wasn't well see I, think it wasn't a defense, it wasn't a give me more prove it to me and that's where the disconnect that I have is, which is why I took my hand down so I'm gonna take my hand down and stop talking, because that's my disconnect consistently and I appreciate, Eric and Nick and pat all the conversations that we have, but we're still in that same place where residents are saying. This is my concern, or this is what I have seen and unless they also live here and walk the same streets to have them invalidated or to have their responses perceived as they need to prove is to me not the mission statement of the battery Park city authority, nor upholding the contract that they have signed on behalf of the residents with Allied. So with that, that's all I'm going to say: I have no more complaints. I appreciate everyone speaking I wish. More residents did but I think this I. This needs to go beyond the community board, no disrespect to community board but and I appreciate all you do truly Justine for raising this and I'm sorry more people didn't come to the table. Okay, wait! Nick! Before you speak, let me say something so: first of all Amy. Thank you number one. No disrespect taken towards me. I, appreciate your frustration. I will attest to the fact that after Amy brought some of this to my attention and her frustration, I signed up for that. Neighborhood chat that she's talking about whatever it's called and she is correct. There are a lot of vehement complaints about things, and one of one is some of the stuff that was complained about I believe some is not within the purview of what the job is of the ambassadors and I we're going so late. Now, part of the conversation has to do with homeless people and we're not we haven't gotten to that, which is what we're going to do. My point is, but that's my piece, but I'm not yet wait. Let me finish him because you're right, what is within the purview of the ambassadors and I'm sorry with of the battery Park City authority and Allied, is responding in a way that solves the problem, so where I was trying to go with Sonia and what I wanted to I feel as if I thought we got there, but we didn't get there at least from the position of the community who are listening on the phone I. The incident of the ambassador, whether it's Brookfield or whether it is allied Universal, is the responsibility of the battery proximity authority to figure out having a email sent back to Sonya, saying you contact Brookfield, I'm sorry, I'm gonna say this because I didn't make it clear. That's not acceptable. I would like that. I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to reply. Please do no! That's okay, because I know you're gonna be frustrated and I know you know. No. My feeling this is something that is obviously very serious. It is government is serious work yeah for serious people. I've dedicated my career to service and the good Lord willing I'll continue to do so for as long as I'm had anywhere that will have me. Amy I would respectfully disagree that people don't have faith in our response and if they do, they shouldn't I'm here. Every month I've been here every month for the past 50 something months at the Battery Park City Committee every month, often with a 10-page report answering any and all questions every month our board meets with a public comment session. We have this past year about three dozen or so public hearings, most of which were on targeted topics like resiliency sustainability, but my name is Nick Spordone, I'm at the 646-531-2276 of every report. Sometimes people like to complain, and they don't necessarily like to show up. I'm not saying that's the case now, but we're here every month, and we will continue to be here every month so long as the community continues to have us. Amy we've had lengthy conversations, I value them I know sometimes that we, you know, go back and forth like siblings, but that's part of the process. We're committed to making sure this neighborhood is as good as it can be, and frankly, it is best neighborhood in New, York City, if I might say so, myself I don't live in it, but I've seen the work that goes into keeping this neighborhood absolutely top notch, but could I just as a point, though Nick I think it's important. The other thing I would add on Sonia. I'm sorry just on Sonia is, and thank you for the note so Sony emailed us Monday morning, I sent it over to pat within a few minutes. The first time I have heard that the fellow was wearing a jacket with the word ambassador on it was this evening at this meeting it was not included in Sony's original note and I can send it just in if you'd like to see it. Here's what happened here was the location, and here was the description of it. I sent it to pat and Pat noted. We do not have anyone stationed in that area. That is not where we have people stationed. Moreover, we don't have anyone who was in that area associated with the island ambassadors during the time when Sonia reported it. So that's what I wrote back to Sonia and I said you know there is a uniform presence. That book field has that you may maybe wanna may want to check with them, but this is as far as I'm seeing not ours. Now new information has been introduced where the assertion is that, while the person is wearing an ambassador jacket, okay Patrick said which I hope is a sufficient response. Okay, I will sit and I will interview every one of the people who I have on staff now I, don't know what uniforms that people wear who are not. Maybe there are other people who wear ambassador jackets. I, don't know if the suggestion that we are not taking this seriously or that we were dismissing it out of hand, is absolutely untrue and I would like the record to reflect that. We responded fulsomely and timely and we will continue to examine to make sure that it wasn't an ambassador and if it was then Patrick and Eric will take the appropriate actions. Nick, wait, sorry can I just interject, yeah and I said I really I said I have told Justine I've told Lucci in this I really don't think this is the community board. Is the proper forum to address personally this issue for me, I think it needs to escalate, but what you're saying Nick and you and I have talked for years and you know I like you and you're a great guy and you are great for what you do. But yes, we have this dance. You just reinforced what I'm saying the fact that you are now saying that this is the first time you heard ambassador tonight. My response is exactly what I just said about the residents not being hurt. If Sonia or Jane DOE wrote you and said this is what I just saw with a yellow jacket, security, whatever and I think this is a problem. The first response to me as a representative for the neighborhood would be: what did the jet was? It sorry, did you actually see? Did the jacket say security did the jacket say Ambassador, I'm saying she didn't write to me to say anything about it. I believe she wrote that, but I'm just saying she did not say anything about a jacket. Amy is what I'm saying to you. She said there was a person. There was an ambassador at this particular place, but that's my fault and I told her. Why do we thank you for the note, but we don't have ambassadors there. So that's like somebody saying I had an issue with somebody in battery park. I can't tell you many times it happens and I have to say. Thank you so much for the note battery park city is not battery. Pork here are the people in battery park. Who can help you? My goal is to make sure people have the answers. Yes, let me stop this now Amy I hear you I hear what you're saying and I'm not sure that Nick hears what you're saying because Justine say again what Eric was cut off. I know I'd like to I'm going to let Eric speak because I think that Nick is feeling attacked and that's not what my point was so Eric. If you want to speak and answer this, that would be great because then I have something to say, because I think that there's a difference- everybody, I'm muting myself I appreciate it. I will listen from now on, but I'm muting myself I appreciate you all. Thank you. Amy go ahead! Eric, you may speak no I. Think Nick mainly made my point, which was just to say that, as when I first heard about this incident and I heard that something had happened at the bottom of those steps there I just know that is a spot where the Brookfield Security are posted up, and so when they investigated it- and you know Nick and Pat asked for the additional information it didn't come as a surprise that they suspected that it was a Brookfield security incident. But I was glad that this evening, when we heard the additional information that Pat said that he was going to investigate it further and so I was just similar to next response was just taking issue with the characterization that we were not going to address the issue, because I think that again I don't want any park user or resident in the community to have anything thrown at them by anyone and to the extent that it happens, I want to play a role and I want the authority to play a role in fixing it, but it's just. It was important to me to make sure that it was clear that we are going to address it further. So a couple of things and then I'm going to close the conversation on this we'll move on. Thank you. First of all, thank you for the people who spoke. Thank you to everybody in answer to make clear what I'm saying and when I was saying to this is: if that incident happened, whether it was Brookfield, Security or allied, it still needs to be addressed. Now. What I'm going to say at this moment in time is if this happened. Monday and today is Wednesday time passes nobody. It does take time to investigate this and give everybody a chance. I am so thankful that Amy showed up and that Sonia showed up, and she brought this all to our attention tonight, because it's important that we're talking about it. We just found out some more information and it's really useful I want to make it 100 clear that I am not attacking anyone. Everybody here is doing their job. Everyone is trying to do a good thing. What I want to express on the behalf of the community, who has been complaining at least and I'm speaking in their voice, not necessarily mine, because I have not had this experience particularly, but there are people in the community in the battery park city community who feel as if they say something, and then they're told why they're wrong, and that is something that maybe it's not the community board's job to get involved in, but I just would like the authority to hear that and sit with it and I know that bothers you. I could see your faces, both I could see. Eric and I can see. Nick I know that sentence bothers you, I'm not saying that it's a true sentence, I'm telling you how people feel and that in and of itself is valid, and so I'm acknowledging the feelings of Amy, I'm acknowledging the feelings of Sonia and I'm acknowledging your discomfort with those feelings. So what I say now is let's shut this down for the conversation? It's eight o'clock. Let us talk further offline and let us keep going on this conversation because once again, I heard a lot of really great things about ally, I, think that the relationship between the battery park, City authority and the community is commendable. The communication level is great. You Nick has been in almost every meeting at every meeting. Patrick has been in every meeting that we've had I appreciate your being here. You are always full forthright with your answers. You tell us what you can and can't do and a lot of times it's I, don't know, and that's okay, because you do get back to me or you get back to us as a committee. So thank you for that. But Amy and Sonia don't stop having your concerns because you deserve to be heard and if your feelings are what your feelings are they're valid because you feel them so I want to acknowledge that let's move on what's next and thank you all for this part of the conversation but I think we're moving to the sheds. Next is that correct I know, there's a bunch of people in the attendee list who have been waiting patiently for sheds lucid. Oh you know what could we do sheds next and then go puree because I think I, don't think anybody on the attendee list is here to speak, to sheds, I'm sorry to speak to puree I. Think we're going to hear from Nick about that which is interesting and people can stay on. But I'd like to have the people who've signed on to talk about the sheds, I'd like to hear their input. Nick are you? Can we pivot to the sheds just for the record for the last one, just only because I checked with Pat during the conversation I just want it to be in the transcript? As far as I understand and as far as Pat understands, he came up a couple of times the pep officers when they were here and I believe is still the case. They were not armed I mean without firearms. Okay, because they had these things, I understand it got it not a weapon of that caliber, no pun intended. Okay! No! Thank you for the record of correcting me. Thank you all right. Let's talk about the equipment sheds on the battery park city side of West Street Nick I may ask you to just give us the history of why they have to be there because you'll do a better job. I will just to interrupt Nick for a second I wanted to say that they were armed and the guys in the car I think I'm sure were armed, because I had lots of interactions with them over many years, so they did carry guns, yeah I, don't know. Thank you Bob. Thank you for saying that. But let's go on to the sheds, please so they're there tell us what the purpose is and where the options are. If you have that information at this point that were presented because I know when they came up at a environmental committee meeting, you guys were pretty much blindsided like we were with the fact that they had to be installed. So now we want to figure out how we can make it the letter of all evils. Well, so I, we talked a little bit about this yesterday, just for the benefit of the committee and I'm by far or I should say I'm far from an expert on this, I'm not an engineer or a architect or designer, but I'll start by saying we being battery park city authority, we're still kind of in the throes of kind of technical and legal and ownership discussions with both DEP and DOT about many of the issues, including what are known as these kind of control houses. We will be as I think there was some conversation at the start of the meeting kind of before we started about our next engagement with the Environmental Protection Committee. So maybe the way to do this is kind of take a step back. So we have provided periodically first through the battery Park, City, Committee and then recently or so past year, or so it's extended out and through the Environmental Protection Committee, as kind of resiliency overall and lower Manhattan kind of comes into their bellywick, so we'll be back to the Environmental Protection Committee in early 2021, probably February or so with a number of follow-up items. We owe them on issues that we've been talking around for some time right battery bikeway the back kind of housed, the backup house entrance on the berm in or kind of the structure in Wagner Park from the seating areas on the lawn I know that Tammy had brought up bike lanes to that area, etc, as well as environmental reviews and schedule for that. Part of this is a function of we had discussed, I think on the lmcr meeting recently with the community board sheriffs and some agencies. They are that we're now going to be bringing an E.I, an environmental impact study for the south project, which is a function of that will not you know to a tremendous extent, but we'll push the time back online. Back a little bit in terms of the beginning of construction on the South Battery Park city project to at the earliest November 2020, when that's construction in the park so with that are a lot of these discussions around interior drainage, which is where the control houses come in. I'd, say a long way of saying we'll be back to the Environmental Protection Committee early next year, where we would have kind of a firm grasp on the formula what this interior range is going to look like benefit of the committee tonight. However, the best way I can explain it again, not as a designer an architect or an engineer. As a lucha knight sent you a lender, you want to maybe bring it up. You don't bring that up. We did presentation to the environment committee back in June, where we discuss kind of the concept of control houses in the main. What control house is it's a house? It's housing for equipment that will control these gates that will close off access to these main sewer lines up my highway. So there's a map starting on that presentation, I'll bring it up. On my end, as well, along the West Side highway, there's a huge pipe that all the buildings, sewage and water kind of runs into, and maybe not using the right terms. But all the kind of this is this from the buildings come in and underground, and since we are having contemplating the resiliency of being laid atop that or hear to have infrastructure gates that can open dry side of the protection from the west side of the protection in Florida, and so flood waters or flowing or running equipment that is used to open closes into center gates, actually has to be these control house structures within which this equipment lives. There are some, yes, so Lucian very helpfully. Thank you pulled up an idea of those intercept. Those controllers recovery are contemplating for the East side, coastal resiliency project and the emcr, which is broken right. Brazilian coastal resiliency, while we put these placeholders in that June presentation for now, is because these were to the Public Design Commission. Okay, there are player out in a lot of these. This residency plan was throughout the city on very episode projects we as a placeholder. For now, knowing that, in the main, the pd, you would like to see some consistency of what these houses will look like not saying that there's not some wiggle rooms on the margins right in terms of materiality but I, some consistency in the design. So when we're on the east side and then in battery park city, it's all one of these control houses, but you were able to tell that they were kind of the same family. Them are everything that they're not they're, small right they are having here, but they are. They tend to be tall by I. Haven't written down my notes here. I'd have to find. Excuse me for a second. Nonetheless, the discussion we had in June was a couple different tips about where they were 40 to 60 feet long at a max of 16 foot high yeah. That's what you're sure! That's what this chart says here, this picture I, don't know, and the boy and Justin the CB is already on record, asking for contextualities to neighborhood, not symmetry, because we don't think it should look the same as it does the historic Seaport as it would in battery park city great again that we would want to hear yeah, no I totally we're on record saying that correct. Has it been a resolution to that effect or we're just making that point, because I think that is a very important point. Tammy can't wait to see resolution. Okay, then that's good that that's what I want to know all right go ahead. I'm sorry were you finished I mean that was the main point. The other kind of summary point for discussion in June was that you should go ahead to page I want to say maybe 30 slide, 30 37. If you don't mind that shows kind of how tall it is, but 40 30 to 40 feet long. That's insane other discussion in June for the Southern most control house. There were a couple of options about again, depending on I want to carry I still because I checked with, even though I know, there's still answers happy to be to the EP committee, capitalist by staying still working through a lot of technical and ownership issues of these things and how it's actually technically gonna work. But at the time we had discussed June location for one of these, the southern Control House. We identified kind of that median right. It's like Wagner's legend on slide 37. One of the options was I want to say in the walkway right next and then on slide. 40 I mean if you could maybe toggle Rob would be actually implanting. I may be mixing it. The idea was either in the planting bed or right next to the planting, but the conversation was oh, throw away outside which, while theoretically possible the further away it gets from the actual interceptor gate itself, the bigger it needs to be because from what we're trying to control. So there are the things I. Think. Probably we will deductions two and not three, if it's in the planting bed that way why, but that page right there that's, you should across it show it like 24 clearance, but what's the problem where's the bike path? So let's look at this and maybe lucid if you I'm looking at it with my pointer, but maybe you can use your pointer because you've got one the downside there would be it's all open, but then you would lose a couple of trees and planting that would be taken out and this would be little west. This is little West Street. So wait. Let's see that's the highway little West Community is the highway or no. This is the that's a little and the West Side highway is still farther. Thank you. Sorry. I'm an idiot but I just really don't see this stuff. Let's go back to the picture that shows the street like at the top of this one. Basically, there you go. This is little west, it's a little west streets here and then the highway is farther like where it says Interior. The word interior is I. Think, basically, if you're looking at that picture, you'd be looking, it would be you standing on little restaurant. Looking south there, you go okay, so the options are yeah. Tell us. Options are in this planter here, which is little West Street in the planter here or when you say on the walkway. What do you mean on the walkway? Where is that like 40 you'll see the same, people see it? Yeah you'll see the same perspective, but instead of being in the planter, it's on the walkway directly to the left of the planter. Lucian will bring that up for you now there. So this whole blue thing. This is the top of the bottom I. Don't know on the in the picture, see the orange I see so either in the pad in the walkway, with the planting bed next to it and untouched or in the planting bed, with the full walkway next to it and untouched. Okay, now all right go ahead. Tammy First, your help. Your hand has been up so go ahead. Tammy several questions one we'd like to see modeling, because what you're showing us is a picture of what it looks like on the ground. It's not representative of what a 16 foot tall, 40 feet. Long structure actually would look like there. If it's in the planting bed, you lose all the plants, all the trees, if it's in the sidewalk, what are you losing in terms of land? Okay, do you so we I'd like to see some modeling if that's possible. Secondly, there was a discussion because on West Street there's a access lane that doesn't go anywhere, that's in the same spot, so on the street itself, there's kind of like a curb bump out lane. That's just you know. Sometimes you get buses who pull over there and wait as to whether or not it could be put there so you're not losing parkland if you're putting it in parkland. Do you have to do any parkland alienation, because that is mapped parkland? If you could get back to us on that as well, and then all these questions and more, it is my sincere hope we will have answers for you at the EP committee meeting great so one about the lane two about modeling, so people can see it three about Contextuality. Obviously, fourth was what was my fourth dang: it contextuality modeling locations. If I think of it all text, alienation alienate I. Think you asked about alienation too. If it goes in the promenade. Was that alienation of parkland? Absolutely that's the other item right. Thank you, Betty! Thank you. Okay and the one thing that is missing from this conversation is the fact that there was a note on the diagrams that we might potentially lose the grass lawn area of West Thames Park. That's what yeah, whether or not a second of these would be needed, which would require the removal of the entire lawn area on the south side of West Ham's park that for lack of a better expression, it's like where all the babies sit in the grass yeah. It's the basketball court, it's the playground and then it's the sand pit and then it's the grass correct and one of the slides showed that it would be in the area if needed, we'd lose the entire graft area. I, don't think 40 feet would fit. There pull up the presentation card because I remember I want to say: we've got people from the community who I know want to speak to Bob. If I see your hand up I know, Vinton wanted to speak and he's been here since before they started so Vinton Thompson, I'm going to let go first, assuming he still wants to speak but and then maybe Bob Zach wants to speak, I, don't know, but go ahead. There was just on that other control House just yes. My notes was that the idea hopefully was that you we may be able to move that second one further up, so you still have the southern one at a location potentially again pending all the technical issues that we're still working through opposed to that, while the other one that may have been able to be put up to the Chamber street and function as part of really much resiliency. So I, don't think that's also of value and something that we're going to want to know, because that that's going to affect us too. Even if it's Chamber street it's going to affect us and I'm assuming I, don't know, I'm not going to assume anything but yeah. Instead of making all the pain in one neighborhood, it would be nice to push some of it north. But again we need to see what things look like and I know you can't do it now. I appreciate that was clearly getting started, just kind of getting on it. So you have some of your right. Yeah we've been at you with as many answers my concept. So speaking of to my board here, my concept for having this discussion tonight was to see what the and I s to see what we thought about all this stuff and what the community leaving nearby these proposed equipment sheds thought about it and then coming together and at least putting out maybe a string of revolutions, but one thing that we certainly could push for would be having a not uniform to what's going on all over the city or all over lower Manhattan having something that is specific to battery park city. So if it has to be uniform, north and south, that's it and it might be a good piece of a resolution. But I, don't know that we can say we don't want them. I think that is that ship has sailed. We need to have these equipment. Sheds someplace is a clear statement that I'm getting from the meetings I've attended to at the EP at the Environmental Protection Committee, so they have to happen. The question is: how do we make them happen in a way that we can function with? So with that said, Vincent do you want to speak? You've been here longer, if not I'm going to go to I'm going to go to Bob and Tammy, you did speak. Your hand is still up, but I'm assuming Vincent are you there, I'm revolution, could you and I'm here you are unmuted- go ahead: Sir, okay, I'm Benton, Thompson and I live at street, I'm also a member of the board of directors of the residential condominium at 10, West Street. We got wind of this somewhat June meeting we weren't there I did attend I, think one of the environmental meetings where they talked a little about it. From our point of view, the proposal to this is a proposal to put a 460 foot long. Roughly, you know 10 to 15 foot high building as a wall across the street from us that would potentially take out all the greenery in front of our building. That would wall us off from the promenade. That would create what would feel like a walled entrance to Little West Street, for anybody coming up a little bus street to the buildings along little West Street, and while there was some indication that somebody had the impression that somebody had talked to the residents in the immediate areas immediately affected by this I can guarantee you. That was not the case. Nobody came to us about this. We got wind of it accidentally, I think we're wrongly strongly opposed to putting a wall on little West Street across of our building, and that there must be a way to combine aesthetics and engineering so that there's a control house somewhere, but that it doesn't result in walling off a little West Street, which would be aesthetically ugly for the whole community, not just for us. So that's my statement. I hope you'll find a way to involve the friends who live right across from this proposed structure in this discussion in a serious way. Thank you for staying on the line this whole time and thank you for expressing yourself I wish like and I. Don't have an email if Justine or somebody wants to connect us, then we'll make sure to add it to our email list. Dozens of resiliency meetings we're always a little more able to solve them kind of voice, their feedback about the future of the community. We keep posted on those. We do advertising all always do a better job of getting meetings. So we'll connect and I'll make sure that you are all looped in to the net of questions. You certainly want to hear what you and the residents have yeah. No thank you very well. Yeah very well said and pay attention not just to this committee, because it's the environmental, Committee Environmental Protection Committee that deals really in depth with what's going on with the resiliency, because there's architects on there Alice Blank is amazing as understanding all this stuff and yeah there's just no comparison to what she understands when it's presented and many of the people who are on this committee are members of that committee too, and we do show up at both and I. Think there's members of the environmental committee on line here right now, I think but Justine if I could just stop and make a shameless plug for me board one's weekly newsletter I put a link to our sign up form in the chat. But if you sign up, you will get I'm sorry. You hear my son making noises you'll get. You will get an update, every Friday or Saturday of Cb1's agendas and any changes to the agendas. So you will know when from us, when this item lands on the Environmental Protection Committee's agenda, so that this is the best way to stay in the know of what CB1 is discussing, especially if you have a an item in mind that you're especially curious or passionate about so please you can either chat the host. If it's the link is in the chat and it's also available on the live.ncb1 to NYC page, where you find the link to our meetings. If you scroll down it's there as well. So that's my end of my plug. Thank you Justine! No! Thank you! That's where I was gonna go, but you have all the information. Okay, so next is Bob Schneck and then I see that Bob Zach has his hand up in the attendee list, so Bob you first okay and Bob Schnapp Bob, Zack! Okay, thank you. I just wanted to say that I'm one of the persons that's on both of these committees, so I'm I am in this again advantaged by lots of meetings and information. I think that it is a problem from my point of view that these solutions do such violence to a the view, corridor of the wonderful promenade that was I mean, if you're, going to if you're going to damage some part of the promenade, you don't damage the whole promenade and that's really an architectural feature to be proud of in our neighborhood, and it's really extraordinary. I think that also the resident that complained about the really incredible disruption of the view corridor of the buildings. I think that's also true, with such a large structure. I think that when in at least one or more of these discussions, the idea you know that there is a crossing across the West Side highway at West Ham and that when you're, some part of the way across there there's this really pretty big area in the middle of the road there where it could fit, and that was proposed. It's kind of adjacent to the kitty grass, but it's really pretty big more than 70 feet and it already it's already excavated because there's part it's got part of the ramp riser of some kind of structure. That's underneath it so I think I and that's in the middle of West Street Bob right. So it's in the middle of West, Street I think it's pretty close to where the actual sewer lines are so I was thinking that we were owed a discussion of that yeah. At least it should be in the pictures and people should say well, it doesn't work because of this or that and I think that's a great idea. Bob I think that's a great idea, a chance to respond to that and so I think. That's what I wanted to say. I think that that's one of the live options for this I think it does the least harm it's just north of the bridge and it's kind of a dead. It's a dead area, so I think it wouldn't be. No, it wouldn't be blocking particular views. It's in the middle of the street, which is well it's a view of the parking lot on the other side, yeah, exactly that's what I was going to say and at that point there's a line of trees and hedges and things that's pretty dense next to the bike lane and then it actually kind of obscures it pretty well right there too. So if you have to have such a thing and it's absolutely as necessary as a sewer line, then we have to have it somewhere and we just well. The best we can do is try and suggest the least harmful or impactful places possible, so I at least expect that included in the next discussions and rest. My case, that's good! No thank you. Bob solution. Two things number one is the alternate, a fourth location, because they because the design people hadn't discussed that- and we did talk about this in an environmental protection committee. I remember this now. Thank you. Bob an alternate location is number one, and number two would be the symmetry. We don't want symmetry with every place else in the city. Those two things on the resolution and so far, is what I'm looking at and then Robert Zach. Please God, please speak unmute him no motion. Thank you very much and I'd like to just follow on what Bob just Bob Schneck just said. Not only is there space in the center island by West, Thames, there's also south of that near the opposite. Mars Street there's a crosswalk there as well, but there is a substantial island space there and that's I, don't know if it's large enough to accommodate a structure of this side but size, but that should be looked at as well, but the I also want to follow on Vinton Thompson's comments, because I agree with him wholeheartedly that having a structure with a wall facing directly on little West Street directly across from the Ritz and from the hotel, is really possibly the worst of solutions here. If the structure needs to be built first of all, it would be removing all of the vegetation for that. I'm sorry I think it might be Vincent who's, not on you. Yes, I think that was Vinton's a lovely voice yeah, but anyway it having it through a wall directly on the street. It also creates a barrier for people trying to get out of the passenger side of their car so that they don't have to get out in traffic. For some pedestrians it would be extremely unsightly and it does create a rather futuristic. It creates a rather barren look for little West Street, which is very narrow. Thoroughfare at that point and I know the people I. The president at the millennium also feels very strongly that is the worst possible location for that structure as well putting it in whether it goes into this into the walkway and diminishes the size of the walkway. Those are things that I think Nick has said will be addressed and looked at and reviewed, but I did want to point out that we completely at the Visionaire condominium, I'm the president. There. We strongly oppose the creation of that structure in the planting area directly on the street and urge an alternate location to be found. So I have a question for you Bob and then for Vinton too. Whether it's in the planter or in the promenade, it's still a wall right, so you're objecting to the whole thing correct at that location right there. Yes, I think the first priority should be to find an alternative location away from the promenade that yeah our workable locations. That would require the least destruction of vegetation and aesthetic appeal yeah. That would be a very well said, therefore, be it resolved. Thank you. Anybody else on the board have anything to say anybody any place. Bob is still up, but I'm assuming you're done all right, so I will move on. Thank you very much Nick. Thank you. So much for presenting this super great job on explaining it, but for folks is and always been a while I think some spoke when you were less than Mcny. This is helpful and what I would emphasize? Actually it's kind of a piece what we discussed earlier with Allied and everything else, I'd like to emphasize that we're not alone and we're in this together when I say that you know for forward on this kind of necessary project. Adam different travels, in particular I mean resiliency. The whole host of folks are going to be working with and through, and hopefully in close consultation with so it's DOT, it's DEP, it's the community board, it's very the public design, commission etcetera. So this is really helpful and I. Take this back to the folks from what I had heard from you. So of this is your characters. My characterization of your character is ancient of the two proposed again: I want to emphasize proposed conceptual locations, both of which are bad. The less bad of the two is the one that's in the walkway and the more bad of the two is the one that gets in the planting bit. Is that right? I'm not saying that if you say yes, I'm going to say put it in the wrong way. Just I want to see yeah I, don't know that that's what he said, but yeah Bob, Zach, Mute, Bob Zack, and ask him that question. I'm not sure that's what he said if we have a choice between strict nine and I suppose the strychnine, because it moves faster through the body, would be preferable seriously. You know none of those locations in the walkway or adjacent to the walkway are really acceptable and they will destroy the aesthetics. They will destroy a lot of vegetation in the one case and they will be a barrier to people walking in the walkway right now there are benches there, people sit there, have lunch and so forth. It's really a very pleasant spot. There are I think if there are alternative locations outside the walkway. That should be the first priority to at least examine those and determine whether they are feasible if they are out of this area totally. So no walkway, no promenade, no planter at this space. Look farther north, just a little bit to where Bob Smith was talking about. That's what I think I'm hearing right. Yes, you can alternate suggestion seriously, there's an unused gatehouse that sits right outside the battery tunnel. That has absolutely no usage. Nobody ever sits in there and there's a middle island, so I'm not sure if it could potentially be on the east side of the street or if it could be in the plantered area in the center median. That is not on top of the tunnel. That's what we're suggesting and what about inside the battery park garage there's a lot of unused space in there. Could that be some and it's publicly owned. I'm hearing that it's publicly owned space in the battery garage well, I think it's just referring to is under the garage overhang. There I believe it's owned by the MTA yeah, so that would be pretty cool. Mta publicly owned I mean that's quasi quasi-publicly owned yeah, it's not a public park, but it's owned by a public agency, not a private who will a public authority, not a public agency but who will benefit from all of the resiliency, like all the rest of us will so yeah. So it's something these are other alternate locations which Nick. Perhaps these are things that can be brought to the development team as other ideas, because I have to say I get that we need to do something, but it is just really bad. The promenade area, whether it's north or south, is just such an unattractive, unappealing location. Yeah I hear you certainly I. Remember Gwen saying it if I'm paraphrasing her right back in June, but we were kind of caught by surprise as well, when this was a new requirement that was added or I guess kind of divorced us during requirement that Dp had been complaining so again, I want to qualify my studies, there's still something's happening and taking place, but I did want to make sure that at Justine's request we came back to the committee is calling upon some of those conversations in June. So that was my attempt to some of our conversations that have happened. Additional conversations on kind of tech, technical solutions are happening, so we will be with more, certainly even before design begins. So there is going to be ample opportunity for public feedback and just a thought, Nick other possibilities. But if the suggestion of having it in the garage with the Mta's property being taken or used, is they can say no they're, a public agency. So was the battery Park City Authority a public agency? So I know this is you're like you want to do this, but you can also say no we're not going to do it here. So that would be something that maybe I throw that out to you as a concept and I know, we've got what we're talking to do. They throw that out to you if they could say? No, so can you that's a concept. Tammy is your hand raised oops, so I call on you, no okay. No, that's fine! All right! If we have nothing further, can we move on to please if you, if you're willing, Nick, you want to get started, I mean we know to start with puree you're in charge go ahead, so let me just bring something up really quickly. I'm sorry! So you had seen in certain of our esteemed local publications word that puree had ceased operations and Justine had asked me just for a kind of a quick update here and is currently closed and Bpa is all relevant for us to try to determine a path forward. Pure Plaza remains open and accessible to the public in terms of context. I'll, have it so big Pca Lisa peer a from the city of New, York families and then in turn, it's sublease to an operator, so our relationship with existing officers that will work in a relationship. You may recall Jake of Hurricane, well what you wouldn't say in the week in advance of Hurricane Sandy Battery Park City authority has assumed pro with those plans, but as a result of the work done that we were fully able to reopen Pra with a host of new results and measures in name raising a lot of electrical equipment and above grade floors, putting marine grade lumber in a lot of the places so that it could still get wet if it had to be brush, sometimes comes up with a resiliency project. It will happen here right. It's like a wall around. There is no the idea with pure a is that God forbid. You would have a standing type event for something similar or worse forbid. You would have the doors of puree open and have the water run through it, but that proofed enough minimal to what it sustained. But it has last time we should have disappeared in everyone. Okay, thank you. Nick. Thank you for the update. I got a question. Wasn't there something someplace about the operators of peer? Oh in the authority background. Something is that still existing. Is that anything that's out there that somebody someplace owes background and what's the status of that it was, you know it's only right. I'd have to check some of my notes, but there was an agreement reached that our I think our board had voted on some time ago for the repayment of some background. That would so yes, I, don't want to speak more on it because I don't have the particulars in front of me. But yes, that was something that there was some backup back rent owed and we had ready to arrange repayment of that. Okay, so I guess what I'd love you to do is for the next meeting. Just as part of your report come back to me, and let me know, is it waived? Is it owed? You know, what's the deal now, that's all and I don't expect you to answer off the cuff. Now that's fine I, didn't it just occurred to me and we didn't talk about it. I give you some time about that anybody have any questions as Bob has his hand raised anybody else. Bob you're up, okay, I, just wanted to say that I think that it's important to realize that I suppose I'm interested in finding out whether or not the agreement with the current operator can keep going and to what extent can the community board be involved in those conversations to kind of keep it the way it is if we go as we go back from the Covid-19, because it's really a good thing, but I think that my impression over the last few years is that the bar part of it's a little bit too big and that it never really. It rarely filled itself up except on very special days, so maybe there's some kind of agreement that could repurpose some of that space and the community board could be involved with those agreements. The second thing, I think that's important- is that it's in terms of the environmental protection part of it, it's the lowest point in the area, and it really needs special protections and those protections whatever we do with them are going to be quite expensive, and so that discussion as part of environmental protection is important. The final thing I want to comment on is there has been a controversy over quite a bit of time about building a new and larger eating venue in Wagner Park. But if Pierre can't be successful, then there's a question about even you know: do we need such a thing? Isn't it fine the way it is with the gigino? That's there and just kind of big enough and kind of fits. So I'm in the more conservative, Wagner, Park Group that says you know the way it is works pretty well and have a huge and amazingly expensive. Disruption of the whole area might really be unnecessary, especially at a time when money and resources in battery park, city and in lower Manhattan are probably going to be more stressed for the next five years than they have in the last 25 years. So we it's an opportunity for us as a community board, to get involved with that, if Justine's interested in taking all of these issues into some kind of resolution, that kind of is a general discussion of that and the general discussion of community preferences, then I'm on board with that and I rest. My ca. Thank you. That's a very interesting concept. Bob I, don't know if Nick has an answer for you for any of it, but I think it's an interesting concept and also what about just moving to Gmail's weight. What moving to Genos to that space? If the community board has ideas about, certainly like anything else, we want to hear them. I couldn't go across the board. I mean we're here every month. We want to hear we have to say certainly- and we do our level to you- won't deliver on the things that we can take off any number of things, but going after the start of the meeting, the idea of having special patrol officers was due to Eric's, extraordinarily hard work and a number of people who had the authority. We got to the places we had them and doing a small part to the people. We think we can do better. You know we have a friends and apartments any number of things that we can try to live wrong. There are certain things we all don't have to absolutely do it and within, as we've been saying, you know, is number one in terms of protecting the physical plant, and that said, number two I wish we could do anything either thinking about yeah either we try to whatever change it and destroy it for us now. Thank you, Nick. Thank you. Bob I, like those are interesting ideas, but just one tiny thing I want to add, and that is I don't want to be misconstrued as abandoning the idea of protection, I'm simply interested in simplifying protections not to spend if you can get protection at eight million dollars as opposed to 36 million dollars. I'm in the eight million dollar camp and I'd want to have the economic branch of these discussions be as powerful as here's. What we need branch yeah now that makes sense, I appreciate that and Nick what I throw back to you, too, is that it's just as it's good for us to give you guys ideas. Whatever ideas are ruminating on that on you on your side, for what puree is going to do or can be after the fact if, in fact, it doesn't open up as a restaurant again with the pool accomplices, let us know so let make it be a two-way street, and that would be what I would ask. As you know, certainly I appreciate that and then Kathy has her hand up. Let's go to Kathy, you're, muted, I'm sorry yeah Nick. Do you think, there's any chance that the authority would not manage the peer going forward and I missed a little bit of the conversation? Sorry I was getting a work text, but are there other uses being considered aside from just you know, a restaurant venue I remember early on the italian American Immigration Museum was lobbying to transform the beer I apologize if I'm kind of repeating, perhaps okay, I, think I'm not in a position or do I know really more than what I have shared I. Wouldn't think, though, what I can say is this is I. Think I mentioned this Justine earlier we have talked a little bit, so it's actually to just now. That's still gonna work through whatever shape the appearance be addressed. Right payments exist out there, so we can't say yesterday we have to say that need to be addressed and all the attendant issues associated with that need to be worked through. But we'll keep. Thank you one thing to throw out to you is, and we talked about this offline, but just to put it out there as an idea. If, in fact, the police does not go forward as a restaurant going in for pure a what about moving the staging area, the security area, whatever else all those horrible white, ugly tents that are in battery park now for the stat for the statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Ferry and moving that whole operation into a I know, you don't have an answer for me now, but as a concept, other ideas museum great but trying to get that out of battery park, which is enough store and it also blocks off public assets. Access all over the place. I don't know what the impact would be with crowds around pure a going in and out, but there's a building upstairs could be put to use. I mean there's a lot of concepts there. That could be useful but I. Throw that out as an idea- and you know I know, there's no answer because all you could say is yeah thanks for sharing anybody else have anything to say on this issue. I think not so much again. I hate to have so many ideas, but that's all right. It used to be my profession. I'm also on a small business committee. Okay and the interest is: how should an interesting and powerful question is how should leaseholders and landlords behave and the battery parks of the authority is the landlord and it gets a chance to manage in public above board the current person that holds the lease and the current organizations that hold the lease and they can actually set be a model of what's fair? How do we kind of protect the interests of small business owners? How do we protect the interests of those people that have had jobs there? How do we protect the interest of the community which is accustomed to having those wonderful, for example, holiday venues that we've used a bunch of times for battery park city, and so it's a really wonderful place? It needs to have some repurposing, but I think that the current leaseholder did very well in their ownership of it for a while, and hopefully we're not going to go back to anything like Covid-19. So it's a matter of how do landlords work with the people that rent from them in with in terms of commercial leases? What are ideal conditions that we can kind of model here that helps everybody out and comes to the best conclusion. I rest, my okay, thank you for sharing Bob. Thank you all right, I think! That's it! Somebody just better speak up if they want to say something, I think we're good. So, let's move on excuse me: I want to jump to do Nick's and I think we might skip Patrick's report because we kind of focused a lot on Patrick today, so I think he's good and off the hook. But before you start Nick I want to ask you a question. So I got an email from someone who I think is still in the attendee list. Has that right? Oh, but go ahead? No! This is it's a value report. Basically it's following up with a message that was sent about construction or incomplete construction, opposite 300 rector place in Rector Park, oh okay, the curve of replacement project. I! Guess that's what it is. If you were to tell me when I was a little kid and I wanted to grow up and be like an astronaut or a firefighter or a baseball player, and you instead told me no you're going to be talking about the curb valve replacement project. I would say that's an interesting life yeah. So, yes, the woman is short of it. Is there is yeah it's right along Vector, Park Eric, if he's still on, can the test. So this has kind of been the pain of our existence for a while. So there is right, it's a curb valve needed to be replaced. It's I, don't even there's a what's. Even a curved wild mean it's like a fire, hydrant I, don't know if it's a fire, it's it Eric. Maybe you can help me out here along the short of it is we're talking with DEP and there may or may not need to be a water shut off to actually finish the work there. The work is done, but we actually just need to close up the actual construction, but there may or may not need to be a work turn water turn off order, and if that's the case, we want to make sure we coordinate with the building so we're not turning the water off in the middle of the day when people actually now everyone is also home because it's a pandemic. So, yes, this is one that is really annoying and it's us, but it's not entirely us. There are some contingencies that we have to continue to push on, to get clearance to do, but I actually was not in the meeting today that Eric perhaps wasn't so. Maybe he can update us on any update. Sorry, to put you on the spot there buddy, no I, don't believe it came up in today's meeting but I you know. Proper irrigation of rector park is a nagging priority for the team and to the next point getting that work done, isn't just an aesthetic issue with regards to wrapping up the construction, but it's also needed for us to make sure that we're able to attend to the park properly. So we've been working really hard to that end. But it's certainly not a low priority item. For us. That's for sure was this anything that was put on hold because of the whole Covid-19 no construction, and is that part of the delay? You know it's, I'm I, don't because I honestly have to tell you with Covid-19 and with all the craziness I, don't pay attention and I walk around, but I'm not always we're aware so I guess, but yeah I would say across the board. Sorry, I'm off video, you know say it across the board. There was a you know: a construction pause as a result of Covid-19, so I don't want to say that this wasn't covered by it. Did you but I would say, put your sheets in the laundry Tammy I, don't think you're asking us about your I was like. Did I leave my laundry out, yeah I know right. Sorry that was us. That's right! Go ahead! Yeah! It's like that dream that you wake up and you feel like you're late for school. Even though you're a grown adult, then there is no school okay. What did I do now? Yes, go ahead. I was just saying that laundry day I, I'm sure that this work was paused as a result of Covid-19, but not exclusively as a result, of course, we're trying to work through the both interagency elements and also some of the construction peccadillos that are involved right. We are nonetheless we are acutely aware of this and are very eager to get it and fixed and patched up. So thank you and I hope. I, don't want to say, I promise, because I can't but I, certainly time I'm next to you. It's either done or I have an idea about when it will be done. That would be great. If you could it's going on it's gone on too long. Certainly the person who sent it to me said that it's been incomplete for a year and I believe her I just have no knowledge personally, so I'm just relaying the information and I don't know. So that's what the email says so I just would ask I mean in a year if it's been a year, it's been a year of almost oh, it's good. It's got to get done, so it does so just message delivered we'll get it. Thank you and thank you for the resident who brought that to my attention, so I could bring it off. Go ahead with your report. Thank you. Oh wait. One more thing, I want to say about the oh gosh, the leaf blowers. Thank you. There were no leaf blowers this morning. I am so pleased, I, don't know if it was because of weather or whatever else, but I slept late. I got onto work late because leaf blowers are my alarm. So I am very happy that they're not blowing early in the morning I. Thank you well good. I wish I could say that I had something to do with it, but I will continue to relay the fact that as best we can, we want to try and be as responsive as we can to the community, while also kind of maintaining our perks to the standard. But yes I. Thank you for that. Thank you. We'll keep on trying to do the best we can with balancing those competing interests. Thank you for that. No thank you. Go ahead. All right, Lucian, all right, 10 minutes, no less, because we're going to hang up because I have to feed the puppies who are crying. No, it's going to be great I! Really! You know, I want these things to be really good for you guys when I compete together before I start this up, there's one member of the public. Who has one thing to add, so you can't stop the meeting until Andrei's a chance to you know speak. So let me fire this up. All right, sorry is it on. Is it yeah I'm pulling it up? Okay, I'm just waiting for it to pop up on my screen. No, it's! Okay! Great! Thank you Lucian, so you will see that is obviously, as we know the Grinch. It is kind of a little bit of a little bit of levity to what is a very difficult time. As we know, Covid-19 has been leading off my reports every month to this committee since I believe it was April, but you know it's obviously very important for us to stay vigilant as we are ending now. It seems to be a second wave, so please remember, as we always have to wear your masks and keep a safe distance, as Pat had noted earlier in his report. I. Thank him for that. The ambassadors have been stationed and providing masks to anyone who needs them and will accept them at our parks on their shifts and I. Think over the course of Thanksgiving weekend or they're about five dozen or so masks are actually given out to folks that they offer them to a lot more, but I know that we are continuing to do our best to make sure that folks are aware of the need to wear masks, obviously and to actually wear them if they don't have so as I've always done Lucian you can scroll down. Thank you. I just put the kind of coronavirus, most recent updates on the chart here latest information on restrictions, whether an address falls into any one of the red, Orange or yellow zones, etc, and there's information there about getting tests forward, NY restrictions, filing complaints about businesses or employers who are kind of flouting the rules. So thank you for that, and obviously, as I always do at the very bottom, you can click here. It's hyperlinked for daily coronavirus emails directly to your inbox. What I've also added now here is number two. On page two roman numeral, two we've been closely monitoring for the duration, but we put it now in short form for the committee. The percent positivity rates in battery park city- we have been again amongst the luckier neighborhoods in New York City, to have not seen a huge spike, but we did see a slight bit of an uptick looks like the week leading up to Thanksgiving. What I've done on this chart here is provide the percent positives on a seven day, rolling average from the 17th to the 23rd and then all the way up to the 22nd through the 28th Gisha Battery Park City's, two zip codes I set against the city-wide average, so we are well below the city-wide average and trending steadily downward and importantly, in both zip codes, including 102 a2, which for our bit there was up around three percent, if not a little more so that information is available on the New York City Health Department's website, you can click on the map that I've linked and you can track those positivity rates on a daily basis. I think the data is updated, I think after midnight every day for those of you who apply or to subscribe, to notify NYC, which I recommend you all do that's the city's emergency notification system. You will be aware that there is now again an acute need for blood in New York City. So the first thing I wanted to add is if you are really keen on donating and can do so, I encourage you to do so. There's actually a blood drive thanks to our friends at the New York Blood Center tomorrow, that's Thursday, the third in the financial district. So it's stout, which is at 90 John Street. The bar is not open right now, but they are using the space for a blood drive. So we thank our partners there and at the New York Blood Center for hosting that and then that rolls directly into our next battery park city blood drive, which is Wednesday, January, 20th I, know a lot of our local papers have done a great job. Promoting and helping us get the word out about that and the community has been doing a magnificent job. So thank you to all who have donated and continue to update over the course to donate over the course of five blood drives since June and I've listed them there out at the bottom, we've gotten more than 400 donations, including 70, another 77 units collected just last month, November 17th. We did one and it was another very successful session. So thank you, everyone and keep it coming. New, Yorker, New Yorkers! Need you the top page three very briefly. It's that time of year again so, as we know, holiday lights usually happens in person at South Cove. Instead, this year it is virtual, but we filmed it in South Cove and it will be going live tomorrow on our YouTube channel, so click on the YouTube channel and you will be able to see a special arrival by our friend, Santa, Claus, singing and overall, merry meant by our partners at Ps 276 and by the Singh Harlem choir. Thank you for ruining the surprise. Well, you know, I'm you know it's in there. It's in the report, I'm not assuming anything, but what I really would like to draw your attention to? Is the top two items right underneath that graphic solution? We are, as we usually do, partnering with some great community organizations for folks who may want to donate, not blood this time, but other needs other goods to folks in need. So, if you'd like to make a donation to city harvest, you can click there to do it and or to stockings with care. There are ways to help the city. Harvest, especially, is very helpful. I mean they make it incredibly user friendly. It's not just you put in a mountain. You get to choose what you want to donate, whether it's a box of fruit or veg, pasta or sauce or any number of things. It really is a very user-friendly interface and I would hope that if you can spare a little bit, you can do so to try and help your neighbors in need. So thank you for that a lot around the Hollands and you will see ads in our local papers as well as we try to get the word out top of page four. This is actually an interesting item, and you know the community board has always been a very good partner and sounding board on any number of issues around the neighborhood. One of the things I wanted to approach with you briefly is. You will recall that in late March this year we opened up our lawns a little early. We usually do it mid April, but we opened them early this year, because we wanted to promote social distancing and give some folks additional space outside to be outside without being too close to one another and, while usually get fenced off for the season around the Mid-November time frame. We have in fact extended that out to about Mid-December now so starting probably the week of the 14th or so you'll, see the familiar fencing going up around the lawns throughout battery park. City was an important caveat, and that is in an interest in the interest of trying to kind of again promote social distancing and provide additional first for space for people who we know, need it and we've gotten some feedback that folks really appreciate it. We're exploring the idea of kind of leaving certain parts of the lawns for certain parts of the season open through little small gates in the fencing, so that we can leave public access to certain of the parks open throughout the winter season. So folks would have an additional time to be out there and enjoy the fresh air without being too close to one another. Now certain qualifiers apply right when, if it's a rainstorm or something like that, you're gonna close the fields off because they just get wrecked, and this doesn't include the fields that are generally open anyhow, so the ball fields will be open. All winter West Hems lawn is open. We sometimes we will usually open teardrop park a little slope there on days when it snows, so folks can kids can sled on it, but we're talking about you know some of the larger areas of Wagner, Park and Rockefeller Park on a rotating base. We would like to experiment this year and try to keep them open for the community benefit and to have folks enjoy their beautiful parks and public spaces. I guess. My question for the community board is: does this sound good to you and if so, would you mind perhaps then in the spring, there's a chance that the lawns will of course be beautiful, because our horticulturals do a great job but there's a chance? They may not look exactly the same because we're trying to keep them open for more people to use. So I wanted to broach that with you and let you know and hear what you thought about it. I will let everybody else get a chance to speak. Who wants to but I think that's a great idea. I think more open space is necessary and better and yeah I think the gates are a great idea. It's just wonderful, so yeah great idea, and if you can do it longer, that's wonderful, but if you can't I understand that too yeah I've thumbs up from me, but I also could I interrupt you now and I. Think people with hands raised is a good choice. Yeah. So do you need a resolution from us to support that? No okay happy to have it, but no it's something that we. You know our parks folks really do a great job. They actually had. This idea and I wanted to make sure that you know I approached it with you, but I think it's something that we would like to. We would like to do so. Ideally, I, guess the form and shape this would take is what I'd want to do is come back to you guys well by the time I come back to you in January may hopefully be actually open a few weeks already, but I'd like to at least publish a calendar or some type of probably in a number of different ways right like a calendar or social media or a blog post or something that goes out to the community. That basically says hey for this two-week stretch. The north lawn of Rockefeller Park is going to be open and then for this at the south lawn of Wagner and then for the succeeding two-week stretch. It'll be the south lawn of Rockefeller and the central lawn at Wagner. So you give some of the areas some room to heal, but you still have a consistent kind of bevy of lawn space. That's available to folks, so no we would like to do it. If you don't have any objection, it's not like. We need you to push us on it, not that we wouldn't okay. We don't want to do it. Unless you tell us, this is the worst thing. You've ever heard, no I think it's a great idea myself, but okay. So yes, I say yes to that. If you are willing to take a pause and let's let Jill go and then Andrew Zelter go and then let's and then yes, of course, yeah Andres, I'm assuming well he's got to go too so we'll and I'm going to interrupt you for that and then so go ahead. Jill first and then Andrew two-part, quick question: I read the Covid-19 numbers. Why are the numbers so much higher in the northern part of battery park almost double it seems, and the second question is in your role as a state related agency: do you have any role in the vaccine, distribution or selecting areas, or anything like that? It's a good set of questions I will try to tackle the first Eric on the stand. Although I appreciate the answer is no, we would do that through and with the city and state health authorities, but in the north you know it's a good question. I, remember seeing something on that I, don't know why? But I know that you know if you look at the map when you get a chance, I've linked it there what's interesting is the data that they provide is not just the positivity rate, but the total number of tests and the reason I say that is the denominator I think in battery park city is a lot smaller than it is elsewhere. So, for instance, you'll mouse over a zip code, someplace else in the city, it'll say for the seven day period there are 2500 tests right and then the positivity rate is x in battery park city. Not always, but often the total number of tests is like 300, which is not nothing, but you can appreciate if you have 300 tests and eight people test positive, that's going to be a not insignificant percentage. Let's say one of those it's 15 now and a few Greeks will be down to nothing. I'm not saying that, but I am saying, contextually I think you would have in battery park city. You run the chance having a higher percentage rate, even with not that many tests, because you're dealing with a relatively low number of tests overall yep. The question is the comparative reason: I mean between south and north. That's the question I don't know because you don't have a strong motor in that between south and north. You just have it for battery park city as a whole versus other places right. No, he had south and North Dakota Coast people saw that I just go back down. You said you know 300 people in the south versus a thousand people in the north. That's not what you were saying right, Mr friends, I'll bring it up now because I have it open on my desktop all the time. So, for instance, if you'll indulge me for the map yesterday, it was it's the most recent number right so for zip code 102.82 for the dates November 22nd to November 28th. There were 204 people tested in that time frame in this 102.80. There were 301 people tested at the same time frame. If you mouse right across to let's say od10012, there were 1200 almost 1300 tests right. There are areas where there's over two thousand tests, it's just okay, that's what just yeah right and so even with that sentence, there's less tests in the north so that answers kind of I mean if that's true, let's test in the north, even if it's two people it'll be more yeah like I. Think I saw something where the days when it was a little higher. It was eleven total positive tests which yeah that's not a lot. That's not in any way to downplay it. But you know you see, oh, my god, it's 3.5 that must be. You know, 100 people, it was 11 people and who knows that could have been. That could have been one group of folks I, don't know what could have been I, don't know what it is. So don't and don't get me wrong. I'm discounting what you're saying that's important to us as I think from an operational perspective and making sure that we're keeping a very close eye on this is that the numbers very thankfully, continue to trend downward, even in the area, whereas even in the north, where it is actually starting a little bit of a higher point. Eric did I butcher that too much, or is that about right if you're still on yeah I, don't have evidence or information to the contrary when I say that I don't know that I don't know that is the cause, but I also. You know it sounds like a plausible reason for why the numbers would be different and then the second question about the role of the state in vaccine distribution. I. We wouldn't have a. We wouldn't have a role in that, except my guess, is maybe facilitating whatever we can access to the right organizations, maybe to help spread. The word do I have that right, yeah. What I would say is that you know we're in close communication with the governor's office and also with you know, state health officials and, to the extent necessary the health and hospitals folks at the city- and you know, we've told them time again that we're here to support in every possible way- and you know- we've named the various resources, whether it's space or staff, etc that we can leverage to be of support, particularly when it comes to supporting the battery park city community, the other thing I would just say, is I. They will call upon us, you know, I, don't think they, even without the offers they're eager to enlist the help of as many hands as possible, but I would expect- and I'm now, maybe speaking out of turn here, but I would expect that much of the testing will mirror your standard flu shot experience more than it would be. You know, tents in the ball fields or something like that. So I'm expecting more of the testing to take place in pharmacies and primary care facilities and hospitals, Eric you're, saying testing: do you mean vaccines? I did yep. Sorry, that's! Okay, no making sure- because that was my question too is: can you get testing down here, but I'm thinking maybe they're doing testing at rite aid? Are they I, don't know? There's a facility, that's open to the public, but it's by appointment in the Brookville com, complex called carbon health, and so tests are available there they take insurance and then there's you know the city Md on chambers and some other local spots. I would encourage everyone to visit the website that the state put together for find a testing site near me. Okay and it's really hot. If you just google like Nys, find a copic testing site, it's the first one that comes up and also I'll, just put in a brief plug for the city's rapid testing, which I just want to make. A distinction is different than the antigen test that they run, but it's the regular pcr test, but they just provide the results very quickly like within an hour or two yeah. 20 minutes goofing her, but it's taking them two days and the weight online was how long this morning, Ollie two and a half hours two and a half hours and she went when they opened because I saw friends on Thanksgiving I need to stay safe. You know, yeah, okay, no, that's cool because we've been doing it too, but yeah. I've had people wait five hours and we didn't do that, but yeah, but that was today. So that's your latest update. Thank you very much. Thank you both of you, I'm Betty, don't be silly. Go ahead! Buddy! I'm you! Thank you thanks. Yes, I want to speak to the lawns in general and being open. Theoretically, I'm very much for that, because I agree with what you said about people needing space and opportunities. I want to kind of give the flip side, and that is some users- are very aggressive users of this space, but there's a spot outside of my place that I can look at and in fact it's a martial arts group that goes out and works. Rockefeller Park right by where the kids playground is that's in front of that area, and it's just mud I mean it's nothing but mud. So when people come families and others to sit, they're now relegated over to the side where there's a little bit of grass or something to cushion under their blanket. So some users actually make it useless for anybody but themselves, and it's going to be very difficult, bringing that grass back here's going to be starting from just mud, so I don't know how to balance it, but with some of the users it's not really being open. It's only for their benefit. It's not for anybody else's benefit. That's actually really helpful. Betty I think that Eric and I will certainly take that back. I think this is probably that there's likely a role here for the ambassadors to play or to continue to play. It would be my hope that, with presumably a smaller area, at least generally over the course of the winter, to kind of be open to folks, because otherwise areas will be fenced off, might be more manageable, but you're right. You have to balance that by saying maybe there's a portion of the parks open. You have to make sure that's not just dominated by. You know a group that is just going to want to do their own thing. I think, like anything else, there's a balancing act and again we want to make sure folks are being responsible when they're outside, while also giving the space over to the public, to whom it belongs. To the extent that we can do that in a safe place. This is probably one business yeah. Well, if it's a business I'll tell you what, if it's a business and they're running it's a class, a martial art, it puts a business and they're running classes in the park and it's over 20 people I. Don't think they should be doing that without a permit anyway. So that should be something we should address. If you want to send me offline some of the particulars times and places we can make sure we can address that to the appropriate channels. Sure I'll look for that yeah because they have to they need to be permitted if they're doing events in our parks and as it is thanks Betty. Yes, thank you Betty all right, maybe the guy who was waiting for like three hours before exactly can we talk to Andres now Andre yeah, no, not at all I feel like I've gotten to know every single one of y'. All it's been a pleasure taking part in this I just want to make sure yes perfect, so one thank you so much for taking her giving me the time. I won't take up too much of your time. I also have to walk my dog Justine, but essentially I'm a graduate student at the CUNY School of Public health yeah great classes in school I mainly wanted to just talk about a legislation that was introduced last year and just hoping to garner some support for it. It's legislation 1766, which is essentially would push for a local law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York in establishing a green Monday program for the provision of plant-based food by city agencies and participating food service establishments. A version of this initiative- I'm sorry initiative- was actually already introduced by a borough, President Eric Adams for NYC schools in Brooklyn, I, don't know if you guys are aware of this, but now all New York City schools, at least when they were open, are serving our children, essentially plant-based food and plant-based alternatives. Every Monday and essentially taking that opportunity to educate them about nutrition and alternatives to you know having meat and other proteins that they could partake in. This has mainly been a concern of mine, because currently food production is one of the leading sources of greenhouse emissions. It generates about 30 percent of the total global emissions, and last year alone the United States produced over 130,103 million pounds of red meat and poultry. Not only that Americans are essentially eating what is equivalent to 140 of what should be recommended for meat intake. You know this reliance I mean me personally, I used to be this person also I had meat almost every single day, but it became a concern because it's a dietary imbalance that will you know just fill you with cholesterol, saturated fats, sodium all these factors that, in heart, related issues that my family happens to suffer from genetically as well by simply eating less meat or taking out the meat component of it and replacing it with something that might be plant-based. One could significantly reduce the risk of heart diseases, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes and even cancer. Essentially, what we want to do with this legislation is not it's just not only to promote less meat consumption, but really to force consumers to just consider what it is they're taking in every day and maybe consider the alternative. I know that a lot of people haven't necessarily had plant-based alternatives and by plant-based alternatives. What I'm talking about is things that are made of Bean Pea soy plant things like that. All of these you know, I feel that with the introduction of these alternatives it could affect behaviors and possibly future decisions when choosing a protein. I know myself once I had a beyond burger. I'm like this is close enough. This is amazing. Why not have this and save a cow right yeah with the right amount of participation, education and incentive, I'm hoping that Green Monday might be, might have the potential to not only you know affect the skewed diets of New Yorkers. Maybe just have them consider not having that bacon egg and cheese every morning which I might suffer from you know, day of day, but what we're essentially hoping for is to contribute towards a movement that seeks to shift away the heavy reliance of the meat industry, and you know just save the environment a little bit and as well as ourselves and yeah I just wanted to speak about that, but thank you so much for giving me the time. I feel honored. No, that's great! Thank you and I'm going to suggest that you make a appearance at our full board meeting at the end of the month. I, don't know the date, but you can student can tell you yeah and at the beginning of it, at six o'clock to you get two minutes to speak and you got to talk to more people than just the 20 of us. I love the 20 of y'. All please, thank you so much. Thank you. I'll see you at the next meeting. Actually I look forward to it. Excellent. Thank you all right, great Nick finish it up. You've got two minutes. Please finish it. It's gonna, be it's all good stuff. All right! Look at this! Just look at this face. This is what you're, torturing, oh sorry, and so going back to that page right. Underneath the park's launch discussion and all the feedback there like put a quick item there for open community meetings. Now these are the ones you've come to know and love right. These are our town halls. You I'm going to go to you afternoon. Sorry now, over the course of the past year, we've done dozens of kind of meetings, mostly targeted on like resiliency and sustainability, and board meetings and community board meetings. But what we'd like to? Maybe do in the start of 2021 to start the year off is to do one of our kind of patented town hall style, freewheeling type sessions. So the idea is to try to do that should be Tbd at Tbs Sorry in early 2021, unless there's a real desire to try and do one late, December but I think that might be difficult with the holidays. So if it's all the same to you, we will work with Lucian and the team here to try and find an open night on the calendar. So it's not to work at cross purposes or at least tonight that doesn't kind of have a whole lot of overlap with community board items on it to hold that so more to come on that, but hopefully we'll have that date set soon and I know, there's a lot of items. People want to catch on up on generally right, so not just resiliency sustainability. Although that's welcome but budget I know, we want to do an update on that and talk about some items there so just to marinate on for now more to come on date and time and Luci and Tammy and Justine I'll be in touch with you as we're kind of kicking around some dates, so we can fast forward there. A lot of stuff we know is important, but it's appeared before sustainability plan is obviously still a top resilient item. Resiliency recovered a little bit as well this evening, so I'll skip through that I will go now to the top of page nine, if you don't mind their illusion, I just wanna. Actually, I'm sorry, the bottom of page, eight I, just wanna, make sure that appropriate props here only because Justine brought it up. This is just a nice little tribute to our folks who work on parks operations so there's a whole bunch of pictures of leaves there at the bottom of page, eight Lucian and that's just some pictures from our team doing some work Lucian, it's page, eight at the bottom. No next one keep going. Oh I see I'm going by the roman numerals. No I'm sorry no pj at the top right. That's just some great work by our parks operations. Folks, that's in my dad joke at the bottom two there it says, leave it to parks, ops, get it leave it. So that's some great work that they were doing in the southern part of the neighborhood, no leaf blower, Justine. Okay, but just you know just a small token of our appreciation to our parks, operation staff that do such a great job keeping battery park city, the best neighborhood in New, York City, so I want to give them a credit, and some shout out for the great work that they do to always keep this neighborhood as pristine, as we all expect it to be moving down. Very briefly, as you know, downtown Soccer League said farewell. This is the type of page in the illusion to Manny Dalmata, who is a long time coach and mentor at the battery Park city ball field. It's a very nice moment on November 21st, but what I also want to draw attention to at the bottom is some really nice. Testimonials again, these were unsolicited. These just came to us. These were people riding the battery park city authority, thanking us for the work and keeping the battery parks at the ball fields open for the fall season. The last one I think is my favorite one. I have two children 11 years and nine years, they've been so excited during the week on weekends to play soccer on the fields. Everyone in the community that we know have been much healthier as a result of the absolute activities thanks so much for the beautiful fields. So I win. It's not me. This is the work that Freddie and the team do parks, operations, team, Eric and the Allied universal ambassadors who make sure those fields are well managed and that the folks who have permits can use those fields uninterrupted and when there are open play hours, they're keeping an eye on things as well. So certainly we are far from perfect, but we are I think very far above the average for any neighborhood in New, York City. I'd also note that also permitted on the field. This fall, you wouldn't know there was a pandemic going on, except for all the folks, following all the rules and wearing masks, we had Manhattan youth, downtown giants, Ps89 super sock stars and asphalt green all using the fields in a permanent and orderly fashion. So thanks to everyone, who'll help make that happen. That's it next board meeting on the 16th and the next community council meeting for NYPD on December 17th. That was the highlight there that I had to edit earlier sorry again Eric and with that, unless there are any questions, that's all I have Andrew I didn't let him speak before Andrew go ahead very quickly, just first on the question of keeping the grass areas open longer into the season again. Theoretically, I think it makes sense. The only thing I would offer is that Nick? If there's, if it increases the risk, you'd have to delay opening those grass fields or grass lawns in the spring, when the weather's warmer and you'd have more people wanting to be out there, I think you might have buyer's remorse if you kept them open for two or three or four weeks in the winter and had to delay on the back end of that come opening in the spring. So just a thought. There, no understood I, think the idea is to make sure that we stay on the scale, but all the same I will take it back and make sure we want to do this with minimal to no impact on the back end. This would be in addition to not, instead of that's the vision, yeah and then with respect to the work and all the effort as it relates to those ball fields. I think it's as close to perfect as you can possibly get they're the best facilities in the city bar none so kudos to everyone involved with that and then finally, can you give just a 30 second update on what's going on with the upper terrace and when you think it might be open, I'm gonna have to defer to my lifeline here. I'm sorry I would but I probably won't be able to say it or find it as quickly as Eric would know, I think, and if we don't have it tonight, I can follow up separately. Eric are you there? He was there. He unmuted, now he's muted, yeah I am here. I just want to I would want to check with Anthony to confirm before we got back to you Andrew. That would be great, though, to get back to us, I didn't even I'm so pathetic. I didn't even know they were closed. No, it's totally. Okay, so Andrew! Actually thank you for that. We'll follow up with you and I'll just loop, you as well, so you have an update, I'm not gonna! Wait, I'm not gonna, be till January! We'll get you an update, you know this week on where we are, that would be cool yeah. That's fine, as you can imagine, it just impacts our potential planning for the spring. If we're able to have a season and where we locate spectators yep for sure Andrew had you spoken with Freddie about this topic, I know that he has been. You know, staying in close contact with Anthony with regards to the status of the project which, by the way I know, is moving along quite well, yeah, so great point: we have had frequent contact with Freddie, although I don't know it's as current as it should be and for some reason I got the impression that the timetable might have accelerated a bit I, don't know if that's accurate or not, but as of tonight, I'm not sure I know what the most current status is, but we've had a lot of conversations with Freddie and team and they've been great I. Just don't think. We've checked in the last two months or so: okay, yeah I have a meeting with Freddie tomorrow, so I'll make sure to raise it with him and make sure that he closes the loop with you if Nick or I don't get to you first great appreciate it: okay! Well! Thank you. Everybody. Thank you all for putting up with the really long meeting tonight, but I think we got a lot done and I'm hoping that the community feels heard and I'm hoping that the authority understands that it's okay to get constructive feedback and we love you guys- are doing a great job and nothing changes about that. Allied universal too, you guys are doing a good job. Let's just keep the lines of communication open, because I think that that's important and you have been doing it so all good and thanks everyone for the feedback. It's when I look, you don't get to hear it, but you need to hear it to make sure you're doing the best job you can for the people you serve. So thank you and we are listening and we're happy to engage. Always thank you. So much and Patrick, thank you, sorry made you talk too much at the beginning and not at the end, but that's okay, I think we can all be very happy to turn this off and go walk. Our dogs feed our puppies eat. Our dinner take care everybody. Thank you. Stay safe, yup, yeah, everybody. Thank you. All goodbye.
