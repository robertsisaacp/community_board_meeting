This is the battery Park City Committee for Community Board, one, Justine Cuccia and I.
Don't, know what the deal is, but I'm, waiting to hear back, but we also have a number of other members on the line right now, which are Betty K, Bob, Schneck, Judith, Weinstock, Sarah Cassell, and we have other board members who are not part of the committee.
First line of business is going to be talking about Allied, universal ambassadors, so I'm going to want to introduce Patrick, Murphy, Nick, Spordone and Eric Munson Patrick Murphy is the head of Allied Universal.
And he's been very kind and agreed to give us his time and attention to kind of explaining what the role of the ambassadors are, as they understand it, as they've been hired to be engaged and they have been hired to be engaged by the battery Park City Authority and Nick Spordone and Eric Munson.
I know that from email exchanges and some in the next door, neighborhood chat, there's been a lot of conversation going back and forth.
And I want to hear what the community has in terms of their perceptions and their expectations, for what a private security force is for them and what they expect from allied.
Tonight, given that I know, there's some questions and we kind of went through a little bit of this exercise.
Last year with allied when the contract was coming up for bid, I've asked Eric Munson, who is our chief operating officer as well, and who kind of oversees the general security posture for the battery Park city authority to join us as well.
And I feel the same way that we want feedback, both immediate and often so, to the extent that you see something, tell us right, away, there's no need to wait until one of these community board meetings.
Our work with regards to securities is never done, but it's also never perfect, and so to the extent that we flip, you know we want to do things.
Any security discussion in battery park city really has to talk, has to start rather with a discussion on crime fighting, and so that is really with regard to the first precinct and part of the reason why we shifted our focus.
Directly, for you know not to observe to report crimes in progress, but rather to mention quality of life issues or to provide Intel on recurring incidents that take a more nuanced approach to calling cri to fighting crime, But the first that one of the things that I'll say in the context of this slide is to the extent that you witness a crime or are victim to a crime.
In fact, The first Precinct Community Council meeting this month is now looking like it's going to be December 17th.
This is the start of the ambassador program, the idea being that these folks are the eyes and ears for both the authority and also the NYPD notifying patrons if they're breaking parks, rules running a command center, that staff 24 7,365 to monitor our camera, network, to field calls and complaints and reports from the public and also to coordinate with Pd on safety, matters.
I've got a quick view on that, and maybe it's going to address but eyes and ears of the neighborhood and kind of like a liaison between the police or the community and the police.
We also, as we've discussed a bunch of times with the committee before I, have the special patrol officer program, and so this was created as a way to provide ally the ability to issue tickets.
Can you know, while lying in bed at night, look on my phone and see where the ambassador is in teardrop park or identify the fact that there isn't one and address the situation and then just a quick shout out to pat at the bottom here.
But we wrote expressly in the contract to make sure that we have someone who has law enforcement experience and ties to serve as a primary contact, not just with local law enforcement, but also to be a main point of contact with members of the community and to attend meetings like these Lucian.
We, don't want to tip people off to the fact that x time is the right time to have your dog on the lawn break, breaking the pooper scooper law.
Think the vast majority of the time there are special patrol officers, working.
That's a another issue that we hear, often which I again, we want ambassadors to proactively engage members of the public, and so, if their head is in their phone, The entire shift.
It's really challenging to do that as you might imagine, but we do want them to scan geotags, which we have to make sure that high traffic areas are caught and addressed by the ambassadors regularly, and also that they're submitting their reports, which they do via their phone.
One of the things I think some of the people in the attendee list are going to mention, are going to be.
I have gone from 200 rector, all the way up to Stuyvesant and beyond and come home, and you know granted that's a bit of time, the coming home part too, and never seen a an ambassador.
Do, not see an issue with where they are at any given time, I mean, and is there a way for you to check like I, know.
Let the community talk before I jump in and let them you know, anticipate too much of what they're going to say but go ahead, Eric, I'm, sorry.
I just wanted to mention that, in addition to providing the conventional security services, because we have a significant allied staff presence in the public Lucian, Could you flip to the thanks.
We talked about both the lost children that have been reconnected with family and their caregivers, and also the special patrol officer program that they've been working on expanding, but I just wanted to take a couple minutes to mention the important work that they've done over really challenging circumstances.
We really are here to listen, but again, I just want to mention that, if, after today's meeting, If something comes to mind that you know that you didn't mention over the course of this evening, feel free to reach out to Nick, Pat or myself and be happy to have a longer conversation with you about it.
Ask that question, because I can just speak during our little league season when the pep officers correctly ask people to relocate from the lower level to the upper level for safety reasons at times, I have to tell you.
And, then I'm going to pass the second one to Patrick what I have heard from the community at large, whether they're emails or phone calls or texts, or just people bumping into me on the street plus my own observation.
These are allied universal ambassadors, so I caught myself when I said that thanks levels of people, but anyhow Patrick, if you don't mind, answering Andrew's second question about: what's that, what's the timeline and what happens Andrew.
Really, If it's negative, if the experience is negative toward you know the safety ambassador toward the general public, that safety ambassador is no longer assigned to battery Park.
My question, first of all, I think it's been a dramatic improvement going from cup to ambassadors, So I just want to put that out there.
That might not I, don't know if that's a question for you for battery Park city authority or the community board, I'm, not sure where that sits.
So that's a really good thing, the only interface problem that I think continues between battery Park City authority and the real 911 police.
Very well, I think they can't even the ones that I know the names of if I could give them geographic tests and they couldn't pass them, which is interesting, and so in emergencies.
I'm, not sure if the ambassadors know where they are, but I presume, because they make all those interactions with those life preservers that they actually have a good sense of that.
But I, really think that we should raise the stature of some of the normal people that actually do the work, So they could go to as themselves introduce themselves to the build the block meeting introduce themselves to the neighborhood, Our community board meetings.
The next thing, I wanted to mention about them, is I often find that they really don't know much about the neighborhood.
I've mentioned this before at meetings, but I think it's worth mentioning again that they really should know something about the activities, the geography and the people that are here, and they should actually strive as ambassadors to develop relationships on a first name basis with the people who work as concierges with the people who sit on the benches and are part of the community with the battery park, seniors, etc.
I. Think one of the things I heard that seemed to be an opportunity is in the contract that said that the community could work together with the ambassador team to kind of find the assigned locations.
I'm cutting you short, because I really want to get to the other people on the attendee list, but I think that's a good idea.
I, Think Patrick's answer to what you just said is that that's not going to be for public consumption, but that might be a working group.
So that, for you, know certain eyes to look at that and get input and then be able to have that information to add color, I, suppose and depth to what the how the ambassadors are being evaluated and their performance, not personally, Like I, don't care performance, review.
I. Think, as a community board might want to direct that and talk about what they do and how they do it and have a better understanding of what tickets they can issue.
Okay, I could just please to the extent that there is a record I want to say that ambassadors need to be wearing a mask at all times, right in the course of their in the course of their duties and in compliance with the governor's executive order, smoking in the park.
And I have mentioned it once to an ambassador like a year ago, and they kind of walked away from me.
I see that often, and then also on Rector Street, the oval parks on the two oval lawns on rector place like right outside of shore and then down the other one.
Okay, So my question then is: Does our neighborhood have a sound limit like I've, seen that in other neighborhood signs, for you, know, excessive, sound and car honking and stuff.
My last question would be if this committee would at all be interested or willing to put forth a resolution asking for a you, know: NYPD official, sound limit.
I, know I've seen it in other neighborhoods, like I, said about like no honking here, five fines over this amount and it could apply to these sounds as well and while maybe not many people could actually give those tickets.
Let Andres know that I'm going to go to the board next, because their hands have been up for a while.
And I first wanted to comment on Patrick's, I'm, the one who reached out when that I think it was a few days ago with respect to the ambassador, throwing something at two passerbys.
One of the reasons why I asked specifically where it was is, Because I know the supervisor and a safety ambassador was dealing with somebody who they had a bicycle incident on the esplanade and the person was busy swinging an object at everybody and cursing at everybody as they were going along, So they had to ask them to leave, but that would be two of them.
Thank you for speaking up sure, I appreciate that I don't know that I have a solution, but what I will tell you next time is call me.
It's a question about scope of services for the ambassadors and has to do with a lot of the traffic issues on South End Avenue a little bit less since the pandemic, because there's less buses, but does it fall within their scope.
Then Pat can follow up with what happens on the ground, but the vehicle and traffic law which govern some of the like the moving violations and the parking violations are not part of the special patrol officer's scope.
And, you know I- see reports almost daily of them, simply just asking them to no longer idle there and nine times out of ten I would say they move, along, It's, not okay.
There a way for people in this neighborhood to know how to contact an ambassador in such a situation or another one.
Would it help the neighborhood would address some of these issues when people can not find an ambassador and need.
Okay, The second part of my question has to do with the ambassadors themselves and oftentimes, especially in the you know, part of the winter I.
Next, Kathy Tammy, unless you like wave at me somehow and tell me, you want me to break you and make you go first, I'm gonna go with the order that of people who come in order, so it would be Kathy, Andres, Sarah, Amy and then Tammy, but.
If this was addressed earlier in the meeting, but I'm wondering if there is an overall communications plan of any kind on the work that allied does were just public information.
Does that or knows you know, I hear comments like they're, always looking at their cell phones, and they don't know that that's kind of a way of checking in and reporting.
If, you have a story like helping a lost child find their parents, You know what a great profile some good work.
Yeah on the public affairs front, I would want to defer to Nick, but I will say that I'm trying to think through the is there a frog on the line.
Take your point that there needs to be a greater understanding in the community about allies, role, which I think I again commend the chair for having this meeting to discuss, but also, Maybe you know, maybe Nick.
Sure again, just like Eric said, though I don't want to I, don't want to think people think that calling allied is a substitute for 911 right, a crime in progress or an emergency situation.
There's graffiti, or you know, quality of life type things, noise, complaints that are not an emergency of nature, then sure Allied is the people allies, the number you should call or contact, and then they can be there and assist and kind of make that determination, whether or not it needs to be escalated to the first precinct or elsewhere.
And I notice in the attendee list, a few names that I recognize from boards of buildings in the neighborhood, Maybe that's a conversation that they want to have with their boards to say, inviting the Gary, Park City Authority, to come to a board meeting and say: hey.
It's not like it's a lot, although I guess with 18 buildings that might be 18 more days of your life, you know whatever and not everybody would want to do it, but that's.
You know for short distance communications or like that and some years ago, now, I can't believe.
They ally presented their project team with us when they interviewed with us, and so you know, 30 of the ambassador hours that you encounter in the parks are run by a minority and women-owned business.
I will say that there they all are required to take the state's security officer training, but Pat. You want to speak a little bit more to what city safe requires of their employees.
So I'd like to know if the new contract is seasonally adjusted and is that, based on the labor levels used for 2019 versus 2020, Looking ahead in the budget, that's my first question.
No, We hear you I, think Tim. Okay, I just got an alert on my webex that my connection was slow, so I wanted to make sure yesterday, okay.
So the board of Battery Park City Authority approves the budget for contracted security services annually, and they allowed me to work with Pat and his team to set staffing levels, not just with regards to the seasonality, but also depending on the needs that are arising in the neighborhood.
You know, we've introduced split shifts over the term of the contract to allow for some additional coverage during certain times of day, where we have found that we needed more coverage in certain areas of the parks, and.
You know that's something that we, as a team has been working on over the term of the contract to make sure that we're calibrating the staffing right.
I. Don't know if you remember it feels like a decade ago, but we were really concerned about the park being overrun in the early spring, just because folks were so eager to get out of their houses.
I'm, just saying for someone like sunny who did speak up and who I knew about the incident immediately because she was very concerned, She, says and reports to the authority and to the allied responsible people that a person with a jacket that says, ambassador and I specifically asked her that when she wrote to me and said this happened and the incident.
This is my concern, or this is what I have seen and unless they also live here and walk the same streets to have them invalidated or to have their responses perceived as they need to prove is to me not the mission statement of the battery Park city authority, nor upholding the contract that they have signed on behalf of the residents with Allied.
Sorry with of the battery Park City authority and Allied, is responding in a way that solves the problem, so.
The incident of the ambassador, whether it's Brookfield or whether it is allied Universal, is the responsibility of the battery proximity authority to figure out having a email sent back to Sonya, saying you contact Brookfield, I'm, sorry.
Every month I've been here every month for the past 50, something months at the Battery Park City Committee every month, often with a 10-page report answering any and all questions.
Be, and frankly, It is best neighborhood in New, York City, If I might say, so, myself, I don't live in it, but I've seen the work that goes into keeping this neighborhood absolutely top notch, but could I just as a point, though Nick I think it's important.
That's like somebody saying I had an issue with somebody in battery park.
I'm, going to let Eric speak because I think that Nick is feeling attacked and that's not what my point was so Eric.
You know Nick and Pat asked for the additional information it didn't come as a surprise that they suspected that it was a Brookfield security.
And, so I was just similar to next response was just taking issue with the characterization that we were not going to address the issue, because I think that again I don't want any park user or resident in the community to have anything thrown at them by anyone and to the extent that it happens, I, want to play a role.
And, I'm speaking in their voice, not necessarily mine, because I have not had this experience particularly, But there are people in the community in the battery park city community who feel as if they say something, and then they're told why they're wrong, and that is something that.
It's not the community board's job to get involved in, but I just would like the authority to hear that and sit with it.
Let us talk further offline, and let us keep going on this conversation, because once again, I heard a lot of really great things about ally, I, think that the relationship between the battery park, City authority and the community is commendable.
Let's talk about the equipment sheds on the battery park city side, of, West, Street, Nick.
Because I know when they came up at a environmental committee meeting, you guys were pretty much blindsided like we were with the fact that they had to be installed.
I'm, not an engineer or a architect or designer, but I'll start by saying we being battery park city authority, we're still kind of in the throes of kind of technical and legal and ownership discussions with both DEP and DOT about many of the issues, including what are known as these kind of control.
We owe them on issues that we've been talking around for some time right: battery bikeway the back kind of housed, The backup house entrance on the berm in or kind of the structure in Wagner Park from the seating areas on the lawn.
So when we're on the east side and then in battery park city, It's all one of these control houses, but you were able to tell that they were kind of the same family.
What this chart says: here, this picture, I, don't know, and the boy and Justin the CB is already on record, asking for contextualities to neighborhood, not symmetry, because we don't think it should look the same as it does the historic Seaport as it would in battery park city great again that we would want to hear.
Okay, then that's good, that that's what I want to know all right go ahead.
I want to carry I still because I checked with, even though I know, there's still answers happy to be to the EP committee, capitalist by staying still working through a lot of technical and ownership issues of these things and how it's actually technically gonna work.
Yeah, whether or not a second of these would be needed, which would require the removal of the entire lawn area on the south side of West Ham's park that for lack of a better expression, it's like where all the babies sit in the grass.
There pull up the presentation card because I remember I want to say: We've got people from the community who I know want to speak to Bob. If I, see your hand, up.
I, know, Vinton wanted to speak.
They started so Vinton Thompson, I'm, going to let go first, assuming he still wants to speak.
And, then maybe Bob Zach wants to speak, I, don't know, but go ahead.
So I, don't think that's also of value and something that we're going to want to know, because that that's going to affect us too.
One thing that we certainly could push for would be having a not uniform to what's going on all over the city or all over lower Manhattan having something that is specific to battery park.
There's members of the environmental committee on line here right, now, I, think but Justine.
I think that when in at least one or more of these discussions, the idea, you know that there is a crossing across the West Side highway at West Ham and that when you're, some part of the way across there there's this really pretty big area in the middle of the road there where it could fit, and that was proposed.
That's I, don't know if it's large enough to accommodate a structure of this side but size, but that should be looked at as well, but the I also want to follow on Vinton Thompson's comments, because I agree with him wholeheartedly that having a structure with a wall facing directly on little West Street directly across from the Ritz and from the hotel, is really possibly the worst of solutions.
Those are things that I think Nick has said will be addressed and looked at and reviewed, but I did want to point out that we completely at the Visionaire condominium, I'm.
What we discussed earlier with Allied and everything else, I'd like to emphasize that we're not alone and we're in this together when I say that you know for forward on this kind of necessary project.
We have nothing further, Can we move on to please if you, if you're, willing, Nick, you want to get started, I mean we know to start with puree.
I. I, just wanted to say that I think that it's important to realize that I suppose I'm interested in finding out whether or not the agreement with the current operator can keep going and to what extent can the community board be involved in those conversations to kind of keep it the way it is if we go as we go back from the Covid-19, because it's really a good thing, but I think that my impression over the last few years is that the bar part of it's a little bit too big and that it never really.
The final thing I want to comment on is there has been a controversy over quite a bit of time about building a new and larger eating venue in Wagner, Park.
Disruption of the whole area might really be unnecessary, especially at a time when money and resources in battery park, city and in lower Manhattan are probably going to be more stressed for the next five years than they have in the last 25 years.
And I, rest, Bob I, don't know if Nick has an answer for you for any of it, but I think it's an interesting concept, and also what about just moving to Gmail's weight.
And we do our level to you- won't deliver on the things that we can take off any number of things, but going after the start of the meeting, The idea of having special patrol officers was due to Eric's, extraordinarily hard work and a number of people who had the authority.
Okay, I, think I'm not in a position or do I know really more than what I have shared.
Okay and the interest is: How should an interesting and powerful question is how should leaseholders and landlords behave and the battery parks of the authority is the landlord and it gets a chance to manage in public above board the current person that holds the lease and the current organizations that hold the lease.
Somebody, just better speak up if they want to say something, I, think we're good.
You know, I want these things to be really good for you guys when I compete together before I start this up, there's one member of the public.
This is actually an interesting item, and you know the community board has always been a very good partner and sounding board on any number of issues around the neighborhood.
City was an important caveat, and that is in an interest in the interest of trying to kind of again promote social distancing and provide additional first for space for people who we know, need.
We would like to experiment this year and try to keep them open for the community benefit and to have folks enjoy their beautiful parks and public spaces.
So I wanted to broach that with you and let you know and hear what you thought about it.
And I wanted to make sure that you know I approached it with you, but I think it's something that we would like.
Although I appreciate the answer is no, We would do that through and with the city and state health authorities, but in the north you know it's a good question.
Interesting is the data that they provide is not just the positivity rate, but the total number of tests and the reason I say that is the denominator I think in battery park city is a lot smaller than it is elsewhere.
What you're saying that's important to us as I think from an operational perspective and making sure that we're keeping a very close eye on this is that the numbers very thankfully, continue to trend downward, even in the area, whereas even in the north, where it is actually starting a little bit of a higher point.
I think, like anything else, there's a balancing act and again we want to make sure folks are being responsible when they're outside, while also giving the space over to the public, to whom it belongs.
Underneath, the park's launch discussion and all the feedback there like put a quick item there for open community meetings, You I'm going to go to you afternoon.
I know, We want to do an update on that and talk about some items there so just to marinate on for now more to come on date and time and Luci and Tammy and Justine.
Okay, but just you know just a small token of our appreciation to our parks, operation staff that do such a great job keeping battery park city, the best neighborhood in New, York City, so I want to give them a credit, and some shout out for the great work that they do to always keep this neighborhood as pristine, as we all expect it to be.
This is the work that Freddie and the team do parks, operations, team, Eric and the Allied universal ambassadors who make sure those fields are well managed and that the folks who have permits can use those fields uninterrupted and when there are open, play, hours, they're, keeping an eye on things, as well.
But, I, probably won't be able to say it or find it as quickly as Eric would know, I think, and if we don't have it, tonight, I can follow up.
Let's just keep the lines of communication open, because I think that that's important.
