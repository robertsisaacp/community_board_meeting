It's been moved around a little bit and that we're going to start with the street use priorities because Jennifer Leung is here from the D.O.T in case we have any questions.
What, eight or nine months in New York City, in which we've seen many unprecedented changes in our the use of our streets from restaurants, to open streets, for you, know, exercise and commerce and DOT is taking those all of these programs that were enacted very quickly and without a lot of community board, Input and they'll be working on finalizing that.
What our input is, what our priorities are, What our guiding principles would be so that we can get ahead of some of the discussions that are going to happen as DOT is working to finalize these programs and provide them with input ahead of time as to hey.
There wasn't too many edits after following our committee meeting last month, but so I wanted to give everyone an opportunity also to see if anyone has any additional thoughts once we do that, then I was thinking that we should go through and see if any of these bullet points fit into broader categories, that we could kind of group them into since I think.
I think it was at the beginning of this year, though that seems so long ago, in which the Department of Sanitation announced that it would have a clean curbs pilot, program, Actually, I, wonder if this link shows an image, it doesn't show an image, but the idea was that they wanted to start a pilot program in which they would create or be start putting containers on the curbs for businesses and residences to use to throw their trash out instead of throwing them on the sidewalk.
Another thing that came up was actually prompted by the discussion that we had about Edgar Street on or trinity place at your street, in which there's the new school going in there.
We had started having a discussion about making sure that our a priority seemed to be coming out of that discussion was we want to make sure that they're, safe, drop off and pick up areas for school, kids, I wrote as a question as to whether or not there's demand around schools for additional play space or areas, especially given Copen 19.
You know supporting the expansion into two non-controversial locations, but also when the therefore be it resolves were a few points that I think feed are good examples of what we could come out of these priority discussions with one of them.
Another is hey: We should be putting bike lanes on streets with CitiBike docks and increasing education around CitiBike, and so some of the things that you see right away here are things prioritizing pedestrians, making sure that we are not obstructing sidewalks, making sure that we're you know supporting our local businesses and making sure that we're ensuring safety both for cyclists and pedestrians.
I'll go through the remainder really quickly, so another one was pedestrian, curbside and drop-off locations, oh, like for hotels and residences, making sure that there's space in front of those I guess high traffic areas.
I think we need to start working on that, and you know, speaking with D.O.T and Jennifer.
If we can add that language that I mentioned change, curbside parking regulations to comport with current needs of residents and businesses.
And, so I think, once we finish having discussion about these points, I'd love to get everyone's take on how they kind of fit into broader buckets, and if we want to pick any of those that are going to become part of our resolution.
I think also exploring what the current New York City law is, that forces DOT to have to give those permits for very little money.
Hearing that the these construction, the demo jobs construction jobs, are taking street space, but paying almost you know nothing compared to the value that it actually, you know, represents to the community in terms of moving people and goods and services through the district, that their pain was nothing.
You know when certain streets are going to be closed if at all, I think that would be helpful to not only pedestrians but also people that are driving or cycling or whatever the case may be.
I mean there may be very good reason, but, for example, like maiden lane between water and gold I, Don't know you can't park there until like 10 o'clock.
In addition to you, know something like a parking meter that has to be fed that you're paying more money.
Do, you think that like would fit in as I think you're right, It kind of fits in with what Mark and Patrick were saying and possibly even more to the point where there are some parking rules that maybe are remnants from when they maybe made sense in the past, but the neighborhoods changed, especially now with Covid-19 things have changed and it might be time to revisit.
Think Lucian knows where I'm going, I'm gonna use the area right by Washington Market.
The parking hasn't changed, it's an ideal location for other usages potentially, and the parking could change and provide relief to the area in different ways, and I'm wondering there doesn't seem to be that I have seen as of yet any mechanism that I know of to be able to report that request that you know kind of figure that out.
And we've seen, we've approved numerous city agencies moving around our district, renting new space, that's come before our board and they apply to DOT for street side.
If there's a mechanism, a form, a request, file, something that's easiest easier for people to be able to funnel that, and if our goal is to reduce usage of cars and getting cars off the streets for a variety of reasons, then what can we do about agency parking to get them to use any number of the garages that we have that are not sold out in full and get them off the streets to really see what that does for our community, even if it was turned into metered parking, which would then make money for the city and allow people to travel.
And I think this is turning into something that actually might end up being a good topic for like a future meeting.
Do, some research for us, because it does seem like we do-- need to have a conversation about the current street parking regulations and.
For example like there's streets that have what parking for like I, don't know, DOT or parking for different agencies, federal and state or sorry.
I personally feel somewhat slated by it, because it does feel like our neighborhood is being treated as a municipal parking lot when it's our streets, you know and that's public space, and we deserve to be part of a conversation as to how that space is being allocated.
Have you know a lot of these were quality of life issues and right before the transportation committee, and.
So you know, parking I, Think Patrick brought this one.
We have somebody in fact, next month, there's going to be a group coming forward about the signage in front of their building and the ability to drop and pick off people, something that Pat Moore just spoke.
It will be done, be very helpful for me, as chair of the committee, to have the idea of the community's priorities, because I have a bunch of individuals saying this is a good signage change, because I want this in front of my place.
Look into it and, of course, There was agency parking on the block, one building in particular, I'm thinking about, and they never got back.
You know disgusting in any case, I wanted to pick you back up for quickly on what Tammy was saying as well as kind of touching on what Britney suggested.
You know when you have like a new turning signal or something all of a sudden on the street.
You, know, or residents are they're used to parking on a particular street.
And I'm sure there were people from the neighborhood that were used to that being, You know free parking on Sunday and all of a sudden it wasn't so notification would be fair in those instances too.
These are private businesses that are taking public space and again glad to see them get the help that they need but wondering if we should or how people think about advocating for should the community have some similar, opportunity.
Should residential buildings be able to have the opportunity to say hey in front of our in front of our building like we want to participate in this program as well, but we have increased, need for you, know residential drop off and pick up.
I, I'm, gonna, Actually, I, think add on to what you might have started to say, which is that you know with all of these balancing things.
Are we serving the greater community by having a single private parking space or, by you, know, a residential loading and unloading serving a tall residential building.
You know you could argue that agency vehicles serve more people than a private car, like so they're.
And I, really think, It's great work that you guys are doing, and maybe Jennifer has something that she wants to add about how DOT is prioritizing these different uses.
Based on what they've been working on throughout the city, I mean when you guys were mentioning about how CB2 has on the agenda items to have like current changes, you're correct that they do look at it based on someone that came to them with what they thought.
They have people that they've been working with who've been speaking to, and they would like this to be changed, so they would put that in as a resolution have it on the agenda.
And sometimes, If I get in advance, I might actually ask my engineers to take a look at it and see if it's something feasible and if they do think that it's feasible, they would like them to make sure you know, get a resolution and that's something that we can work on, and that applies to every you.
You know when, like I said when it comes to curb rates, those are easier things to change.
We are the constituents, because we as a community board, are looking to reduce agency parking, because we know that the agencies will not come willingly to the plate, Are we allowed to make those requests or does it have to go through the agency.
Has too many agency parking that you want us to like shorten it or like, or I'm, trying to think of an example, What, you're.
Okay, If we said you know, there's agency parking there seven days a week, but we would like to know if that agency parking could be either reduced, removed or changed to business, hours, Monday through Friday, seven to five or whatever, and either be metered or free afterwards, which would help facilitate parking availability for people attending target and whole foods, and the ancillary small businesses in that zone.
The community board asked DOT to audit the amount of agency authorized parking that was actually necessary for I, can't remember what agency it was for that particular street.
And I think that's what we'd like to see all over the district, because I would say that typically each agency that comes to us, they have, We have to have them, submit us application and a survey like they have to give us the number of cars that they have, and you know, based on, where they're located there's a formula that we look at and based on that formula.
If you realize that, maybe that agency is no longer the same amount of vehicles that are using that space, Then we could also definitely take a look, and you know resurvey them, because what we do is that our authorized parking unit is the one who does all the coordination and they.
I mean it's to allow vehicles, passenger cars to be able to drop off and pick up right, yeah, something like that.
You know whether that's the you know, residents, who need to do some loading unloading, whether that's a commercial vehicle, whether that's a delivery vehicle like we need people to be able to have curbside spot when they need it and to say that whatever parking regulations are going to support.
I mean there are some streets where, when the businesses are open and metering, it till 10 pm makes sense, you know, but it.
I also think some of these topics that we've taken up are going to end up turning into standalone items on future committee agendas, but I actually don't want to speak too much.
I'm kind of glad to hear a little bit more gelling around certain things being important to a wide swath of the committee members and public that are speaking because that's kind of what I had the point of doing this was to get a sense of the priorities of the community rather than hearing one or two people, yell really loudly at a particular item that comes up.
I want to remind those who may not have been here or thanksgiving kind of distracted them a bit with some of the things that were pointed out last month and Carol attends is here who can answer questions from Revel as well, for people who have questions, but it is an app-based, scooter-sharing rental service and again the scooters are mopeds.
Another question, Since we have received complaints about the use on bike paths and in parks other places where they're, not allowed, What regulations or laws exist for mopeds and moped sharing in New York City.
Now you know what I've been doing for the last month was getting answers to these questions, and next give you some of the answers that I have gotten both from Revel, as well as from the D.O.T under current New York City D.O.T regulations, rebel, mopeds.
You want to use it simply for making reports, You can also use their email or calling them, but because of the concern that we heard last month about 311 really being the mechanism for how people make complaints about things and how the city government tracks complaints for things.
New York City Council is currently working on law 6773, which would be oversight of shared mopeds and e-scooters.
Again, e-scooters are sidelight but they're, not in Manhattan anyway, and a lot 2061, a local law which would amend the administrative code of the city of New York, which would grant DOT approval for shared moped, organizations.
However, Although law 2061 has not yet passed, the DOT is creating a permit system to formally regulate shared moped systems, so they're, anticipating those like Revel in New, York, City.
I know like space is very limited right now, especially with all the outdoor dining going on.
The I also sit on the Hudson River Park Trust, Advisory Council, and the topic of rebel scooters has become a large conversation there as well, as I'm sure you know in individual boards.
Anybody riding in that area would be suspended from the platform, but definitely I, think we're always open to working with the city and improving the technology that we have to make sure that there's no illegal writing going on.
So when we do move to vote after discussion, people are well informed before they vote the first one supporting Mo, Revel Moped's, share operation in New, York, City and I.
Let's support their continuation, two to urge New, York City Council to pass legislation that will regulate the use of moped share organizations, as I said, that's already being discussed and worked.
This would be merely to make sure they keep moving on that and perhaps pass it urge the New York City Department of transportation to develop the regulations for moped share, which again they have acknowledged, and the law would mandate them to do, but as our input would be, to provide clear guidance and signage for where mopeds can not be driven, which kind of mirrors what Tammy has just said and what really inspired me to think about.
You know that they should be in the right hand, lane that anyway, that the resolution doesn't have like a an education campaign.
Three of these results for the signage and guidance would be to warn mopeds because yeah the big thing is them knowing before they end up where they can't make a move out of a lane such as when they're going down.
You accept a friendly amendment that supports what she just said about urging New York City more than legislation or developing regulations, but to work on a public relations, marketing campaign of education surrounding this education public, because a public education, Oh sorry, I'm, not unmuted, but to that they're supposed to be written in the right, hand, lane, for example, You know, people who are new to mopeds may not know whether they follow vehicular rules.
And, so I think it's gonna be just the general issue of riders drivers of other vehicles, understanding, the limitations and necessities of mopeds, because it's a very different kind of vehicle on the road and Mark Ben. I brought this point up a few times and at some point supposed to be put on the executive committee agenda, but the idea of a resolution being presented to us written where we really should be constructing these things organically at the Committee and Tammy no offense.
We could attempt to persuade the city or you know, whoever it is that manages those tests for New York state to consider, including more direction for drivers with cars that drive with rebels on the street.
Think it'll be a great idea to look at a resolution to the state Dmv about driving putting into their testing system questions about driving among Microtransport mopeds, because I agree, that is a whole new dimension to who's on the road.
Other comment about the actual, therefore, be it resolved statements, because that's what we're going to vote on for the resolution and, Of course, they can be changed in full board, but I want to get it checked, here, because it's the one place where we can make changes without motion so and great.
The flaw in this map that I want everyone to know is that it's being calculated from the center point of the school, which is where I assume New York City established the coordinates of the DOT, that this is from the official data set and the law says it's measured from the school entrance or exit.
One I needed some technical looking eyes looking at this, because we're dealing with, Am I using the right direction, such as, where I am in the city codes and things to work out the actual wording of these resolutions, but also because I want to make clear that two things that I'd like to see changed and get feedback from people.
I would like City Council to amend that law, to add no standing, zones, loading zones and blocking sidewalk ramps or curb cuts as reportable locations where parking creates hazardous obstruction that endangers safety.
Many people complaining about when cars park in standing, zones, such as in front of buildings when I know, river terrace here was marked out to be no standing, was so that emergency vehicles, especially hook and ladder fire trucks, had an adequate turning radius to be able to get into the street.
Sorry, this vehicle to go to some place that is hopefully far from transit and I, believe that you know them allowing them to park in some of those areas.
Long like a loading zone or a cross or a curb, cut, And. Yet, as we know, many of the placard uses, especially in battery park.
You know, there's lots of places for people to park into these days.
I, Think this needs to be a very general consensus which I'm glad to hear you know.
