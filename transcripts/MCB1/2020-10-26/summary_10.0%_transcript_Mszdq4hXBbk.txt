I see we have capital and budget expense first, but I'm going to hold that I'm going to allow a Warren, Street, Cargo, Bike, Corral presentation by DOT.
I'm a project manager for the movie unit at DOT, happy to be here to present and update you about our proposal for a cargo bike corral to be called mid block on warm street in front of the in front of one of the exits of whole foods between West Street and Greenwich.
This here is an image showing the cargo bikes operating out of the whole foods on Houston Street, using the space at the curb.
But, just like this location, whole foods on Warren Street, is working to use cargo bikes for their local deliveries as a pilot participant, they can load unload and stage your deliveries at the curb, but having a dedicated space with cargo bike rails can improve safety and efficiency of their overall operations.
We work very closely with NYPD dot's parking, division, commercial Bicycles unit and safety education team to help run.
This sorry this can help alleviate issues like parking on street signs, fences and trees to keep the sidewalk clear.
This will be partially occupying the truck loading zone, where the pilot participants, such as whole foods, is permitted to load, unload and stage their deliveries at the curb already, but having dedicated bike parking available with the Cargo Bike Rail Improves safety and also provides free, convenient and short-term parking for the public to use we're.
To show you an example of what the Cargo Bike rail could potentially look like is that the space will be marked out with bike racks, flexible ballers and markings in the outside lane.
Rail is this additional space allowed for cargo bikes to load, unload and stage their goods safely in the space which are which are not allowed to stick out of this marked out space or block the travel lane, so they can either park parallel or at an angle, to the curb, depending on the dimensions of the bikes and whole foods, will be maintaining the cargo pipe corals to ensure that they'll will be clear of snow and debris and report derelict bikes.
This bike corral is for whole foods so that they can load and unload for their deliveries right, but the public can use this as well.
Whole foods is a private company that makes a huge profit, and so a city street is going to have part of its space they're going to get for free, They're, not paying for this parking.
That, add vehicle, miles traveled and create safety problems on the city streets, to delivery by cargo bike, and in order to facilitate That.
Seventy percent of that space is whole food space and thirty percent Like Eugenia said: first come first serve and the racks are added bike parking for either shoppers or community.
They have to find a place off street to store their bicycles overnight, but in the process of loading unloading and staging they're able to use This corral, space-And, you know It just assists in making bikes a worthier option to make some of these deliveries, which you know during the pandemic.
I think the answer is yes, but the option is that they as part of the pilot, the participants, can load and unload their bikes wherever commercial vehicles can load and unload, and they can do it in this truck loading zone You know they're starting to switch their operations over, but this space is a safer space.
Think it's an improvement on just leaving at a truck loading zone and having that operation occur more haphazardly in that space, and that is a permanent, build out.
I'm going to go next to Justine, just confirmed that's a permanent build-out, So that becomes a Bart a bike loading spot period as long as they need it as long as they're doing delivery as long as they're active, because there is no It becomes a 24-hour bike.
I live on the east side and do not think it's fair for me to necessarily decide what they would prefer, but do agree that a loss of parking spaces in lower Manhattan is really a travesty, because we have very few.
He can afford to build a bike rack, but you know, or whatever else, is necessary for his customers to be able to park bikes or cars.
We also recognize that, in switching over from vans loading to to bikes loading that the space that was needed for truck loading, you know can now can now be partly taken for the bike loading, because it's a direct replacement of that same operation.
New York City was not laid out that way, and there are so many uses that DOT is trying to provide for the streets now by and large, where there are all of these multiple uses, commercial, vehicular, buses, bike, lanes, New, pedestrian, areas.
These cargo trucks delivered they deliver in front of my building instead of bikes, because they're delivering during this pandemic time tremendous amounts of groceries so to tell us that the trucks now are going to be in the in a lane where cars come and go, that this is going to avoid.
We know this, because there are several public bus stops right over there Other than convenience purposes, they chose to move their whole operation, or maybe they do not have to pay for the loading duct, but there's some reason that they stopped using the loading dock for the building that whole foods is in and focused on.
The district manager I in the past, I have received complaints about the Amazon delivery bans idling in the street in the area and in fact, I had to call up through you know, multiple different numbers of through whole foods, trying to find someone who I could speak to with decision-making authority to really register an actual complaint and try to work with them to reduce the amount of idling which they had tried to do, and it seemed to help.
They were mostly just positive feedback from for having additional bike parking, available, and one thing I'll say is: Maybe we can get as direct aligned to residents as we as we would want.
Do they get space and nobody else in the community Let's not act as if we're talking about equity when we're talking about car owners getting their personal spaces preserved for them, because it's not exactly true in my neighborhood, yes, they're people with cars, many of them have their own parking spaces and do not use them around the neighborhood.
Serve, does not work when Amazon delivers 20 out of 24 hours a day, and is that something kimberly and anyone else from the team has considered a way to guarantee public access Absolutely our bike racks, which will be at either end of the overall bar corral.
Corral are public, temporary short-term bike parking for the public, so the center space is meant for the cargo bikes and also open to the public.
If a person, a resident, owns a cargo bike and wants to park there, they could as well, but the intent is that the whole food cargo bikes would fill up the center space and then the bike racks at the edge are meant for the smaller everyday cyclists.
This is only used for a particular group of people, but the cargo bikes can't actually park at those racks, they're, not big enough, so the intention is, it would be for the smaller, typical bicycle writer.
Is, it safe to say it's a request of the board for us to instruct whole foods to have their people not attempt to park in the racks on the side of the cargo.
I also think that there's no way that any of us should approve it unless you have in writing an agreement from whole foods that they will not allow their own vans or any of their deliveries for the store to double park on Warren Street, and I think.
And I support bike cargo because I think it's a really good thing.
I just am not a hundred percent on the privatization of the streets and allowing you know they should provide their own employees for parking right for their own bicycles.
They will not allow their vans or any deliveries for the store to double park on Warren Street, and they will not monopolize the bike racks to allow for public uses and with that, I'm passing it off to deda.
A huge community benefit people who want to go with their own bike to whole foods, who now might have to search high and low for something to lock to some sort of street Sign, some sort of sidewalk bridging they're going to have a rack there, that's going to be a huge amenity for the community, it's something that can be used by many people like the space before that could be housed only five loading or unloading vehicles and then possibly five.
You do not want cargo bikes on the sidewalk, making the sidewalk very crowded and hard to navigate and for them just to go in the commercial loading unloading zone with no protection, though that's also a little risky.
The sidewalk put them in that commercial loading unloading zone with protection plus a give back to the public that whole foods has to maintain, but yet they're not even going to be using those racks on the side of it, and that will be a huge benefit and it will be a benefit for a lot of people.
I, mean, I think you know DOT views it as a good behavior to encourage on street and In many places it occurring on the sidewalk can be viewed as a nuisance for pedestrians or whomever.
For years, now, we've been getting requests from the community to add more bike parking, so we just saw this is another opportunity and to just go back with that.
We're at and making sure that our sidewalks are clear and making sure there's more space for people to continue to add just more street furniture and more you know, sidewalks is something we're trying to avoid and Just to you know also what Jeremy was saying with just safety.
: We want to make sure that, with the cargo bikes constantly going on and off the curb.
So I think I have everybody's concerns in there, but actually one of the things I do add in there that there that the Community board has in one of the, whereas is that the Community board has expressed concerns about providing a private delivery area from taking public space to a private company.
But you just said to us: it was not going to be permanent and if it did not work, it would be able to be removed, so that yeah, so those installations can be ripped out, but they are, they are planted in the asphalt in a way that does not make that space available to cars, to pull in.
So we can truly see the behavior that happens and what it is instead of permanent and rip out, which we have a suspect that if it does not work- And, it does need to be ripped out, for whatever reason we're going to hear back from the city But we do not have the money to do.
We can certainly have a follow-up conversation if you'd like what I think the appropriate thing to do would be to have another dialogue with whole foods about size, shape, accessibility and see where we can go to make cargo bikes work.
This is the collegial discussion, my friend, and we are collegially, saying that we like and support some of the concepts and ideas we do not like the particular sighting of where it is, and so okay I think that we can make something work in that zone, maybe not as quick as you would want, and let's talk about coming back with a revised proposal.
They came to talk to us in Q4 of 2019 about permanently citing a new shelter somewhere in community board one and the meeting was very nice and they were very collegial We said we would be open to working with them because we are dedicated to helping the people who are on our streets.
So I sent a letter to commissioner banks and lucian can scroll down a bit basically saying you know what we have been willing to work with you, but you need to think of other locations, because William Street, being one of the two northbound streets in the historic district of Fidei, is not a place.
Further to that point, I want to say that DHS, with Leilani and project renewal came to quality of life again this year in July, to talk about the sighting of the temporary shelters first, and we had a very robust and very good working dialogue with them.
We do not have anything to opine on right now in terms of the move of the Lucerne men to there, The agenda is to say that the dialogue that we have with friends of Friday, open, hearts, there's, is going to be welcomed in our community board for quality of life, and things like that.
What, we do not know, is what they're doing to help the people on our streets that we would like to be able to get shelter and the groups of people who are together, who want to move together.
You say that there'll be some sort of a task force or something where we're going to be discussing this further, because part of the issue, I think in getting the people who are already here off the streets is the way the DHS is approaching.
Anybody feel we need a resolution to kick back at the mayor, to put it officially in writing from the Community Board one perspective, basically showing what we have done and saying we look forward to the dialogue, stop trumps and in the neighborhood and maybe come talk to us.
You, know to continue the work we've already done for sighting of a permanent shelter with Community Board one.
So, thanks to all the committee chairs for your work in discussing the New York City fiscal year, 22 budget.
Support of the city's green infrastructure, programs, sure, city parks and green streets have previous green spaces.
I. Want you to know that that's against DOT regulations, what you're asking for, because that's why they won't give me a crosswalk at the end of north end, Avenue to cross Chamber Street.
We need to get most of the placards and the agency parking off the streets to the maximum that we can, especially if, in the new world of virtual with people not going in.
