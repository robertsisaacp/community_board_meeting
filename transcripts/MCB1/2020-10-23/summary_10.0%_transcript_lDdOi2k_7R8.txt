The committee will have a minute for question and you know if you need a little bit longer okay, but try to keep everything as compact as possible.
They won't even ask for I d, so we just encourage everyone to please go get tested, I'm going to try and share my screen, one second, so I am the gender justice manager and Lgbtq plus Liaison for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
So, for a long time, city government and a lot of institutions in general have been taking more of an equality approach to service provision and resource allocation, which would mean that everyone gets the same thing.
But, as you can see by this illustration, that may not actually support people fully right People have different structural barriers related to their social positions or social identities, and when I say social positions, I'm talking about things that they acquire throughout their life or that they are assigned throughout their life, which could be your job, status, education, income, wealth, etc.
Knowing that different people go through life, having different structural barriers in front of them, we have to divide up resources and provide services.
The primary social factor that we're talking about at the health department is racism and a lot of people really see racism as an interpersonal kind of thing.
So the only way that we can support health equity is, if we decrease identity, stress for all people and ensure that all people are affirmed and that we address and dismantle those structural barriers that even our governmental agencies have a part in right and just to really frame that intersectionality Piece Audrey Lord said that there is no such thing as a single-issue struggle because we do not live.
Well, as our structural capacity as an agency to improve health outcomes by building staff, awareness and skills, examining the impact of structural racism and other systems of oppression in our policies and practices and strengthening collaborations with the communities that we serve in New York City to talk about why we're focused so internally as a health, department, I want to show you our theory of change, because for some people they do not quite why it's so important for us to really look at how our policies and strategies and procedures and planning actually relate to racism down the line.
Unfortunately, it's inaccessible right now, but we do have some things online We also work to link different divisions and teams to different contractors like the people's Institute for survival and beyond who do the undoing racism.
We also worked with a group of people who work in contracting and budgeting, who did a case study on equitable ways to distribute the funding that we have as a health department across the city.
Just as a high level snapshot of the different parts of our equity plan, we are doing an assessment of how our agency supports lesbian, bisexual, Gay, queer, transgender, non, conforming and non-binary staff and communities, and putting that also mirroring that to specifically staff of that experience, who are also people of color, so that we can really understand the intersectionality there we're working on putting out data disaggregation protocols for racialized upgrades, because something that we've seen as a barrier to really understanding the health of all of our communities is how we have how white supremacist understandings of race and ethnicity have created monolithic understandings of these grits.
You know, ironically, we're having you here today and just earlier today, the Senate Judiciary Committee for the federal government voted in favor of appointing a nominee that may very well roll back civil rights, for you, know, blacks and browns and LGBTQIA within like the next two weeks so, and that and the president that nominated they brought.
So much for that, it's tricky when we're talking about funding right because, as we all know, we're in a fiscal crisis right, now, just everywhere, and so The health department, just like every other city agency, is facing a lot of challenges.
It's wonderful to hear totally, because the some of the work that we have to do as a health department that all city agencies have to do actually came.
It's health department staff, specifically, however, through initiatives like executive order, 45 we've worked with the mayor's Office of operations to try and provide information so that we can.
What we have tried to do is share what we can with at least other city agencies, I'm, not sure if you're aware, but the mayor's office put together a racial equity and inclusion task force to respond to Covid-19., and that is one team that we've that we, as a health department, have worked closely with on trying to bring these racial justice and racial equity tools into into other city agencies and into our emergency.
We had regular meetings with the commissioner to elevate trends and concerns that came up from our core workshop and would work with the commissioner to figure out messaging figure out different ways to show you know the agency's commitment to what we mean when we say racial, equity and social justice.
We have been in contact with other city agencies who have been interested in either starting their own kinds of versions of race to justice, trainings or working with contractors that we've worked with so we've.
They have to ask for the training first, or do you mean for staff internally at the health department, for different no different agencies, like the question was asked in terms of with a h, you know: Those staff, unfortunately, would not be able to attend our training.
What would happen is that another city agency who is trying to roll out another equity, objective or equity initiative would reach out to us and we would meet with our team to consult with them and let them know about our process and what we've done and let them know about the vendors that we've worked with to help them develop their own trainings.
We had a particular trainer who had you know who had the interpretation of the material and the way that met the values of the health department and giving it to another group without understanding fully what their capacity and intentions are in terms of understanding, racial equity and social justice.
Is there a way that we can help to at least make people aware that the DOH has declared that racism is a public health crisis and that you that you're doing this work or that this is the city's sort of stand on this position on this?
We either do a resolution or add it to our district needs statement and ask for funding to staff, to provide staff or funding to race, to justice, to do trainings for all city, hospitals and clinics, or also, I.
Even, though you have not seen the training, it is a great training and it is, you know, no matter what, even if you're, no matter how easy you try and make that for people to swallow talking about racism at all with a wide group of people and experiences is difficult.
This is my opinion, as El Tantai go to community based organizations, and there are a lot of great community-based organizations in our city that are tackling the same topic exactly that dude, that do you know racial equity and social justice, kind of training, ones that you know that we've worked with you know, And I would love for them to work, with.
I just want to let everybody know we're having a police reform and re reinvention listening session for Manhattan on Thursday October 29th from 7 to 9:00 pm There's something that's presented, that you may need more information on all right.
We can give them that, like a phone number or an email address of the person who's making the complaint that way they can, the department of homeless services can actually call or email the person that was making the call.
I took a meeting with some people that are actually on this meeting with skip Bloomberg, the friends of City Hall Park in regards to some of these issues, and one of the things was with the damage that the cars caused to the the East side gate over where the occupy setup was happening, so Captain Figueroa actually did address it with the burrow and with the details as they you know, get turned out of city hall, so we were having like 40 cops, a night, their response, we're down to just eight, I from what I understand, there's no more parking on the on those blue, stones.
Sorry, that's me, but the second thing And I'm going to then stop talking make a comment that I do not feel safe in New, York, City.
Obviously, you know, I understand why people feel the way that they do just know that, just because the our union may have endorsed somebody Try to judge each member individually on dealings with that specific person.
We just know that the homeless outreach was because it was told to us that it was disbanded, and I personally know a couple of people who worked in there that are out of the police and the anti-crime unit was disbanded.
You know it feels like a very scary, unsafe police, state, Thank you no problem, and you know I'm, sorry that you had that experience and that you had people that know that majority of the protests in Manhattan, especially when it first started, did happen in our precinct.
I'm, not saying that I'm going to just say that most likely, it probably did not come from a specific cop that was assigned to our precinct.
Not it well a lot of precinct overrun parking And, it's presenting sort of like a parking situation down here for the residents, especially now that the restaurants, you know, are able to stretch out and have all of that space on the street.
The police officer's probably not going to write a parking summit to another police officer with a Pla. Like it's, usually a lieutenant or hire that goes out And they observe this, but we also everybody that uses twitter knows probably about the placard abuse.
Let's see who's here and Claudia and Peter Quinn, and if everyone looks at their agenda item number two is New: York State, Housing, I just moved to a bunch of people as panelists, so you can meet yourself and tell me if I'm, seeing anyone Lizzie you noticing anyone from your office, hi.
My name is Peter, I'm from Assembly member News, Office happy to be on and also discuss housing legislation with you all so great yes, and that my colleague Claudia is also on which I know you guys are very familiar with okay.
Senator Cavanaugh is the chair of the housing and development and Construction Committee in the New York City Senate, and as the pandemic rolled through Senator Cavanaugh and his colleagues have been really dedicated to finding sure that not only people can stay in their homes during the pandemic, but also as restrictions begin to ease.
There are two eviction: bills: seven, eight, seven, eight a as well as the s8667 on eviction, and you know, I think there needs to be a lot more legislative action to ensure that we are statutorily protecting tenants rights to stay in their homes.
This may be a little bit less pertinent to New York City tenant market We are trying to engage in the discussion of race and intersection with housing.
It's going to be a very interesting debate, so You know I just want to go over the main housing bill that we've introduced in the assembly and as well as a few other bills that the assembly is looking at in terms of gathering, support for and then possible candidates for viable housing, bills.
You know, we've been pushing the legislature to take action with you, know, strong, effective holistic programs that provide real relief to our tenants and to that end we've worked on several housing bills, but there is one main bill that we've been working with, how housing advocates on and other legislators on, it's the rent and mortgage cancellation act.
Whatever is less, and it also allows the department of Financial services to establish a commercial rent relief program to essentially support tenants and landlords that are affected by this bill, and it specifically would allocate half or 500 billion or 500 million in funds from the federal government.
So those are the main bills that are slated to go through the legislature that assembly members are looking at this moment, I mean we're working really hard And, then we're going to try to push our bill as hard as we can Before I ask claudia if she has anything she wants to add.
It is a very lengthy bill and we understand that everyone needs time to digest it, but for the capacity that we can address it tonight, please feel free to let us know, and I do see hands going up, so I will move the time right back to the board.
That's going on with people who, I know, are living in fear of being evicted from their homes.
I do not know if you want to pull it up, so people could read it, but if you can, that would be great.
The office of the City Council member Marco Chin, as well as other government officials, as we just heard, now, are looking to find subsidies for the units in question, whether it's federal money or state money.
I do not know what else we have where we actually go over some of the points of housing so that we all become familiar like what is 421a.
Obviously, a thousand percent, I'm just confused, because I read the those links that you sent and I'm just going back when New York was a different place like in the 70s and the 80s, and I lived in an area where there was.
If you look at you know in the Covid-19 experience that we've had there's been a real failure to collect racial and ethnic data, information about testing hospitalizations deaths, and so there needs to be a comprehensive understanding of what's going on in order to start coming up with solutions to properly address the issue.
You know the social determinants of health and what the issues that come up so that's kind of where it is now.
Hopefully, we'll have some people who listen to the service delivery by way of introduction, I'm, the 61 representative to the New York presbyterian, lower Manhattan hospital cab, and at our last meeting we had wonderful presentation and they're doing a lot of wonderful things.
There, It would take me another meeting to read it: But she's the site chief of emergency medicine and has done some terrific work down at the hospital which she's going to share with you, and also I, do not know if you're going to mention the wellness lectures that that are that the hospital is all also offering that is available and all the services that are available to the community in the hospital.
They can also help patients download nyp connect onto their phones during their visit so that they can do not as follow-ups as needed, and they can also schedule appointments with specialty physicians like orthopedics or back pain, specialists and neurologists for headaches, and that type of thing we are continually working with our community to be able to provide lectures on updates and Covid-19 updates and burn.
I invite Dr Farmer in light of the last Presenter Hannah talking about you, know: anti-racism and public health.
Cbo's, right, community, based organization, Part of the problem with institutional racism is the institutions and if we do not have mandatory training for the people that are in the institution, they're not going to, because if you do not have it mandatory, those who want to seek it out will but they're, probably not the problem, but that I'm not understanding.
You said the institutions, but if the wage is already working on it and these and these small agencies are working on it, I'm asking for funding for the for DOH, so that it can expand to other city and state agencies, okay, and to the public and to the public Race to justice, funding for racial bias, training, So we are asking to give funding so that they can, because part of what I think Elle was saying was right now they're struggling, so we want to give funding, would like funding so that they can expand their training yes to both other city agencies and to the public in general.
I think the priority should be to the other city agencies so that, because those are the ones that are in most need, because the city is so diverse, and, having worked, you know: full disclosure with the members of the union and their city, workers.
A second suggestion would be for the community fund funding community programs because he said that was that, because that's totally separate Right would we have to seek out these specific community-based organizations that we think are working with?
I mean groups such as yeah youth, elderly such as Manhattan, youth, such as, and We put down specific organization solution Or So I think it's probably best to just design what you want the program to fund and then allow them to find who is able Has the capacity to receive the training and effectuate or like make the most of the training?
Yes, we're planning out November department of construction, working well We wanted to work on a housing resolution in support of the bills Looks like a pretty full November meeting and we're bringing back the racism in public health is going to get us information from the legislative team about the data specific to our area, and we can potentially do a result supporting that bill.
This is a city planner, so you can help us and we will, I know, an okay amount of housing.
