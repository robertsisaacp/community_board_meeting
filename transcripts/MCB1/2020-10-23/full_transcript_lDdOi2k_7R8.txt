Good evening, everyone and welcome to quality of Life committee meeting, I'm Pat Moore. I can't see people more Chair. Mariamba James is the co- chair hi we have francis curtis who is going to be chairing francis. What is the exact title of the part of the committee? That's yours, service. Delivery. Thank you. So item number six francis curtis is going to chair item number. Seven justine is going to be yours of the affordability for 225. before we start everyone tonight before we, you know when we scheduled this meeting we did not know tonight was going to be the second presidential debate. So we would like to be able to finish by nine, so everyone can go see the debate if they choose to do that. So if someone has asked a question already, please do not ask it again: let's try to keep everything moving. The committee will have a minute for question and you know if you need a little bit longer okay, but try to keep everything as compact as possible. All right, so we're going to start so pauline. How are you my dear and since you have to leave you? Go first: that's item number four thanks. So much so, actually I'm not sure if I see oh l just joined so I'll, give Elle some time to set up their presentation. So I just wanted to give the community board just some top line. Covid-19 updates. We have halloween and voting guidelines on our website. So if anyone is interested in seeing those please visit our website and then, as we all know, there are spikes in certain areas of positive Covid-19 cases. So we continue to emphasize the core four, which is stay home if you're sick to wear face covering maintain social distancing and wash your hands frequently. I know there have been a lot of questions about that. So we just want everyone to remain vigilant. Go get tested, find your local testing site on Nyc.Gov, Covid-19 and there'll be a list of testing locations. Testing is free, especially at h. They won't even ask for I d, so we just encourage everyone to please go get tested and then I'll turn it over to l when they are ready thanks. Okay, thank you. Hey, I'm ready, I'm going to sure yeah, I'm going to try and share my screen one second, so I'll just introduce yourself tell us who you are yeah one. Second, while I get this going and then I'll quickly introduce myself. So can everyone see this? No, yes, Sir, hey! Okay, so my name is El Tantai, my pronouns. Are they them theirs? I am the gender justice manager and Lgbtq plus Liaison for the New York City Department of Health and Mental hygiene. I am part of the race to justice, management, team and I'll, be talking about what race to justice is as an initiative across the agency and how that fits into how we see racism as a public health issue at the health department. I apologize for my virtual background, but it's just better than the background that I actually have so thank you so just to set us off right. The mission of the health department is to promote and protect the health of all new yorkers. To do that, we need to be considering health equity. We define health equity as achieving the highest level of health for all people. So, for a long time, city government and a lot of institutions in general have been taking more of an equality approach to service provision and resource allocation, which would mean that everyone gets the same thing right, but, as you can see by this illustration, that may not actually support people fully right, everyone's starting in different places. People have different structural barriers related to their social positions or social identities, and when I say social positions, I'm talking about things that they acquire throughout their life or that they are assigned throughout their life, which could be your job status, education, income, wealth, etc. Immigration status, especially incarceration versus your social identity, which is how you see yourself and identify yourself, but can also be how you're perceived by others, so that could be race or ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, religion and so on. Right. So, knowing that different people go through life, having different structural barriers in front of them, we have to divide up resources and provide services with that in mind, so we have to take an equitable approach. We also take an equitable approach in our data and understanding the problems at hand. For example, infant mortality is one of the major one of the major data pieces that we track as a health department to really understand the health of our city, and if we were only looking at infant mortality as a total, then we would see a downward trend in infant mentality across the city, which is great right and we would say, oh we're doing great and we do not have to change anything. This is for by different sorts sources to different foods. However, if we take into consideration that structural approach- and we take into consideration different barriers- that people have especially racism specifically, then we would see a wide discrepancy between black mothers and white mothers, so there has definitely been a decrease among black mothers and white mothers for infant mortality. However, there's still one gap between black mothers and white mothers and black babies and white babies right. So that's why it's so important for us to really call out racism as a major factor in health inequities, and we define health inequities as health outcomes. That are avoidable, unfair, unjust and driven by social factors. So the primary social factor that we're talking about at the health department is racism and a lot of people really see racism as an interpersonal kind of thing. That happens when one person may call another person, something you know, or one person may treat somebody a certain way so oftentimes, we might see it as like bias, but actually racism is much more than that. It is a system of power and oppression right that structures, opportunities and science values based on race, which is also a social structure, and what we see in our society is that it unfairly disadvantages people of color, particularly black indigenous folks, as well and unfairly or white right or who are classified as being white. An easier way to understand this is racial prejudice. Plus power equals racism. This is from the people's institute, the People's Institute for survival and beyond, and what that means is how we believe in race or how we define race in our collective consciousness and the ability that people have to make their reality into something or make their make their will into. Something. Is racism, so we also know that people of color are not only dealing with racism. There are many different identities people can hold and because of it, there are a lot of different kinds of structural barriers that they might have to deal with throughout their lifetime. We recognize that identity stress plays a key part in the health experience that people have, and that is the theory that the more that somebody who experiences marginalization from the different systems that they have to enact in the more stress that they experience and the more likely that they are to experience negative health outcomes. Because of that stress, and because of all the different barriers that it will take for them to receive those services and resources. For example, you know, unfortunately, transgender people are disproportionately affected by violence and murder, especially. However, it's really important that we recognize that the majority of Trans people who we have reported as being murdered are people of color, and if we dug even deeper, we would see that actually, the majority of them are trans women. So we see on top of not just sexism, you know, which is the assumption, that people should be fitting within the binary of male and female, and if they do not, then there's something wrong with them right so transphobia. You can also call it, but also racism, coupled with that and within that also Misogyny, and how those those three things really play out. Unfortunately, in the health of transgender women of color, so the only way that we can support health equity is, if we decrease identity, stress for all people and ensure that all people are affirmed and that we address and dismantle those structural barriers that even our governmental agencies have a part in right and just to really frame that intersectionality Piece Audrey Lord said that there is no such thing as a single- issue struggle because we do not live. Single- issue lives right, and so we take that into our practice as race to justice. We primarily have a focus of racial justice and gender justice intersecting with other oppressions, so that we promote racial equity and social justice and we build our internal capacity. So that includes the staff capacity. As well as our structural capacity as an agency to improve health outcomes by building staff, awareness and skills, examining the impact of structural racism and other systems of oppression in our policies and practices and strengthening collaborations with the communities that we serve in New York City to talk about why we're focused so internally as a health department, I want to show you our theory of change, because for some people they do not quite why it's so important for us to really look at how our policies and strategies and procedures and planning actually relate to racism down the line. We recognize that as a society, all of our institutions and structures were built on the foundation of White supremacy. So if we acknowledge that fact, we can see white supremacy enacting in the most fundamental pieces of our work at the health department. So that includes the organizational commitment and leadership that we have our workforce, equity and competency so which includes retention, hiring and recruitment. How we engage the community and create partnerships, our actual budget and what we fund and how we make funding available to folks through contracts, how we communicate with the public, as well as with our own staff, and how we collect and report and analyze our data. So we see those as specific focus areas as race to justice and as a health department. And then we look at the different outcomes that come through those practices and try and dismantle the pieces that we see within our structures and practices and strategies so that we can have a measurable reduction of health inequities as a whole. And to do that, we use the governmental alliance for racial equity or race and equity framework. This is also in now part of race forward as well. If you all have heard of race forward, they have this framework for institutional change and it begins with normalizing. So I'm having a shared understanding and foundation for what it means to operate with urgency and what it means to operate with equity, creating internal structures to support that normalizing process and to create tools from a lens of racial equity and social justice for data metrics and understanding. What our measurable results are. All that is necessary to work towards our vision of a city where all people have access to health care and have an equal opportunity to positive health outcomes. So to see this operationalized, the normalized piece of our work is very much in a day- long core workshop that we do with our staff on racism and how we see that play out in public health and how we can work to dismantle it at the health department. We also have a computer- based training on gender identity and expression to talk about how best to support transgender staff and non- binary staff, as well as transgender and non- binary community members. We also have an intro to health equity, computer- based training as well, so that people have an additional understanding of what we mean when we say health, equity and for people's further learning. We offer a health equity collection within our public health library at the health department. Unfortunately, it's inaccessible right now, but we do have some things online and we also work to link different divisions and teams to different contractors like the people's Institute for survival and beyond who do the undoing racism workshop? You can also see here that we try and form a collective vision for health equity in this, this kind of cute infographic that was created with one of our contractors, so the organized piece is made up of volunteers from across the agency as well as now. Finally, some paid staff across the agency who can support implementation of efforts across the health department. Those are divided between divisions and even within the divisions of the Health Department different bureaus within those divisions. We also work with a core team of folks who represent all the different divisions as a strategic planning and thought partner arm of our management team. So those groups all really help to ensure that the staff that they work with are working with a racial equity lens. They work with their divisional leadership to guide action planning and they try and help us operationalize some of the tools that are created in workers which I'll explain in a second and they have even held spaces for open dialogue among their staff race, the justice as a management team. We also hold some of those spaces as well, and we have employee resource groups that are also volunteer, based that also provide community and support for staff from a human perspective. So we see our work operationalized through tools in different ways. The primary way is through our work groups. So if you recall the different focus areas that we had before, based on those focus areas which were identified with the core team volunteers that we work with, we have created different work groups to plan out different tools for that particular piece of cross cutting work. So the staff learning development work group actually helped to develop the all- day, training on racism that we mandate for all staff. At the agency. We we created a toolkit on internal and external communications on racism and other oppressions and combined that also with a community engagement toolkit for how to have an equitable community engagement. You can actually find the community engagement framework of the Health Department online and I'll look for the link for that and actually share it with Paulie. Thank you, yeah, no problem we're working to make those more publicly shareable. In the next few months we have worked with with specific staff who deal with HR recruitment, on workforce equity recommendations, and they came out with an incredibly robust document that we are working on internally to try and try and see their recommendations through. And finally, we also worked with a group of people who work in contracting and budgeting, who did a case study on equitable ways to distribute the funding that we have as a health department across the city. So hopefully at least the communications and community engagement Toolkit will be publicly available sooner. Another way that we see us operationalizing. This is through our work on policy, so the health department, as well as acs, which, which oh I'm blanking on what they stand for, but they, but they support children in the foster care system and other systems and the Department of social services. Basically, the health and human service agencies have all been mandated to create equity goals based on internal assessments that they've done on how they based on gender and race, sexual orientation and income. So just as a high level snapshot of the different parts of our equity plan, we are doing an assessment of how our agency supports lesbian, bisexual, Gay, queer transgender, non-, conforming and non- binary staff and communities, and putting that also mirroring that to specifically staff of that experience, who are also people of color, so that we can really understand the intersectionality there we're working on putting out data disaggregation protocols for racialized upgrades, because something that we've seen as a barrier to really understanding the health of all of our communities is how we have how white supremacist understandings of race and ethnicity have created monolithic understandings of these grits. And so we need to understand that the experience of say somebody of chinese descent is different than somebody of indian descent and is different than somebody of Laotian or Hmong descent right. So that's what I mean when I say data disaggregation and then looking at our leadership and ensuring that the leadership and staff that we have is in proportion with the breakdown of New York City. We want to make sure that turnover is low for people of color and decrease that, and we actually already have a workforce development program that has already been created. Thankfully, and they've already started doing some of that workforce career development. Unfortunately, it's been a little challenging during Covid-19, but it's still chugging along, so that I tried to go through that as quickly as possible, so that we have time for questions. Thank you so much. What questions do you folks have right now? Thank you just put my hand up already yeah. I just I first want to thank you for coming with this amazing presentation. I feel so lucky to have learned that you know the DOH was doing this recently and to have asked you guys to come, but I was not aware that you also focused on LGBTQIA issues and I'm so happy to see that also because this is something that this committee has really been trying to bring awareness to and educate ourselves as well. You know we do not know everything that we need to either. So just really thankful for your very thoughtful work here that you put into this presentation and extensive. It was been over. So many topics- yes understandable too, with that you mentioned, have a couple of questions you mentioned volunteers. Are these volunteers from within DOH? Are these DOH employees that are volunteering to participate, or do you appoint volunteers through some other mechanism? Yeah? They are stuff they're, dohmh staff. Okay. So with that in mind, you know, ironically, we're having you here today and just earlier today, the Senate Judiciary Committee for the federal government voted in favor of appointing a nominee that may very well roll back civil rights, for you know, blacks and browns and LGBTQIA within like the next two weeks so, and that and the president that nominated they brought. The nomination also has recently called for an end to funding federal funding for any bias training. You know subconscious or unconscious, and implicit bias, training and anti- racism training wanted all of this removed and also recently signed an executive order that would make the money that he gave to Hbcus. He would enable him to take it back if they basically taught the truth that they, if they said so with that in mind, do you expect to remain funded or how do you come by your funding? Are you fully funded? Is there more funding needed? Is there anything that we can do to help you or do you? Are you think that you could? The program could be in trouble in light of all of this? Well, thank you. So much for that, it's tricky when we're talking about funding right because, as we all know, we're in a fiscal crisis right now, just everywhere, and so the health department, just like every other city agency, is facing a lot of challenges. Thankfully, we are baselined in our funding from the city and I will say that the city has a commitment to equity, at least legislatively so the New York, City, Human rights law kind of I can't think of a better word, but it trumps kind of the not New York City, Human rights law supersedes federal law in a lot of ways and we remain committed to the New York City Human rights law and to the vision that it sets up for our city. So I do not see that changing unless we have a drastic shift in who comes in after mayor, De, Blasio or governor Cuomo, because as of before at least the next year, you're secure. Okay, I mean that's all I can really say or perceivably secure exactly for the next year. Okay for the foreseeable future yeah, it's wonderful to hear totally, because the some of the work that we have to do as a health department that all city agencies have to do actually came from. You know the city council they're, the ones who created or who really pushed for local law 174 that mandated us to do the equity assessment and mayor De Blasio and his team put out executive order, 45 that mandates all city agencies do something very similar, a kind of kind of an assessment, but also a report on certain city- wide equity metrics that will be made that will be reported out publicly. It's probably pretty delayed because of Covid-19, but that will be made public. So I just I just cite those as kind of further evidence that our city does have. You know like a commitment to these issues, yeah and as much as it can. You know? Okay, I, if you do not have to leave like pauline, you may be interested to stick around we're going to discuss and potentially pass a resolution with regard to the walking wall. Trans ban, oh wow. I have to leave at seven, but that's okay. Well, it's for 25 minutes, so any other quote, so I thought someone else's hand was just the Handmaid's. I guess I'm thank you, first of all for the presentation and for all that you're doing, but I have a question now that so who is your? Who are your clients? So this is where does this go from here? So if we're talking about my team, specifically, we work in terms of our staff, so our so the people that we are serving are our staff. Okay. But if we're talking about community stakeholders, then it's the community partners that the different staff at the health department work with, which is many different community partners across. So the community partners would be city, employees right, I assume, or for so for race to justice. It's health department staff specifically, however, through initiatives like executive order, 45 we've worked with the mayor's Office of operations to try and provide information so that we can. We can build equity across city agencies. There are other commissions that are also trying to build equity in different ways. Like the commission on gender equity. They actually have a what's it called. They have a strategic plan for gender equity for the city, oh, and actually, for this presentation I did not get approval to share it like as a document with other folks. So if you could not share that, oh okay yeah, although actually technically all this is public but yeah, I guess yeah. I just wanted to be clear that so this basically is a really cool thing, but it's not city- wide. Yet yeah, it's not city- wide. Yet it's not really enforceable forever or being shared with everybody, I'm obviously not publicly yet whatever, but it's not shared across lines which it's so wonderful. It makes me sad, but I guess everything takes a process. Thank you, yeah. I have a question. What was not to be shared? Oh the presentation itself. Oh okay, yeah! I mean he said he understands that it's public, but it gets for us to not go out of our way to send it to anybody right, yeah, you're, saying because, like I have to get like also not, I can show it to you. I just can't like give it to you. Okay, right, okay, I have a question so before we move into the I'm. So sorry, I just want to to respond to what the last person was saying: justine we, but we. What we have tried to do is share what we can with at least other city agencies, I'm not sure if you're aware, but the mayor's office put together a racial equity and inclusion task force to respond to Covid-19., and that is one team that we've that we, as a health department, have worked closely with on trying to bring these racial justice and racial equity tools into into other city agencies and into our emergency response. So we are trying. Sometimes your opportunity can be challenging, but but we are trying to get that out there and I'm sorry, please continue and sorry l. I do not. I do not mean to jump in it's pauline also, but I also wanted to highlight you know the just, because race to justice itself might not be publicly known. The health department has made an effort to make sure that all of our public- facing materials are in all of the top languages, so everything is translated and there is a commitment to work in those underserved neighborhoods through our health action centers, and so there are steps that the department has been taking to make sure that health equity is a priority and will continue to be a priority in closing the gap in health disparities across the city. So just wanted to highlight those efforts as well, but I think race to justice has really pushed each bureau to look at their policies and procedures with a fine- tooth comb and to see how we, as an agency, can start from within to close these injustices and imbalances and really move that forward. Public- facing you know programs, so I just wanted to make that clear great now. My question is: how do you act measure how effective these trainings are with the staff of the agency? Is there a way that you can do that yeah actually? Well, so, pre- covet, we did have a hefty evaluation plan in place. We do have evaluations at every training and we were going to go through a more robust evaluation process. We are currently trying to figure out how to do that now in a virtual setting with our staff, but we are planning on evaluating it. We had originally thought of, like some groups with staff who have gone through it and other things, so it's just a. We just have to reimagine it from a virtual perspective and what's your recourse, if you find that a staff member has not taken to the training and is actually displaying racial bias. Oh good question: yeah, that's a great question, it's challenging, so let me make sure I'm getting your question so like if a staff person attends- and they are not in line with what we're with the values that we're expressing right. What do we do? After that? It is. It is a challenge, and really the only way we'll know is either through the evaluation or if they, if they contact us directly, there is nothing we can. We do not want to do anything punitive for folks. We take that and we actually pre- covered. We had regular meetings with the commissioner to elevate trends and concerns that came up from our core workshop and would work with the commissioner to figure out messaging figure out different ways to show you know the agency's commitment to what we mean when we say racial, equity and social justice. So that's one thing that we do it also. We also can feed that information anonymously to the divisional action teams and bureau action teams to address that in those those discussion spaces that they have. It also helps us to kind of retool, not fully change the training but to retool, maybe some time points within the training to hone in on certain pieces of it. Of course, we do not want to change the training too much, because then that would change the our ability to measure its efficacy, but we can definitely like know what to highlight. For sure know what know what the person is not understanding or getting, and exactly try to okay, all right for right now. I think that's a good answer. We might want to talk to you at a year and see what's happened, yeah totally, yeah, oh well, Pat! I would think I was going to jump in here. You should be able to sort of get some kind of assessment through your mandatory training right yeah. Exactly you have. I mean you get a sense of where the person is. At that point I would hope so that you know whether this person is fit for going any further with the department yeah it's hard yeah. I know that would be one point that I could see you kind of give guidance in these trainings to the city. Hospitals too. Oh, can we offer it to city hospitals? So, for a long time we were operating with one trainer and staff volunteers to train up 7,000 staff, so that's made it through local law 175, and there was just no way to offer supplemental training outside of that. However, we have been in contact with other city agencies who have been interested in either starting their own kinds of versions of race to justice, trainings or working with contractors that we've worked with so we've. We provided resources to them based on that yeah. If we, if we could expand, that would be amazing and then we could do that. But how does that better? How does that process go? Do they have to do with the need for training, or do you yeah? How does it? How does that go? Do they have to ask for the training first, or do you mean for staff internally at the health department, for different no different agencies, like the question was asked in terms of with a h, you know: well, those staff, unfortunately, would not be able to attend our training. However, if usually, what what would happen is that another city agency who is trying to roll out another equity, objective or equity initiative would reach out to us and we would meet with our team to consult with them and let them know about our process and what we've done and let them know about the vendors that we've worked with to help them develop their own trainings. For that, so they would have to come to you to ask for that, and then you would work with them to create their own thing. How do we break this out and bring it out to all new yorkers? That would be awesome. The reason why we do not just wholesale give the training to folks is because we do not. We have training that we've done for the trainers. We had a particular trainer who had you know who had the interpretation of the material and the way that met the values of the health department and giving it to another group without understanding fully what their capacity and intentions are in terms of understanding, racial equity and social justice, as we do does not feel right. You know what I mean. Sorry, I think I lost my train of thought. I mean you mean not being intimately aware of their organization, their staff yeah those racism, those undoing racism workshops are not just open to anybody. There's a certain evaluation that happens to see if you're even appropriate for the workshop before it happened. So those I I've taken one and it's very intense and if you're do not meet the correct criteria in the very beginning get talked to so is there a way that we can help to at least make people aware that the DOH has declared that racism is a public health crisis and that you that you're doing this work or that this is the city's sort of stand on this position on this? I do not think people know like I said we found out and I'm very happy that we did we found out just like a month ago. So I'm sure a lot of people do not know yeah. I know we've written articles. You know different commissioners over time and different staff have said this either in an article that they've written or in some sort of public address. I know that Commissioner Bassett had and so did. Commissioner Barbeau have to look back at and find those but yeah like it's interesting. I mean, and another great thing is that we're not the only jurisdiction who has declared racism as a public health crisis. You know, as a public health department, I believe Albuquerque has, I think, kings County for Seattle, I think possibly has or yeah L.A County I think, might have. There are multiple ones, Pat and Mariama. I have a suggestion. Maybe we either do a resolution or add it to our district needs statement and ask for funding to staff, to provide staff or funding to race, to justice, to do trainings for all city, hospitals and clinics, or also, I would second that I mean. I appreciate that so much funding. Maybe you can do it. I appreciate you can't do it right now and unfortunately, with the fiscal crisis, it's going to be one of those things, I'm sure that'll be a couple years before we get funding, but I have no reason not to ask for it. That's what I say yeah. If we do not ask, we won't get it, but, yes, I think you're wrong, but Al you were going to say something yeah. No. I really appreciate that, and I also appreciate your whole heart of belief in it. Even though you have not seen the training, it is a great training and it is, you know, no matter what, even if you're, no matter how easy you try and make that for people to swallow talking about racism at all with a wide group of people and experiences is difficult. So I appreciate that the one thing I will say is personally, I would rather see funding- and this is my opinion as El Tantai go to community based organizations, and there are a lot of great community- based organizations in our city that are tackling the same topic exactly that dude, that do you know racial equity and social justice, kind of training, ones that you know that we've worked with you know, and I would love for them to work with. You know, city agencies or even other providers, to do that and do they get some of their funding from the city. The agencies you're thinking about sometimes some of them. Some of them have already, and some some were just kind of one- off purchase orders, but well yeah. You know, first of all, your enthusiasm comes across so even though you say we have not seen, we have not fully seen program we can tell that is something that you've gone about. You know helping to form with passion. So we appreciate that and we thank you and, ladies, why do not we or everybody on the committee one a week because Al and Pauline have to go? Why do not we first of all any other questions, and then why do not we talk about this reso later? Okay sounds good, because that this way we can get to the next thing, and maybe they can hear part of the right Trans thing exactly so Al. Thank you Pauline. Thank you. So much and as I say we might, we might want to. You know, invite you back say it. You know in a year, and you can tell us sure it will be very interesting happen after Covid-19. We have a date in the year. Thank you. So all right we're going to move along back to item number one on our agenda officer. Nelson. Are you here? Yes hi? How are you okay? How are you thank you for coming tonight? Oh my pleasure. So first of all tell us who you are and what to do? Yes, okay, so I'm Brian Nelson, I'm one of the three community affairs offices for the first precinct in lower Manhattan I've been, did you freeze, you're frozen hold on one Sec? Let me can you see, hear me now? Yes, we can okay, so I'll just start over again, I'm Brian Nelson, I'm one of the three community affairs offices. At the first precinct, we represent lower Manhattan. I've been in the position officially for seven months, but unofficially for the last five years, because before that I was the crime prevention officer, and I used- and I work mainly with the community affairs officers to augment them when they need extra help. So I've been doing this, for you know quite some time now right. I just want to start off by saying I'm not here as an official spokesman for the NYPD, we just need to represent the first precinct. You know our goal is just to basically create a better relationship with our residents with our business community with our clergy. You know, in light of everything, that's been going on the past. You know a few months. I can try to answer any questions that anybody may have most likely it's going to be in an unofficial capacity. If it's anything that does need you know a hard answer. I can take that question to either my commanding officer or to my patrol borough to one of the chiefs and see if I can get an answer, and I can get back to you guys on that. Okay, I'd like to start off when you're ready, yeah. I just want to let everybody know we're having a police reform and re reinvention listening session for Manhattan on Thursday October 29th from 7 to 9:00 pm, I'm going to send community board one the links that they can send out to whoever's interested in participating in that it's going to be via zoom or facebook live. So you can link up with that, and you know it's going to be kind of on. You know, race, relations and building, you know a better department and how we can improve ourselves. So you know, maybe somebody wants to check out, and will there be time for people to ask questions? Yes, they're going to have a they're going to have a questionnaire that you can fill out, I'm going to send the flyer and the link you can fill out free questions, pre meeting and you also have a attempt to ask questions live. If there's something that's presented, that you may need more information on all right and then the first precinct will also be having our monthly Community Council meeting the same night it'll be an hour before that the seven o'clock start. So we're going to start our meeting at 6 P.M. It's also going to be via zoom I'll, send lucian and the rest of Cd1 the link and the invite to that, and you can pass what date was that also October 29th Thursday, great okay that'll be at 6:00 P.M and then the reinvention meeting will start at 7 P.M all right. So I'll talk to you guys tomorrow. So I'm going to start out with a question so in lieu of reallocating funds from the police- and this may be. You know the general question not just specific to first precinct. We know that the police no longer have the responsibility of interceding with the homeless, situ homeless situation. What is the policy, though? So, if the police are not accompanying social workers, what are the police doing in terms of engaging with homeless, okay, so we're? I think that was a big misconception about what happened, and I think I think even the police officers who were responding to the phone calls were kind of confused when it came out that we were no longer going to be dealing with the homeless. We are the only process. That's different is we're not taking action on the scene unless they're emotionally disturbed and we feel that they can't be left to their own devices. But now, when we get a nine one call or three one call that has to deal with the homeless, we still respond to the scene. We just make an official notification to the department of homeless services they've, given us a specific email address and or number the call that comes directly for us, and you know we let them know where the complaint was. If there's any complaint information, we can give them that, like a phone number or an email address of the person who's making the complaint that way they can, the department of homeless services can actually call or email the person that was making the call. So if someone so, if a resident were to call in and say there is a homeless person at such and such an address, they may not be doing anything that is harmful to themselves or anyone else. You still are obligated to go and check out the call. Absolutely yes, okay, we'll be going to the scene and then you'll make a determination as to which agency you need to call absolutely right. The only thing people be doing is unless they're blocking the doorway. We can't remove them from the front of the location. The only way we can is, if they're, causing a hazardous condition like blocking you know an exit or an entrance kind of like in front of a window. We kind of have our hands tied right now, we'll do our best to try to get them to move along, but in the end, if they want to stand their ground, they have every right to if they're, not impeding any pedestrian traffic flow. Is there a specific reason why you can't move them like? Is there a law or why can't they be moved? So it's when I first started we could. We were always able to move them, but it seemed as time went on. We changed our policies and procedures on how we handle them. Lawsuits usually were the the driving force behind them. I do not have any specific lawsuits right. I can reference, but you know, as lawsuits were handled and settled it just became unless they are acting in an aggressive manner. Unless they're you know stopping people from entering locations demanding money to like get out of the doorway. Something like that. You know we call it aggressive panhandling unless they were being aggressive. There was, you know we were kind of told, just kind of move them away from the doorway. You know just try to gain compliance through. You know what we call verbal Judo right. Controlling you know, just try to you know, take the human side of it and you know get them to comply. Okay. Thank you so questions. I have a question, so I was asked by residents that are concerned with the maintenance of City Hall Park, to ask this question, but I I'm really interested in asking it for an additional reason as well. It's what we've been discussing tonight like implicit, biases and things. So I just want to just make a correlation here. If I can so, I was informed about- and I think at this point, the whole board has been informed, or at least the Waterfront and Parks Committee. That damage has been caused to the blue stones at City Hall Park because of the police vehicles that have that are driving up on the sidewalks and things and that this damage actually has turned out to be more costly and permanent as compared to the graffiti. So obviously, as residents and people of the area work, we would prefer not to have either case not the graffiti and not the damage to the stones. But when we have a situation, this is where the implicit like biases come in. We have a situation where it's made so publicly known that there is Graffiti and it's sort of politicized attached to protesters. Then it becomes in part like a racial issue as well, because then the picture is, you know the these black and brown people are doing graffiti. They are riding they're, causing all kind of damage, and then now we have this police damage. It's been sort of, you know fairly quiet, only the people that are really concerned with the park that look to see it reopen and then maintain. It have really taken a notice and an issue with this. So I what we're trying to achieve, I think in combating systemic racism, is ultimately to not, you know, be like well. The police caused this damage or to not be these black people caused this damage, and rather to say like this, you know it's a consequence of the pro bro. It's a consequence of protest, the consequence of whatever, but not attached to any people. So anyway, my question would be: are the cars still pulling up on the sidewalk and, if not, is there a plan to stop doing that? So I actually we. I took a meeting with some people that are actually on this meeting with skip Bloomberg, the friends of City Hall Park in regards to some of these issues, and one of the things was with the damage that the cars caused to the the East side gate over where the occupy setup was happening, so Captain Figueroa actually did address it with the burrow and with the details as they you know, get turned out of city hall, so we were having like 40 cops a night, their response we're down to just eight, so there's usually only two or three cars. I from what I understand, there's no more parking on the on those blue stones. Okay, that's not to say that you know one night somebody's not going to get cute and try to try to do it. You know captain figueroa obviously does not. You know usually work in overnight. He only does one or two of those a month. If he sees it, he will definitely address it. You know we have a note in the detail that goes out every night on have to have them park on there, but again you know not being there. I can't promise you that you know does not happen every now and again, but I think for the most part it has. It has stopped. Okay, that's good. I know that the Waterfront Committee put it in to request funding to have it repaired, but yeah it just. It comes attached to like these larger issues that we're also, of course, trying to come back in bringing the community together, which is you know, while you're here. So first of all, thank you for coming wow. Thank you, nice, seeing you again. Can I ask a question? Yes go ahead mitch, but I also want to question, but let's let the committee members ask first and then pat, we will call on you go ahead mitch I mean I see like most people most of the cops and just do not mess. Is there? Is there anything that is coming from the supervisors to try to influence them to whether, yes, when they're supposed to be you know, there's situations where they're enforcing people who have s which I support? But it's basically you know most of the cops are not wearing mess. So is there any anything going on behind the scenes that you know of so in regards to the mass policy our mass policy right now currently? Is we have whenever we're dealing with the public we have to so, if you're coming up to me, I'm putting a mask on unless you're willing to stay 10 feet away, which most people are not so, if you're coming within a few feet of us, we're supposed to put our masks on what about when I see groups of five cops just standing next to each other like maths, so technically, I'm not as 100 sure with the official policy. I do not mean technically. I know I do not mean to pin you down, I'm just like in general like is there anything coming from the supervisors or the precinct commander? Saying hey: come on guys, like you're part of the human society, also separate from your bed? No, I agree when we're in public. You know most supervisors are trying to tell their guys to wear it. Yeah. It's not! You know. You know that yeah I mean we know it's just one of those things that you know. Unfortunately, it gets addressed, and you know, as you have the captains and lieutenants addressing it, gets corrected at that moment. But then you know it's like any other thing. Once they walk away. You know people are going to be people when they're by themselves, when they're, just with the officers in groups of five you're. You know they're, probably not well, they're, never really by themselves because, like when you know it's very crowded like, and you know that you see groups of cops, whether there's they're getting ready for like some type of thing but little park, but there's thousands of people walking by that just like who live or work in the area, and it's you know with the uniform, it's just those groups, it could be a group of people in borough park or in Alabama. That's preventing people like me from having work opened up, so you know I just wanted to just give that feedback yeah. No, I we agree. 100, captain figueroa is definitely a fan of us wearing the mask and he tries to get everybody to do it all right. Thank you, okay, thank you. Justine. Do you have your hand up? I do I do because yeah I thank you. Pat first of all and thank you officer, Nelson for being here. I appreciate that I would just kind of reiterate what mitch said in the sense that a police officer on the street of Manhattan, just like anybody walking on the streets of Manhattan, is never not within six feet of somebody else. So it's just disingenuous to say that while they're working and while they're there in uniform that they should, they choose not to wear a mask you're, never not with people. There's always someone walking past you and now the CDC just came out with new regulations, saying or new information saying that if you're within six feet of a person for 15 minutes in a 24-hour period, there's a possibility strong possibility, you will catch Covid-19 so really and truly. If captain Figaro wants to really be proactive and show some support for the community number one, I would say it should be a firing offense not to wear a mask. Sorry, that's me, but the second thing I'm going to say is I'd like to and I'm going to then stop talking make a comment that I do not feel safe in New York City. Now, after and I know this is not the police department, it's the the police, the pba, the police, benevolent society, having endorsed a political candidate on behalf of New York City police officers. I do not feel safe. It's an old white woman in New York. I do not know how anybody else in New York feels safe, after that they should not have any business in Georgia volcanic candidate and I'm not making the comment as to who was endorsed. Thank you. No, not a problem. You know, unfortunately, political statements I can't get into, but you know I obviously you know, I understand why people feel the way that they do just know that, just because the our union may have endorsed somebody does not necessarily reflect what each individual member membership. Thankfully I hope that's true. Thank you. Try to judge each member individually on dealings with that specific person. If that's how police are doing, we all know that any statement that's made pro or Khan in regards to the department can sway a large group of people just by hearing whatever that comment is you know some people have a. I could deal with a hundred people, 99 people may say I'm awesome, you might get that one person who says I'm not and if it's the right person that word could spread and can do damage to my reputation or if the 99 spread the right kind of message. People could say: ah that person's you know, maybe he had a bad day yeah, so just try to judge interaction with each individual officer and take your view on that. But just because our union endorse somebody does not. That is a flexible individual. I appreciate that, but do hear what I'm saying, because my reaction has been the police are my friend: I've lived in lower Manhattan, the police officers on 9:11 the police and they were my heroes and they have always been my heroes and now I'm afraid of them, and that is the message that has been brought out and, like I said, I'm way, that's something that I would think would resonate with people. I do not know any help, but thank you for your position and I'm sure it's not you personally, who I would be afraid of afraid of so well. Anytime, you want to have a discussion personally email phone call. You want me to come sit and have a cup of coffee. You know we can discuss and you know. Hopefully we can change your opinion and if not at least, we could agree to disagree civilly any other questions before we get to that. No, so pat hi listen, that's great right, yeah! I know I'm on it. Okay, all right, pat you're, good, to go! Oh good! Thank you. So thank you for being here this evening. I was at another community board meeting a few weeks ago for the upper West side and there were two members of the police department. There. One was the captain Neil Zuber from the 20th precinct and another was- and I do not know that he was a captain- I'm sorry, but his name was Naoki Yaguchi, and my question specifically is that at that meeting it was stated by Mr for lack of a better title yaguchi that our homeless outreach unit has been disbanded. I have two questions: number one. Was it disbanded just for that particular area, the upper West side and number two, if not or even if so, when I mean how did that come about? How long has it been since there has not been a homeless unit? I heard you earlier say that you will take calls if someone says there's a homeless person and you will, you will assist but an entire unit. I do not know what size, but a unit has been disbanded. So if you could clarify that please, the official unit has been disbanded, all personnel have been picked up for units or other precincts. You know, depending upon, I guess what their preference was in regards to how long I do not have an official date, but it was sometimes during the summer after the budget was passed whenever that was it was. It was not too not too long after the that final budget meeting passed, that disbanded meant started to happen. Is there is there a way I mean? Probably there is not. I just do not know for an individual like me or people here tonight to know what areas were disbanded as a result of the budget cuts areas of the home coverage unit or, oh, just here what got affected. In all honesty, I would not be able to even try to answer that. If I you know, I I'm not privy to anything of that. You know some shifts were made. You know the anti- crime unit was disbanded. The homeless outreach unit was disbanded, other things got kind of revamped and retooled to try to modernize and reinvent the you know the wheel in regards to you know what was happening during the summer with all the you know, the protests and demonstrations. So, but officially, I really you know, do not know what units were and what was not. You know. We just know that the homeless outreach was because it was told to us that it was disbanded, and I personally know a couple of people who worked in there that are out of the police and the anti- crime unit was disbanded. Yes, the anti- crime unit that was the plane closed unit that you know they would go around in the unmarked cars and you know regular clothes and try to you know they would usually go. Usually they were, you know, trying to spot violent crimes happening in person live so that you know they can deal with it as they were happening. Thank you. Thank you, Taylor hi, good evening. This is Taylor banning I'm a resident of battery Park City, my question's for officer Nelson. Thank you. First of all, thank you so much for coming on to this meeting and speaking with all of us and answering our questions, and I guess my question is hard for me to ask so I'm sure it'll be hard for you to hear. But this summer I witnessed some really horrible behavior in our district from precinct one and I assume other officers, because there was just so many towards friends of mine towards my neighbors. While they protested and spoke up- and it was honestly terrifying and triggering and a true horror to witness- and I'm so sorry to say, I know tough words, but it's an important thing to say and share, and you know it's- we witnessed it in so many sites downtown at City, Hall on West, Street, and so many more and police were physically violent, aggressive. It's been reported and documented in many newspapers, including the New York Times, that the police were aggressive, even human rights watch. You know, reported on a case of town but downtown there's been reported cases by legitimate sources of police acting aggressively toward citizens and in light of what the protests were about, you know addressing you know, calling for police reform and calling out racism and calling out bias. It's you know, additionally horrifying that the reaction of our police downtown and across you know the city was to double down with force and aggression and harm and kind of you know followed up by an endorsement. You know it feels like a very scary, unsafe police state, and I just thank you for listening and I'm just I just it needs to be said. It's what's been happening has been unacceptable and not for too long. So, thank you no problem, and you know I'm sorry that you had that experience and that you had people that know that majority of the protests in Manhattan, especially when it first started, did happen in our precinct. We're a precinct of about 200 cops total. So at any given point on duty, we maybe have 50 to 60.. We had not on any given day we had over 2,000 cops assigned to our precincts. No cop should give you a bad experience. I'm not saying that I'm going to just say that most likely, it probably did not come from a specific cop that was assigned to our precinct. We had numerous cops every day being flown in to cover all these protests. They were still having the Covid-19 unit. That was a 400 person a day unit that was coming into downtown Manhattan. So it probably well. You know if we all represent the NYPD, it might not have specifically been the first precinct, but either way you should never have a bad experience. So I'm not trying to say that it matters where they, where they work, that's kind of. Why we're having this reinvention and reform meeting? That would definitely be something that you know is going to get addressed at that meeting and I'll bring again. I'm going to take all your notes and go to my captain with the you know specifics. You know we're going to try to do better. I you know to apologize to the past. You know it's not something that you know. I can personally apologize. You know for how you feel, but you know we're just going to try to do better. You know moving forward. You know, because that's all we can do at this point. Everybody has their opinion good, bad, indifferent. You know we're just going to try to do better for everybody and try to you know bridge that gap that we, you know that has been created in the past couple of months. So hopefully you know we can work. You know hard to turn that and thank you from you know some of the people all right. We need to move on, but I wanted to just ask you, since you just brought it up, what's the Covid-19 unit, and does it still exist? Ah, no, it's it. It stopped. It was when when coverage had first happened, it was you know that everybody was social distancing once they had closed the parks down. It was kind of the monitor make sure people were not going into. You know areas that they were not supposed to gatherings were not you know, but it basically became you know the 311 Tattletail unit. So you know we tried to do it as best as we could, but the amount of calls that came in on a daily basis. You know not everything got out of hand. Yeah got out of hand, not every call warranted 400 police officers, specifically they have for social distancing concerns. Okay, great! Thank you all right, any other one more! That's it! Thank you so much. We appreciate you coming and being open and relaxed and answering our questions. Wait! No! Sorry! I'm sorry! I had to, I had a hard time finding my own mute button, but this is regarding parking down in our area now, with the whole restaurant thing where they can use street parking and we're a narrow part of the city. We have small streets anyway and there's an excessive amount of record parking and illegal parking, not it well a lot of precinct overrun parking and it's presenting sort of like a parking situation down here for the residents, especially now that the restaurants, you know, are able to stretch out and have all of that space on the street. Are you guys looking at that, because I'm sure from the other committee of the license and permit we're going to be dealing with that, but I just thought I'd bring it up here. Placard is a huge thing with the department, it's an integrity issue, so we do have. We have an inspections unit that goes out to monitor that it's not done on the precinct level as far as like police officers, because you know it's a common practice. The police officer's probably not going to write a parking summit to another police officer with a Pla. You know with a plaque in the window, not to say that they could not. It's just probably not going to happen. If we're going to be honest, but we do have, you know like it's, usually a lieutenant or hire that goes out and they observe this, but we also everybody that uses twitter knows probably about the placard abuse guy. That goes on twitter and points out every interaction, but we monitor that and our internal affairs and investigations divisions they go out and you know they tow the cars and they also write summonses to the department of vehicles or even if it's the members, personal cars they'll, do that. If you have a specific area or street that you're talking about, I can definitely look into it all the Cv-1. I could give you a specific street. Can you north end Avenue in Battery, Park City is one and then there's got to be stuff around someplace else, but I know North End Avenue is a big street around Warren and Murray and north end. Yes, I can give you one too Park Road, I mean Ann Street is closed between Park Road and nassau every night after 5 P.M, but there are always like cars with placards sort of locked in there trapped in there. They must not move them that the restaurant could be using as additional seating. Yes, we're aware of both those locations, the North end Avenue one. We have a the NYPD and some of the federal agencies share a building over at the World Financial center. Most of that parking has been because of that they have a large contingency that works out of that building. We've actually had anybody, who's attended, our community council meetings knows we go about this all the time yeah do our best. But yes, that is a condition. We're well aware of it. We've taken action against personal police cars, personal vehicles, we've had toes tickets, written we're, never going to win that battle. We just try to you know, keep at it, so I'll make note of that and definitely bring that up to our traffic safety unit and captain Figueroa. Thank you, the and Street one. I think that's other department agencies from what I recall, because we've had those complaints before and we've had cars go down there. There's other city agencies that have city plaques that look like ours a lot of times. It's not NYPD cars. It's just you know like department of finance, or you know, even like some department of buildings, cars. They have unmarked cars and they just get generic plaques. That kind of look like ours so but we'll definitely look into it and see what we can do about moving them. Thank you. If any other before you go, if I can, is there a way or do you know if there's a way for us to obtain, maybe quarterly, maybe even annually? I do not know how often but data specific to our district on you know. Maybe the number of tickets, the number of arrests, things of that nature, get that every you can get that every week it's on the New York City.Gov website, okay, awesome under like NYPD or yeah I'll. You know what I'll shoot a link great somebody from Community Board, one really appreciate it. Thank you and figure out how to get you know, get it from that great. Thank you thanks again for coming yeah. We appreciate it all right, so we will see you the night of the 29th. Yes sounds good have a good evening and stay safe yeah. So if anybody has any further issues, you guys have my email address feel free. Thank you. Take care guys, take care, okay, so we're going to move on number two. It is 7:25.. So do we have Senator Kavanagh and Assembly member? You lean new and who else is here should Hannah from Nadler's office be here or is that a whole nother thing? Well, let's see who's here and Claudia and Peter Quinn, and if everyone looks at their agenda item number two is New: York State, Housing, Legislation, okay. I just moved to a bunch of people as panelists, so you can meet yourself and tell me if I'm seeing anyone Lizzie you noticing anyone from your office hi. This is Lizzy from Senator Cavanaugh's office. Here we are in attendance today. Andra, who is our housing director sends her regards she. We had a last- minute scheduling conflict, but I'm more than happy to discuss housing with you all great thanks. Who else is here? Hello, everybody? My name is Peter, I'm from Assembly member News, Office happy to be on and also discuss housing legislation with you all so great yes, and that my colleague Claudia is also on which I know you guys are very familiar with okay. So who wants to start? You want to hear about this great new housing legislation. Sure I'm more than happy to thank you so much for having me first and CB1 has been incredible during the past months of our chaos and especially with quality of life committee. I think you guys have put in tremendous effort in having an agenda that is very reflective of our existential and very intersectional challenges that we face in our community and I think in real great relation to the discussion today. Housing, insecurity and homelessness has always been a racialized queue, and you know, even before the pandemic has been a big concern. Senator Cavanaugh is the chair of the housing and development and Construction Committee in the New York City Senate, and as the pandemic rolled through Senator Cavanaugh and his colleagues have been really dedicated to finding sure that not only people can stay in their homes during the pandemic, but also as restrictions begin to ease. Hopefully, fingers crossed that we are not thrust into a few places where tenants still can't pay back rent or their current rent landlords, can't pay property taxes or repair costs or provide salaries for staff who depend on these jobs to make a living and that local governments won't be able to pay for public resources such as teachers, firefighters, sanitation workers and other services that rely on property taxes and to really reinforce our already fragile housing stock. That is really getting worse. So to I'm sure, Peter is going to be expertly. Communicating on these broad strokes of our current circumstances as well, but just to paint a broad picture of some of the efforts that we've been doing. The current eviction moratorium. The status has become a lot less certain the past couple days. The most recent order issued on the 28th of September, it helps to extend protections to tenants that might otherwise be subject to evictions that predate Covid-19 and but it also seems to leave open the possibility that evictions will resume in cases where tenants can't manage to prove that they've been unable to pay their rent because of a Covid-19 hardship. So that is something that we are calling on for further legislative action. Senator Cavanaugh is a co- sponsor of both stellar Miley Myra's bill. I can also post links yeah. Of course I will. I can publish this all together. There are two eviction bills: seven, eight, seven, eight a as well as the s8667 on eviction, and you know I think there needs to be a lot more legislative action to ensure that we are statutorily protecting tenants rights to stay in their homes and, as you guys also might be aware of, we promulgated the emergency rental relief act. The E- r- r- a it, was to take a hundred million dollars of federal Cares Act funding that was available to New York at the at the point that we had made the legislation. A hundred million dollars may sound like a lot, but it really is not. It fails in comparison to really vast need that is needed for new yorkers, but you know this was money that we had, so we mobilized it as soon as possible, making sure that we were lowering the barriers to eligibility as much as possible. We'd really try to make sure that documentation of missed, missed out income was very low. That families with at least one occupation for a person who were born in the United, States or house citizenship or permanent residence also applied. So that was something of an equitable approach that we tried to take, but we definitely need to do more, and that comes with the call for federal funding. I'm sure Hannah is well versed in our calls, but you know we are continuing to advocate for comprehensive rental relief that only the federal government can truly provide, and you know this is with the C- rap C- E- r- a- P as Senate Bill s 8140b the bill provide rental assistance kind of like in the form of section a in the form of emergency housing vouchers. So that's going to subsidize rent that exists, 30 of a household's income for households that have suffered a significant loss during I emphasized during because everyone that it would not have to be provable that it was income lost due to the pam. So anyone who have significant loss of income endemic will be eligible up to 250 percent of the fair market rent for the area which the something a lot more cool that we've seen before. So, for example, it's breaking up pat you're breaking up Lizzy. I'm sorry about that. My internet has been very finicky lately. Is that a little bit better? Well keep talking? Let's see all right, let's see so yeah, to set an example. If you have 4,800 a hundred dollars for a two bedroom, that's going to be eligible for coverage, so it really does brought paint broader cast to broader net for everyone who is suffering and incurring a loss from cobit- and you know we're really. This is contingent on us being able to get federal funding so we're calling on the Us Senate to pass the Heroes act. 3.0- and you know, this is going to be much needed dollars for rental assistance and housing stability that we really need for all new yorkers, and we are also. This may be a little bit less pertinent to New York City tenant market they're also due to in our mortgage forbearance- and this is a lot I can provide more links to anyone who is interested- and you know we're. We are trying to engage in the discussion of race and intersection with housing. We recently had a joint hearing on housing discrimination in long island, where it was the outcome of a really scintillating journalism that you guys should all read on Newsday. It's long island divided I'll, also provide links for that where it provides a lot with evidence that there was racialized steering involved when homeowners or prospective homes were looking by a purchase a home in long island. As we all know, this is not nothing new, nothing new, nothing that is isolated, you're breaking up lizzie, unfortunately darn it. Let's see if well, yeah, do not do a lot of work, some bullet points and those links. We would love it. That way. We can email it to everybody on the committee, so they can take their time and reading it can I mention. Can I make a question to her, or is it do? We is now the time to make a comment or a question to Lizzy I'll? Let you go ahead: okay, hi Lizzy. Can you hear me? I can hear you just fine. First of all, like I said, I'm a big fan of your office and chantal and Mckinley have helped me enormously. There's one quagmire that and I'm not you might realize you might not. Concerning the Covid-19 relief program, which a lot of freelancers and 1099 people have fallen into this trap. The Covid-19 relief program is counting only counting income start from April through July, but April through July are the months that the extra Pua the 600 a week was in effect, so the end of July, the pua stopped, so that disqualifies everybody else from the Covid-19 relief program, because that puts you like at least for me. It put me a fraction below the 30 percent threshold and so like the last Pua payment was the last week of July. So now, like people like there's thousands of people that are way below the way above the 30 threshold, but in the Covid-19 relief program they were just counting income when the Pua was in existence. So now the Pua stopped, and now people are just getting by in one or two hundred dollars of unemployment, but the rent is still you. We still have to pay the rent, so I'm like chantello is aware of that. So, if you can, please continue that feedback to Senator Cavanaugh, because that's a big, a big quagmire as far as the the metrics, I completely are you it is. You know something to contextualize and the fact that when we did pass the era it was months ago something that we are continuing to face. Now we have a lot of constituents with your exact issue and that we are hearing cases of this in the statute itself. It has mandate to prioritize those who have been rent burdened before who ex express the most need, and it you know it that's odd. No, the metrics is that has nothing to do with this situation. The metrics is, if you paid less than 30 of your of the income between April and July, you were disqualified and they're, counting the unemployment that pua as income. So but as of when the Pua stopped, there are thousands tens of thousands or 100,000 of people that are eligible starting August 1st, but are disqualified from the program because the Pua stopped. This has nothing to do with anything from before. Plus all of the 1099 workers would not be able to prove income January, February or March, because it would be on the taxes that you'd file next year. So one instance that I will bring up is that we recently had a constituent who were who was being paid under the table. Can you hear me? I can see you we can hear you can hear me: okay, perfect! Oh Mitchell Zooming into the camera, so we had a constituent who was getting paid under the table who recently qualified for era, and this is in no means me. You know defending this program- it's insufficient it. As you say it does not cast a broad enough neck to oh. No. The problem is better than nothing. There's just there's this little quagmire. That's all I'm saying! No! I hear you, and this is something that we are really truly. You know I mean, and if you need to mitch, why do not you shoot a quick email? That's okay! I spoke about to chant about it, so they know I just wanted to take this opportunity to with Lizzie. Thank you so much for everything you guys do Lizzie, there's mitch. Okay, I'm a big fan of YouTube Mitchell, so Lizzy you want to Peter or to claudia. Do you have any? Is there any other point? You would like to make okay, so who's going next Peter hi, hey hi, pat? How are you doing I'm all right? How are you happy Thursday everybody Peter from Assembly member News office, I'm going to try to be as brief as possible. I know everybody wants to get off for the debate today. It's going to be a very interesting debate, so you know I just want to go over the main housing bill that we've introduced in the assembly and as well as a few other bills that the assembly is looking at in terms of gathering, support for and then possible candidates for viable housing bills. So, basically you know we all know. New York is facing a real housing crisis, especially in the next coming months. You know our office has personally received hundreds of ui cases. You know constituents are having trouble paying rent. You know, housing instability is becoming more and more of a real thing. I mean it's always been real, but it's been it's even more real now, so you know, we've been pushing the legislature to take action with you know, strong, effective holistic programs that provide real relief to our tenants and to that end we've worked on several housing bills, but there is one main bill that we've been working with: how housing advocates on and other legislators on, it's the rent and mortgage cancellation act so I'll, send all these bill numbers to lucian and the links as well. After this meeting, but the bill number for everybody's reference is a 10826 or S-8802, so it's also held on the Senate side by Senator Salazar, so just to go over really quickly what the bill does. It provides protection for renters and homeowners, so it essentially suspends all rent and mortgage payments for all residential tenants and small homeowners for the duration of the state of emerge of the Covid-19 state of emergency and for 90 days after it also provides tenants and homeowners with a right to relief with prohibitions against fines, fees, evictions and also prohibits the occurred of suspended payments under this bill, and on top of that, it will prevent any adverse credit reporting. So you know, if you miss payments, it will not affect your personal credit if this bill were to pass. In addition to that, it also provides financial assistance to co- ops as well. So if the housing or if the co- op can demonstrate loss, maintenance or rental income, then they can apply to the program under this bill. That is admin that will be administered by dhcr, and so in so for in order for you to basically apply for relief, if you're a co- op, you have to grant one- year lease renewals to basically everybody in your co- op on top of that also applies protection or financial relief to affordable housing, operators and landlords as well so just like it is for co-, ops, we're going to provide financial relief for forbes for affordable housing operators and landlords. They have to demonstrate that they've lost rental income due to Covid-19. The application process will be determined by the Dhcr commissioner, so there are a few more conditions attached to affordable housing operators and landlords to apply for rental relief, so the conditions are they have to freeze rents for a duration of, I believe, five years evict only for good cause have no outstanding hazardous violations, implement non- discrimination provisions; no, they are not. They are not allowed to retaliate against tenants and they are not allowed to participate in tenant. Black lists that tenant four tenants that have not been able to pay under Covid-19. and moving on our bill also provides creates a public housing relief fund as well, which also establishes a fund for public housing agencies to seek relief if they have also lost rental income, so that, in a very large shell, is what our bill does. Currently, we are trying to push it through the legislature. The legislature has been out of session for a while. At this point you know there have been talks about reconvening soon, possibly after the elections, but you know we're we've written multiple letters. We've signed on to multiple letters advocating for the legislature to come back into session, because if we wait any longer the problem's only going to be compounded and get worse and worse. So that, in a nutshell, is the bill that we've introduced in you know, members in the assembly are looking very closely at our bill from what I've heard. It seems to be one of the top contenders for out of the slate of housing bills that have been introduced. A few other notable bills that I just want to quickly mention from other legislators that are also on the slate are a10827 from Senator, Myrie and Assemblymember reyes, which basically prevents eviction proceedings for a year up during the token 19 state of emergency and for a period of a duration of a year. After also there's another bill, S-8865 on the Senate side and then a10,901 on the assembly side, which essentially assists nonprofits and small businesses in meeting their rent obligations. So it limits their rent obligations to 20 of their overall income or one- third of their contractual rent. Whatever is less, and it also allows the department of Financial services to establish a commercial rent relief program to essentially support tenants and landlords that are affected by this bill, and it specifically would allocate half or 500 billion or 500 million in funds from the federal government. If we were to get more money from the federal government also really quickly, one other bill, S 8175 on the Senate side and then Assembly bill, Number A10265, which is held by Senator, Salazar and Assembly member epstein, which it basically prohibits the rent guidelines board. From increasing rents on one year leases during a state of emergency, so those are the main bills that are slated to go through the legislature that assembly members are looking at this moment so yeah I mean we're working really hard and we're going to get in a session soon and then we're going to try to push our bill as hard as we can so Peter before I ask claudia if she has anything she wants to add, would you please just one sheet bullet point the bills for us so that we can do our homework? Yes, I'm writing, but I can't you know. I can't keep up with everything you're saying I just sent the list of bills to lucian in the chat fantastic. Thank you so very much so Miss Claudia. Would you like to add? Well today, is one of the evenings that I rarely have another colleague on and in this case it's our director, so I would defer to Peter on all the items that he mentioned. Obviously we're hoping to go back to session and officially tonight we would be happy to address any questions that are for the bills that the assembly member is holding. Unfortunately, we would defer to the legislators for the other housing bills, but we're happy to address any questions. It is a very lengthy bill and we understand that everyone needs time to digest it, but for the capacity that we can address it tonight, please feel free to let us know, and I do see hands going up, so I will move the time right back to the board. So I do not see hands. So whoever is asking speak up so two things. I first wanted to comment on what mitch was asking I stepped into a chinese restaurant, I'm still sacrificing my waistline to save lower Manhattan one restaurant enjoy. Yes, oh thank you. So the governor on a similar situation to what mitch was describing or what sounded similar to me. The governor recently signed an order for people who had been receiving the 600 to allow them to do things like poll work and census work and not have that unemployment count against them and maybe that's something that we could pursue with regard to the housing. You know that was just a thought and then otherwise just to comment thanking everybody for coming, and you know saying that this is like the appropriate time where we should be. You know, writing a region to support these bills so that you have the support in hand. When you return to session calling on the federal government to provide funding, I I'm you know I would move to do that, I'm in favor of doing that. I just want to say that you're fading and yes, I heard the part about us- writing a rezzo and support and like ray yep. This is calling for federal funding. Okay, anything else, mariama, oh, that was it. Thank you yep. So I had my hand raised too sorry. This is justine. So thank you, mariama, because I yeah I agree. I would suck in her motion to do a resolution, and then I was just going to ask if, when everybody's finished, asking questions and we're done with this, if we could move the 225 right here- okay, good, thank you. That was it that was it okay, who else has her hand up that? One nope. I think I think it was just us. Okay, all right guess I did a good job, then I think I think you all did a great job so Lizzy and Peter and Claudia. We thank you. Please stay safe. We hope that we can get some federal funding and that we can that you all can help with these bills to alleviate some of the suffering. That's going on with people who, I know are living in fear of being evicted from their homes. So thank you for the good work you do. Yeah, you guys are amazing. Thank you. Everyone have a great night stick around up, but I think Peter spoke. Maybe I'm wrong. Yeah Peter did not speak. Okay. Everyone! I put Peter's points into the chat. So if you want a bill by Bill description, you know I'm old and terrible with technology. So yes, email, can you send it an email? It please? So it's big enough, so I can see it also all right. So why do not justine? Why do not you take over for item number seven, which is the rezo for two five? Okay, perfect lucian? I do not know if you want to pull it up, so people could read it, but if you can, that would be great. I suppose I could share my screen, but I'm not that good. Well, tell us just a quick synopsis. Yeah I'll give you the quick synopsis is 225 rector place. I think I brought it up last time briefly and then members of the quality of life committee were invited to the Battery Park City Committee meeting on October 7th. I guess it was, and I believe this is going to be a joint reso with battery Park city and quality of life and bottom line is that at 225 rector back in 1986? Let's go through the president, just quick with the facts, because they matter developer, related company opened to 25 rector as an 80 20 rental building of the 305 apartments 60 were set aside as affordable units up until the year 2009 under 421. A rent creases during this time were limited to those allowed by rent stabilization developer, of course, received generous government subsidies and respond in exchange for affordability provisions. Soon after the 9:11 2001 terror attacks, government officials stated that it was safe for residents and workers in lower Manhattan to return home to live, and they went so far to give a rent subsidy monthly up to 500 per apartment, rented in lower Manhattan to entice folks to return and rebuild the area. The subsidy was granted for one year and as years passed, we realized- and we know now, that the ambient environment was still too toxic for people to live safely and work downtown during that time. In 2002. The economic downturn that followed the terrorist attacks also extended. The state and local governments gave related companies a new package of tax financed subsidies in exchange for extending the affordability protections under the 429, a from 2009 to 2019 and that expired in 2000 November 2019. skipping about Mr Levy, who came and left and made a mess of things in 2000. I mean it's there, it's on the resolution, but I'm not going to waste time talking about it in 2011, the related companies bought the building back in foreclosure from Mr, Levy or well after people quote, he defaulted on his mortgage and they moved ahead with the condo offering plan that Mr Levy began. At that time there were fewer than 20 units still occupied by the 80 20 tenants. They went from 60 down to 20. in 2013 an investment partnership called venue. Then one rector purchased 22 units that included the remaining affordable units and 25 erector in a block. Then one then one rector and his partners planned from the beginning to abide by the affordability protections through the through the sunset in November 2019, and they did so in May 2018. Then one rector and the remaining 80 20 tenants entered into two- year leases, all of which expired on April 30th 2020, keeping the 20 apartment. Tenants the 80 20 tenants in place until the end of April 2012 in March 2020. As the end deadline was coming up, then one rector offered the tenants the option to renew their leases at market rate or else make arrangements to move out. At that same time, the 80 20 tenants said they could not pay the market rates. Then in March 2020, then one rector signed a lease with a corporate tenant who wanted to rent all 20 of his apartments as a block at the pre- covered market rates. So he was looking to make a nice chunk of change. However, by the end of 2020, the Coronavirus pendant came into effect a moratorium and nobody could move in light of the eviction moratorium. Then one rector extended the tennessees of the remaining affordable tenants. He extended it. I think three or four times going through till the end of August 2020.. However, the government August and in August 2020 governor Cuomo, extended the eviction moratorium until the end of December 2020 and that might still go forward during this time. Council Members City Council member Margaret Chin sought to broker a compromise that would allow the 80 20, affordable unit. Tenants who were left now down to 13 would hope that they would remain in their home for another year, at least until Covid-19 ended. Then one director has been in compliance with the eviction moratorium to their financial detriment. Then one director is not financially able to sustain supporting the 80 20 tenants at their respective rental payments of between 1,200 and 1,600, respectively per apartment per month indefinitely, especially as the monthly pilot ground run. Rent and common charges will exceed these amounts. The Battery Park City Authority was aware, as we have sai, has played a constructive leadership role in the past, as they did recently at gateway Plaza by committing financial resources to mitigate a landlord's financial shortfall. While preserving and existing extending affordability projections for tenants and whereas our elected officials have joined together to write, then his name is Neil, but Senior Curt, the manager of then one realty to assure him that having tenants at this moment is better than spending money in housing court. The office of the City Council member Marco Chin, as well as other government officials, as we just heard now, are looking to find subsidies for the units in question, whether it's federal money or state money. I do not know, that's not in the it's, not in the reserve, but this at least one of these bills would save these people some of the 225 affordable. Tenants are people with 9:11 related illnesses and are more susceptible to experiencing serious side effects if they contract Covid-19 virus and they should not be forced to move during the pandemic. Therefore, you get resolved. Cb1 encourages continued negotiations among elected officials in the Bpca, then one rector and the 2080 tenants with the goal of reducing the financial burden on then one rector and his partners we're asking for it until October, 1st 2021 or until one month after the coronavirus pandemic is declared over whichever comes first and be, it further resolved that both the 80 20 tenants in rector place and the then one rector should be giving financial support by government agencies with relevant jurisdiction, such as the Battery Portfolio, City Authority, the federal government, the state, the city. I do not care whom, but somebody should help them to keep the tenants in place and to mitigate then one rector's financial losses until October, 1st 2021 or one month after the coronavirus pandemic is declared over. Whichever comes first, that's the Rezo Battery Park City Committee talked about it and we passed the result. Six in favor with one abstention and the public vote public member one vote was it in favor and did you did you notate separate quality of life members that attended and voted? Did you notate their vote separately? Lucian? I do not think you did. You said they could not. I do not know, but I did not get it. There was not a quorum of quality of life members at the meeting, so it would we did. These types of resolutions are always very difficult to enact because it's very difficult to get a quorum of both committees at the same meeting right. So what why I was asking, so we do not want people who would gather. We do not want people from the quality of life communities who attended and voted to vote again. Do we but the we did not so they would have a chance to vote now, which is what I think right. Yeah generally, you know having president be multiple committees very difficult, so should we be voting again? I think that if coming out I talked to Tammy and alice about it. They're comfortable with this just being a battery Park, City Committee- and you know this committee can certainly endorse the work of that committee. But it's a fine resolution in currency. Okay, so then we're not voting on it. Can I ask you a question when you're finished with the with this to justine Pat sure go for it now? Okay, obviously I'm a thousand percent in favor of this. But for me it should even go further, but so the 80 20 tenants that are still living there have most of them been living there for, like the last 20:30 years, yeah they would have had to okay. So this is something that I had brought up. I do not know if pat, if you remember, but I used to bring it up when Tom we had the housing committee and other elected officials, that you know. I have zero sympathy for whether it's related or then management, because they're, just looking at the individual apartment in the billions that they've made and they've reinvested the millions that they've made in the tax breaks over the last 30 years, because they're, smart business people just remember it's too different for different things. Mitch, yes, but then one rector is not like a lefrak or related. They are a small group of 17 people, one of which lives in Fidei and so is a constituent of Community Board. One as well and well, I think I said it before, but it makes sense they're richer than I am, but they're not as much well. I understand, there's like not being as rich as lefrak but being richer than us. There's still no, but let me just clarify this, though different owners, so one owner has not benefited over 30 years, so many tax breaks. Let me take okay, so I'll, take that off the table, but if you've been living somewhere for like 20:30 years, especially if you're a senior and I've lobbied some of the officials about this pat well, while you've been present, there should be some mechanism that you can stay in place. However, it's, instead of just until the pandemic, is over like plus one year, because a year goes by like this, and you know that there has to be some other way for us to preserve this affordable housing. I agree with you, but let me just only in because of time. Okay, since quality of life is not going to vote on it. I think that we do not. Even you know we can bring it up under our housing. Part of our agenda at a later date, not specifically for 225, but to discuss that as a mechanism for affordable housing- and I would not- if I could say this- I agree with mitch wholeheartedly. I think we need to figure out a way to write better laws. However, under the situation that is written and what's this situation here, we need to do better. We need to build more places, build more housing, that's affordable, take care of the people that are here already and not make it so that people are being thrown at their homes when they're when they get older, they retire or they become ill. I agree with you: 100 yes, Tina Pat would scree audrey help some of the anyone who's a senior in this situation? No, because no, I do not think so. First of all, but I do not know, but there are folks there are folks online here who are part of the 80, 20, tenants and so okay, but make those numbers not to make them speak, but just to make a note of drew of screw injury yeah. Those are programs to protect people and fix seniors on fixed income. So that's something so you know what let's plan one meeting you know maybe next month I do not know what else we have where we actually go over some of the points of housing so that we all become familiar like what is 421a. What's 421b, what's 421c, you know so that we can maybe we can between between Lucian and Diana. Maybe we can get them to give us a small. You know lecture on what these things are, so somebody from we're not voting. I do not believe so. Okay, so we're going to move on the quality of life committee is aware of this one building and it's you know one of many in our community that are having trouble. Thank you, justine, all right, so the pitfalls of the expiration of programs right exactly! No! Thank you all! No, we are not. We are we've done one two. Did we do three? No, we did not do three, so three is walking while Trans man and mariama you're back from the restaurant. Yes, I am so. Would you like to take that away? Please take that. I would. I hope that the state representatives remained so they, the state representatives, have actually been working on this issue, and hopefully everybody received the material that we sent around already. I included the penal code. What the bar association has to say about it. What the state, Assembly and Senate have to say about it at this point, it's a horrible bill that basically basically stigmatizes and stigmatizes trans people if it takes into presumption that any number of trans people congregated on a corner, for example, are automatically prostitutes and allows for their arrest. You know for different nonsensical reasons and their prosecution and it's a discussion and we should take it off and hopefully you guys have read about it already have you, I read what you sent around okay, so then I would just you know: ask that you know like move to write a resolution in support of banning this. You know when the state legislature goes back into session, that they could have this in hand and do away with this disgusting law so now, because they are not in session. Can we move this to next month to write a resume? I see me shaking her head. Yes, I see you Mimi. Are we all in agreement that we'll move into next month that will give everyone time to read what miriam has sent around if you have not, and if there is any update, we can read it over the next month and then write a reso. Well, I'm going to assume in support. We will have a discussion and we'll see whether everyone is in support. Okay, Marianna, a question of one thing: I'm confused about yeah. Okay, obviously I'm in support of the principle of this. Obviously, a thousand percent, I'm just confused, because I read the those links that you sent and I'm just going back when New York was a different place like in the 70s and the 80s, and I lived in an area where there was. It was an area where there was a lot of prostitution and I'm just using the terminology from back. Then it was, you know like the heterosexual prostitutes, transvestite prostitutes, drugs gangs, crime and everything, and I'd have to explain to my you know, syringes on the streets and the whole thing. So obviously you do not want. I do not want one treatment person to be caught up in that, but the thing is it's legal like if they were married yourself, please mariama. If there was you know, you know demonstrated like of prostitution with, like the cars like coming up and the quality of life stuff. How would that be taken care of? Can we take this discussion to next month? Can you read the bills, and I was not sure if there was a difference, because I want I would like to separate them, because I'm a thousand percent of a part of the the intention of the bill, but the way I read it was that there would be no enforcement of that type of behavior that I experienced outside my building 40 years ago. So I was just if I was listening well, it is still happening, as described in the first presentation that we heard by department of of health the they them that presented to us at I remember spoke specifically about transgender people being attacked being murdered. So this is what we're trying to there's a there's, a law that basically allows for some of it and that's what we're trying to combat okay. So it's separate from like if there's actual like criminal behavior, that's separate from everything correct. Well, if you say, if a police officer or a person that wants to report criminal behavior, see something and want them tell the police officer, then that would be the reason for the person being arrested or prosecuted or whatever we're talking about people who are standing around they're standing around, but because they exist they're being perceived as prostitutes. No because they're preconceived ideas, I'm going to have to walk with you on that. I just was not sure the way I was reading it. Okay! Well again, let's move this discussion. Everybody do some reading. If they can, you know find some information pass it to the rest of us. Let's all do some reading and we'll have the discussion in November. Okay, let's see where are we did we do five? No, we did not do five. So number five is anti- racism and public act of 2020 and we have Hannah Weinerman Anna are you here is Hannah here, Darn mute Button for everybody? Well, it's I'll be very brief, but it's a pleasure to see everyone and first I want to say that we hear the call for federal funding for all those things that we had discussed earlier loud and clear. Obviously, the congressman was a sponsor of the heroes act. We've tried passing it in various iterations, so we need- and hopefully we can in the next Congress for the love of God, okay, so very quickly the bill that they, you guys had asked me to speak about tonight, the anti- racism and public health act of 2020. It's a bill that was introduced on the outside by Ayanna Presley and Barbara Lee and Elizabeth Warren in the Senate congressman Nader is a co- sponsor of the bill. Really the point of the bill is that there's, obviously racial disparities in health income, as Hal had spoken about in their presentation, there's a lot of systemic racism and structural racism that leads to health disparities and, unfortunately, there's not a lot of information on it. So the pandemic really has laid these inequalities to bear. There's a lot of comprehensive research to explain and to really identify what the issues are. What the causes are, what the symptoms are, how they look? You know if you look at you know in the Covid-19 experience that we've had there's been a real failure to collect racial and ethnic data, information about testing hospitalizations deaths, and so there needs to be a comprehensive understanding of what's going on in order to start coming up with solutions to properly address the issue. So the bill calls for two specific programs they're both through the cds well they're with the Cpc, so one would be to create a national center of anti- racism at the CDC, and it would be very responsible for and developing the research and database for this information to you know much. We can't understand the problem. If we do not have information about the problem and do not know how to proceed, the second area that they would this the bill would create, is a law enforcement violence prevention program within the National Center for Injury, Prevention and control at the CDC, because, unfortunately, we know that there's an issue of systemic and sexual racism within our law enforcement system, and it leads to both physical and psychological issues and physiological issues, so that would establish both of those centers within the CDC. So the bill right now is currently in energy and technology. It is not going anywhere anytime soon, but we are hoping that in the next Congress things will start to move. I also wanted to flag that there are a bunch of other bills that focus on health disparities that have been introduced in Congress, and one of note is called the equity, health, equity and accountability act, which is sponsored by representative Chewie Garcia of Illinois, and it's also sponsored by what's called the tri- congressional caucus. So the congressional black Caucus, the congressional hispanic Caucus and the congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, are all co- sponsors of this, as well as congressman Nadler, so we'll see what what types of bills can go through if we have a congress is willing to pass some. You know comprehensive consolation like this, we'll continue doing that, but yeah, but jokingly co- sponsored both of them. I would be you know more than happy to answer any questions and that you have about this, and I will say that the the bill that I just mentioned is supposed to really improve health care and improve competent health care access for all and putting funding into data collection, but also into services to address you know the social determinants of health and what the issues that come up so that's kind of where it is now. If there's anything specifically in the bill, I'd be happy to answer it. I can try my best and I can also go back to our legislative team. Yeah and Hannah. Can you please send us a somebody needs to mute. I do not know how that is, but can you send a sheet bullet pointing the bill, so we can look it up and read and do our homework absolutely I'll, send it to evolution and then he'll send it in an email to us questions you have when I looked up the bill, it basically took me to Anna Presley's page and then included information on Massachusetts. Specifically, do you have information on our district, so I do not have a specific energy district. That is something that I'm happy to ask our legislative team for more information about, but I believe Senator Warren and Ayanna Presley had those press releases, but I can get the information as related to our district. All right. Thank you right here. Other questions. Somebody needs to meet that. I think yeah, someone that someone were hearing a lot of background noise. Any other questions, oh, is Hannah. Still there yep, you have a question. Oh I just well I if I could have 15, I just wanted to thank her and Jenna for all the all the things they're doing I'll, send them an email but Hannah. For you to know, the global entry is back on the processing those things now, yes, and also we have we've, been getting a lot of passport requests too. So we are, our caseworkers are doing a fantastic job and we're here for whatever you know, just to let very quickly let you know. Mine came finally came with all the stuff that we talked about before mine came through this week, but there's no way to go, I'm not allowed to go but anyway, that process, so just to give you that feedback. I'm glad to hear. I appreciate it so, and you can always email me I'll put my email in the chat. You can email me with anything great. Thank you on mitch's behalf. Thank you. So any other questions, no Hannah. Thank you! So much for coming and spending your evening with us. It's a genuine joy. Thank you just stay safe and thanks for all the hard work. Yes, please, okay, so we're going to move along we're getting closer to that hour of the debate. Where are we now? Let's see francis, it's your turn item six that mute button. Again, I have my computer. I have a hard time think to it, but anyway service delivery. Finally, hopefully we'll have some people who listen to the service delivery by way of introduction, I'm the 61 representative to the New York presbyterian, lower Manhattan hospital cab, and at our last meeting we had wonderful presentation and they're doing a lot of wonderful things there, and I thought it would be good to make a presentation by them from them hear a presentation from them about some of the things that they're doing and the two representatives, hopefully they're. Still here: Dr Brenner, Dr, Farmer, Brenna. Okay, I see yeah, I'm here, thank you and Julie. I think she had to go early, but I'm here to answer any questions. Okay, oh well, thank you very much for hanging in there with us, but- and just so you know, Dr Farmer's list of credentials is so long. It would take me another meeting to read it but she's the site chief of emergency medicine and has done some terrific work down at the hospital which she's going to share with you, and also I do not know if you're going to mention the wellness lectures that that are that the hospital is all also offering that is available and all the services that are available to the community in the hospital. Okay. So without further ado, thank you for hanging in here. Thank you about a lot of stuff, but you're here. Thank you so much for inviting me, I'm here briefly to talk about our telemedicine services and to continue to encourage the use of the emergency department. If you need to be seen by a doctor at any time day or night, we are open and here to help in the emergency department and throughout the hospital we have access to telemedicine services. We have a virtual urgent care that can be downloaded onto your phone actually and used as an app. It's almost like a zoom meeting itself, and you would speak with one of our emergency attendings who would provide you with? Whatever you would need, we also within the emergency department. Have patients see our physicians with a physician assistant? They will see the physician assistant in person and they can see one of our attendings via telemedicine. That's what we do with some of what we call fast track: patients who need a wound, check or suture removal or sprain their ankle or something along those lines. They still are getting to see and attending, but it's a much more rapid pace in that area and then just as a kind of final thing before I talk about our community services and community lectures, is we have access to different services across the nyp system via telemedicine? So we have patient navigators to help patients find primary care. Physicians after they've been seen in the emergency department. They can also help patients download nyp connect onto their phones during their visit so that they can do not as follow- ups as needed, and they can also schedule appointments with specialty physicians like orthopedics or back pain, specialists and neurologists for headaches, and that type of thing we are continually working with our community to be able to provide lectures on updates and Covid-19 updates and burn care. Our most recent lectures that are going to be part of the community is on Tuesday November 3rd, one of our attending hospitalist who's, a assistant professor of Medicine Dr, Ezra Gabay, is going to be talking about medical ethics and then on Thursday November 5th we're going to have a burn safety lecture by one of our colleagues at the Cornell campus Phillip Chang, who's going to talk about burn safety and then November 12th, which is a Thursday one of our cardiologists Dr Mohammed, is going to be talking about heart, health and we'll be sure that you have the information for these zoom lectures so that you can enjoy them on our website. Yes, I will make sure you get them so that you can share them with the Community board. Is an opportunity to ask questions? Are these just like? Well, these are. I do believe. These are all yes, no they're all they're not recorded they're, not they're over here, they're, all on zoom. So therefore anybody from the community that's. Why it'd be important to have this on our website, so people can access it and they can go at whenever it's whatever lecture. They see that's pertinent to them. They can go, they have. They do not have to have a certain medical coverage in Mexico to listen to the to the lecture. So that's an important thing, but the other thing is that access the hospital services to you know one more question about the lectures. I'm sorry, so are there lectures that have come before these three and are they recorded and we could go back? Are they archival and we can go back and look at them? You know I will find out about that. I do think that they record lectures, but I will have to find out about that from our public affairs office and with two man, the the, but there is opportunity for questions and answers on the topics that they're speaking of, and they also will talk about other upcoming lectures- that the hospital has planned with our attending physicians, and even our nutritionist has given a lecture on healthy diets and those type of things: okay, fantastic, so you'll get back things off and the great thing about it is the fact that you can. Just if you have a computer and you can access the zoom, you can just go on. You know it's not like you have to have a certain type of insurance in order to have access to this wonderful information exactly so community services. Sorry, no you see some people in the attendees have their hands up here, hi good evening. This is Taylor banning I live in Battery, Park City! Thank you. So much for the presentation. I invite Dr Farmer in light of the last Presenter Hannah talking about you know: anti- racism and public health. Are you at the hospital taking on initiatives anti- racist initiatives to address you know what the disproportionate effects of health? Okay! Thank you to hear more so happy to hear that we actually not only are trying to partner with different community organizations to make sure that we are anti- racist. We have all of our all of our health care workers, anybody that works in the hospital or works for nyp or while Cornell Medicine has to do bias training so that we all recognize our own biases and we also are doing specific trainings around anti- racism. That's one of the things that the hospital is very passionate about, and we want to make sure that all of our employees and all the folks that we work with are that way as well and so that we do not have the problems that have been noted in the past, with and amongst health care and in research and other things that have happened, we're working very hard to make sure that we are both training, our provider, anti- racist and that we are positioning ourselves to be anti- racist. That is so positive. Thank you. Oh and as a matter of fact, I'm reading the email, because Matthew could not be with us and they just launched this dialog center for health justice, and it has a whole lot of exciting things that I was hoping he could be here to share with us, and it fits right in to the question that was asked because it's name for amma do dialogue. Do not know about that, but the let me see the dialog center for health justice, it's dedicated to understanding and improving equality and addressing the justice and health and driving actions as a result of improvements in health outcomes. So it kind of fits in to what Hannah was saying and I'm listening and I'm trying to figure out how to you know how to get those two together to see if the hospital, if there was access by the hospital to the programs that the federal government was going to have and how the community could benefit from it. Yes, I know that the hospital is working very hard on having both community lectures and well as well as partnering with the community to ensure that they are all on the same page and they've even on our hospital website have promoted making sure that folks know about even the book how to be racist and getting that specialness training. You guys have been doing some great webinars in general, though I just want to say I was lucky enough for somebody to forward in a couple of links, and I saw like the gastritis one, which was really important to me, and what about it? And what about heart disease as well, so yeah? No, but I that's what I want to do. I want to be able to we'll we will post the schedules on the on the on the website, but actually I remember we as board members gotten copies through email in terms of the flyers that were going out, but we'll continue to do that, but Dr Farmer. Thank you very much. You're welcome was there another component, though I'm sorry community services or we've covered no, that was that was it with the lectures and okay great. Thank you. Any questions for Dr Farmer, no francis. I just wanted to ask you. Well, you were Dr Farmer, we're just focused. Is this just a New York presbyterian for like the downtown low Manhattan or the other? Are you representing the other locations, also like the Allen hospital and the other places uptown? So as a physician, I work with two of the New York Presbyterian campuses, so I'm the site chief of the emergency department here at lower Manhattan, and then I also do clinical shifts up at the Cornell campus at 68Th. Street. Okay, well, you guys are amazing and unfortunately, like I have experience at the Allen hospital for other family members and they're like they're gods, they're just amazing up there. I agree my husband works up there. So thank him for mitch from that. Thank you. This is amazing. Thank you. We look forward to reaching out and having some more wonderful discussions with you and finding out all the wonderful work that you're doing at the hospital. Thank you definitely please reach out again. Thank you good night good night. So I think we've covered every item on our agenda. I'm missing anything that anyone sees. If I can't see the aging I do not have a I've got. I've got the prince peace, be working on that job, finishing up before nine o'clock, so yeah 15 minutes. Oh no wait, capital and expense budget items number eight! Sorry! Now, let's just tell everyone, those of us who were attended the executive committee meeting last night, we went over the 150 items that were on our list and lucian made changes that are now on that link that he sent us about a month ago. Solution. If you want to send that link again everyone, you can look at that link before Tuesday's meeting and if you have any items, you'd like to amend or add, would you please send an email to lucian? Okay, we want to add something for DOH for that for the program yeah. So first team wait Lucian's going to save myself. Yes, I would I would. I would put it like this if you, if you have an item that you want to add, definitely send it to me I'll help. You workshop it so that you can read the full board as a friendly amendment. Since the executive committee met before this committee, they technically voted a resolution on the package, but the idea is that they'll slot in things from the quality of life committee, so I can what I'll do is I'll help you kind of form that into a cohesive package of items which then can be discussed at full board and yeah so that it should be easier. Listen can we do that? One thing now, maybe just be more specific, so it was the DOH. Is that the funding for the other programs? Yes, because Al asked us not to fund DOH but to actually ask for funding for local programs that were also doing programs Cbo's right, community- based organization yep? So do you want to? Is that how you want to approach it justine? I would ask for both. I appreciate Ls saying that he was concerned that it would not branch out, but one of the things that I did not well that struck me as he was speaking and where, when I was asking about the clients, I appreciate that the community- based organizations are there and doing what they're doing, but they're there and available to people who seek them out. Part of the problem with institutional racism is the institutions and if we do not have mandatory training for the people that are in the institution they're not going to, because if you do not have it mandatory, those who want to seek it out will but they're, probably not the problem, but that I'm not understanding. Because then are you asking for I'm asking for both? No, I know I know, but you said the institutions, but if the wage is already working on it and these and these small agencies are working on it, I'm asking for funding for the for DOH so that it can expand to other city and state agencies, okay, and to the public and to the public yeah. The public would be great. Okay sounds like some and as you're writing Lucian go ahead. You type because I do not want to confuse you expand. Maybe the official name of the program is a D- o-, h- a- c- h, I do not think takes 10 of us. I know sorry yeah, I'm looking at my nose, yeah race to justice, funding for racial bias, training, okay, so we are asking to give funding so that they can, because part of what I think Elle was saying was right now they're struggling, so we want to give funding would like funding so that they can expand their training yes to both other city agencies and to the public in general right. I think the priority should be to the other city agencies so that, because those are the ones that are in most need, because the city is so diverse and, having worked, you know full disclosure with the members of the union and their city workers. That's a that's a tough, for example. A school nurse works for DOH, but she's in school. The Department of Education has to deal with a lot of different. You know diverse adults. So, let's back up, do we just want to say then just to expand the training to other city agencies and leave out the public for the time being? Well, though, I think so yeah I think, expand the teaching of this program across all city agencies. That's what they say. We say: expand the program prioritizing other city agencies and then try to well. You know what this is this year, so we could say city agencies this year and keep it on the list for next year next year and then the next one. So a second suggestion would be for the community fund funding community programs because he said that was that, because that's totally separate okay right would we have to seek out these specific community- based organizations that we think are working with? Absolutely that's what I think, or could we ask like? Could we ask for our community based organizations to be funded so that they could do it like? Let's say if we ask for this money- and maybe Manhattan youth could do it, maybe can we can we back up for a second? So why do not we be specific about organizations and our community alone? Okay, that's the only way you're going to that's the only way, you're going to get money, and now that they're trying to throw these homeless situation shelters in our area, that's more of a need for us to be able to have more sensitivity and training. Absolutely one different put it on in their community. Do we have to do? We need to find out what some of the our community- based organizations are to be specific? Can we just say racial justice, community- based organizations? Maybe, but are they racial justice? Youth is not a racial trust. Are they organizational? How about educational and step in here and give us some guidance yeah give us some guidance. We can try to make a habit, any community organization that okay hold on. Let's let let's let lucian step in and see if he has some guidance from him. Let's say let's say I mean we propose to you and you. Let me know, organizations that, but I mean specific to our catchment area, that provide the necessary funding to hire and maintain sufficient trainers and program designs for the race to justice programs, but propagate the teachings of the program that community yeah we'll deal with deal with. How about I mean social justice and equity. Generally speaking, can we deal with marginalized communities, diverse communities, okay, one at a time? Okay, mariama. First of all, I agree with you, but by putting you say to marginalized communities if we wanted Manhattan and youth or Manhattan youth wanted to do some type of like racial justice program. Technically, you know, that's Tribeca is not a marginalized. Youth does deal with marginalized communities. They have children from all over the place, even within our district. They need financial aid to attend. No, I agree with programs. I know that for a fact, I'm just talking, I agree with you, I'm just talking about the way it's worded certain to not to that. We do not have to use marginalized. I was just saying I saw that Lucian was typing at risk and I thought risk was you know? Okay, one at a time, first of all, it's so tiny. I can't read it so. What does it say? I can read it to you now. It says: provide necessary funding to hire and maintain sufficient trainers and program designers for the race to justice program to propagate the teachings of this program to probably community- based organizations that work within CB, not CD one and provide social support. That's great! You know what can you also put I.E such as Manhattan youth like using that as an example? This is an example such as Manhattan, youth or others yeah, but yeah me too, but I mean you can put so yeah supposed to support and education, social and educational support, how's that such as to Youth, Elk, youth, elderly, poor. I mean groups such as yeah youth, elderly such as Manhattan, youth, such as and then yeah, for example, yeah, exactly you and you could put down. Can we put down specific organization solution or you think not? I could just put one if there's a program where they're outlaying funds, then they're, probably going to want to go through some sort of procurement thing and okay. So I think it's probably best to just design what you want the program to fund and then allow them to find who is able has the capacity to receive the training and effectuate or like make the most of the training? Could we also throw in their gender, or you know, lgbtq, whatever the hell? The letters are and thank you so much because they were marginalized and then and they were true. Thank you. I think that's okay covers that's great. That's, okay spectrum! The CB! The board serves district you're back. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry, thank you. Mimi yeah Ggtqia see how the autocorrect knows that it's right, we got it lucian, that's a district yeah. Okay, anything everybody looked at it any other edits, editions, subjects. What justine said the CD says: the CB. No it's district and that's been said it's supposed to be, I'm sorry, yeah! No, I me too, I did not know the community district right anything else. Anyone do we does this, and cult include race as well, or we do not need to well but we're doing racial training yeah it's for everybody, facial training, so yeah. So I do not know yeah, I think so. I think if that kind of encompasses that okay, it is, but if we're saying such as maybe we should specify I'm Harding also or something like that, and then a minority yeah yeah, I think maybe such as minority, okay, minor, okay, we got it in there. Okay, anything else. We have consensus on this one. Yes, okay, all right now going back just quickly, so we're moving walking wall Trans to November, so yeah. So on that I can we at least see maybe if there's a consensus, that they would be positive, and I could do the resolution in advance because I've worked on when you're going to write the results. Yes, because I worked on one for another organization that I'm on with actually other people that are on this call, so we have information already, okay, so let's do can we do a quick vote on do? Does everyone understand what we would be voting on we're talking about writing a rezzo that we will review next November and if you got a chance to read the links that were sent around by Mariama? Regarding that legislation about walking, while trans we'd like to vote on a resolution against walking against a bit yeah- yes, I vote yes, and I would I there has to be an organized way of voting. How do you do it? Listen for voting for the walking wall transition that we are writing yeah, maybe just as if anyone's against it. That's the fairest way you want to vote on this month or next month. No, what we're trying to do is to see if everyone is in favor of us writing the result, because if not, then we have to debate it. I would say just yeah just canvas the committee and then okay, so I will write to prepare and bring it to the committee meeting next month and have the committee voted up or down or mark it up? Okay is Michael still here. He has no there's no robert's rules against any of this right. Okay, so anyone against writing the result against bringing the topic back. Just let us know, I guess I'm confused. Why are you asking about bringing it back because back? Why do you need permission? I guess, instead of writing to wasting time writing a reso if we need to have. Oh, you need a discussion. Well, you know we're not voting on a reso betty, we'll go to this kitchen, we'll talk about it. Okay, you know what then you do not need to vote hold on hold on hold on. For my from my observation, it appears that most of the committee is definitely very motivated. Okay, this issue, I would say it would be safe to put together a resolution for the community to review next month. Okay, that sounds great thanks buddy for bringing that up. Okay, so we will just we'll write a reso and we'll have our discussion next month. So that's moved to next month, as I said in December, let's can we if there are not any topics that we that are an emergency that we need to discuss in December? Let's have a reso writing meeting and daddy, who writes fantastic rezzos if you would be willing to help out and help teach us along with lucian. We would appreciate that I'll think about it. I might have a few of them to do next month, so of course, December we'll have yeah December. I do not know. I will do my best yeah, that's fine! I mean, if you can great, we would love your input, so we're going to have a reso writing workshop in December okay next month, we're going to do some construction, Right department of construction, we're bringing back walking wild trans ban, we're doing the construction close to construction. No, I'm saying they're coming in November, so like planning out November right. Yes, we're planning out November department of construction, working well, Trans ban. We wanted to work on a housing resolution in support of the bills right lucian sent us all an email with the bills. Okay, do I see that here? But yes, I'm ready. I want to circle that so we want to do. Where's. My pen supported the bills meeting. I posted all the bills that were sent to me by the elected staff to the chat. Okay. So that's that will do that. Looks like a pretty full November meeting and we're bringing back the racism in public health is going to get us information from the legislative team about the data specific to our area, and we can potentially do a result supporting that bill too. Okay sounds good. Anyone want to add anything. Anyone have a topic that they need to bring before the committee nope. Okay, sorry that I want to say not necessarily for November, but I want to talk about affordability. I think we need to have that discussion. Yeah we've got to circle back around Jill is not here tonight. Yeah, that's fine! I do not so we'll circle back, let's talk so maybe we could do the December meeting. Maybe the December meeting could be like an hour on reso writings and an hour on terminology like screen dream 421a, and maybe we could do that for December. That sounds nice actually, okay. Thank you. Pat remember. We had a couple of years ago we had somebody from the the mass office came by and gave a little talk on the the 421 and all of those things. There was a young lady that came back, remember Michael did also years ago. I do not know if you were on a committee, then- and you know who else knows a lot about? It is Susan Cole. So yes, let's see if we can, but there's something from that from that department that actually came and when they were changing the 421 rules like at that specific time. Okay. Well, let's see if we can get who you know, I do not know. I do not remember who it was, but let's see if we get somebody who's, an expert on these things and lucian. I'm sure you know something about all these things. Also this is a city planner, so you can help us and we will, I know, an okay amount of housing. I wish I was a stronger housing, planner yeah, but we'll get some other people in and maybe Diana can lend a voice, also bring in all the experts we need and is also can we get the controller's office? Can we get Scott's office involved for some like actual stats and data, maybe on like the number of buildings that we even have in this district that are 420a or that, may you know that may or may not be expiring. I can. I can invite someone I'll reach out to housing preservation development to see if they'll send someone from that agency. Okay, yeah. Okay, we need something state so because we need the buildings that are expiring in a few years. We need to somehow let the people age in place. Okay, Cora will help me find I'm telling you cora you're still here, you're being volunteered all right, we've we got to go because we've got to go. Watch that second debate. I know everybody's got the popcorn ready. This is a great committee start with the TV watching football. With that meeting. That was referring to that when Tom Goodkind was the chair, he invited HPD to come to do a presentation. At that time there was a new 421 program, that's applied to the whole city ballroom and during the discussion. One point that is different from the before is that Community board preference for some programs- that's no longer in the deal, so that's development by development, but you will be able to find a record somewhere in the fall during the fall of 2018 when Tom Goodkind was around. Maybe a couple meetings during that time that two staff or attorney came to present and they were from HPD and at the time Erica one of your former community board members was there. She has nothing to do with that presentation, but she happened to work for HPD, so she was able to offer some understanding of how programs were happening. So maybe we can just, but I will help you to get the name. I actually have it in my record great. Thank you all right again. Taylor also brings up especially around houseless individuals and in shelters. I think we'll also want to shelters, permanent shelters. We might want to circle back and continue brainstorming locations for permanent shelters within the district. Okay, you know. The other thing I wanted to do also was to reach out to those organizations like open heart and to truly yeah, to talk about open heart and trinity church to talk about their homeless. Outreach, welcome and pat include friends with Friday they're, our local ones. Oh right friend did the cookies get up there allegedly yesterday, I do not know, I did not confirm. Okay. Does the new trinity or will the new trinity include shelter space? They trinity used to have a shelter they used to have a shelter and they closed. I do not know, but we can get someone from trinity to come and talk, so that would be great yeah. I do not know okay, so we got ta go it's it's like eight minutes too again. I think this is a fabulous committee right exactly. I thank everybody for their energy, their effort. You know thank you lucian, so much and enjoy the debate, and we will I'm sure, talk about it at another time too bad. We have Covid-19. I want to go out and have like a beer with somebody and talking about it. Yes, I still go out. I'm telling you I'm trying to save the restaurants alone. Let me call me I will everybody knows I'm in Queens with mom when I come when I do my couple of days back at my apartment, I'll give some calls. You know I get in the car, I can come to Queens, that's good, bring it bring a group. Everybody have a great night stay safe, okay,.
