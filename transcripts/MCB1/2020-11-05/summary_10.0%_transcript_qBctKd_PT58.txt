My name is Justin coaching on the chair, the Battery Park, City Committee, and today is November.
And, as everybody knows, I, do not think we have a whole lot of people on the line that are not us, but we have a.
So, raise your hand when you want to say something, and I will try to pay attention and as a lucian is making a note to please sign in that would be great.
Then we'll go to next report, and at the end, we will talk about solution will give us a little bit of an update and information about 421 a, and for 21.
Barry Herman I have lived in gateway, in, Battery, Park city.
Of, the Battery Park City, seniors.
I'd like to explain what battery Park city seniors even means.
A list of people who are interested in knowing what's going on and from the perspective, I should say of a senior.
The mission of the seniors, Battery Park City seniors, is to foster ongoing community engagements.
People could live anywhere downtown and come join our programs, which is kind of the Spirit of Battery Park City and the parts you can join us, no matter where you live on.
There are also some senior programs, senior centers I'll call them, like house and Hudson guild, and we will grab from their newsletters things that we think might be of interest to our people.
You know, something like meals on wheels is useful for people who might have an issue like that and need help.
A lot more concerned, and I'm sure other committee members are as well because of the status of money, this year, and the city and the state.
We may be a little more hard up going forward because we paid for things like to have an art.
Is the security office number for Battery Park City Authority.
During, the nice weather, when seniors, would sit out on a Friday or a Tuesday afternoon, little groups here and there, and keep everybody going and socialize, cause.
I think we can sit out on Friday, but we really want to move towards continuing this through the colder weather in a safe, way.
Do not know, I, always invite people to reply to what we right.
It helped people out to be able to have an easy way to close and not wait on those 4 or 5 hour lines, because I was there.
I will that we just pushed out newsletters items, letting people know about having special senior hours anything that our elected officials were making available.
The lines of maybe people said I need somebody to go pick up our prescriptions for me, or there was 1 person who wants needed, and this was not related to code.
As, we get out of Colvin, and we want to start to have maybe programming that may cost something, you know.
I'll let, you know, what happens more information and 1 last questions.
Well, wait, battery Park City Authority does for, in that space in 200, director.
If there's no other questions, I do not see any people are going to have to help me out with waving or something, because I do not see anything in any questions in the attendees.
I'd like to get some my way of saying, because I want some substance behind the report.
What I want to know is okay, so we had some.
Gosh, it's like last, I, think maybe this was for the last meeting, but whatever, where there were people on a scaffold by Brookfield and.
We do know the regulars and so does department of homeless services and all them.
The thing to realize is that a lot of people, think, okay, just call in 91111, is going to solve the issue.
The way it's set up now is that actually, department of homeless services has to come.
It's just crazy, I guess, which is fine for the people who are the regulars, but someone who's coming and going.
Was that it takes a lot of touches of from them to meet the people to make them feel comfortable, feel safe to actually apply for housing.
When many of the entry ways to Wagner park were kind of blocked off and when these things happen, I would ask the ambassadors.
So, yes, because, I, mean, they're, they're, worried about their taxes and spending money and I can think of a lot of ways to do that.
Actually people in my community work in soup kitchens to volunteer at petition, Kitchens and stuff like that.
You know, it's what we're seeing actually, even within Battery Park City.
We've got Patrick and we've got nick, and I think that they probably know exactly who everybody is.
Okay, because there was a department of homeless services, individual speaking about it and what they were doing with moving residents from the upper west side down to their really.
Do we have a local department of Homeless, Services group or team, or a person.
People are known to department, homeless, services.
It does allow the city to know where people are.
I would say that the lower Manhattan in Battery Park City.
They identify someone who's in need, and a lot of the city to engage to, to find out where people are sometimes they're.
They're, finding people that they had a good conversation, going.
But a couple of things I want to say that Sarah grace points that you're raising Tammy has actually brought this up in her big meeting asking to have.
We want to take care of the people who are on the streets in our neighborhood right now to place.
The way I understand it is that, according to the commanding officer captain and the Community Affairs unit, Brian Nelson, whom you met at the last quality of life meeting, if someone called 9, 1, 1 or 311, it's not that like the pd.
Keep, encouraging the residence in the CB 1 area to come, because people are really angry with the homeless.
Quality of life is the place where that conversation goes, but we have asked and multiple people have asked to have a separate.
I said, the angry people, but I noticed that every time after they attended the Community Council meeting, because they bought that direct dialogue and they actually hear from the offices what the challenges are.
I think Corpus speaking, because it's kind of an entree into what I want to say.
Think now in the community is aware of the homeless person.
I mean, you know, it, comes down to a while after a while as.
Just saying that, you know, I think.
Okay, cause, you know, each, each area in Battery, Park, City.
I know what everything going on right.
A lot of that is credit to pat for being here and with the community, and here every month in and out with me building that trust and making sure that the community knows that if you're working.
Thank you for that 1 thing that came up also, and certainly agreed that we can maybe try to get some more context to when Pat's, giving his reports about goings on the neighborhood, which the conversations usually evolve into anyway.
Like, I think, I probably sent something out to you that morning, after conversing with pat saying, hey, heads up as the CB 1 chair you and Tammy.
Those are things that certainly when it's at that level of potential emergency, you're going to be hearing from us in real time.
I appreciate that, because yes, I appreciate the real time information, but I also think it's important for the.
The committee to hear what's going on in the neighborhood, and the people who call in.
1 is the rent stabilization agreement and the other is class action settlement and Sir. As many of, you know, because I know some of you are, in fact, gateway residents.
It's the only thing in battery park city.
That's part of the original master plan, which called for affordable housing, among other things in Battery, Park, City.
I would add is once we know we'll circulate that information to the tenants, because people were paying for the 3 or 4 months.
So, class members tenants needed to follow a claim form by April of this last year.
Communications people told us is that the rent credits should show up on our January.
A lot of the tenants got legal letters thinking about being perhaps late on their rent when.
Add, your email address in person, parks, programming, number 2 there as you know.
And there's to the release, we will know on the Battery Park City Authority web site, as well.
As we begin executing on this very ambitious plan to try to make battery Park city, carpet, neutral.
Next battery Park city, blood drive is going to be a solution.
Go down to page 6 there and next battery Park City blood drive is going to be Tuesday, November 17th to ever terrace.
Thanks again to everyone who participated, especially all our battery park, city residents and partners, and folks who are coming from across downtown.
Battery Park City, resiliency project updates.
The Good News on the battery Park City Ball field is that we are very close to be a being able to knock on wood.
We want to make sure that we're going through the process with the city and the Community board, with.
Thanks everyone and battery Park City, especially for the great work in getting your senses.
I think Corey mentioned it, but the 1st Precinct Community Council meetings are very helpful for those who attend.
What's, even what's going on with battery Park city.
And I think that we really need to come.
I do, so I would tell me which buildings in Battery, Park, City.
Which buildings in Battery Park city are poor.
I know battery Park, City.
We do not have a provision in Battery, Park city, authorities, land, lease.
What conversations that you can share are happening right, now, because I think the people who live there would like to know step 1 and step 2.
It is the affordable housing in Battery, Park, City.
It's definitely have a vested interest in preserving affordable housing in Battery, Park City and.
Those things in the other thing that I think is important for us to work with is the answer to the question.
How many people there are in battery park city that might be under financial dressed and might be facing anything like eviction, or.
To find out who those people are, and to help work with them.
1, thing, I want to say to answer the 1st, 1, I was asking who was responsible within the quality of life committee for doing the housing subcommittee or whatever.
Any kind of conversion requires the approval of the Battery Park City Authority Board.
We are not approving any condo conversions in Battery, Park, City, co, ops, unstructured as I understand, that.
I wanted to jump in for a 2nd, since we have a pause and just say that I think it might be possible that battery Park City has a list of affordable, housing.
I think I am done trying to keep this going when I can't hear anything and that's not anybody's fault.
