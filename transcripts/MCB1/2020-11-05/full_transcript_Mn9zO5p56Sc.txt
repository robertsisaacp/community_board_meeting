Hold on I'm putting my computer more in front of me and so I am ready. Everybody I'm so sorry about the I always have trouble with webex and now oh there we are back again. Can you read up the first agenda item because well, actually I can get it up on the screen but Jennifer in the meantime, while I'm getting the agenda up, will you will you read it out sure? So? The first agenda item is a first 60 caller certain 55 late street, which we reviewed last month. It's for further review of the application to renovate the industrial street canopy to the main building entrance. So here with us tonight, we have Catherine. Dean. Give me one moment: sorry, yeah, okay, yeah, my understanding. Just so everyone knows is that this has been. There's been a public session at the Landmarks Preservation commission. They seem to know they have agreed with us in terms of the canopy, but they added a concern about the amount of glass on Lake Street. It was that Catherine Dean is kind enough to return to us with the revised proposal in response to well us and also to the LPC. However, there is no more public hearing, so it's this is the second applicant recently who is coming back to us as a courtesy to show us the changes which we appreciate and I said please by all means, do it, but there's no context anymore in which to present to LPC from our side, because there's only one public hearing. That being said, please welcome hi catherine. Are you there, catherine? Are you there with us, she's muted? Let me unmute her hi. We can hear you, okay. That is not what happened Bruce. Actually, what happened? Is they agreed with you about the canopy previous to meeting with you at the Community Board or with before the second meeting they asked for less glass and they agreed with my solution, which was to make the glass panels in the doors narrower. So there were three equal wooden conditions and the doors be the glass became narrower, but they agreed with you at the Landmarks Preservation committee that the canopy needed work. Okay, so that's where it was left. So what was left with the Landmarks Preservation Committee is that I'm supposed to work with LPC staff right? Okay, that's in other words, you're, saying that the my explanation was wrong in that in regard to the glass and its presentation is that I do not quite understand where we, where the committee, our it's, the Landmarks Preservation commission, where the landmarks and preservation committee are not quite sure where our committee stands in regard to the process now. I do not really fully understand either because they decided to review it and they decided to review it on Tuesday. So in the review on Tuesday, they agreed with you about the canopy, and so the commissioners agreed with you about that canopy. So the landmark staff agreed with your with your concerns with the canopy and landmarks commissioners agreed with it as well so where it was left, is I have to work with them relative to reducing the size of it. I think there's a misunderstanding and you do not have to come back to us you're, not working directly with staff. Okay, that's what bruce is as a courtesy to us, I did not realize you know. I thought captain was just courteously presenting, but the new proposals without making a resolution in any case, Jason is right. This happens more often than not where ltc would provisionally accept something, but has the African go back and make revisions? Rarely does the LPC reject an application out of him go back to the current board as they did with a mansion that was being proposed for opposite you on coliseum they started again, but as long as you're here, catherine, why not just show us the new presentation, you know I appreciate you being here: can we can we look at it now again sure? Do you want me to go through the whole thing or just go through the changes? Okay is anyone else having trouble hearing bruce? No I can hear him now. Jason he's. Oh! Thank you, Jason. Okay, someone needs to give me control of the presentation. Catherine give me one moment: I'll be passing them over to you. Okay, catherine I pass the presentation rules to you whenever you're ready, but I do not see the slides. Oh do you want me to present this? You have the presentation and I just wanted you to give me control of them. Okay, so, and if you can't give me control of them, I'll just tell you to go to the. We can do that. Okay, so let's scroll down and let's pass all through. All of this keep going keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going just oh go to the next one here go to the next one, okay, so with the canopy. What I had done was what we talked about at the meeting, which was to lower the canopy relative to the line of the double hunt windows. But what I've thought about since then was also reducing the scale from it being eight inches thick to being six inches thick. So I was thinking about changing the eight inch wide section flange to a six inch c channel. Instead, so it will be thinner as well. I'm going to investigate with landmarks of what, whether they want it sloping or not. One concern I have about it being sloping. Is they want it to be narrower and I'm a little uncomfortable with the sloping canopy dumping rain into the middle of the sidewalk? It's already sloping slightly, so it's already going to dump rain into the sidewalk, but it won't be coming off at a fast pace and if it's sloping downward in any kind of dramatic way, usually this usually the canopies that slope down go all the way to the edge of the sidewalk, so they're shutting rain onto the onto the street, and if this slopes down it's going to be sloping down and it gets narrower than what it's currently shown here. It's going to be dropping rain right in the middle of the sidewalk, but this is what, where it's currently at it's going to get thinner, keep going forward. Two more slides forward, one more okay! Here back one here! You can see that now the three styles of the doors are equal and the glass is more vertical, which is more similar in proportion both to the vertical dimension of the glass in the glass over the doorway of the garage and the glass in the doorways of the transparent doors adjacent to it. So it's actually just more in character with the kind of vertical proportioning of everything, and it reduces the glass at the on the edges of the doors and they thought it was better. It also shows that the it is now aligned, which I think is better, that the edge of the glass is aligned with the mullion overhead. So it registers better with the transom. Can you go ahead? Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead and grow the last slide. So here you can see with the canopy lowered, but it it's kind of a more intimate scale, with the doorway and with the glass narrower on the facade that it's more in similar proportion to the windows on the facade on the far right and with the windows that are up on the top portion of the on the third floor. So those are the changes that I made between seeing you and a second meeting with LPC and they approved the doors on late. They approved the transparent door on callister and they sent me back because they wanted to have a smaller scale. Canopy I mean they wanted. They said there was something wrong with the scale of the canopy, so that's where I'm at so I'm sent to revise the canopy. Still, yes, is it possible to show us the original canopy proposal, or is that too complicated now here with various people controlling his life and so on? I do not know how to do that. Okay, it's okay! The only way I would know how to do. That is that Jennifer has the previous presentation and can load it yeah. So will you describe again the changes in this? The canopy is lower here it used to be higher up. It used to be about a foot higher up on the wall and the glass is more vertical in the door, so the glass is narrower and more vertical and aligns with the transom overhead and the bottom image. So those are the changes, but landmarks still did not approve the canopy. They still thought it was too big. So I'm meeting with them again tomorrow, I've already investigated possibly making the canopy thinner and why too big? Do you mean projecting out in I, can only think that they must mean sticking out too much because at the same time they were very clear that they did not think there should be more hardware on the facade so they'd like the idea that I was reusing, the ties that are already there and I can't you can't really reuse the ties any other way, because it would look really strange to pull them into the middle. So I'm assuming that they must have meant projecting out too far and I thought also. Maybe they meant in scale. Maybe they meant the dimension of the thickness of it because it's thicker than it needs to be. So that was the only thing I thought is mark on Mark. Are you here yeah, I'm here? Okay, Mark had some questions or issues. He was not at that meeting, but I guess she's not on this one either it's irrelevant. Now, but you had some comments as regarded this canopy I know on hollister. Did you want to speak to it now yeah? Thank you bruce and I think you. You are also familiar with the with that street and unfortunately, I would ask. Maybe if your folks are on the computer to Google maps it map it because directly across the street, unless you have a photo, the applicant has a photo. There's a canopy directly across the street from here. It is very diagonal across the street, maybe a little bit off, but this is a very thin street. It's an alleyway! That's only two blocks. Long and there's that's the only canopy on the street is the one that's directly across from there. I do not know if there was even ever a canopy here prior to this, so I do not know if we're setting a president or not either so from a landmark's point of view. I would want to reject it. Just based it. There was never. It was never one there before I do not know. If we're going to do a resolution, I think you mentioned it's almost a fade to complete, but it's called it's going to cause a dangerous situation, because the trucks use this street all the time, and you noted that last time bruce- and this even causes the street to be even more narrow because you have competing canopies facing each other and and it's going to cause a dangerous situation for a cat for a truck to maneuver in between both of these canopies and the truck heights are higher than the canopies, the box trucks and those kind of things I'm not talking about 18 wheelers. Although someone ever made attempts to go down the street, believe it or not, so I do not know if we can refer this specific item to quality of life this month as a issue. So at least we can get a resolution on a review of it from a DOT perspective or something like that, because they might not be aware unless you know it's a complaint driven from a landmarks, effective they're just looking at it landmark wise. But this is logistically going to cause a very dangerous situation on that street and I do not know if we can bring Google maps up to show the how they're going to be competing against each other. How much space is really I mean that that's that sidewalk is already ultra thin. I know we spoke about it because we need more lighting on there and it's difficult to put up a light because of a handicap, and so it's a it's really a very much of a problem. I do not know we can make honorable mention of it landmarks wise, but if we can relate to another committee that can tackle specifically the the real problem, an issue in danger with having compel canopies facing each other for the most part, did you consider I mean that is a quality of life issue? It's not directly a landmark issue and we did. We did reject the canopy last time, so we weighed in on it. But captain did you look at I, it's interesting when Mark had brought that up. He was not at the last meeting, but he had mentioned that, and you know I've been in that building many times, and it is true that there's a very difficult passageway for pedestrians as it is because trucks have no choice but to pull up to onto the curb in order to navigate at which point the park can not get down the street anyway, but did you consider the the height of the truck versus the height of the canopy? Yes, trucks are 14 feet high and we used the limit right in front of the door and used a limit of 14 feet clearance for the canopy okay. So how high is the bottom of the canopy right now and look in revision from the sidewalk it's 14 feet and the truck is 14 feet. It needs 14 feet of clearance, bruce may I project. This is not a canopy. A canopy according to building code, actually touches the sidewalk, so this is not considered a canopy. So what should we call it? Oh god, Kathryn help me for a moment, I'm having a brain fart, it's not a canopy, it's an honor! Maybe what it's? Probably more of an awning, but no it's not an awning. It has a different name. The point is that a canopy touches by building code, a canopy, extends up out of the building and it has two elements that touch the sidewalk and at that point it must be back two feet from the sidewalk for garbage. So this is not a canopy. So catherine, what have you been calling it to landmarks? Pardon me what, in terms of landmark's presentation, what have you been calling that device about the door? I've been calling it a canopy, but it's not my friend I guarantee anything that does not match the sidewalk. It's called the marquee. If you touch the sidewalk, it's called a canopy and a canopy belongs to D.O.B and a marquee belongs to the department of transportation. So I guarantee you this. So it's marquee. If it does not touch the sidewalk, can I ask a question. I appreciate that. But how is that germane to this conversation is that it's not a canopy, a canopy touches. The sidewalk can I say something Jason here, Jason the other bald man on the on the committee. I want to say something that is germane to this I hope it does not offend anybody. This application has it's passed us, and this young lady has come back by mistake and I. My heart bleeds for you, because I would not want to do any more community board meetings than I had to do and I do not we're not going to resolve any I can't agree to make a new resolution about this. Canopy I do not think it's right and mark the canopy. It's a monkey. Let me finish: yeah and Mark obviously has a bone to pick as a very close by neighbor, and my suggestion to Mark respectfully would be you spearhead your campaign against the canopy on the block at the full board, and we should not weigh in hold on I just want to finish. I. Do not I, do not really talk a lot, I think and I and I and so mark you can you can you can take that through I'm not going to I'm not going to like sign up for a resolution about quality of life or anything? This application has passed through us and it was gone. It's gone. I think that you do not owe us anything this applicant to change this, but you should just listen to what everybody has to say and I just wanted to say that I think we should move on to the next application. We also made a mistake: can I clarify something I made a mistake: I looked it up again: the height of trucks allowable in New, York state is 13 foot six and that's why I started at 14? Yes, okay, absolutely I'm sorry, bro, just you're really cutting it close. Having come back to us to give us the courtesy of the change, I understand what LPC is saying: I clearly they've taken our advice into consideration. So has catherine we see what you're doing and I appreciate. I do. Think Mark has made his position clear. He unfortunately was not. At the first meeting we wrote a resolution and catherine I appreciate your coming back and I agree with Jason that we we've dealt with this. Can I want to wish you good luck. Unless someone else on the committee can ask the question you have to sorry what staff is running. The meeting I can't hear you mark what staff CB staff is running the meeting who's here. Jen, so can you can you contact Pat to have this added to the agenda for quality of life, so at least we can tackle it from the other perspective that we need to sure I can do that all right. Thank you. Thank you. I hope you did not wind up feeling like you're in the lion's den, by doing this in service of just showing us your amendment. We appreciate your help. May I just say one thing before we move forward the tiki camera Hey. Do you mind? Do you mind if one? Do you mind this edition committee say no one's objecting go ahead, so I just want to say catherine without a doubt, knowing the building code. This is a marquee and not a canopy. A canopy touches the sidewalk and it has certain regulations. The canopy must move back two feet from the sidewalk, so the garbage truck does not get hit if it's a marquee, which is what this is because it's hanging from the building and not touching the sidewalk, it has its own regulations. Okay, I will I will look at that. Okay, thank you for your advice. Thank you. Okay, thank you. So thank you. Everybody! The next. The next item agenda item. Please sure the next agenda items is for bulgaritis. I do not want to pronounce it wrong, regardless plaza statement, support for Pdc approved Kiosk. This is coming from the Department of Transportation. Okay, do we have anyone on from the other committee joining us so far, I do not see nope. Thank you Jason by the way yes, I appreciate it. Thank you. I also wanted to say that young lady does not feel she should not feel obligated to go to Mark's agenda meeting, because there's no requirement for her to do that and I feel bad for her a little bit, because, if she's going to go to the meeting and everyone's going to bust her jobs about this thing, she should just deal with intelligence on the street. But by coming back to us and showing her modifications, she's now she's now entered the pit of community distress. It's almost like. Why do us a favor, it's proper to invite them if they want to come they can I'm not saying that I'm just saying like you're totally right too mark you're totally right too, I'm not saying you're, not right. We just we should not be advising them. If you want it'll be great if they could come just so, we can hash it out. Maybe there are other ideas: okay, now we're moving on to to what is it? I'm sorry, I have to get the agenda up. Jennifer read it again, please, and we won't go backwards. Sorry for a book artist, Plaza statement of support for pdc approved Kiosk. So here are the center. We have Jennifer ines as well as emily waldenhoff, so whenever they're ready to speak, thank you Jennifer and hi everyone good evening. I hope you all can hear me. I'm Jennifer something as dot's Manhattan deputy borough, commissioner and I wanted to thank Community Board, one Bruce Jason and all of the members of the landmarks and preservation committee for having us on tonight. I'm joined by my colleagues, emily wydenhoff dot's, director of Public space, Christina you and Nicolas patnati, who is our deputy director of urban design, we're here tonight to present on our standard Plaza kiosk design for Bogardus plaza. We've brought this design to the public Design commission we've received pdc approval and we're slated to present our proposal to the Landmarks Preservation commission for LPC approval in the coming weeks. Following tonight's presentation, my colleagues and I will be on to answer any questions that you may have and we're hopeful that the board would offer a statement of support. Should that be the case, and so with that I'm going to hand it off to emily, who will be sharing her screen and running through our presentation before we do it if, in the event that we write a resolution, I just want to be clear that we are talking about the plaza that never gets completed between reed and rather the beginning of what was Hudson street and West Broadway at Reed and chambers. Is that correct? Yes, so that is the Bogardus plaza location and emily will be able to talk through some of the specifics on that location through in our slides. Before we go any further, the official designation was Bogardus triangle. Is it now called Bogartus Plaza? The reason it was officially designated triangle was because every other juncture which is characteristic of Tribeca historically, is designated triangle, whether it's Barnett Newman Triangle or the one on West, Broadway and Varric and Franklin, whose name escapes me at the moment, but have you changed it to book artist plaza so just to clarify? We are talking about the D.O.T public. You know pedestrian Plaza for this Kiosk location, but Nick or emily may be able to add a little bit more color to your question about Triangle versus Plaza. You know during our presentation. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead, beautiful, okay, good evening! Everyone! Thank you. So much for having us can folks both see my screen and hear me. Okay, yes, great so just very quickly to the plaza name. These plazas are named based on either a kind of pre-designated name or based on the street that they're on and so because Bogardus garden had that name that the name, the official name of the plaza is Bogardus plaza. I also want to acknowledge that we're joined by Victoria, Weil friends of Bogardus plaza our maintenance partner for this evening. So I appreciate that she has is able to join. We there we go. We oversee 82 pedestrian plumbers across the city, quite a few of which are in your district. A key part of our plaza program is our concession agreement that we have with our plaza partners. This allows for food kiosks markets, things like that which bring vitality and life and positive use to all public spaces, but also it's an important mechanism for the maintenance of our public spaces and by allowing this kind of public RFP process for a food, concession or other type of business. In a plaza, all the revenue that's generated through that concession goes back into the maintenance of the space and so having a permanent sub-concession. Kiosk is an incredibly important and kind of reliable stream of maintenance support for our partners, and it is really critical. We found over that past many years to create a standard kiosk that really fits into the streetscape of New York City and having a standard really creates both a kind of reliable street furniture element, but also something that really streamlines the approval and recruit process for all of our maintenance partners and really reduces the cost for our partners, certainly based on location and need. We would always allow kind of a unique and different design should the partner be able to afford, but really having a standard is key. So what we're here present to you tonight is our standard design that has gone through pdc and will be going through LPC, I'm going to start with the Kiosk design principles. I'll move quickly. If you have questions, we can come back to slides and then I'll end, showing you specifics about book artist, Plaza itself, a few design parameters. We researched a lot of kiosks across the city. What was working in public space and came up with a kind of standard design that met a lot of the kind of food service and retail requirements for a space. The finish of the interior of the plaza is raw and will allow for a retailer to come in the kiosks are ADA accessible. We really worked to make sure that we could keep the cost down for our partners and work to coordinate with our sister agency's Department of Health Department of buildings. The real goal and kind of concept of the kiosk is that you know our plazas are 360 degree spaces people enter and walk past them and through them really at all directions. There are very few plazas with a back side, and so we really worked to design a kiosk that could be accessible and certainly visually pleasing from all directions, and that was also kind of paired with our standard set of street furniture. So we actually worked with Billings Jackson, the designer a member of the design team on our street furniture toolkit. We wanted to make it feel part of that New York City family. We also saw who is that principal designer? Would you say your name against sure? It's Billings Jackson Billings Jackson. Thank you. Yes, we also saw you know. Another really important piece of the kiosk is that when it was closed for business, we did not just want it to be an empty box sitting there. We really saw it as an opportunity to create additional lighting and think of the kiosk as a lantern at night to provide you know additional space and kind of public safety. So with that this is our kiosk design. It's a it's a stainless steel structure that has fulton shutters. It has service and trees on three sides. It really allows for flexibility, for operators, to you know, think about pickup and and or ordering windows and pickup windows allows for kind of the greatest flexibility, and then we really worked to use a material that was going to be very robust, something that was easy to replace and also really work to standardize the sizes of the panels. So again, maintenance could be easy and affordable and we could keep these things looking great well into the future. Here are just a couple of the technical design drawings the kiosks are outfitted with and will receive power and water and sewer connections. So we do not have to deal with any noisy generators in the plazas and again here you see the setters that open and close here we have the kind of evening view so that the kiosk can really act as a lantern and support the space when it's not in operation also flag that the stainless steel at the bottom has a texture to deter from Graffiti. Here you can see some of those samples up close still a little. You know still a picture, but you can see the upper cladding, the shutters with the perforations and then the textured steel for the bottom panels of the kiosk. Can you leave that for a second? Please leave the last slide for a minute. Please. Thank you. Hold on I think. Another idea that came with the textured bottom panel is that that's the panel that people might bump into might get dung up a little bit. So you know having that texture helps. Kind of you know, keep some of those dings kind of fade away. In the background, like I said, the kiosk is ADA compliant, so both you know the height of the shelves and the windows, as well as a ramp element that can be added on for someone who's actually operating or working the retail facility. Here you can see the shelves that actually get taken in, so nothing is sticking out of the kiosk when it's not in use here's a shot of the inside again very kind of open and raw, so that each individual business can come in and make their own and outfit it for the way they need it. The lighting is included as part of the design, and here you see, the framing of the roof includes the ability to add air conditioning and other types of cooking equipment should that be necessary. Another really important component is thinking about the signage and the branding, and so part of the Kiosk design is kind of a set of guidelines about where signage can go very set to be. You know mostly the kind of top panel that can be visible from far away some kind of secondary graphics on that middle glass panel. We do not ever want to cover more than 50 percent of that area to maintain transparency and then I kind of. Lastly, a third subset of graphics, so you can kind of imagine as I show you here, the brand the menu and maybe then some some kind of additional graphics as necessary. This is a view of the side of the kiosk. Here are just a couple of other examples of what branding might look like, and so with that, let's go to the proposed Location Bulgaria's plaza, which you probably know all very well on West Broadway. These are some photos of what is under active construction, we're hoping we just had a call with our sister agency, the Department of design and construction, on an update today, they're hoping to finish the majority of the work by early November fingers crossed as well reported if I may interrupt it at the last quality of life meeting they said spring, so that was two weeks ago this week, this day in November for a substantial completion, which means I'm sorry, I'm sorry to interrupt. You and I do want to hear the rest of it, but for the neighborhood, what has been happening at Bogart Bogardus triangle over many years is at the point where most neighbors that I speak to wish nothing had been touched. It has been so delayed and it is so disruptive and it was quite pleasant before now. It's a wreck I do not it in its transformative state. It's been a wreck for a long time. It also has disrupted tremendously pre-existing businesses, for instance the one that we can see here directly South east, the southwest that business is gone. King's pharmacy northwest has suffered because of this construction. I appreciate your wanting to add another source of revenue, but I would like to keep the local businesses that are losing revenue also in business and I. Do not understand the discrepancy between DDC telling us two weeks ago that it would be finished in spring and you're using the phrase. Substantial completion I do not know how something is substantially or unsubstantially completed when it comes to a plaza in a month. Okay, I've made my comments known and, let's continue sure, no well I do not know I just have to say yeah. No, we appreciate your frustration. We we construction is feels way too long and way too messy, and we hear you absolutely again. I can't speak for my colleagues who are not present, but just to say that we are very hopeful that they can kind of complete the last remaining items and plant get the landscaping in before the cold weather hits. So thank you, emily and by the way, what division are you with what agency, or so we are with the department of transportation? My specific unit is the public space unit. Yes, okay, thank you. Emily go ahead, and so with that, looking at the plan of the plaza- and here you see West Broadway, the kind of main north-south connection past the plaza, the location that we're proposing for the kiosk is really along. This outer edge to kind of preserve the open and the calm area. Where you have the garden, you have the platform and all the kind of additional planting and bench seating, really keeping the plaza towards the busier, more bustling and flexible area to the south, where we also have the subway stair and the elevator, and that is the end of my presentation. And so we welcome your questions and your comments. Someone is here from the the community group that has been helping with or spearheading Bogartus Triangle and you've been with us before. Regarding a clock, are you who is it and are you here, I guess not I thought Jennifer introduced someone from friends of bogartis triangle, but am I yes, Victoria wile from friends of Bulgaria's garden is here I do not believe she is a panelist I believe she's an attendee, so I'm not sure if she can actually I would love to hear from she's muted. If that's possible, is it Jennifer? Can we unmute her? Is it possible Jennifer? Are you with us? I do not know. I do not know, but I do know. This platform has to be corrected between now and the next meeting we've lost, Jennifer, I, guess, okay, suppose I'm here, oh, can we unmute? Can we unmute Victoria from the friends of book artist triangle? Is it possible yeah I can meet her one second, okay, oh well: okay, she's unmuted, so yeah hi I do not need to hijack you but you're from the community, and that means something to me and I've. We've met before and I just want your opinion of all of this. If you do not mind so, first of all, I'm 100 with you. This has taken so much longer than I'd been told than any of us anticipated. It's been extremely frustrating and painful, especially as the face of bogartis Plaza I feel like I've just been like misleading the community. When I'm like it'll be done two years ago, I mean anyway, it's been really frustrating. So I hear you it's a tricky area. I've been going to the meetings with the department of design and construction that hire the contractor for two years now, monthly and now bi-weekly and bi-monthly so anyway. So I'm with you so I just wanted to make that clear. That, like I, feel your pain, I live right over the plaza, it is really frustrating, but we are getting there and I do not know where you heard the spring thing. Like that's super upsetting. We on our call today, emily as she said we are, that was at the quality of life meeting at the community board when DDC went over all of their projects, that we insisted that they go over and that was last month. That's so that has never been projected for I mean it's. Never it's always been it'll be August. Okay, oops, it's going to be October! Okay! Now it's going to be late, October! That's it's never been projected that far in advance and we're talking to I think the highest people up in this. So that's surprising, but, as Emily said, the latest projections are like we're moving to the punch list. Hopefully substantial completion, which means all the major construction is done by early November. The plantings are supposed to be going in the first two weeks of November and this kiosk. From our perspective, we've been talking to Billings Jackson. What will likely end up happening? I do not know if you know how these things work in general, but generally a sub concessionaire is the person who built designs and builds the kiosks for DOT. This has not happened yet that there's been a standard kiosk and because we are landmarked and because Pdc approved this design it would make a lot more sense for us and for future sub-concessionaires. If there was just a a box that was there that could be customized. So we really like the idea, because otherwise there are all sorts of rules and regulations about taking it off the plaza for a period of time each year. This just makes sense to us. So we would like this to happen. We've talked to on my board. We've reached out, we've started to write an RFP, and one of our criteria is that we're going to wait local businesses more, that that'll be a plus for people who apply it's a public process, as you know, and we've just reached out to five local businesses just to take their temperature. Is this something that interests you? Is this something that you'd run away from and I'd say four out of the five were interested? They want to know when the RFP is released, and so that was good to hear, especially now in this weird pandemic time, a small space that is based sort of outside is appealing to people. So that's where we are. You should also know that one of the owners of king's pharmacy is on our board. So where is it Jones? It's I'm Alan Solman all Right Alan. This is partner right. Okay! Well, that's encouraging yeah, so I mean I. Try. I've always tried to keep the people who are closest physically to the plaza as involved as possible, just because it impacts our neighbors at one Hudson at 16 Hudson, I'm at 90, West Broadway. We have a relationship with and it radiates outward the impact radiates outward. It's not just that cloister, it's a very busy intersection yeah and it causes traffic and noise absolutely and may it end soon. But anyway, that is our perspective and you're. Welcome. Sorry, I can talk a long time about this I get sort of passionate about it. I'm going to open it up to the committee. I hope. I have not dominated the time too much. I have other comments, but I would like. Perhaps the committee has questions for the D.O.T or for victoria or comments on the design. Should we go around the virtual table? Susan I see you I do not have anything at the moment. I was listening and I'm just still thinking. I mean I, know where it is the triangle and it's not offensive so yeah there I am I'm. Thank you, I'm looking for some reason again, I can not get visuals of the full committee is Vera on I'm just calling out names. Hey bruce! I'm here! Yes, I'm here, do you have any comments? Not particularly it is what it is. That's where I'm not that's correct liz! Yes, bruce I'm going to just echo the sentiment. I really do not have any questions or comments. Ciao. Do you have any remarks? No I agree with what was that earlier or mark? I'm sorry, I can't I'm having trouble hearing. That's okay should I wait. No I said earlier that I agree with what we said earlier: okay, Mark, okay, just reiterate for me to remind the kiosk, is now going to be a permanent structure. Is that right? Yes, so if I remember way back when when this was a temporary thing or something like that, I thought there was not going to be any permanent structures on the on the triangle. I kind of remember something about that you're right mark. It's I think it's about the subfloor like what lies below it, so it will sit on top of the plaza. So it could, it can be removed in theory, because there's no, it does sit on top there connections underneath there's a sort of a little vault that has the connection for electric and water and waste, but it's not it's not built in it kind of lands on top and I think that's the difference, so there's actually a sewage or water lines underneath I believe. Yes, there will be. So that's really, if that's the case, as opposed to just having a box set up with electric running through an air conditioner. This is they think this is not opposed to what we were told. I mean it was. This is, of course, well supposed to be temporary, but I'll get into that one again, so I have an issue with the permanent or anything can be removed, but the permanence of the Kiosk, the way it's being built. That's not who we were told initially again Vicky. Thank you mark and thanks for that recollection vicky. Are you still there I see? You're I am told you'll promise at the moment. Thank you. Oh I did not hear what she said, but mom at the moment. I agree with mark, but no common adjustment. Thank you, Jason I do not. I was wondering what about like advertising for the kiosk. It looks spare of any sort of signage. Is there going to be signage? No, there was a very big signage presentation. Can we go back for Jason? Oh I'm! Sorry all right in that rendering, though oh okay, that's fine, that's fine! Okay, I'm! Okay! With that it makes me for the dawn, did I miss anyone on the committee I it's hard for me to see. Christina is not on the committee right. No and Christina and Nicholas are not on the committee. Okay. Well, that's correct. I mean you have to step in because everyone else is being reticent. I want to support the friends of bogartis, because the friends of Bogardus are residents some of them long time residents. I'm glad to hear that king's pharmacy, which really struggled at the beginning of the shutdown, is on the board. I have very mixed feelings about this one, because I always I always relate public works projects by the DDC in terms of the lifespan of students, and since this has started, we have had students in starting high school who are now in college, and it's still not done. The contractor I spoke to some of the contractors recently and they drew a complete blank as to when they'd be done. It was very much compartmentalized. It was thrown into the same basic hopper as the reconstruction of Worth Street by Dbc at the quality of life committee and famously the contractor. There told residents that at this point it's a license for the contractor to print money. Unquote and that's a direct quote and I fear that that's what's happening here and without the pleasant enjoyment of the community of this space and it's getting embroidered and embroidered and embroidered I do not feel I. Do not feel right about supporting this until I actually see something to my eyes, the kiosk looks like a meteor set into this beautiful, perhaps overly ambitious plaza compared to what it was and I do not like the 50 signage, and I'm really surprised that this new feature is being presented since this little plaza has been worked over and worked over. We've had so many meetings at the community board level on it always supportive to me. This is out of out of left field and I do not mean left if I mean left field as the expression, let's say it's out of right field, it's from outer space that that's my immediate reaction, but I won't be unilateral about. This is something that requires the boards. The committee's you know, ascent and participation. I do not know how to parse this, I'm not against something generating the upkeep of the park. I do not particularly like the design. It surprises me compared to the formality of the present design. I, do not like the signage but I, understand the concept in terms of budget shortfall and needing somewhere to generate revenue to keep the triangle you know going so I guess I'll have to leave it to the coach here. Sorry, somebody to interrupt bruce I I, appreciate your your thoughts there and I just wanted to jump in a little bit on the process and the clarify a few things. So this whole a couple quick things, one, the kiosk is not going to be built by DDC, it's separate and apart from the DDC project, this is an effort by D.O.T to help support our plaza partners. It's also a new effort. So over the past few years we were able to get funding to work with Billings Jackson on this piece of street furniture. It's something that we've heard a need from a lot of our plaza partners over a decade of managing these spaces. So it may certainly feel new and different for the kind of conversations that we've had with the community board over the years. But that's because it is, it is an evolving kind of new tool in our street furniture. Toolkit, so it's something that that the infrastructure was planned and put in the plaza in terms of electrical connections, but this kiosk effort is new and also separate, and apart from the DDC design project. So if this was in the hopper evolving for a long time and the Community board has been involved with Bogardus triangle for going on 10 years now, right back to when it was when it was a viewing garden, we've been dealing with this for many years in fact decades. Why was it brought to us this late in the game? It was always. It was always on. We talked about having a sub-concessionaire ages ago and I do not think that was ever hidden and if you have a sub concessionary, you really you'll have to have like no one can come and do anything and sell anything without power without water right like. But what I do? It is important I mean in fact, friends of Bogardus garden, we're trying to finance purchasing this, because I'm not sure that DOT has enough money. So if we do not do this, we're going to be asking whatever potential sub concessionaire is interested to design and build and install something which will take longer, we'll have to go through various pro be approved. So from our perspective, this is sort of the simplest, cleanest, most effective way to get funding to maintain the plaza as quickly as possible, and the design is okay and it matches right like is it the most? Is it old feeling? No, it's modern, but it matches the bus stops. It matches the chairs, the benches that are around so like from our perspective. It works and it could be. You know, a vital source of funding for us. So there should not. You know, I get it. Everything has been really slow and then it feels like there's this cold water thrown in your face. Very like wait. A second there's, a kiosk right, I. Get that that's exactly right. Where is the clock that we spent agonizing months on the clock is being refurbished in Canada and it's going to be installed? This is also not part of DDC. Dot is going to help us install it. We have a guy who's, going to pick it up and bring it over and Ddot is going to help with the crane lifting it on and we're just waiting for some final paperwork from DOT and we're ready to go. It's been paid on this on this plan before the floor plan, which is up currently where varrick is on the West and chambers is on the south. Where will the clock be in relationship to the kiosk if it's killed on the southwest corner? Almost the corner of the bulb I do not know how to where the two little arrows are facing chambers up in the upper top left is that right we can send an image with where the clock is going to go because the base just arrived. The fact the base just arrived for it. It does not say this is my proposal, then thank you and I wish it's so hard for the board to participate. This way, it's just it's the nature of virtual meetings. I depend upon and rely upon. The committee to you know actively participate and they always do when I so I. Unless and until and I hope. The committee does respond. My thoughts are, as I said, complex, but I have to I have to boil it down and I want Jason to please chime in I, understand the need for the kiosk and I want the triangle to succeed if it ever gets, completed and I do not like the design and I do not like the signage. So I would suggest that we affirm the concept of the kiosk and the location is the only place that makes sense. Chamber street is too is too heavily trafficked and putting it anywhere inside the triangle would be crushing to the design. So this is. This is essentially on barrack on West Broadway, which is I, keep saying: varric I mean less broadway, which is as benign as it can get, but I think the stainless steel is extremely and I'm not saying it can't be stainless steel. But it's to me it's out of context to the triangle everything around it. It's an extremely defined landmark sub district between the building on reed and between Hudson and Varrick, West Broadway and the buildings on the east side, and so I wish the the empty. The White box concept can be revised a little more artfully and I think the 50 signage is over the top. If it's in the public park space, which this essentially is- and it's on, that very traffic corner I, do not think the screaming signage, which also has not been you have not specified a type typology or a system also needs to be re-reviewed, while at the same time wanting to support you, that's all I can say. Can you hear me yeah? Can you hear it? Okay, I mean I, do not want to speak only as a distant relative of bovardas himself, but I think bruce is right. We should just not have these applications that triple on with extra you know appendices to them every so on many years. Are we writing a resolution for this, because this is going to public hearing they're requesting a resolution in support of this concept? I do not know where it's going next. Where is this going after this application? Are we here for by law or just for kindness of your heart? So we will be presenting this to the landmarks committee. I would look to my colleague Nick, who is our landmarks liaison to confirm exactly what the role of the board is here yeah? So we are planning to present this to the landmarks Preservation commission, we're currently working with staff to review this location as well as a couple other in other landmark areas, because this is a city-wide prototype that has been approved by the Design Commission, and the agency's goal is to get approval for its use city-wide. So we are here obviously to solicit the board's feedback ahead of that ultimate public hearing at the commission. If you do not have a date for the hearing. Is that correct? We have not finalized what meeting date yet we're still working on that I want to propose something. Oh bruce can I just say something: I think if this is if this is. If this is a city-wide solution, then I think it's a simple resolution for us, which is we do not support a city-wide. You know prototype thing to plop down in our very beautiful plaza and I mean that's where I stand out. It's not. It's obviously, then not being thought about on on the ground. It's just some sort of thing, that's being plopped in it can work for everything and I do not think it works for everything. I agree. Thank you all right. So, let's close I think it's odd to for the Landmarks Committee of Committee Board, one which is specific to downtown Manhattan, to support a kiosk that was designed to be contextualized with the bus stop across the street and the a kiosk that will be I do not know on the upper West side or in Astoria all fine neighborhoods, but not ours. That's right, so I propose that we support friends of Bogardus triangle that we commend their effort to find a source of income to maintain the park. We urge pdc and DOT to complete this rapidly. We look, we can accede to a ps, but not this design bruce can I climb in yes, so you were around all as well. When this first came up, I mean there's a you know, like I said it was originally temporary when we believe we found, we knew that it was not going to be so there's a little bit of a history here of kind of last-minute changes, and the funding issue is also a problem is supposed to be self-sustaining. I understand from the people who live across the street in the winter, often that it is not shoveled and then it turns to ice and anything in the resolution. If we can talk about the kiosk not being of a permanent nature, as was agreed to eons ago. So I'd like to see that in the resolution please thank you well. I can note that it has been presented to us in the past as a temporary feature sounds good. I do not want to I. Do not want to pull that out. Yeah we rejected on that basis. No yeah honorable mention so we're on the record. Thank you. I also want to say to the committee, and I'm talking an awful lot and I'm sorry that this has been a mighty struggle for Victoria and friends. It's amazing what they have accomplished so far on this little spit of land when other parks are being ravaged by the way Victoria DDC said, the money has been committed, for instance, for the completion of the reconstruction of Wall Street, but they could not even guarantee that the money exists to complete the latest triangle under the current crunch, the budget crunch. So I'm just mentioning I'm sorry, that's so strange to me: it's not at all the messaging that I'm getting yeah, so I just described a complicated resolution that we will write endorsing Kiosk and endorsing the friend's desire to have a source of revenue to maintain bogartis Triangle. But we have. We have serious problems with the design and we will note that originally it was going to be a temporary kiosk. I want to tell the board that the committee that it's DOT and LPC, which are allied in some respects in terms of the mayor's office, so I, do not know how much suasion we have. Some of these deals are done deals, but nevertheless we have our position emily. How long have you been with D.O.T I helped paint some of the crisscross patterns back when Bogartis Plaza was green and gray so over a decade now, because I would like I would like your contact from Jennifer after the meeting as regards I also have to raise suspicions with D.O.T, whoever we were connected with for years working on the the reconstruction of Word, Street has disappeared and the subsequent points people know nothing about went before. The discontinuity is so disturbing. I do not know if it's happening with vocal artist triangle, but apparently not but I would like your contact from Jennifer is that is that, okay, I'm happy bruce I'll be able to you know, share the contacts of you know my colleagues, but really the Manhattan borough commissioner's office. So that's borough, commissioner Pinkar and his Deputy Jennifer Santinez, we're happy to you know, relay the questions and work to answer. Whatever you know outstanding issues the board will bring to us. I will take that offline, but I again, I would I would like how it is Jennifer to connect me with you just so we can. We can pursue what you just said through the channels. Okay, sure is that okay, so committee whoever's left, I've talked so much. Probably everyone's gone to sleep. Do you agree with a resolution? The resolution would be that we are approving for chaos. We, and we appreciate the friends of regardless wanting a source of revenue and I will go into what we object to in terms of the current design and I will add a I will let it whereas, regarding a you, know, footnote regarding the fact that we have been under the impression that this was temporary. I think you can completely agree with the chair. I do too Jennifer. Can you go around the table? Jennifer Sure and someone can call a vote. Someone else I can please I'll. Second, it someone please: okay, Bruce, yes, Name Jason, yes, Mark! Oh sorry, I'm going to abstain. Okay, Vicky! Yes, Susan! Yes, Elizabeth! Yes, Vera! Yes, Ciao! Yes, okay, so the motion passes. Okay, great! Thank you! Everyone, members of the committee, thank you so much for having us on have a good evening. Thank you. Thank you. I know. There's a budget, a budget on the agenda, but we did that two or three months ago. It's on the agenda. Again, if you know the committee still wants to have a discussion. You know if, since those two three months ago, if there's any new items, any new ideas that may come up to add to the to the budget request, did you? What was our discussion item? Were our items submitted? Well, that's usually something for the chairs of each committee to do I, I'm sure we did it, but if we did not I remember what the items were in terms of staffing in terms of enforcement in terms of the desire to have deeper further surveys in terms of responding to our request for additional district extensions and additional individual designations, those were those were the things that we had I thought that had been brought forth. Does the committee want to further opine? Is there anything I'm missing or I? Guess not so Jason are you there, I'm here? Yes, those four items I can go over with you and I'll write the resolution for book artist triangle. Yes, what do you want me to what to say one more time? What you'd like me to do, I'll? Do it yeah I'll? Do it offline, because the committee already okay, all right, we'll take it offline on yeah. Do we have any more attended items? I'm sorry go ahead. No okay, I want to apologize for the communication difficulties and I'm sorry that we did not have as much too many participation as we could have in reality or if I was not so audible impaired. But does anyone want to add anything that I've missed? Okay, then I, guess we'll say goodbye right? Yes, okay, thanks have a good day.
