good to go to say, thank you. okay welcome. everybody. my name is Justin coaching on the chair, the Battery Park City Committee, and today is November. 4th, and we're having our meeting. my Co chair is Kathy Gupta. we have Jeff might hop on the line. we have Betty K. we have Bob snack. Jeff Galloway Jeff my hop I did not say anybody. Judy Winestock. and I think that is our board, Robin's going to come on late and then thinking Sarah's coming, but she may be late too. so we'll just keep an eye out for her, but we want to get started. and, as everybody knows, I do not think we have a whole lot of people on the line that are not us, but we have a. Robert's rules, so the board, our era panelists will go 1st and ask questions and then we will look to the attendees. so, raise your hand when you want to say something, and I will try to pay attention and as a lucian is making a note to please sign in that would be great if you could do that. and I think we can get going. maybe we start with the seniors also, so, let me say. the order, so if you want to go to the, agenda please. all right, so we've got stuff shaking it up. now. Kathy had a really good idea and Patrick, I see you're on and I think you'll like it. you want to do every other month where you go 1st. or almost 1st, because we've got Mary and Robin presenting today about the seniors group, and she needs to get off Powell early. so I want to let her go. 1st, but then you're up. so, for the 1st time, in a long time, you get to go 1st and then we'll talk I'll talk with you and then we'll do just to give an order. so it'll be Marianne for the seniors. it'll be Patrick, it'll be the Gateway Plaza tenants discretion. then we'll go to next report, and at the end, we will talk about solution will give us a little bit of an update and information about 421 a, and for 21. G. all right. so go ahead with that. Marianne take it away. okay, I am Marianne. Barry Herman I have lived in gateway in, Battery Park city since the 1st day Gateway opened and. in recent years I become a member of the Steering committee. of the Battery Park City, seniors so 1st for everyone is enlightenment. i'd like to explain what battery Park city seniors even means. it is basically an email list. a list of people who are interested in knowing what's going on and from the perspective, I should say of a senior. so, we do not have rules about an age or a requirement. if you think you're a senior, you're welcome to join us. so, using the list, we. put out programs and activities for seniors and through that list and through attending. programs and activities, seniors develop relationships. the mission of the seniors Battery Park City seniors is to foster ongoing community engagements. by providing educational, social, healthful and recreational programs. and activities that support the independence, health and wellbeing of older adults. now, if any of you have seen our, our email newsletters that go out. we cover health talks. we connect people with fitness activities, and we've worked a lot on developing senior activities, fitness activities that will keep people moving physically and. not have to pay much if anything for them so that if anybody can feel free to join us and attend. we work with any agency and resource we learn about and can. get any help from so the Community board website and messages are very useful. our assembly member are state senator any information that comes our way. Margaret particularly has been a very big support over these years because she has a special focus on aging. and the Gateway Plaza tenants Association, and especially the battery Park City Authority since this is where we, most of the members of the committee lip, we do not restrict it based on geographic geography. people could live anywhere downtown and come join our programs, which is kind of the Spirit of Battery Park City and the parts you can join us no matter where you live on. as far as other programs and resources that are that are available to us, we will take information from a group called senior planet. that does a lot about educating seniors on using. the web and using computers, they also put out senior programming. a group called next door. and 1 of the key things that next door did this year. was that their members got online when Covid-19 began. and said we're young and healthy. we're working from home downtown here. does anyone need a delivery? does anyone need something picked up? they just there was an outpouring of that is that neighbor's email group? yeah, it is. it is. yeah. so, and, you know, again, it hits different neighborhoods with different topics, but it was clear right away that there were people who were ready, willing and able. to assist, there are also some senior programs, senior centers I'll call them, like house and Hudson guild and we will grab from their newsletters things that we think might be of interest to our people. now, to put all this together and related to Colvin when Covid-19 began. there are 5 members on the steering committee and. we were just gathering information pushing it out. we were sending we normally do a new 1 monthly newsletter. and then, maybe sort of something mid month to catch up on some new things we heard about we want to let people know we were sending out messaging every. every other day, you know, here, grocery stores that you can go in early and. just be among seniors and not among other people. so you have a little better opportunity to shop and stay safe. here are places to get free food. and if you need food delivered. there's a city program, you can sign up for. so some people financially can afford food, but they may not be capable of getting out there and getting food, bringing it home, cooking it for themselves. so, you know, something like meals on wheels is useful for people who might have an issue like that and need help. so, we were just pushing information out until we kind of, and I'll speak for myself. personally I was like, exhausted and I kind of said, I got to back off a little and give myself a little bit of a break on this. but by then most of the. things that people needed to know was out there. so. one point i'd like to make is that our funding where we are not a senior center. like centers exist, they have a physical space and people come to them and it's a very structured program. it's only volunteers who are running this and keeping this thing going. and we used to get a small amount of funding every year for Margaret Chin. I guess it's that extra money that some of the council members get that I can distribute throughout their district. well, it's never very clear to us any year. if we're getting the money, although we're invited to submit bills and get money back and so far. so good. a lot more concerned, and i'm sure other committee members are as well because of the status of money this year, and the city and the state. so we may be a little more hard up going forward because we paid for things like to have an art. arch person come in and do art lectures. and actually, the very last group activity we had before the shutdown was an art lecture. and literally the next day, everything stopped. and we were sort of like, was not it great we will at least had that lecture because, you know, you get a smattering of people who just listen and then they talk among themselves and it's that social opportunity. the seniors need. so, to get closer to a conclusion, we try to mediate as well as telling people what's going on. we try to mediate on local issues. so, as a quick example, there was a tie sheet class. 1, Friday morning when I have okayed of boats, came in. making a lot of noise disrupting the class and so, you know, I got involved in that to try to be sure not only that. I mean, it got resolved, but I also wanted to be sure people knew in the future. what can they do? I see your lips moving justine, but I can hear you. hey. should I be hearing Justin. and you're hearing me now, I do, I did for a 2nd. is there something I should do or? no, no. now you're back. i've heard you the whole time. good with me. i'm sorry. go ahead. i'm sorry. so, for example, I gather tons of information about the marina and activities that are permitted and not permitted and I put that out in the next newsletter. so that if people feel there's something happening, that's not right. this is who to call. 1st, and this is who to try 2nd and 3rd and so on. so, what we're trying to do is be a source of information. to seniors, I tell them periodically throughout the year. this is the security office number for Battery Park City Authority. so, Patrick, i'm always telling them that. they should put your number, not your personal number but the department's number in their phone. so, if they have an issue when their out doors, and they're worried or upset or something's happening, they can quickly call. and get through to 1 of the ambassadors in the office, who can, who can help them out outside. so i'm always looking for possibilities versus policies. like, here's the policy we do this. we do not do that. well, let's discuss possibilities and 1 of the things we're talking about now is transitioning sitting circles outside. during the nice weather, when seniors would sit out on a Friday or a Tuesday afternoon, little groups here and there, and keep everybody going and socialize, cause it's so important for people who live all alone. and as the weather's getting colder, how can we transition to something inside. so that people won't lose that they got through the worst of colvin in the beginning when started, it was new and everybody was in. and put spirits about it, then we had the chance to be outdoors more and I do not want that to just cut off now that it's getting colder. happily this week we're up in the sixties again. I think we can sit out on Friday, but we really want to move towards continuing this through the colder weather in a safe way. and that's probably what I have to say. that I need to say, so, if anybody has questions, ideas, we get a lot of we got a lot of input from the Gateway tenants Association during Cold it also to share things. so we're always looking for. resources and access that we can share among all the seniors. thank you, thank you so much for presenting that and giving us information Marianne and thank you for what you're doing for the seniors. during cobit, have you had any issues or had any? people who need help who we've not been able to help or is there anything that can be done? not that came forward to me. okay, there's always sort of a, a concern that there are people we're not reaching, but maybe they're just not our audience. that's possible and I do not know, I always invite people to reply to what we right. and there's very little response. will show up for things, so I do not always know how to gauge that. but, i'm not hearing any 1 say I need help and I can't get it. and other thing, I'll just break the about this. a little was that we put out a lot of information about doing the census and voting. and, we were able to find out that you could drop off and absentee ballot at 32 broadway. you did not have to go all the way to Barrack Street if you did not want to put it in the mail. and a couple of people did that. and they were pleasantly surprised because that had not been publicly put out. but we did have Justin. you were in on these emails, even with Miss Dodie. for the Election board, and so people could go very close by yes. in their ballot. and I personally did it for me and my husband so, and they were just lovely there. so, it helped people out to be able to have an easy way to close and not wait on those 4 or 5 hour lines because I was there. right I see that Sarah raised your hand. and. me can I ask a question. in your audio cut out I do not know why. type solution can you hear me? I hear you. cool. what timing to your outside groups quickly? beat. oh, the sitting circle that we do. yes, 230 in the afternoon. okay. and what kind into your gateway? I do not think there's a breeze, which is good to blow anything away. that's hanging around. and we've been doing that on that irregularly, Tuesday and Friday. are you if it's possible to do it in a. you know, everybody Maston, everybody separated. I know the gateway has a party room that's on use. do you want me to approach them about that? possibly yeah. okay. it's, it's in the gym. the gym is reopened. okay. there's also a room and back that clearly there are not going to be any parties in. right, right so i'm happy to approach them. on your business that's helpful. thank you. that'd be great to just test the test the waters there. yeah, it's it. it would not it should not be hard. the other is. there's a, a room and. the district, whatever they're calling it right now. okay. yeah. coach them. about maybe using that room just what you're doing. right. and also I will put out there that is looking at the community room. in 200 factor as a possibility as well. so, yeah, thanks, Sarah. yeah, so that's good to have options. yeah, thanks. did you get a reply from nick? you've got my email, right? yeah, I do I do. okay, is it 10 down. okay, and then Cathy, you go ahead. and my sound is going in and out by the way. so if you if i'm speaking, Karen, excuse me sure I have a few questions a sense of how many seniors are members of the group. well, we have just 250 people on the email list. sorry? 250 to 5. 0 t. yeah. wow. I know that they are not all actively reading the emails. so, at some point, we'll try to do some cleanup. that's what we have. what are the types of services or needs that were most commonly asked for, during the, the height of the crisis well, people do not and there's almost no one's saying I need this. I will that we just pushed out newsletters items, letting people know about having special senior hours anything that our elected officials were making available. we were, we were putting back out. our president has had a lot of information, but people do not typically reach out to us and say, I wish we would do this or that. 1, the dining club. I can't hear you Kathy. oh, sorry. i'm. along the lines of maybe people said I need somebody to go pick up our prescriptions for me, or there was 1 person who wants needed and this was not related to code but she needed someone. if you have certain medical procedures, they won't let you go home. unless somebody's there with you, and she'd asked if we could find somebody, which would have been doable. although it's not typically something we do, but then she, it worked out somehow. and so I will even say that there are people through. the people they've met at exercise classes, for example, who've. become friends and who now do these things for each other, which they may not have done. they may have been more alone about these things in the past. so that's been a positive move over to. question is always talking to me. I do not know. and most people have made the arrangements they need. it's not something we're concerned about. as we get out of Colvin, and we want to start to have maybe programming that may cost something, you know, we may need ideas for sources of funding. if the city pulls back on what they've been funneling through Margaret Chin, for example. but right now. you know, there's not something i'm asking for. there's nothing i'm asking for. i'm just sharing I'll let, you know, what happens more information and 1 last questions. anticipate any special needs around the holidays, especially since you can't be together with our families. right now but I told him I would love to have Thanksgiving dinner. or a holiday dinner year end. for seniors who are otherwise alone, but I do not think this is the year to start that. a lot of people have children who pick them up and take them to family gatherings but there definitely are people out there who, who do not have anyone to be with. and after covert, i'd like to find a way to make that happen. so, okay. this 1, quick question here, is there any way to any place? is there any way to obtain and in place to store or use. these heating labs that we see restaurants using a dime is something we've already talked about this, a place where we could designate a spa, or seniors can sit out together under some lamps with blankets and be together. you know, even chillier months, I do not know, I mean, it's possible that a restaurant like Miramar. there are 2 restaurants 1 beside the other, right? on the south cove. I do not know if. maybe if we brought our own heating lamps, if we're meeting at 230, that's not really meal time. they may be happy to let us sit outdoors with some empty tables and. we're in our own lamps and stay warm. all right you know, people are willing to wrap up as best. they can on just to have that the time together so yeah. that's that's, i'm glad you thought about a. another actual alternative, so, thank you, I was thinking more like a place where they can be store that is not a business that if there's any budget to buy a couple of them. and then, I do not know about that courtyard up near. gateway right or maybe right outside the center where we have our meetings occasionally across from Israel. or somewhere where they can be taken out assembled, and some chairs put up with some blankets and. some peters in place to sit. well, wait, battery Park City Authority does for, in that space in 200 director. and outside of that space, it's under, and under the coverage, the arcade, and we could have, because actually the authority has given us some storage space in there. so, yeah, senior stuff, you know, mostly related to eating and. so on, but we can run a line outdoors and to have some chairs outside that might be a way to stay outdoors. and sit and visit, or perhaps even use the community room in some small groups show. yeah, so that's in Nick's court at this point to see what's what we could do indoors. but outdoors is a great idea as well. thanks all right well, I do have to go guys cause it's off to the fields for a soccer game. I'll stay. all right. to me. okay, really quick and high resolution. we have to watch our microphones. some people have speakers on sound feedback loop. it's really horrible. i'm noticing that. Webex is rolled out a feature where if you're muted. you can hold down the microphone. it will temporarily temporarily. you, you. you can speak when you put your hand off the microphone, it'll renew you. that's the best way to do it and prevents. horrible horrible. some feedback I tried to hunt and close people's mikes down when i, when I hear it. but, so if you see your, you're muted, that's because there's some sort of sound issue coming from your microphone. when you're not speaking, so do not take offense. i'm doing it too many sound. that's it. and I'll. thank you Justin. okay. sorry. I was I had called in and I do not think anybody could hear me talking. I wanted to thank Marianne. Jeff Goodbye. but I think you're gone already. sorry I was actually talking. I do think Marianne that Jeff's idea is amazing, because I think being inside, i'm sorry outside is better than being inside. i'm going to be a fun meeting with me. not hearing, but anyway comes and goes to hearing anyway but thank you very much. next, I think if there's no other questions, I do not see any people are going to have to help me out with waving or something, because I do not see anything in any questions in the attendees. and that's it. I do not see anybody else. so thank you, Mary Ann and. there we go next, I think they will then jump to Patrick. are you there? oh, I am here thank you, Mary and for the, push with the telephone number for the security office. I appreciate that. okay, you're looking at October's numbers for 2019 and. 2020, Graffiti in 2019 we had 9 cases in 2020. we had 2. on lists in 2019 we had 21 reports. for 2020, it's at 14 lost and found property. we had 7 and 2019, and in 2020 we have 4. POC rolls in 2019. we had 58. in 2020 we had 69. a vendor solicitation solicitor. we had 24 and 2019 we have. 2 in 2020, dealing with dogs in 2019, we had 46. in 2020 we had 27 reports. so, that completes the report. all right, Patrick, so what I would like to do going forward is and i'd love the opportunity to jump in and i'd like to hear from you, but I talked to nick a little bit about it and then. yes, i'd like to get some my way of saying, because I want some substance behind the report. the numbers are good, but we can see comparison by looking at Nick's report, the last page of his report. so, when he does that, it's there, what I want to know is okay, so we had some. situations are homeless. I have questions about the homeless in our neighborhood. how do you get through the. ambassadors have, they made contact with them. do they know who they are? I mean, there was some pretty regular people who are around and I do not know that you can answer me today. so that's okay. but I want to give you an idea about the different things that i'm looking to see you talk about some other incidences where there's. gosh, it's like last, I think maybe this was for the last meeting, but whatever where there were people on a scaffold by Brookfield and the scaffolding fell, but thankfully the people were saved, that's of interest to say. okay. this happened. it was okay. the no, no glass fell no people on the ball fields were hurt if that was even a possibility stuff. and i'm making myself clear about what i'm looking for. oh, yeah, I mean, I can speak to the homeless in that. yes, we do know the regulars and so does department of homeless services and all them. remember this when you call them up and you give the description, they know who they are. okay. we know which ones are the aggressive ones. okay, and when a stranger comes. and we do see them, you know, most of them comply. so, when we asked them to sit up on the park bench, they'll sit up. those that do not stuck, get angry you know, we then are aware of them. you know, the thing to realize is that a lot of people think, okay, just call in 91111 is going to solve the issue. it really does not. the police Department itself, because I was. on the virtual meeting with the 1st precinct. the police Department had no longer has a homeless services unit. okay, that's gone. that does not exist. the way it's set up now is that actually, department of homeless services has to come out. 1St. and if they deem that the person needs to be removed, because of whatever condition. or if the person's seeking services or whatever, they are, the ones that have to make the determination and the other ones if. they say, oh, okay. this person is in. you know, going to cause more harm to themselves or somebody else. the other ones that make that determination, and then the police are caught. you know, really is a setback really to anybody in security. no. oh, wow. oh, interesting. okay. is a setback why? because departmental, homeless services you can turn around and report something to 3. 1 1. okay, and how long does it take them to come and actually see that individual by the time they get there that individual is already on their way moved. okay, because it takes some hours, I assume, or right I mean, that, it's not like calling the police who will show up. at the Max, I mean, the Max on the response time that we had with the police, the Max is 20 minutes. I mean, normally our response time with the 1st precinct. is around 10 minutes so okay you are talking about DHS show without maybe a day later. it's just crazy, I guess, which is fine for the people who are the regulars, but someone who's coming and going. it's not going to help, but I guess what i'm raising it for is because i'm trying to figure out ways to interact and help them and help them get housed. 1 thing. DHS told us in the quality of life committee was that it takes a lot of touches of from them to meet the people to make them feel comfortable feel safe to actually apply for housing. because once they go, the shelters are probably pretty horrible places. and i'm going to sneeze. i'm just wondering how we, as community. but your voice dropped out, just to let, you know. Justin, can you hear me you have voice dropped out? okay, but just to touch base, like, there's a, there's a younger person that's over on south end. yeah. okay guys sleep sleeping back. okay. we all know we all know him he's been called. Department of Homeless services was cool on 9. 1 was called. why them by the community and that stuff and, you know. it's if he does not want to go, he does not go, you know what i'm saying? and he's cool. he's cooperative and actually, you know, I want identify the stories, but there's 1 or 2 stores where he goes in and he cleans up. the store, or does all our jobs form sometimes it does deliveries form and that stuff. just, I do not know if he's doing it for food or for money, but obviously. he's existing. okay. and. to say that, let me let me throw this out to, you. when was the last time anybody saw department or homeless services vehicle. in Battery Park City never, but that's me. okay. but it's the same thing. I mean, we used to see them every once in a while. driving around now, we do not see him at all. that's let's be honest. does that mean that would be my but I also am not always out, but yeah, that would be. my reality is never, I see Bob Snack raised his hand for a long time then Sarah cell and then Cora from offices in the chat. I will go to Bob then Sarah then Cora. okay. okay, go ahead. okay, I am I on. here on Bob, so my simple question is i've often things are happening in Battery Park City. for example, we had this major repaving out here. on on, west and south of here and during those things came up. all of a sudden. I did not know that. they were going to come up. then. there was there was a time. when many of the entry ways to Wagner park were kind of blocked off and when these things happen, I would ask the ambassadors. well, what's going on. you know, what is it do you know, and so my suggestion is, it would be good for the ambassadors to be briefed on various happenings. in the area, so they can actually tell us. oh, that's because governor Promos coming or that's because we are going to have a this road is closed because we're repaving. it. it, it turned out that. no, 1, that I spoke to as an ambassador in any case. when there was something going on in the community, actually had any perspective on it, or had been briefed about what it was, what it had to do with the community. how long it would last how big it was just a suggestion. okay, I appreciate I appreciate the suggestion. thanks. bye. Sop I'll jump in there for a 2nd, this is an export knowing. how are you? wow. the thing about the, the incident with the paving understood absolutely. that's run by the Department of Transportation. we did not necessarily have a heads up there either, but I think it came in, like, on a Saturday, Justin, or someone had emailed me and we were able to pull up in short order from the website that they had their paving and billing schedule. so, we can take that back as well and continue to the agencies and they're giving a heads up about this stuff. but that was not something that we had planned. or that we're doing, thank you nick, right? that was that yeah, we do not pay streets. we would not even pay the streets. that would be a city matter. but all the same, we can always do better with doing our trying to get the communication and updates out there. so, thanks for the note. and just for the record, it was pretty horrifying nighttime noise for the people living on that side of the building, at least in 200. but, and another question is, why are they doing this when the authority is planning to? we do everything. on the streets, you know, I know at some point it's going to get done, but, you know, West Temp Street is on the list of. changes even if we're complaining about it, but it's kind of crazy and waste of money, is not it to do the milling now? oh, I mean, I would not want to comment. because this is probably on a annual or semi annual, or, I do not know, by annual basis. I do not know. I do not know what it is, but. no, I do not know I do not think it's I do not think we're close enough to get into the part to the start of the South and Avenue modeling. that would. 1, prevent them from paving the road, especially and be aware. right now they should be aware of that it's going to happen. I mean, for sure, sure. so, yes, because, I mean, they're, they're worried about their taxes and spending money and I can think of a lot of ways to do that anyway, that's all done Sarah unless Bob, if you're if you're done, then Sarah goes. I just have a just an extra question because Patrick has so much experience with handling behavioral problems. I often pass homeless people, and every, once in a while, some of them are threatening. and dangerous, this has not happened as much in battery, the battery Park city segments, but as I go farther north into Hudson River park, every once in a while that'd be someone who's actually a little bit on the aggressive side or all the time. there are people asking for money and all the time there are people to feel sorry for it and I really do not have enough social behaviors to know what to do with them. i'd really like to do something helpful and i've never found that doing a 3 1, 1 or trying to get involved with someone. from homeless surfaces ever did any good. so the question. to Patrick and his wide experience with handling these guys. is what is the right kind of behavior? or if you around children, what should you tell children about them? or should children be afraid of them or how there's a whole social world of interaction that. i'd really like some education in well, I well, Bob, I mean, I write the trains. and the trains to follow them, so as somebody I see somebody starting to approach me agents, raise my hand. up like a stop sign and they know they just stay away. okay, you can help everybody as an individual. yeah, i'm going to say that so, you know, I know I have my charities. i'm sure you have, you had charities that you donate to and that's what I do. I mean, there's actually people in my community work in soup kitchens to volunteer at petition Kitchens and stuff like that. so. you know, it's what we're seeing actually, even within Battery Park City, we know we know the ones that. you know, or not. violent at least when we approach him. well, what we do have seen is that they're more aggressive right now and that's and that's pretty much. you know, all over well, over the city that you see. I mean, Penn station is for them to be honest, and, you know. like that they walk up to everybody and I find my, my best thing is, as you see them approaching, because. you know, who's going to walk up to you, he just put up your hands, like a stop sign and you know what? they just walk away. you know, that was is what works for me. I hope that helps you somewhat. well, thank you. no, Patrick, Sarah, thank you. Bob. sorry, you're up. okay. i'm wondering since the Radisson Hotel is going to become a shelter. why can't the people that you already know about? we already know about. our homeless are in our community are participating in our community. why can't we get them a priority? housing at Radisson Hotel is that something we can work on? is that something that, you know, obviously we've, we've got Patrick and we've got nick, and I think that they probably know exactly who everybody is and. you know, and quite a few of us have actually chatted with this lovely young man who sleeps in the sleeping bag and yeah. however, he should be a priority for the Radisson Hotel and he can still keep his, you know. yes, no, it seems doable. I do not know how to contribute to that, but it seems like we as a group. could help with that. did you attend that? she'd be 1 emergency meeting dealing with the. I only got to see part of it. okay, because there was a department of homeless services individual speaking about it and what they were doing with moving residents from the upper west side down to their really it's. you know, we would love to say, okay, here. here you go, but it's really their job. they, they have to. go and do it I mean, i'm on the security level. when you go into it, you mean, the homeless people have to go into it. no, no homeless services test has to come out and they're the ones that have to set this up for them. they are the ones that have to meet these individuals and set it up in person. okay, do we have a local department of Homeless Services group or team, or a person. not that i'm aware of not that i'm aware of right Sarah, this solution. so i, I can address a couple of the questions and comments. i've gone so far regarding homelessness and CD 1. the answer your question is yes, the quality of committee is. i'm thinking through ways to create opportunities for. homes individuals who do reside and our district. it is something that's been identified and it's, it's a priority. it's been made clear to the department of Homeless services. and it's possible that some amount of capacity could be opened up 9 the Radisson Hotel. but in a different hotel for people who. except shelter services in our district, it's something that we're tracking and we love to see. how that develops, that it is certainly something that, the board is working on. also, in terms of the, the effectiveness of client 3, 1, 1. you know, the pipeline to. getting services and getting off the street. is it's made possible by allowing. those who provide the services and the outreach to know where people are. almost some homeless people stay in 1 spot. and they're easy to find and some people move, and the more often than not homeless people are known to department homeless services. and they're rediscovered when they do move and they emerge in a different spot in city. so, when you call 3, 1, it may not have immediate effect question. we've always loved it for it to have immediate impact and the van to arrive and people to get out and the person to go into Van and get some warmth into food and sleep. but. it does allow the city to know where people are. and when an outreach is available, they send them they, they offer services and people eventually, you know, in a way, they do take them. and, you know, the fact that there, there's the shelter expansion. is a testament to that? I believe so. I would say that the lower Manhattan in Battery Park City. are they considering a shelter? no, not in battery Park city, but. but I have not, I do not know. they've come to 1, and they asked us to help them find a place for permanent shoulder, but certainly. they're doing that supposedly all across the city because there is a need for more capacity because. it's a right to shelter city so anyone who. wishes to have shelter has the right to get that shelter in our city. so. the city's closed down types of shelter that were. substandard cluster sites and in previous to coban, 19, they were shutting down hotels because hotels are. are not as good as, some of the other shelters, but. given social distancing needs, they've gone back to that, but. back to my original point is that, I would encourage everyone to keep calling through in 1. when they identify someone who's in need, and a lot of the city to engage to, to find out where people are sometimes they're, you know, they're finding people that they had a good conversation going. and then this is a way for them to pick up because they were probably Harlem before or the bronx, or in Queens and they've traveled. listen, what i'm hearing is there is no department. team for areas correct so so, and lauren had the outreach team to say this is daughter down lower Manhattan. Goddard is not for profit organization that does. does contracted to do homeless outreach it's like that nonprofit. so it's not a contract contract. it goes to the city does not you know, for a lot of agencies. do not hire up to every person though. they'll have a big contract and then allow the nonprofit to do it. and makes procurement easier. and staffing easier. so, but goddard is the organization that does the outreach for dhs, but there are certainly our DHS teams that go out as well. it's, it's a mix. so, but we do have a contact from it. let's leave urban Justin. you've met her a 1 m times? yes, I have. and. no, go ahead because I think that she was she was trying to take some accountability, but I think there's a difference between who's there and paying attention and the outreach directly, but a couple of things I want to say that Sarah grace points that you're raising Tammy has actually brought this up in her big meeting asking to have and I think also the borough president has said we want to take care of the people who are on the streets in our neighborhood right now to place them. and I think the dilemma that I heard back from, when we were on that call, and was on the call, who was a homeless man at lucerne, he said that when the people would come in 1 of the dilemma's of. people who are on the street is that yes. DHS wants them to come into their system be interviewed, go through this whole process, but you do not know where you're going to go. it's not like you can say. okay, i'd like to stay in this neighborhood. I mean, I suppose 1 school of thought might be, you're homeless, take anything yet, but it's dehumanizing to have that. and I think we could do better than that. anyhow. i'm sorry, I interrupted you done. that has a job down here that he does. and a network, he should be allowed. to stay in the area if the Radisson Hotel opens, he should have the priority. I agree, it's not our calls it's not Pat's call Patrick's call either, but it's not our call, but I agree with you. all right, I know I said Cora was next so can we get mute? please. and that's the illusion has to unmute her. she's in the chat. clicking on mute so maybe she. got it thank you for your patients. Cora. can I on video myself to? no. it's not that I want to hide, but I think you. I do not think I have the option to turn on the video either. you know, my voice, it's me, Corey here, I want to make a response to what Justin. talk about earlier it does take a long time for homeless case worker to build trust with the homeless person. and according to the DHS team, it takes about an average of 267 interaction. with the individual for them to accept the case worker to work with them. I remember the number 267 when I1St heard of. when I1St heard of it that they have 267 calls I missed what you said was pause. they actually the homeless outreach team. I have a lot of admiration for them. they actually know the people, like Patrick said, they actually go out there when we're sleeping in the middle of the night they were out there. they were all there so the reason I remember the number is. it's not 67. it's not. 26 is 267 and it makes sense because I do not know. you, it took me a long time to know Justin and everybody and it took me like, 2 years, keep coming back and attending the meeting. and I thought people would remember me. but, no, I thought so. and they do not see them all the time. so why would they trust you? so, this is the experience that the homeless outreach team share with us right? then as to Patrick's comments. I also attend the 1st pleasing committee unsold monthly meeting regularly. and, yes, the mit, the homeless outreach team was eliminated soon after the budget. after June, right? but the way I understand it is that according to the commanding officer captain and the Community Affairs unit, Brian Nelson, whom you met at the last quality of life meeting if someone called 9, 1, 1 or 311, it's not that like the pd. they're not looking after them. they will still handle the situation. they will still take the call because if the call goes to the 1st, pleasing the police officers will still handle the situation and to the beach ask homeless Outreach team arrives. right? so you ask the question. how can the community port help? when I observed over time is that. residents often get to better understand the work and the role of the P. D. after they attended a committee council meeting, why? because the offices and the commanding officer actually explained very well what their role is, what their work is, why they can or can not do certain things. and a lot of times. when I managed to get the residence, like, please come and now with zoom meeting is much easier that. they raise their concerns and they question, they banged the offices like, why they really angry and get upset. but. that's the beginning of the dialogue, and I find a very, very helpful because then they get a chance to hear directly from the offices. and that gets a better understanding. so I would imagine. if your committee or. the, community board can actually embrace this more and how to help spread the message. how every time you have a meeting, and you remind people, hey, this is a committee council meeting or this is another meeting another meeting. so, at least people can talk not 1 way. it has to be 2 ways like. when we had that reticent hotel conversation. is everything is screen you can't really hear from the people, the voice and then the outside can really see those messages. versus the meeting, the 1st round, it was really nasty. the people are re, upset when they have the upper West side meeting. but you get a sense of, like, where people are. and 2 way, communications is the best way. so if there's any way you can host small conversation with dialogue like Brian Nelson, the officer now, she's in charge of the community affairs together with Tommy Moran. so, I think it's a very good start and to keep. keep encouraging the residence in the CB 1 area to come because people are really angry with the homeless, but there are a lot of stories. aspects and perspective, they do not get to see. and I would like to see more of that if we can do it better. thank you totally. i'm not angry with the homeless. I want to help them, but yes, there are people who are angry and you're correct. unfortunately, quality of life is the place where that conversation goes, but we have asked and multiple people have asked to have a separate. it may not it does it a separate. task force or sub maybe or something underneath quality of life. so we can focus on these issues because they're so important. they should be discussed once a month. they should be out there. people should be able to have access to the answers to their questions. and it's just very, very concerning all the way around. so I think that makes sense and it's not the place for it here, but just makes sense. the reason I said, the angry people, but I noticed that every time after they attended the Community Council meeting, because they bought that direct dialogue and they actually hear from the offices what the challenges are. they are less angry and upset and there's always 1 or 2. they said, wow, thank you. so much. you saying the officer? well, yeah, no, definitely. the officers deserve to be thanked for their service because they're doing something for us and they're putting themselves in the line. but there's also a balance that has to be struck, but anyhow, I also, I see that. raised your hand. no, thank you. Cora i'd also in the chat. Cora had some ideas for the senior group, which maybe. you could either share directly with Marianne or maybe lucian can share it with Mary and so she has that. I see Betty can use raise your hand Sarah. i'm thinking you're not still raising your hand. but I also see in the attendees and Betty, if I can ask Amy. in the attendees to go 1st or I guess, I can't I got that got to do the board. 1St so Betty your 1st and then Amy. go ahead, I think Corpus speaking, because it's kind of an entree into what I want to say, as someone who has 1 been on the quality of life committee for a number of years. that's where I started. but also worked in the healthcare field for my whole career. I want to point out a whole nother perspective that. everybody who really wants to go help. i'm going to think of help from a different perspective. it is very condescending when people come to you and tell you what help you need. I get it because of disability and people telling me what I should do to make my life better. same thing with the homeless, if they wanted to get off the street. and we're ready to accept assistance. I would not assume the social workers are all incompetent. or that the, the police are all incompetent. it's maybe the person just is not ready for whatever reason. there are lots of them when you say it takes up to 200 visits before they decide to do something there are groups we're trying to reunite homeless with family members. feeling. that's the key. ingredient is. you're missing that link. they also acknowledge it is a small percent. well, for many visits that are success stories for them. so, they're all missing pieces, but 1 thing I always taught my students. do not make somebody else's problems. yours they're not yours you have? no right. to think that you have a decision making capacity, you have no right to be that condescending. back off, and I wish people would consider that the 1 of your help is nothing. when it's offered, it may be offered with very good intentions. it's heard very differently than a help. that's more you're telling me what to do because. what i'm doing must be wrong and i'm sure that's not what you mean, but consider that perspective too. that's all, thank you for sharing that. I appreciate that Amy in the chat, and then Taylor banding and the chat on any 1st, and then. you go, thank you. and I feel terrible because i, this is a very passionate and important conversation. and but I just want to circle back to Patrick Murphy and the allied ambassadors. because I definitely. nothing but compassion for the homeless, but there is in terms of the neighborhood and the ambassador's role. my question is. homeless people are homeless. people have mentally mental health issues are a different story. so, my question is because I have witnessed some unfortunate incidents in the neighborhood. I just would like to know about the training. or what support the Alan ambassadors have. in order to help them cope with when they run into a situation so that they are helping them. the residents when there were, and there have been several occasions, and there are going to continue to be. people who are mental health issues it's different passing through. or just within the neighborhood, and I just wondered what training they have because, and I forget my ignorance. Patrick. I just do not know what the. ambassadors have to go through in order to form their jobs. and i'm concerned for them as well. hello? well. you know, they, they go through a constant training actually with us, it's a desktop training, and it's done through a program which we call E. and there's so many courses that will pop up during the course of a month. and they'll sit down at the at the computer and go through. basically, you know, a lot of you to stuff tends to be common sense. at least. from what I see when they, when they go to approach a homeless person, they're not waking them up. they're not walking over, you know, like the old time cop with a nice steak, tapping them on the foot saying, you have to get up. you know, they're busy talking to them from a distance. this is what I have told them and train them to do. to work from a distance, you know, when you talk from a distance, you can tell whether or not. somebody's going to be responsive, whether they going to be respond to in a positive way, or a negative way. okay. if the person jumps up, they know stepping back. they also reach out in that case and call the supervisor. the supervisor will show up with another supervisor also responding and another safety ambassador responded from another area. and to or to the individual from a distance. okay, we're talking about a POC that's open to everybody. does not close to 1 o'clock in the morning, which is to ask him to sit up in the bench instead of sleeping on the bench. okay, most of them then we back off. when you back off and they see that they, they think they 1, whatever. you know, take it up and they relocate they'll move on. I would say about 95 to 7 of them, get up and they leave the park. okay, there's another few that will leave what say down at wagner park and walk up to rose to Rockefeller Park. and they'll go lay down in the bench there and then the same thing happens up there. but as far as training as well, he's constant training going. and dealing with them on the bicycles, we do that training every year, even though they've been trained what say, the year before we go through it again. okay. obviously, I have. instilled in the safety ambassadors, you know, we have a, do not touch policy. okay, so, you know, unless you're an. that has peace officers status. okay. you're not touching anybody. all right, so. thankfully, so far that method has worked. how we've been successful with it, you know, obviously we, you know, everybody I think now in the community is aware of the homeless person. how walks through battery park screaming at the top of his lungs. right. he has a regular path that he walks. he walks our path almost every day. okay, it's in the park, he goes through the park a certain area and then he exits to park. take as long as you leave him alone, nobody really. you know, if you just leave him alone, he walks by keeps on going and every, once in a while, he'll jump out and start screaming for no reason and keeps on going. I mean, you know, it, comes down to a while after a while as. you know, I can't help the cop jargon because I was 1. you know, it's knowing everybody on your post it's when it comes down. so when you when, you know, you post. you know, the people that go there and, you know, those, that. you know, act certain ways I hope that answers your question. yes, it does. I will just tell you from personal experience. that's why I was asking. I had to help an ambassador once with my son. because she was very distraught because a. mentally unstable person I gather I do not know. was apparently bothering her I did not see the beginning or the end, but I know that. I intervened to tell her where she was, because she. could not tell her, she was trying to call for help, but she could not. figure out the street name, and I was totally fine. I was not threatened by the individual that. was she felt threatened by but I did worry about her safety. because it's not her neighborhood, so she does not know where she is. and while, ideally, I would like to think she can protect my children when they're out on the street or myself. at the moment i'm looking at a young woman who was. clearly distraught and did not have the. the cut the compass internally to know exactly where she was to call for help. so, that's what my question was based on mostly just. for their own safety, what do they go through. you know, because any of us can walk down the street and have somebody. approach me, and I will feel intimidated as a woman on the subway or whatever. I do not have the right answers. I do my best. but in a professional capacity, I would just hope that they are. comfortable and protected for themselves and i'm sure it was a 1 off incident. Patrick so i'm not i'm not making this and i'm to saying. it was disconcerting for me to see this young woman. I understand I believe that was like, what over almost 2 years ago now. yes, no, no. okay, regardless of those 2 years ago or 6 months ago is it's all right. I know your masters are walking the streets for our neighborhood and for our residents. and they have certain risks as well and I respect that contrary to what you may believe. I do respect that and. I think it's, I do not go out late at night anymore as I used to for nightly walk, because I do not feel safe. your ambassadors are out there and I would just that was my question. what did they go through and what are they equipped with for their own. safety as well, as the rest of us, that's it. okay, thank you for that. you, I appreciate it. thank you. thank you. Amy. yeah, Patrick, she raises a point. that's interesting. and maybe it's something for you to think about because it would be good for the people to know they are and, you know, that's kind of scary. and being worried about the people is. kind of scary. like I said is has their hands up next, but i'm not sure if you took a down. hi, good evening. this is Taylor banner. I took it down. I guess I was going to share something I just personal, but. that I think, I guess I'll share it. yeah go ahead. I. I was house. and it took support from community family and elected officials and financial aid from. the government to survive to survive that period of time. so. i'm just saying that, you know, I think. it's a similar effort required to make sure all new yorkers have a home. community medical professionals and elected officials. together with empathy and compassion, thank you. thank you for sharing that taylor I appreciate it any more questions. I do not think so. I do not see any other questions. so then, perhaps, do you are done Patrick? thank you. I am sorry that you were on the spot for a half hour longer, but I found this to be much more robust conversation about what's going on in our neighborhood. and i'd love to do this, and I would love to make do you the favor also of having you go earlier in the night so you do not have to i'd love you to say all the meetings. but so you do not have to always wait till the end. well, thank you for that and i'd just like to add 1 more thing. do not forget about the in ceos. okay, cause, you know, each, each area in Battery Park City. you have 2 ceos assigned. okay I know what everything going on right now. they may not be around this week because of, the elections and what they've been assigned, but. they do cover the neighborhoods they do call people back. they do call me back when I send them something. so please keep that in mind. no, I appreciate that. Patrick, thank you. and we are really glad for the that are here and we appreciate what ally does I. I think we are lucky to have them. thank you. i'm serious. I am. I think that it's, yeah, that's probably be said on this call, but I feel I feel safer. with you all there than not because. yes, I think that i'm thankful for you leave it at that and keep my politics out of it just in it's next word do not thank you for that by the way and thanks pat occurs to me now, as we're sitting here this evening, it's just about 5 years or so ago now that we 1st began the engagement with Allied I believe it was 1215. and it's really been a good. it's, it's been a really good and productive partnership. and a lot of that. a lot of that is credit to pat for being here and with the community and here every month in and out with me building that trust and making sure that the community knows that if you're working. thank you for that 1 thing that came up also, and certainly agreed that we can maybe try to get some more context to when Pat's giving his reports about goings on the neighborhood, which the conversations usually evolve into anyway things like emergency or seemingly kind of existence circumstances like the window cleaners that got kind of pin to the side of the building a few weeks ago. absolutely. things like that. I think we spoke about that, but those are also. those are also things that in real time you're likely getting an email from me. like, I think, I probably sent something out to you that morning after conversing with pat saying, hey, heads up as the CB 1 chair you and Tammy this is happening. so, those are things that certainly when it's at that level of potential emergency, you're going to be hearing from us in real time. we're not going to just hold out until them until the meeting. but then also that the meeting certainly will always read. yeah. and let, you know, we've learned in the interim. thank you nip I appreciate that because yes, I appreciate the real time information, but I also think it's important for the. the committee to hear what's going on in the neighborhood, and the people who call in. so, and eventually when we all have meetings in 1 place, they all show up. so thank you, Nick. i'm pushing you pushing you next after. the Gateway Plaza talk, please, it's okay. i'm here. i'm here for the duration. you know that I think I know you're very kinds. okay, Jeff Galloway, you are up so okay. and thank you again. thank you. so, i'm going to report on to the agenda is a little bit. misleading there are actually 2 developments at gateway that I'll be reporting on. 1 is the rent stabilization agreement and the other is class action settlement and Sir. distinct issues, but they both have recent developments. as many of, you know, because I know some of you are, in fact, gateway residents, we now have an extension of what we call the rent stabilization agreement at Gateway agreement and let me just give a little bit of background. so, you can understand the context of the new agreement gateway was originally built with Mitchell Lama Financing. it's the only thing in battery park city that's part of the original master plan, which called for affordable housing among other things in Battery Park City. and though, although gateway was built with subsidized funding. when it originally opened, it opened as a market rate, a complex. and that was back in 1982. the tenant's association with formed almost immediately after the building opened, or the complex opened. and arguing that because of the. Mitchell Alma Funding and so forth. the complex should be rent regulated. association sued various people, including the authority as well as the landlord in order to seek to have the complex stabilize that lawsuit was settled in the mid eighties. and as a result of the settlement of that lawsuit. the 1St agreement was entered into, that was part of the settlement of the was. the original agreement had a 10 year term. it provided that all tenants that gateway, all residents of gateway. we're entitled to renewal leases of 1, 2 or 3 years. and that the rental increases would be governed by what was whatever the then current stabilization guidelines worked. it was not technically rent stabilized. it was a private agreement. the agreement, so the 1st agreement was 10 years. it was repeatedly extended, over. the course of history as a result in negotiations by the authority, acting for the tenants as well as for itself. and the landlord, the left for our organization. generally, speaking, the, the agreement was extended in exchange for benefits the landlord sock from the authority, or from the state. those were the days when Sheldon silver was our assembly person and speaker of the assembly, and certain things that the landlord desired had to be signed off on by the speaker. and so we were successful in getting the agreement extended repeatedly until 2009 in 2009. it was extended again, but for the 1st time through these similar negotiations, but for the 1st time, the protections were limited. to the people, the residents who were then current residents, as opposed to all present and future residents. so the 2009 agreement covered everybody that was in gateway as of June of 2009, and it had an expiration date of this past June 2020. in July of this year of 2020, a new agreement was reached between the authority and left retroactive to July. 1St and that agreement was long in coming a huge number of people. expended a tremendous amount of effort to bring that agreement to fruition. not only any number of the people. at the authority, including Jones. Eric Months and Nick, as well as well, as all of our elected officials. Borough President congressmen, Adler. Control Stringer Center, cabinet, assembly member, you a new and Council member Margaret General, all involved, as was the community board a year ago, the Community Board Pastor resolution, and support of concluding these negotiations in a manner that would extend the protections. so, the agreement, as I said was entered into in July of this past year, it's not a perfect agreement, but it was a result of long negotiations. and, and certainly. the authority believes and we have no reason to. to disagree that it was the best agreement that could be achieved to protect the tenants its basic terms. art continues to protect the same set of tenants that were protected before those people that were in residence as of 2009. instead of the rent stabilization guidelines as the metric for. rent increases, it's a fixed percentage of 2 and a half percent for 1 year leases and 3.78% for 2 year leases which if you do the math, the 2 are equivalent to 1 another economically. at least for the 1st, 2 years. it was retroactive to July 1st, so that it would cover everyone. and, but it was contingent on Hud, approving the agreement. and that's because HUD ensures the mortgage for a gateway. and under the terms of that mortgage, it has the right to approve. certain things which in the agreement falls under that. we were notified by both, probably Nick, but certainly the authority as well as Congress but. about a week, and a half ago, the HUD has now approved the agreement and the tenant's association has. inquiries outstanding 2. to left for our organization of how they will effectuate, the. the retroactivity, protections, the agreement extends for another 10 years, the protections until June 32030. because of a non disclosure agreement between the authority and refractor in the course of the negotiations. we're not currently privy to the full terms, either of the agreement itself for that matter as well as the, the. benefits or combinations that were made. to the landlord, but those are presumably all public documents, which will be available for anyone who cares to see them, including all of us in the not too distant future. we can see from public filings. that among other things, the landlord had secure an additional. 5 years on its ground lease, running to 2045, with the ability to have extensions to 2069, it previously had the ability to have those extensions to 2069 but the. now, current ground lease, instead of expired in 2040, it will expire and. 2045, and that's pretty much the extent of the publicly available knowledge right now is in terms on what's on file with the city registers office. and, ah, let's see, what else? I just want to say that, you know, it was, as I mentioned a moment ago, kind of long hold to get to where we are. there are a lot of things that we wanted to achieve that we were not able to achieve, but we did, we were able to achieve. continued protection of the tenants that were currently protected and we think that's something that will be beneficial to the community. because these people by their very nature have been long time residents of the community. they have to have lived here since 2009 and many of them have lived here much longer than that. and they form an important part of the fabric of the community. I'll go on to the class action in a minute, but why do not I just pause for. comments or questions on the agreement. that's a good idea. lucian. if you're there, Robin is in the chat, but attendee list. could you move her over? please? and then thank you anybody have any questions. I think Robin had she was texting me on the side. Robin may have something to say, but, I mean, with you. but you're fading out justine can hear you. still, I was just going to add on to what Jeff said thanks Jeff for doing this for us. did not the agreement and as Nick knows and others so we're very anxious to see the signed. which we have not been privy to and it's, a little bit ridiculous that we have not and we're hoping that, the authority, or somebody in the lower Frack organization will provide that to us. it will. the basis for leases and and, the provisions for the next 10 years. as of July 1st of this sphere. so that's all I wanted to say. thanks, Robin and sorry my, sound keeps going in and out and maybe doing it seems like i've got it now for the moment. Jeff, I guess it'd be Rob with anybody else. so. you will we, we're aware that they sign the deal. so that's good. you have not seen it yet questions I have is what's happened in the interim so a lot of people signed leases. after June is that 1? that was the deal ended this yeah, it's i, I can try to describe that. it's it's, I know i'm kind of echoing her hopefully I do not sound echoes to everybody else. it's kind of a confusing situation. tenants who not surprisingly, every month, there is a set of tenants who sleazes expires since people have moved in pretty much at different times of the year. so people that were previously covered by the Expire agreement. if their leases. expired after June 30. so, for example, their lease expired July 31st. they were offered renewals. at Non Q. R. S rights. because of the class action that I'll talk about in a minute. those increases were limited to five percent for for a year and seven point something or other percent for two years. but, you know, twice the increases that were allowable under the agreement. so, people whose leases expired. end of July end of August and September end of October. all had renewal offers. at those rates. people whose leases a expired. November thirtieth or December 31st. were given renewal offers at the actual 2 and a half percent. right. i, I think the management people finally realized that it was more trouble than it was morris to retroactively change. everybody's lease. after HUD approved it, because there was never any real doubt that would approved the agreement. that they eventually started offering. leases that we're conforming to the terms of the Qrs agreement, but none the less there's a significant chunk of tenets out there who have leases. who signed lease renewals at the wrong rates. beginning, I do not know, maybe about a month ago. management started sending out. amendments to those leases to those tenants that had been. given the, the 5% increases and these amendments knock their rents back down to 2 and a half. as far as we know, we, we do not know. how many people were sent those renewal forms, nor do we know. how, management has dealt with the rent that was. overpaid so to speak, we've thanks to the good work of Margaret Chin and Gail Brewer. we now have a new sort of communication route as attendance Association. with the organization, and we've had a very constructive. zoom type meeting as well as some constructive email exchanges following that. and by constructive, I do not necessarily need to agree with everything. sometimes it's just that they politely say no to things that we ask for. but they do at least respond to our inquiries and reasonably timely manner. and so through that line of communication, we have asked. for an explanation of how this retroactivity will be implemented for those people who signed and paid. increase them out, so we do not have a response yet, but we hope to get 1. I do not know, Robin, you want to add anything to that. you're on mute I would add is once we know we'll circulate that information to the tenants because people were paying for the 3 or 4 months. the 5% increase rather than the 2 and a half percent. which is the, the increased amount in the agreement so their old. money for the amounts that they paid. and we're hopeful that the Frank will actually refund that money in some way to those people because. in this economy there we have a lot of people who are. you know, in a difficult situation so, yeah, we're hopeful, but we're waiting for. a reply from people, other questions comments. I can go on to the class action okay, Justin, where you're trying to say something through your audio? yeah, my not. so you may speak you guys back again I guess I might. I mean, it's a quick question before and nevermind audio back, which was what happens to the people who are not part of the Qc group. what are their increases? just anything just anything although. I mean, there are blessings and lots of different disguises, but. as a result of cobit, the market rents, in fact, are not showing up and some people have been successful and actually at the market people, some of them have been successful. and even getting reductions at renewal. oh, yes. but, but many. are seen, are reporting to us that they're getting no increase no increase, so same some reduction. thank you. okay, so yeah talk about the class action. that makes sense. thank you. okay, so the class section is, an entirely distinct. situation from the Qrs agreement, they're not related to 1 another at all nor is the class section really related to the tenant's association in a meaningful way. and I guess I should have noted, although I am on this committee and a member of the Community Board. i'm also the secretary of the tenant's association and member the board. Robin's Vp of Tenant Association and, and Sarah is also a member of the board of the association. so, the class action is a lawsuit that was brought back in 2014. independently of the tenant's association by some tenants that were not formally or even informally affiliated with the board, the subject matter of the lawsuit. was basically the high electricity bills that tenancy gateway. pay, and they used to be even higher because the walls are poorly insulated. the windows were 1982, vintage windows, also poorly insulated and very leaky and the heat in Gateway is electric. it's these wall units that we all pay for out of our electrical bill and to add insult to injury. we pay that electricity to. they sub a submeter, the electricity and so we pay our electricity. to the same people that we pay our rent to so the high electric bills, the poor insulation, the poor windows has been a subject of complaint for many, many years at gateway. and in late 2013 in early 2014, there were parallel efforts to deal with that situation. 10 association was working with elected officials and with the Community Board and in particular, then Senator Squadron as well as council member. Chin were very much involved in those discussions. and as a result of those discussions. the landlord agreed to replace all of the units. I forgot what p tech stands for, but it's the unit to the air conditioner, and they hear replace them all with more energy, efficient units and to replace all of the windows and. and that was done, although it took a while to get it done, but it was done over succeeding years. while those negotiations were going on, this lawsuit was filed essentially asking for the same thing. but since by the time, the lawsuit got anywhere, and it, it's sad commentary on the New York court system, this lawsuit long torture. it's history. as I said, it started in 2014, and we're now talking about the settlement here 6 years later in 2020. by the time, the lawsuit was really advancing very far. it really became a lawsuit over the overpaid electrical charges prior to these renovations at gateway, as opposed to seeking. you know, changes because it changes were happening independently of the lawsuit in any event a year ago almost exactly a year ago. in October of 2019. Left Rack and the class plaintiffs. reach the settlement of a lawsuit, because it is a class action required court approvals where, as well as various notice requirements, and the ability of class members to opt out and so forth. the agreement was approved by the court. in March of this year 2020. in order to obtain benefits under the class action. class members, which are basically anyone who has lived in gateway since April of 2008. the magic to that date is that 6 years before the start of the lawsuit and statute limitations for 6 years. so, class members tenants needed to follow a claim form by April of this last year. the main the main terms of the settlement. the term that affects anybody in their day to day life is a 10 m dollar settlement fund that was set up of which. about 3.4 M dollars goes to the to the lawyers. leaving maybe it's 3.6 m dollars down someplace. no 3.4 m going to the, the lawyer is leaving about 6.6 to be distributed to the tenants. the, the form of that distribution. former tenants will get a check. current tenants will get a credit on their rent bill. the amount that you get. is a function of how long you lived a gateway since 2008? as well, as what your rent was, and during the time that you lived there. it's impossible to tell how much these dollars and cents will be. ahead of time, because it depends on how many people submitted claim forms because it's a 6.6 m dollar fund that's going to be distributed. and so how that gets divvied up depends on how many people are. asking for it, however, the, there is information in the claim and the settlement notice. that gives you kind of a rough idea of what at least the class action. lawyers think the amount will be pertinent. and for current tenants who were looking at rent credits. if you've lived in gateway since 2008. you can expect probably anywhere from 1 to 2 to maybe even 3 months rent credit. i'm pretty right. once again, that's it, it could be substantially different than that, including. substantially less than that, depending upon. how many people submit claim forms. but, you know, it could it could be a month, at least for, for many tenants. and so that in these Covid-19 times, that's important. what are those benefits going to be distributed? well, under the settlement agreement, the settlement agreement becomes final when the time to appeal. the court approval of the settlement expires that's normally 30 days. after the approval order under New York. court rules, as I said, it was approved in March. so normally, in the time to appeal would have been expense expired in April. Covid-19 however conspired to create problems. 1st of all closer is in the courthouse. meant that the judgement itself, which is what you appeal from. it's based on the court order, did not actually get entered until August, rather than in March. and then, meanwhile, governor Cuomo and issue various executive orders, extending all deadlines in the court system pending. the net result is that all of those deadlines. or the most recent executive order, the deadline extension expired today actually. so, so with any kind of luck. people should start seeing their credits and then not too distant future. so that's 1 of the questions that we asked. to the left people in this new line of communication that I mentioned before. and on the class action lawyers website, there's some similar information. the website says. benefits should go out in December. what the left. communications people told us is that the rent credits should show up on our January. rent bill, we've asked for clarification. is that the rent is that the bill for the January rent? or is that the bill that we receive in January for the February rent? and we do not have that clarification yet, but whatever it is, it could not come soon enough given these Covid-19 times. yeah, that's amazing. that's right. so in any event, that's what we expect. that's time in the, unless there's another executive order out there further, extending these deadlines. I mean, there's been a monthly executive order, extending these deadlines, but the most recent 1 that was entered in October. the language in the executive order, suggested that this extension was the last 1. and so, and i'm not aware of any further extension of having been issued. and so that that's actually really cool. now, what happens it goes back. so people who were living in gateway up until, as of 2008, January beginning, April of 2008, 6 years before the start of the lawsuit and how much they get. so they're no longer advocate way. they'll get a check, right? and that check them out will be dependent on. yeah, rent rent, they paid in the yet for however long they were at gateway and what outreach is being done to get people who've moved out already. well, that was the responsibility of the class action lawyers and, they presumably. got a list of the last contact information from the landlord and. you know, everybody was in multiple different ways, sent notices of it. I mean, we I mean, I know a number of. x Gateway residents who did indeed get those notices. you're on Mute again Justine. hear you. I think if you're mute and unmute, it comes back. now you are 30 or I am again. okay. i'm going to say, thank you so much. Cathy has her hand raised so, let's go to Kathy. sure, 1st, thank you, Jeff and the attendance is phenomenal. amount of work. you've done. the, I guess my question is, I think you're aware that last month there was an unusual situation where. quite a lot of the tenants got legal letters thinking about being perhaps late on their rent when, in fact they were not or. not paying additional charges that were suddenly on the rent bills and. you know, you almost had the feeling that all these agreements for reached and now let's try and. Harass the tenants out I mean, what, what was your take on that? yeah, you know, it's hard. that is something that we have raised with people in this line of communication and I can't say that we got our satisfactory response. it was polite in response, but not necessarily a satisfactory and substance response appears that what the landlord is doing is that they've computerized their rent collection. system in a way that any body. who was not paid rent by the 2nd or 3rd of the month. automatically gets 1 of these threatening letters. even though, under our leases you have until the 10th to pay them the rent without. penalty, we in our communications with the left correct people have explained that this seems counterproductive to everything. and common sense, because presumably they're paying these people to send out these letters, which come out by the way by certified mail as well as on your door. and, you know, it's just crazy. we have not received a satisfactory. response as to what anybody's mindset is in doing that. and it seems crazy in these pandemic times. I have no explanation to give other than what you've seen. Cathy lots probably half the building, got those letters. I mean, it was, it was crazy. it's crazy. that is crazy. yep. yeah. that makes that makes no sense whatsoever at all. and I go forward, but I can say, thank you to Jeff and end to end to Robin. I was just going to say that on the board, got those notices also. so there was a special selection. that's so funny. well, they're a little crazy cause you're right. that costs money, it's stupid. it's stupid on that part is to wait until the 10th, at least, and then send it out because. yeah, that's anyway, but even do, but anything else am I missing anything? no, I mean, that's all the report i've got. I do not know. there may be other questions. speak up, because i'm not seeing any hands, but if anybody wants to speak up, say something but thank you. I think that is very helpful. I see no questions. so i'm going to go on to the next thing, which is next for down. you are up with your report. now, i'm keeping you to 10 minutes. i'm sure it's still early to get on. I know. I know but you've got 10 minutes and then going to talk to us and we might actually be able to get off this call at a decent hour for a change. all right. I want to go through it, and I think I can probably keep paper to close to 10 minutes there. Lucian do you want to queue up the, the report if you'd be so kind good, man. okay well, good evening everyone. with again, on the end of a long, long week so far, but we'll keep our fingers crossed for good news still. running through this briefly, as we have been leading off. every report with since April. is our, corporate update this is pulled, essentially from the New York state's web site, we just want to make sure that folks are keeping. up with the latest, the information about the pandemic, which we are incredibly inside, they still not out of. you've seen the signs again.

I put it in here again as well. it's a. it's quite voluminous, so i'd encourage you all to take a look at it. I know. just an illusion. we'll talk about actually doing a more formal presentation to the committee on this. we want to thank you again for all the community, and put that into planning. this was 1 of the last public sessions we had right before the pandemic as it were, we had 1st presented this back to the committee. I believe last November or December were in the process of putting it together. so thank you for that. and we'll be back to you with some more information and feedback as we begin executing on this very ambitious plan to try to make battery Park city, carpet, neutral. by the middle of the century Battery Park city, blood drives continue. this has been a huge success. I spoke with Marianne about this earlier today. and to now, kind of teased it last month, but the next battery Park city, blood drive is going to be a solution that's at the. go down to page 6 there and next battery Park City blood drive is going to be Tuesday, November 17th to ever terrace. it's run by our partners at the New York Blood Center. thank you as always to them. this is good again. like I said, going to be our 5th session. since, since we've kind of been engaged in this pandemic, we've done, we did 2 in June 1 of July 1. got nearly 350 donations in that time. thanks again to everyone who participated, especially all our battery park city residents and partners, and folks who are coming from across downtown. to participate, and especially to the battery proxy seniors. I know. and for index, and especially Laura key to getting this. this idea started, so thanks to them. Battery Park City, resiliency project updates. what i'm wondering is certainly was a. the, we, we did a report at. lmc our quarterly update session at the environment to Protection Committee meeting in October. that was the night with the full team from in the mayor's office of Sustainability that report. I do not actually have yet from the mayor's office. so, when I do, i'm actually going to link it into my report here. and this report itself is, of course, posted on our site, but I had updates on all of our projects to make it a point to take down each of these as we go. each month on the battery Park City and community center at the last 1 they're on that page as a note. this is actually going to be something that will become in no resolution. I'll be reaching out to you on this and Diana. probably, the Good News on the battery Park City Ball field is that we are very close to be a being able to knock on wood begin construction on those ball fields as you'll recall, we have some temporary flood protection measures there in the form of muscle walls. that will sustain us through the end of. storm season, which is the end of this month with any luck. we'd like to have the interim solution built and constructed out by time. next storm season is next, August or so in the interim. we are in the process of working through the revokable consent with the. city transportation in small business services for small strip of land. of the bulk feels that technically is on sitting land. it's kind of a perfunctory, but, we want to make sure that we're going through the process with the city and the Community board with. that's the application when it comes through nothing new than what you've already seen in terms of the designs, but that'll be coming your way shortly. okay. wildlife census we've done we keep that in every month strategic plan. the same. neighborhood police, and we've mentioned as part of the security report obviously I want to take a moment here on the census 2020. solution that's at the bottom of page 8. thanks everyone and battery Park City, especially for the great work in getting your senses. forms filled out as we know the final deadline was Friday the 16th you received that blast email from me, obviously, in the days leading up to that we were really pleased and honored to work with Community Board 1, leadership and the local Census bureau officials to really try a pound the pavement and get. those census forms filled out and pleased to report that the final New York City self response rate was up to nearly 62%. against this New York state rate of 64%. pretty good. what's especially notable as we see at the bottom there is that the Census Bureau itself was only projecting about a 58% response rate by. by New York City, and we were able to identify the hard work. a lot of people. I know that by Julie met and some other folks around the community. and city to get that up well, and we'll in excess of that and importantly. more than some other major, large american cities I have listed out a few there so we had a higher better percentage rate response than cargo. Orlando, Dallas, Boston, Houston. Philadelphia, Miami, and the work to name a few. and I have some additional reading there if you'd like to to, read up there. security updates we did. thank you again, pat and everyone here for the updates, lost the contact information and comp posting. board meeting schedule we have 2 left for the year and we mentioned this very briefly before. I think Corey mentioned it, but the 1st Precinct Community Council meetings are very helpful for those who attend as we know. and I announced last month, they have gone virtual now in the age of covert, at least for the foreseeable future. confirmed with the police department today that tentatively speaking, at least the next. Community Council meeting should be Thursday, December. 3Rd, they aim to do these things the last thursday of every month. roughly. the last 1 being October 2009th, but since November is the month with Thanksgiving, it looks like it now may be but, 1st precinct very good about tweeting these things out. I will send you that I think, as well. I think Justin, you've been attending some of them as well, but they're, it's really a nice opportunity to get some time with the commanding officer of the precinct and it's essentially an open forum for folks to bring up any concerns they may have regarding public safety. concerns in the community, including I know. homelessness is a is a big issue. traffic's always a big issue, et cetera. so that's it. I was able to go through that. I think. sure. thank you. everyone. and i'm happy to be with you here. all right all good. you can hear me maybe I seem a little light spiking up. thank you so much. I appreciate your report. anybody have any questions about anything. I feel like alice blank in the, in the Resiliency Committee. really does follow up very well with the, what's going on with resiliency and what's even what's going on with battery Park city so just reiterating a lot of things that she says make sure there's always going to be some sort of contact and continuation with the speed whatever's going on the edges to make sure, well, let's say what you're doing and. that's kind of it anything else would be to reiterate with what Tammy said, or has said in the past. about, silence. just in your. can you hear us. oh, it's back. sorry maybe. maybe it's back. it's okay. yeah i'm can hear you. yes, if you. I am yep, I can hear you guys now i'm just going to stop because my computer may or may not keep going. so I will, thank you. and if nobody has any questions, or if you have any questions, speak up, do not wait for me to call on, you. I see no questions. I see no questions from the attendees. Barbara Island has a question, can we call her and, let her speak or hey, Barbara. I thought we were going to talk about for 21, 8. affordable housing next, I think, right? Tim yeah. that is next. exactly that is. oh, you can't hear me but that is next. yes. yes, if you can hear me now. yes, Barbara, we are talking about that. now if we're done with nick, we can move on to Lucian, talking about for 21 a, and affordable housing and let's go to there. can you take it and I will hopefully be able to hear everybody. alright, everybody a copy of an interesting time. I am halfway through a diaper change from my son. so why do not you finish that? yeah, can you give me a 1 minute because i'm going to get ball bags all over the drive better? yes. and then I'll finish the finish the diaper change? yes. so, funny. all right thank you. this, this worked I hope that Patrick was happy to go. 1st, and I think this went well, does anybody have anything to add in about anything that's been going on so far? I think not so while lucian is changing diapers the reason for having the 421 8 for 2001 g, affordability discussion is to kind of give us all a bit of information and knowledge about what these, what these laws are. what we can expect going forward from them, if anything and as they are all now, starting to come to explorations what we can do, because I would, I think it's, it's for a resolution or whatever else that's going to be done in the quality of life committee not our committee. it's not just battery park City. this is the whole all of New York, but. I think we have to do better. I think our elected officials have to do better in framing laws. the fact that they would the fact of the of the. affordability protections been expiring. puts a cap on how long people can live in their homes. and I think that is just wrong. and I think that we really need to come together. as all community boards and start realizing that we can not make. our homes subject. to such huge increases or whatever. and even if, you know, it's coming, sometimes you can't make changes. so I think we need to do better with our the way our laws are written, but we can't do better until we understand what they are. so, i'm hoping. what perfect timing there you go. i'm hoping it's ready, because i've got nothing else to say. that's great. great segue. hi, everyone i'm lucian. i'm the district manager CB 1. i'm not. I am not a, by any stretch, housing expert. I have worked in housing. I was once an urban planner for the Manhattan, borough president and, you know, there was a, that was. when a, fortunately, when a is going to be renewed, and so there's quite a bit of conversation around it then. so I picked up a lot of background. you'll have to excuse the baby in the background. that's nico so the 401 a program is it's incentive program for developers. that who build multi family housing on land that's fake it predominantly bacon or under utilized. it's chiefly a way to help. projects pencil out, which is a industry term for. creating a development that is a profitable development. i'm hearing developers, describe it and this is this is not. particularly when my perspective, but just to give you a perspective from that side and that, that's usually the, the difference between condos and rentals is is. if for 4000 when they can be applied to a project and, and I think that it definitely there's a need to really explore the, the mechanics of it and how it how it gets worked to the performance for buildings. but. the important thing that we know about for 20 minute, is that. you know, since the seventies, when it was 1st, put into the New York state, tax, tax provisions, which is part 421 a, is that, later on, it took on affordable housing requirements, and those of morphed, as time goes on. so, different buildings, which have for 2008 components to it do not necessarily have the same. restrictions and protections of their affordable units, or the, the same requirements for the provision of affordable units on site. so the, the best example would be x tells a 157. i'm a super tall building that really cause the last conversation around. what buildings in Manhattan's core ought to provide to people when there's a tax abatement that's supplied for 15 to 25 years. and, and I believe 157 was kind of give it a special right into the, the 4, 2001 a, at the time, which did not, which made it so it was not required to provide affordable housing. on site, which is a real it's a real miss for providing housing in Manhattan. so. in looking backwards for 2008 protections and provisions it is a different story than looking forwards because the programs can be seen to be so different as time goes on. so, that's kind of a very. general Overview, but it is related to for 2001. G. I mean, these are all types of of, tax incentives. for the development of housing, it can be compared to 1. but the details and really the nitty gritty of it, it's something that. we would have to bring in a affordable housing expert to really get into that. but I hope this is enough to start a conversation on the committee level about 420. solution thank you. I apologize that. i've been moving around and shaking my computer because i'm trying to find. constant signal, which means I missed half of your. explanation but thankfully, you told me a little bit in the beginning. i'd love though, and hear from questions from our board. anybody has anything to say plus Barbara Ireland wanted to hear about this. so i'm wondering if she has any questions, particularly to ask. I do, so I would tell me which buildings in Battery Park City. as for 2001 a, or g, and I also am I hearing from the solaire that they're going co op. Nick, can you speak to that? can you hear me? yes, Nick can you speak to that or give us some information? I know I had spoken to V. J. about it. and he said that he was aware of all the buildings that were for 2001 a. he has all the deadlines in Park City that. hello. no, go ahead. I also believe that. the bylaws of the land lease in Battery Park city does not allow a co op to exist. okay. I apologize I had the family issue. I'll step in since we can't hear just the. which buildings in Battery Park city are poor 21. 421 8 and G. and I understand from directly. from Albany's that is going co op, which I understand is against the policy. of the by laws. fortunately, when a, and G. I do not know, I do not have I do not have it on me. now. I know battery Park City. we have a number 4, 2001 a. buildings I do not have a breakout right in front of me now about what's for 2001 a, and g but I can get that back. my understanding about. restrictions are on condo conversions. not necessarily co, op conversions. which was their tricky way of dealing with it and jumping this. is this a loophole. I think it's a loophole. go ahead. i'm sorry. wait. we do not have a provision in Battery Park city authorities, land, lease. to have a conversion to co op. I understand it's against the by laws. is that correct? Nick or not? correct? I look again I do not sitting here right now. I would be out of my depth if I were going to try to comment with any, within the degree of. okay, I can follow up. can you get back to her? sure, I can. if you guys can all hear me I can follow up about the. a solar visa the proposed. co op conversion I understand. it's not the 1st. that other buildings are going to go co up. okay, I'll check and say, I do not know, I do not have it in front of me, but I can confirm I can check feel. okay, so i, of course, missed everything and i'm still missing. oh, here we go, I missed everything which is fine. I was going to ask will I have the chance to ask that? you come back and report next month? Nick. number 1, let us know if the co op is possible or not possible. because I think it is a loophole that they were kind of creative. I think the better Proximity authority said no condos not thinking that they would try to go co op. so, i'd love to know what if anything can be done to prevent that. and what conversations that you can share are happening right now, because I think the people who live there would like to know step 1 and step 2. i'd love to and accounting of the 421. a g, whatever the hell, it is the affordable housing in Battery Park City. so that we can have a focus on it and then eventually this is going to go to the quality of life committee because this is really more their bandwidth. but, it's definitely have a vested interest in preserving affordable housing in Battery Park City and. the 1st step is getting that information. so so, Barbara, thank you. for bringing it up. yeah. I do not know if we can wait until next month though. they're actively telling all new leases. that they're going co op and close in the lobby for renovations and converting units. oh, wow. and how many units are empty now. well, what you can all like to know. yeah, you do not know. okay. wow. okay, Nick, you get back to me. next week. sure, would that be helpful? I mean, this, so we can at least see what we can do because the quality of life committee is not, you know, this month. the 3rd, I guess Thursday or something, I have to look it up, but it's not next week. it's the week after I think it's the 17th 11. okay. 18 baby. whatever date is okay, 13. yeah. Justin. silence. just speak up, just to go ahead. I did not I did not mean to interrupt Robin. I just was watching my hand up for a while. I just wanted to. yeah, I like to make some that is the Tom Good Kind. it has a. and it's been for some time with his wife, taking it over and it's never really gotten anywhere. but I know that there were some completed lists of all of the different kinds of affordable units that are around. and that should be. the Community Board should take the responsibility. of unearthing those things in the other thing that I think is important for us to work with is the answer to the question. with the, with the kind of with the kind of new financial stress stresses and possible homelessness, do we have any record? or is there any institution that's trying to figure out? how many people there are in battery park city that might be under financial dressed and might be facing anything like eviction or. extreme stresses and can we, as a community board find ways to work. to find out who those people are, and to help work with them even if it's just to make. just to make referrals for them, so we can help them along. or maybe is in the position to kind of help with that kind of. a heavy lifting 2 good points to very good points. 1 thing, I want to say to answer the 1st, 1, I was asking who was responsible within the quality of life committee for doing the housing subcommittee or whatever. and I was told by Tammy that it's actually pat more. it's not jill if Pat was in charge so i'm going to be pushing pat and lucian remind me to do that to push pat to see what we can do. yes, I think i, I think that I think that the person who had the information and was supposed to go forward with was Jill and obviously, I think i've watched that Pat Moore has become more responsible for it. but even in any case, the problems are. current and desperate, I think, and so it's really important to make the make an initiative and make it a priority. it is, and I think you were saying by reading your lips. I think you were saying that Jill has the list. she probably does because Tom had the list. so that would be a good thing, but let's talk offline because this is not going to well, Robin, did you want to say something? I said that I said that yeah. said that, Robin did you want to say something. yes, thank you. I just wanted to say something about the layer. this is the 1st, i'm hearing about it. I do not know what's in the ground lease in terms of the creation of coal, but it's certainly not something that. I would say long term residents, or probably the people who created the groundless anticipated correct remember that solar was built as the 1st, green residential building and it was built as a 9 through 10 as I recall. the idea that it would become a co op sort of flies in the face of, I think, what many of us are hoping for, within the neighborhood you get a question for you, presumably, any kind of conversion requires the approval of the Battery Park City Authority Board. has that been discussed at the board at this point? yeah, so I do not. think this is a conversation. I know that Tammy and I have had and yes, cause I know we do not believe that co op conversions require approval of the authority. conduct I thought any changes in. I thought any change in composition like a. rentals so a condo conversion does and we have made it abundantly clear. we are not approving any condo conversions in Battery Park City co ops unstructured as I understand that. I am again far from an expert here, but our structure differently. I do not believe it requires approval, but I will again come back. yeah, so justine, I guess your life committee with what with what understanding more complete that's a better way of putting it right? I would have to say that it's alarming. it's very and if there's not a requirement, there should be. and if there's not a requirement attention to be paid to this, and this should be. in the community and beyond, because we are trying to protect the very small amount of affordable housing there is and preserve the community. and this is. my opinion not a good way to do that. so. Robin, you are correct this is that the 1st time that i'm hearing about the co op. possibility and I know Tammy has raised it and spoken with Bj about it and we need to follow up. so, Nick, i'm going to hold you to come up to some at least. so, we can have a conversation about it at the quality of life committee. it makes them set up a conversion. I mean, it's wearing that's been issued or. can hear you. hello. I can hear you nick. okay. I'll. bye bye. I wanted to jump in for a 2nd, since we have a pause and just say that I think it might be possible that battery Park City has a list of affordable housing. and that it would be good if Nick could research that and get back to us on whether that's the case or not. and whether or not, they can help work with us to updated. and also to find out what new problems and challenges we might have coming up. yes, I think that would be a really great idea and I think we've asked for that or 21. yes. you can come back with that. that's a separate issue. so, layer issue, which is something we want to do in the interim. yes, exactly. it's 2 different things. I think that the 421 a list can wait. at least tell the quality of life committee. or our next meeting, but, the solaris is more urgent. we need to jump on that. and I have to tell you that if nobody has more questions. I think I am done trying to keep this going when I can't hear anything and that's not anybody's fault. but mine but does anybody have anything to add or questions? I do not see any of the attendees. I do not see any on the board. so I would say. if nobody has anything to say, we can call this meeting closed. can we do that? that's good. 2nd, all right. are we good? very good. very good. all right. thank you. all for being here. I do not know. I do not know that I will have been hearing me, but I appreciate it. and I really do Nick. i'm going to hold you to following up with me. in the next week or so. and I appreciate everybody. no. just so layer went crazy about conversions either. clearly that's not a part of what we're trying to do, which is to try to preserve and where we can expand affordability. so, i'm with you, it's part of our strategic approach and I'll be back to you for sure. so we can discuss it if need be at the quality of life. okay, justine with the with the, the audio. if you want me to, if you want to cut the recording, you use your hands on. good. yeah, I think it's assigned to close up because I got nothing here. I think time. to turn up the thing, turn off. I think we're all good.
