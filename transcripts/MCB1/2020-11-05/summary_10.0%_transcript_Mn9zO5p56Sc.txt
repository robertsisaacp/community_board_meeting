They seem to know they have agreed with us in terms of the canopy, but they added a concern about the amount of glass on Lake.
There were three equal wooden conditions and the doors be the glass became narrower, but they agreed with you at the Landmarks Preservation committee that the canopy needed work.
What was left with the Landmarks Preservation Committee is that I'm supposed to work with LPC staff, right.
Okay, that's in other words, you're, saying that the my explanation was wrong in that in regard to the glass and its presentation is that I do not quite understand where we, where the committee, our it's, the Landmarks Preservation commission, where the landmarks and preservation committee are not quite sure where our committee stands in regard to the process.
I thought captain was just courteously presenting, but the new proposals, without making a resolution in any case, Jason, is right.
I'm, going to investigate with landmarks of what, whether they want it sloping or not.
So it's already going to dump rain into the sidewalk, but it won't be coming off at a fast pace and if it's sloping downward in any kind of dramatic way.
Usually, this, usually the canopies that slope down go all the way to the edge of the sidewalk, so they're shutting rain onto the onto the street.
And this even causes the street to be even more narrow because you have competing canopies facing each other and and it's going to cause a dangerous situation for a cat for a truck to maneuver in between both of these canopies and the truck heights are higher than the canopies, the box trucks and those kind of things I'm not talking about 18 wheelers.
So at least, we can get a resolution on a review of it from a DOT perspective or something like that, because they might not be aware unless you know it's a complaint driven from a landmarks, effective they're, just looking at it.
But if we can relate to another committee that can tackle specifically the the real problem, an issue in danger with having compel canopies facing each other for the most part.
He was not at the last meeting, but he had mentioned that, and you know I've been in that building many times, and it is true that there's a very difficult passageway for pedestrians as it is because trucks have no choice but to pull up to onto the curb in order to navigate at which point the park can not get down the street anyway.
How high is the bottom of the canopy right now and look in revision from the sidewalk.
Do not think it's right and mark the canopy.
This edition committee say no one's objecting go ahead, so I just want to say catherine without a doubt, knowing the building code.
I do not want to pronounce it wrong, regardless plaza statement, support for Pdc approved Kiosk.
Artist, Plaza statement of support for pdc, approved Kiosk.
I'm Jennifer something as dot's Manhattan deputy borough, commissioner and I, wanted to thank Community Board, one Bruce Jason and all of the members of the landmarks and preservation committee for having us on tonight.
We're here tonight to present on our standard Plaza kiosk design for Bogardus plaza.
And we're slated to present our proposal to the Landmarks Preservation commission for LPC approval in the coming weeks.
Should that be the case, and so, with that I'm going to hand it off to emily, who will be sharing her screen and running through our presentation before we do it if, in the event that we write a resolution, I just want to be clear that we are talking about the plaza that never gets completed between reed and rather the beginning of what was Hudson street and West Broadway at Reed and chambers.
You, know pedestrian Plaza for this Kiosk location, but Nick or emily may be able to add a little bit more color to your question about Triangle versus Plaza.
I also want to acknowledge that we're joined by Victoria, Weil friends of Bogardus plaza our maintenance partner for this evening.
This allows for food kiosks, markets, things like that which bring vitality and life and positive use to all public spaces, but also it's an important mechanism for the maintenance of our public spaces and by allowing this kind of public RFP process for a food, concession or other type of business.
We found over that past many years to create a standard kiosk that really fits into the streetscape of New York City and having a standard really creates both a kind of reliable street furniture element, but also something that really streamlines the approval and recruit process for all of our maintenance partners and really reduces the cost for our partners, certainly based on location and need.
What we're here present to you tonight is our standard design that has gone through pdc and will be going through LPC.
I'm, going to start with the Kiosk design, principles.
What, was working in public space and came up with a kind of standard design that met a lot of the kind of food service and retail requirements for a space.
The real goal and kind of concept of the kiosk is that you know our plazas are 360 degree spaces people enter and walk past them and through them really at all.
There are very few plazas with a back side, and so we really worked to design a kiosk that could be accessible and certainly visually pleasing from all directions, and that was also kind of paired.
We really saw it as an opportunity to create additional lighting and think of the kiosk as a lantern at night to provide you know additional space and kind of public safety.
Another really important component is thinking about the signage and the branding, and so part of the Kiosk design is kind of a set of guidelines about where signage can go very set to be.
Let's go to the proposed Location Bulgaria's plaza, which you probably know all very well on West Broadway.
These are some photos of what is under active construction, we're hoping we just had a call with our sister agency, the Department of design and construction, on an update, today, they're, hoping to finish the majority of the work by early November fingers crossed as well reported if I may interrupt it at the last quality of life meeting they said spring, so that was two weeks ago.
I do not know how something is substantially or unsubstantially completed when it comes to a plaza in a month.
Here you see West Broadway, the kind of main north-south connection past the plaza, the location that we're proposing for the kiosk is really along.
That, like I, feel your pain, I live right over the plaza.
I do not know if you know how these things work in general, but generally a sub concessionaire is the person who built designs and builds the kiosks for DOT.
This has not happened yet that there's been a standard kiosk and because we are landmarked and because Pdc approved this design, it would make a lot more sense for us and for future sub-concessionaires.
They want to know when the RFP is released, and so that was good to hear, especially now in this weird pandemic time, a small space that is based sort of outside is appealing to people.
That I agree with what we said: earlier: okay, Mark, okay, just reiterate for me to remind the kiosk, is now going to be a permanent structure.
So if I remember way back when when this was a temporary thing or something like that, I thought there was not going to be any permanent structures on the on the triangle.
So it's something that that the infrastructure was planned and put in the plaza in terms of electrical connections, but this kiosk effort is new and also separate, and apart from the DDC design, project.
So, if this was in the hopper evolving for a long time and the Community board has been involved with Bogardus triangle for going on 10 years, now, right back to when it was when it was a viewing.
Okay, I mean I, do not want to speak only as a distant relative of bovardas himself, but I think bruce is right.
I, think it's odd to for the Landmarks Committee of Committee Board, one which is specific to downtown Manhattan, to support a kiosk that was designed to be contextualized with the bus stop across the street and the a kiosk that will be.
You know, like I, said it was originally temporary when we believe we found.
We have serious problems with the design, and we will note that originally it was going to be a temporary kiosk.
I want to tell the board that the committee that it's DOT and LPC, which are allied in some respects in terms of the mayor's office, so I, do not know how much suasion we have.
We, and we appreciate the friends of regardless wanting a source of revenue and I will go into what we object to in terms of the current design.
If you know the committee still wants to have a discussion.
