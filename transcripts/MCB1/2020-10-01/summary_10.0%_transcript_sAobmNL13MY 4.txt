I want to thank everybody who has come and recognized Manhattan borough, president gail Brewer, because you do represent all our community boards.
I think you have heard me say over and over again that at the beginning of July 27th and the following time in board seven, there were a lot of issues when, without any notification same thing, the folks were moved from a hotel on 51st street up to the 79th street hotel Lucerne, and there were a lot of issues.
I will tell you that project renewal has made great strides with excellent services in the hotel, etc, and guess what, as you have heard, as members of community board, one and the reason that I am upset, is they got a riverside community center, a settlement, house?
Taking out those who perhaps should not be in a hotel to start with, and the population is down , it's stable, the men know the neighborhood and here's an offer that nobody provides.
From, my perspective, for the city, to let that mind just disappear and say sorry , we're not interested we're going to move, and so that's why I'm opposed to it, and I appreciate very much the fact that this discussion is taking place, but I just want people downtown to know.
This particular group of men from this particular facility at the Lucerne on the upper west side to the location that they are proposing without prior notice on wall street and william.
You know sympathy for these men and the work that we want to do to stable, to help them stabilize themselves, and you know, get into permanent housing and live their lives and also be very skeptical of what the city is proposing, particularly here.
We should have a longer-term conversation about what is going to happen with that radisson site and what is best for this community, including as tammy meltzer mentioned the many people who are already homeless and already living in our communities.
Lot of effort was made to make it work after a lot of services were put in place after a tremendous effort by a provider that does great work in other sites, I'm familiar with as well, and also just again for this for the city to do this on an emergency basis Be, without you, know, proper consultation and without really articulating a service or policy reason why this makes sense.
You know opportunity in community world one because we have a large homeless population here that needs to service.
I want to make sure that we can sit down with the city and plan for a shelter that can help families and people in need in lower Manhattan, and that's something that we can work.
I want to start by talking about who this conversation should be about, which is the 235 new yorkers experiencing homelessness, who are at Lucerne on the upper west.
Community, leaders, elected officials and project renewal have been working hand-in-hand to address community concerns and provide the residents with the support services.
We all need to come together now to send a message to the mayor that we are not okay with this administration playing political games when lives are at stake, we need to plan to address homelessness, build low-income housing and work with communities, and we need it.
I think this actually may be their fourth move, which makes it even more unconscionable in terms of humanity, but I will leave that to DHS to talk about So, DHS and project renewal are going to give their presentation now, which hopefully will answer many of the questions that the public the community is asking.
To last that we have 54 000 people, almost 18 000 are single adults, men and women, and so part of the work that we need to do to support them when they come to us.
You, see I like to say that DHS is the safety net of the safety net when all else fails where they are 24, hours, a day, stabilizing lives and moving folks to permanently when the pandemic hit back in March, the single adult men and women are primarily in congregate settings and we thought about how do we save lives First, we started by really looking at the vulnerable senior population, and then we looked at.
We work with nearly 15 000 clients a year to help them renew their lives through health homes and jobs, and that's what we did at the Lucerne So I'm I wanted, first and foremost, to give you a picture of the services that we're going to provide at the radisson.
Then we started to look at the distribution where hotels were some areas, had more hotels and covered hotels than other areas- town, for instance, upper west side , for instance, This site gives us an opportunity to use temporarily for de-densification and gives us the opportunity to have a permanent shelter on this community.
One of the things that we wanted to do in this administration is to make sure that we have equity in where we have shelters and every community board we've been talking.
We, have people going through them to try and ensure that we do this with a little bit of grace so from downtown new york city for safe streets is christopher.
It's great downtown new yorkers, has been created to amplify the voices of our community who are concerned for the following one: the safety of our children, two, the cleanliness of our streets and three.
Hotel, that's set up there, that's going to be turned into a shelter run by project renewal in dss number one They're within one mile, there's 11 schools within a half a mile, there's six schools within 300 feet, there's three schools bright horizon early learning, pine street school and quad prep.
Every person who is experiencing homelessness is a criminal right, and so I also think that you know to reframe that about who the folks are is important for us to do.
You know folks experiencing homelessness, having right to public spaces, too, And, but we will work with you all, along with project renewal and my team, to see if we can find a place where it is directly there I know I work down on a beaver street someplace close or not , I.
I know that project renewal does a good job, but- So, just for the community board members who are raising hands.
The whole crux of this is that we appreciate that these are real people that we're talking about and human beings, and we at the alliance have been advocating for the homeless for many years and with our work with brc, I mean we know the on a first name: basis, most of the street homeless.
We placed 62 within our area last year, just 20 in the last month, and so I think we recognize when we're dealing with people who are struggling with substance, abuse and mental health issues like they're, but for the grace of god, and so we respect you eric jody everybody at DHS.
We don't know to when, until we have a plan in place, it's going to be a repeat of what happened on the upper west side And, it's really nice to hear about a family shelter as a permanent possibility.
Is it permanent, what's happening, and so what I want to talk about is this temporary These men are going to move again, right.
The issue is having them on the street like what are the services you're gonna provide, because the borough president is discussing sort of a criminal walking away from real services on the upper west, side.
Call it what it is: a political move that isn't really in their best interest, but something you have to carry out all right, jessica, allen's at first You know the review did happen and because of the density in certain parts of the city, the decision was to use this space that was being underutilized, giving us the opportunity to turn it into an adult family, shelter.
Why move them again versus looking to get the homeless families and people we have on the streets of community board one?
Why not utilize project renewal and their fabulous resources to set up a way to help the people who are on the street in cb1, get them off the street, help them get to services in the neighborhood.
Some areas I talked about had more dedensified hotels, right, we're not intensifying the individual building with our workers to de-densify the you know, distribution of hotels, but I just wanted to pick on two things that you talked about.
The Manhattan consortium is one of them breaking ground, they're out every single day, 24 hours, a day, engaging those on the street takes about six months to build trust before people are even interested in coming.
I'll also mention that we're going to contract with a security company to have 25 guards per shift, at least two of whom would have responsibility for being posted external to the building, doing block patrols and engaging our clients who they see out in the neighborhood, and we want to have thoughtful planning conversations with the community about what that external surveillance looks.
As we stated in the letter we sent to the mayor, we care about the well-being of all new yorkers, I, don't think, there's anyone that would question the commitment of our employees and our students to better the neighborhoods and communities where we live and work.
You said that people aren't thrown out on the streets, but is there a curfew that they have to be in at that involves the security things like.
Certainly if there are issues, if there are people behaving poorly in the community, we want to know we will plan to be in touch with all of whomever wants to on as regular and routine a basis as you want.
Clearly enough, I know jody that you do good work, but it would be better if it ran like the operation on water street.
So, while getting 18 people off the street is amazing, we're seeing hundreds of people on the street down here , That's, where that's coming, back, I'm gonna go to open hearts , I believe we have from open hearts corinne lowe, hi, so I said: I could have a little bit of her time, because I want to also read a statement from a resident of the Lucerne shelter, because I think it's extremely important for impacted individuals to be represented in this conversation What I want to say, I'm a community member on the upper west, side, I'm, not a professional in this space in any way I'm, a college, professor and a mom, and I got involved in this, because there was a lot of you know: vocal discontent with the shelters in our area and for me, You know, I thought that was morally wrong and unjustified by the facts on the ground, because for us having the shelters here has been an opportunity for service and virtues and for forming deep and meaningful community bonds.
So, this transfer is wrong, but at the same time I am dismayed by a lot of the comments I'm seeing in the chat and hearing that has a tone that says that you know these types of people shouldn't be here.
He is a resident of the Lucerne He's one of the men that will be transferred And. He asked to speak on this meeting tonight and his request was denied and I want you to hear his voice.
A lot of confusion between street homelessness and shelter, homelessness, and I will say that it has been a incredibly meaningful and wonderful experience to be able to welcome the shelter with open, hearts, and I would be glad to work with the community board down there to put the same services in place for a different population.
Well, I think, and that's good, as I said, that's great to hear, because we would like to get those same kind of services for the people who are on the streets in lower Manhattan.
Thank you for as well for talking about the security plans, but one of my concerns and it relates directly to the services that will be provided to whoever ultimately inhabits the shelter is what financial resources has the city committed to this specific site currently and what will be committed in the future.
You know I'll, be coming back in front of all of you to answer questions about what that is, but an adult family, shelter.
We will be talking with you, know: community board one, The public get an opportunity to ask us.
Had this dialogue, we've had families and people come to us already, That is part of the discussion that we would hope that you would be open to looking ahead, and I know.
I certainly would welcome from you or any buildings that you think could be a family children's shelter, but I just need to interrupt you, all.
I, think that will be helpful, because one thing that this community needs right now and that was lacking by this being dropped on a friday night-.
I just want to say that you know there have been so many voices within the community who said we are ready and we are ready to mobilize and help that shelter once it becomes a family, shelter.
We see the unsheltered with the homeless encampments, and we know that there are people now who are housed into shelters, and we know that this needs to be an issue that it's an issue that has to be addressed, but transparency, I mean you know, we're all adults, right.
Did you direct a question back to jocelyn or project renewal, Yes, and actually some of it was was asked when patrick was speaking, but we talked about the proposal process to getting that family shelter off the ground.
You could bring to us to create whatever shelter you think the building can and can be used for, but because it's not families or children under 18 there still is a need.
Why is it not possible to help the men who are currently on the streets in the neighborhood, and that is a fair question to ask as the numbers recede you've receded numbers on the upper west, side What about the people on our streets in our community?
If people wanted to come into shelter, we would find a bed for them.
The city has a responsibility to provide a safe public, realm, and I do not support a city action that would increase incidences where I am threatened with physical violence on the streets, not every homeless, person undergoing treatment for substance abuse and mental health issues will be violent or is violent, but it is inevitable that congregating 235 men with a history of these issues in a single building without exterior space, will increase violent events throughout the neighborhood.
And I think there are people justine- I think I want to speak more as a resident of this neighborhood, respecting the reason that I got the Getting the opportunity to speak is because I am a member of this board, but I think I'd rather speak as a resident of lower Manhattan of gold street for my entire life and sort of like the resident 911 person.
We are a community who cares about the people who are actually living on the streets.
You know how does security work project renewal can come back to us and answer many of the curfew, questions and safety and security questions and the operation questions.
There were homeless people there, but at the end of the day the mayor doesn't see any of them because there are gates that he put We want to be able to plan for the community to help the homeless here, help whoever needs help.
The answer is really yes, that these hotels can be used as housing and that's kind of you know one of the things we've talked about long time in community board.
Can project renewal stay on to answer some of the questions about program, security and other things that were asked?
They may not know the cost to transfer the people from the upper west side down and the overall budget and whatever the city is paying for the hotel, but they can answer the questions about services that they offer.
Does security work for the community right What services are rep, are able to be replicated from the upper west side and which ones aren't that you're going to have to do before you move and will all the services be available before you move in?
I know that we are we're able to do another meeting or to to answer those questions, but I leave that I don't want to talk to you eric or jody, but I'm certainly willing to come back and answer those questions to be present to help the questions you might have for the department of public services, but maybe we can jump on email tomorrow and try to figure out a date schedule a day, eric nodded.
If you see something happening like right, now, there's always someone at the shelter who will respond to that, and we certainly, you know, will, all of which have been kind of remarkably quiet, so that that's kind of an overview of safety and security.
The question that comes up when people miss that 10 pm threshold is whether they will in fact secure a bed at that specific site or whether they'll get a different bed within the DHS shelter system.
You know, in addition to the scope of services that project renewal provides at the Lucerne through our contract with the city.
I've worked at the department of homeless services for 13 years before coming to project renewal and Never, quite understood what the what the best practice model looked like in terms of a community coalescing in a positive way around a shelter, and we feel, like we've, achieved that with open hearts, with the constellation of supported elected officials with that program, as the borough president mentioned, that we were about to launch with goddard riverside, and all of that has really enhanced our programming at the Lucerne.
You know in all of our programming that project renewal operates in terms of really cultivating those meaningful relationships with community groups that can be transformative in the lives of our clients.
It would be great if they would have that up there, and then we could replicate that down here for people who are living at the six water street, shelter that you manage.
There is frankly, a disconnect, I think, between the various you know, providers and what their roles are: we're not responsible for street outreach, and One of the problems that we will have- is that neighbors are going to assume that anyone who appears to be homeless within a one block radius of the Lucerne is probably one of our clients and there's there will be confusion about that.
So that is going to be a concern that we have for you There outreach workers today on the street all the time engaging with those people?
One thing we all know is that everyone is safer when people are sheltered, getting services, as opposed to on the street, not getting services.
Even, you are already in our neighborhood at six water street, and it would be important to know when the community sees things that are happening that are related to any of the shelter locations.
You know to be able to get more people off the streets, so that will in itself not allow de-densifying, and I'm, not sure.
If I encourage the members of the community, if you have questions that you weren't able to ask- Or if you think of something new, please send those questions into the community board so that we can address them next time we meet I'll, also say, and for those sorry, we put up a web page on when we moved into the Lucerne with information about it If people want to go there, it's project, renewal, Lucerne.
