Yes, they can drop off, they are making a statement so we'd like them to be able to do that. Can you hear it's pat yep pat you're live and I can't start my video because the host has disabled it. Yes, it can drop off correct, hi tammy. This is blah great. I'm here all right. We okay great margaret. Thank you so much and lucian we are live. So the only thing I would like to check is whether or not we have Manhattan borough president gail Brewer on senator kavanaugh. Thank you councilmember chen. You are on and I see luke wolf is on and I see you lean, so I just need to ensure that gail and senator kavanagh are here and then we can rock hi tammy. I am. I am here, I'm getting a message that it says some. The host needs to start my video, but I'm here. If you can hear me, I can hear you so that's perfect. I don't have a video either at this point. Okay, great same for me, it's jessica, hi jessica. Thank you! So much April. Are you going to turn video on for panelists? Let me see here: yes, I can't do that. Working on that now. Thank you. It's a very old one, so it would be preferable. I know julian. The picture still looks nice. You go for those who have joined. It is 603. This is Manhattan community board one. We are hosting a special meeting this evening outside of our normal agendas and business working and hosting with DHS and project renewal. I want to wait to ensure that we've got everything technologically going because we are on zoom versus our normal webex platform and and then we will be in great shape, I'm just seeing in the chat right now that zoom has reached capacity. So a lot of people are unable to join. Yes, thank you to youtube live. It will redirect youtube exactly all right. So still don't have any video April, oh, but everyone else was able to start their video. Maybe try again. Let's see how do I do that? What do I do? Start? Video? Ah there we go. Thank you. Okay, everybody ready all right here we go so we're going to get started. I want to welcome everybody to community board ones, presentation and dialogue. We we want to start the meeting off with the acknowledgement that we would like to have some decorum and ground rules on here. We do have groups of panelists who are all going to be able to speak for two minutes and the electeds. We were advised a short while ago that DHS must leave by 8 pm, so we're going to try and run a very tight chip. If questions have been answered, please don't ask the same one. We are trying to group people together. We got literally hundreds of questions online which we are going to try and we have shared with DHS and we're hoping going to get some answers to tonight. Questions will continue to roll in we're at 350 people thus far, who have sent us questions not including the people who are on the zoom call with us. We do have bandwidth limitations with the call tonight. We recognize that so we will have 500 participants who are in the attendee list, the panelists, and then everyone else will be able to be on the youtube live stream, and you will still be able to have questions input there again we're going to try and go as quickly as we can. So I want to be respectful of everybody's time. If the question's been asked, please don't ask it again and with that I am going to start. I am chair of community board one host moderating tonight with to host project renewal in DHS with pat moore, who is our chair of the quality of life committee. This meeting came about quite shortly because we were and part of my expression, pipe bombed information friday night with no from the media. No notification came to community board. One, no facts: no input, no engagement, nothing so, as a chair of community board, one the choices of the city to destabilize and dehumanize, a group who are succeeding well in a location that they currently have and to put them through. This is upsetting to start with the fact that this will do nothing. The opening of this shelter to address the people in our community who are part of community board one, is something that is untenable to us in community board one. We want to help the people who are on the street here. We want to be able to provide options for people who, through the rent moratorium, goes away. Eviction moratorium if they're in community board one with their families. We want them to be able to stay here. Adding people here without helping the people who are existing here does not seem fair to us and shows that truly this mayor is making a decision and putting it back on the mayor, not the agency who is facilitating, but again they have to answer for it as well that we're not prioritizing keeping a stabilized group in a position. This isn't about humanity. This is not about care. This is about pitting one community board against the other which, as a community board leader, I completely disagree with. There is no less value to the people in community board, one than there are to community board seven. There is no less value to the homeless people and community board one than there are in community board seven. So looking for a holistic approach that really takes into account everybody- and I'm done with my time so I'll get off my soapbox with that. I want to thank everybody who has come and recognized Manhattan borough, president gail Brewer, because you do represent all our community boards. Well. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, madam chair, and I want to thank pat moore and I want to say you have been stellar in dealing with this issue and I also want to say that we'll have a conversation with project renewal, but I know they have another program that has been successful in district one and they are an excellent organization. So it's not about them. It's not about the men. I think you have heard me say over and over again that at the beginning of July 27th and the following time in board seven, there were a lot of issues when without any notification same thing, the folks were moved from a hotel on 51st street up to the 79th street hotel Lucerne, and there were a lot of issues there was drug dealing. The project renewal did not have time to put excellent services into the hotel. The hotel does have very little space. It has a small community room. We asked the city to do a fix up of the roof garden. No, we don't do that and we won't make the owner do that. So there's no space except out on the street for three weeks. It was really challenging and I think that's what upset some of the residents of the upper west side. I will tell you that project renewal has made great strides with excellent services in the hotel, etc, and guess what, as you have heard as members of community board, one and the reason that I am upset, is they got a riverside community center, a settlement house? You know one of the excellent hundred-year-old settlement houses board members, wrote massive checks, individual checks to the tune of between two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand dollars, and they said to the hotel Lucerne and to the men. We have, and I have the proposal right here. We have outdoor space indoor space and we can do a six day a week program. We can provide jobs through our green keepers program and we will do it from 8 am till 8 pm and it's right near the hotel. So that was on the table. It's no longer on the table. If they move- and I have to say that's what we all want. We want that kind of program. It's like a dream, come true. Private money spend it correctly and give these men the kinds of support that they need. So I have to say that's why I am incredibly upset about the move, because that kind of offer doesn't come around. It cannot happen from downtown, it doesn't work to go, uptown, etc. So I'm very opposed to the move. I have said this from the beginning. I think that the men there were arrests would have decreased the population and, to be honest with you, taking out those who perhaps should not be in a hotel to start with, and the population is down, it's stable, the men know the neighborhood and here's an offer that nobody provides. The city of new york certainly does not provide that kind of money and that kind of program so without because I know you want to hear from others. I just want to say it is a crime. From my perspective, for the city to let that mind just disappear and say sorry, we're not interested we're going to move, and so that's why I'm opposed to it, and I appreciate very much the fact that this discussion is taking place, but I just want people downtown to know we arranged this. We made the offer and if they move, they can't take advantage of it and it's a crime. Thank you very much, madam chair. Thank you very much for a president. It's I will, when DHS addresses the and gives their part. Perhaps they can answer that part I'd like to move next to senator cavanaugh great. Thank you very much tammy. Thank you, pat moore, thank you for everybody at community world one. You know I have to say during this pandemic it's been an effort to keep the normal channels of community engagement up and running, and cb1 has done a great job of that, and that is why your community board is ready to take this on in this technically sophisticated way, and I can tell you I do a lot of community boards and many of them are not functioning this smoothly, especially in a borough that president gail Brewer isn't responsible for that. I also represent, but I also just wanna acknowledge you know: gail some member julie, new council, member, chin, controller, scott stringer, I think, is represented and other distinguished guests. You know as soon as we got the similar last minute word really. After the you know, we got we got phone calls. You know the end of the day on friday about this. All of the elected officials immediately consulted with each other immediately consulted the community award, because we do want to work together to make sure we get the best outcome for all concerned here. You know I want to just emphasize. There are two very distinct issues here. One is whether the city should be moving. This particular group of men from this particular facility at the Lucerne on the upper west side to the location that they are proposing without prior notice on wall street and william. The second issue is a longer-term question about what we can do to prove to create this kind of capacity for services in our district, and I want to emphasize that they're very distinct. You can both have tremendous. You know sympathy for these men and the work that we want to do to stable, to help them stabilize themselves, and you know, get into permanent housing and live their lives and also be very skeptical of what the city is proposing, particularly here. So we want to addre. This is the city is described as an emergency. They want to move very quickly to do this. We should have a longer-term conversation about what is going to happen with that radisson site and what is best for this community, including as tammy meltzer mentioned the many people who are already homeless and already living in our communities. Often you know in the streets and on the sidewalks of all of these, all of the community neighborhoods and community ward one. So I you know I joined gail in expressing you know real concern that the city is walking away from something after a lot of effort was made to make it work after a lot of services were put in place after a tremendous effort by a provider that does great work in other sites, I'm familiar with as well, and also just again for this for the city to do this on an emergency basis be, without you know, proper consultation and without really articulating a service or policy reason why this makes sense. It seems very much a matter of getting out of one facility to get into another because of you know some opposition in the neighborhood around the existing facility. So I look forward to the conversation today. I do thank the representatives from DHS, who, I think, are you know gonna face challenging questions tonight, but we appreciate you being here to answer those, and you know, let's get to the conversation. Thank you. Thank you. So much senator cavanaugh council member chin, you're next and we're going to really try and be tight on time. So thank you. Thank you tammy and thank you to everyone in community one for hosting this. Just like my colleague have said. You know we heard about it on friday and I also spoken to my colleague, councilmember rosenthal, who represent the area on the upper west side. They're like this on the upper west side, they are standing together against the move because it is unconscionable for the city to move these residents again. They've been moved several times in the last six months and they were not consulted. They need stability. You know I and I think community board with a lot of residents. Look we welcome more shelter, opera. You know opportunity in community world one because we have a large homeless population here that needs to service. But, frankly speaking, a threat of a lawsuit is not a good reason to move those residents from the upper west side to lower Manhattan or to any other neighborhood. It is not an emergency. I want to make sure that we can sit down with the city and plan for a shelter that can help families and people in need in lower Manhattan, and that's something that we can work towards. Look all of us have to be compassionate and deal with and with humanity to deal with. The vulnerable homeless population is all our responsibility, but the city needs to work with us, and I thank all the members of community both when I look forward to working together with project renewal, all the providers and the city on this. Thank you margaret. Thank you. So much and you hit it right on the nail on the head. We want to move quickly to assembly member, you lean new. You can tell I'm going city state city state, not our typical order, but this is not a typical night. Yeah. Remember it's great to hear especially gayle's perspective, and I just wanted to say that actually, when we heard on friday night, I mean I heard on friday night at like 8 30 p.m. So I called brian and gail immediately because I was wondering what their perspectives were. I also texted margaret to see if she was available, but I wanted to be able to see if we could actually get on. You know the same page. I didn't know the background on what was going on and why it was moving so quickly. We were all very puzzled about what caused white constituted in an emergency, especially when the homeless neighbors that we have up in the upper west side were doing well there, and so I felt like that. You know really. Gail was able to kind of highlight some of the biggest factors in these decisions that are being made, and I think that we really should heed some of her advice here, and so I want to echo her sentiments. I also want to echo brian's concerns and sentiments on on. You know why the community was not really given a lot of input and leeway into kind of at least getting some information about what was happening. So I wanted to see the rest of my time to community to speak, because I know that we're in a rush here, so I would like to make sure that we actually get to hear everybody speaking. Thank you. Thank you again, tammy for chairing. All of us. Thank you assembly member. I believe scott stringer's office has a statement. So luke wolf are you here or is it jessica? I am here, I'm lukewall from comptroller stringer's office I'll be reading a brief statement. Thank you to community board one for putting this form together. I want to start by talking about who this conversation should be about, which is the 235 new yorkers experiencing homelessness, who are at Lucerne on the upper west side, these residents for their own safety were moved out of the shelter at the start of the pandemic, moved again in late July and now face the reality of moving a third time in seven months, each time their lives thrown into disarray. How this administration has treated these men as if they are the problem, is cruel and inexcusable and a way to deflect from the real issue. We face that this is an administration that does not have a plan to address homelessness. They did not before the pandemic, when there are 66, 000, homeless, new yorkers, half of them children, and they do not. Now we need to make sure that as a city, we do everything we can to take care of the most vulnerable among us, especially right now, when times are hard and right now, that means keeping these individuals experiencing homelessness at the Lucerne. This move is not grounded in public health rationale. It is not in the best interest of these men nor the provider who serves them and only emboldens other communities to resist instead of welcoming their fellow new yorkers is the situation at Lucerne perfect? Of course not, but substantial progress is being made, lines of communication have been opened and problems are being resolved. Community leaders, elected officials and project renewal have been working hand-in-hand to address community concerns and provide the residents with the support services they needed. This is not to say that every community does not need to do their part. Controller stringer would welcome a shelter in community board one and believes that all communities need to be part of the solution. However, this administration has acted without transparency, disregarding community engagement and caving to one group of residents only to move the situation to another neighborhood is inexcusable and a failure of leadership. We all need to come together now to send a message to the mayor that we are not okay with this administration playing political games when lives are at stake, we need to plan to address homelessness, build low-income housing and work with communities, and we need it now. Thank you. Thank you luke, I might say, DHS is next with project renewal. Who will be here as well? I think this actually may be their fourth move, which makes it even more unconscionable in terms of humanity, but I will leave that to DHS to talk about and so we're gonna. Yes just again, I know that you've said it before, but I want to reiterate it to everyone that we have a hard stop at 8 o'clock. So DHS and project renewal are going to give their presentation now, which hopefully will answer many of the questions that the public the community is asking. So if you, if they have answered your question, please do not ask it again in the in the interest of saving time. Also dss has said. Dhs has said they might give us a meeting next week. If we do not get to all the answers. Thank you am I good to go jocelyn carter from DHS straight up. I was going to introduce you but jocelyn welcome. This is jocelyn carter. I believe it's administrator for DHS and you have your team iris rodriguez with you and erica dean. So the three of you are here. I am not sure who is here yet from project renewal, but I will look through my notes but take it away jocelyn and thank you so much for working with us to provide our first community engagement on this topic, and I am pleased to be here. I know it's not it's a difficult time, but just before I start eric and jody are both on see. Everybody yeah project is on the call is on the in the meeting, but thank you for having us and thank you for having me and the opportunity to speak to all of you. I'd like to start at any presentation a little bit about who we are and what we do, I'm the administrator of an agency that is responsible for over 54 000 individuals. So it's not 66 to last that we have 54 000 people, almost 18 000 are single adults, men and women, and so part of the work that we need to do to support them when they come to us. You see I like to say that DHS is the safety net of the safety net when all else fails where they are 24 hours, a day, stabilizing lives and moving folks to permanently when the pandemic hit back in March, the single adult men and women are primarily in congregate settings and we thought about how do we save lives and how do we make sure that the infection rate in our system did not escalate? And first we started by really looking at the vulnerable senior population, and then we looked at. Why not move the folks in congress settings to hotels right, and so we very quickly moved about 10, 000 individuals into hotels, and so that was done very quickly. Yes, it was done because we wanted to save lives and we did save lives now we're looking at distribution of where the hotels are and yes, in the upper west side there were multiple hotels down in the finance district. There are two corbett, hotels and no shelters. This is an opportunity for us, and I've heard it said that we would welcome shelters. We would welcome shelters down in this area we're using this temporarily and we are going to turn this into a adult family site, so there will be in this community board an adult family site. Adult families are those moms with adult child, adult siblings, a couple who have fallen in hard times and come to us, and so our plan is to be able to turn that in, and so this does that give us that opportunity. It does mean that you will have men moving into the neighborhood who are people's husbands, people's brothers, you know uncles people who are human, and so our job is to really help to stabilize them. I understand that you were not given any notice. This was part of the review that happened by the mayor, and this is the decision that was made. So what we're hoping to do tonight is to really look at. How do we work together so that when we come into the neighborhood and we work with providers, project renewal is one of our best providers. They've been providing services, they provide expert services, he'll talk to you about what they do, but working in conjunction with the provider project manual and all of you to make the work that needs to happen with the individuals be seamless and solve issues former president, you talked about what was happening, the upper side and raising that money. I do know that we have individuals on the upper west side that can certainly utilize that money and we hope to be able to duplicate that down here in the fidei's district. That money should not go to waste, and so we are certainly working to make connections to the same type of thing that happens up there for learning from what happens up there. What can we do to make sure that doesn't happen? So the other thing I wanted to really talk about is: there are two tracks I believe there are. Those are sheltered on the street who need stabilization and those who are sheltered and coming into shelter. So there are two things that we need to do yes, unsheltered, our folks and we've brought in at least 18 people into our safe havens. Since we since January this year, and we continue to engage those- are instructed on the street, we're engaging those who are sheltered in out in brick and mortar we're working to stabilize and move to permanency. This fight will give us an opportunity to stabilize and move to permanency, while still moving towards an adult family facility. So there are two things happening here. Other questions that you may have. I want to make sure I address all the issues. I think that's I'm going to stop there and then I'll answer, questions that you may have, but I'll have project when you'll start talking about the services that they've provided have been providing yeah instead of answering questions at the moment, could you have project renewal? Do a presentation, sir hi? Everyone, I'm eric rosenbaum, I'm the president and ceo of project renewal and I'm joined by jody rudin, who is our executive vice president and chief operating officer briefly, project renewal is one of the oldest and largest homeless service agencies. In new york city, we house over 2000 people, every night, half of them in seven shelters. We operate through Manhattan, Bronx and Brooklyn, and the other half in supported permanent supported housing buildings that we operate mostly in Manhattan and the Bronx we're also one of the largest providers of health care to homeless, new yorkers, I'm treating over 13 000 individual people each year with primary care, psychiatric care, substance, use treatment, I mean even dentistry. We operate health care, I'm sorry, employment programs targeted at homeless, new yorkers are people at risk, including a culinary arts training program. That's been in existence since 1995 and out of which has grown a social purpose, venture called city beep kitchens, which today makes and delivers over 3 million meals a year to homeless, new yorkers, making us one of the largest providers of food for homeless. New yorkers as well you'd. Ask me in March what my greatest fears were walking into the pandemic. It was that we would be overrun by the virus in our congregate shelters today. I'm actually amazed to say that we've had only 85 cases of Covid-19 among the 3 000 people who have lived with us since March, and only one of them died in shelter and that one was someone who was on hospice before they before they got infected with Covid-19. I think the hotels have actually had a lot to do with this. We have operated at this point now. This will be our sixth hotel we are occupying for today and we actually have operated a hotel within 10 minutes of radisson since June 15th, reducing density at two of our other shelters, and I think we established a great relationship with the neighborhood in that hall and there have been very few problems, and I would certainly hope that we can repeat that experience here. We make it an absolute priority and a commitment to get to know the neighborhood in which we operate, even if it's only for a short period of time. We demonstrated that in the in the first hotel- and we will do so here, even though we understand that we are walking into a very difficult situation, I'm going to turn it over. I know you want more information about what exactly is the population will be serving and what services we'll be providing. So I'm going to turn this over to to jody, to give you more information about that hi everybody good evening. It's good to be with you, I'm jody rudin, I'm the executive vice president and chief operating officer from project renewal. As eric touched on at project renewal, we work with nearly 15 000 clients a year to help them renew their lives through health homes and jobs, and that's what we did at the Lucerne and that's what we planned to do at the radisson. So I'm I wanted, first and foremost to give you a picture of the services that we're going to provide at the radisson. Each of the clients at the radisson will be assigned a case manager who will work with them comprehensively towards helping them secure, permanent housing. That could mean any number of activities, including helping them to secure public benefits or entitlements, for which they're eligible helping them secure identification, helping them complete housing applications and visit apartments, and we also try to bring a multi-disciplinary approach to our work. So, in addition to case management, we have a wide range of health care services, including primary care psychiatric services that will likely largely be provided via a telepsychiatry hub at the radisson, and then we have a team that delivers health care for around addiction, treatment and drug use. We also have, yes, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but due to the lack of time, is it possible to answer some of the specific questions that were brought up about 52 william? Can you just go straight to why it was selected how you know how that site was selected? That should be. That should be a jawline question right. I am I'm jumping in on the 52 william question. Sorry, I talked about the review. That happened, the mayoral review that happened, and we really look at distribution of hotels that we use for de-densification back in March. It was done really quickly and then we started to look at the distribution where hotels were some areas, had more hotels and covered hotels than other areas- town, for instance, upper west side, for instance, and so we really wanted to distribute well the hotels. This site gives us an opportunity to use temporarily for de-densification and gives us the opportunity to have a permanent shelter on this community district. One of the things that we wanted to do in this administration is to make sure that we have equity in where we have shelters and every community board we've been talking about. Since I've been in the sea 2017, the commissioner sent letters out to every community board saying we need a building. We need spaces in your community board. This is the opportunity to have a regular shelter, permanent shelter for adult families down in italy. Oh wait jocelyn! This is that's a no you're saying a permanent shelter. This is temporary. You've said this is temporary, so this does not answer pat's question and that's what we want targeted information as to why a temporary shelter here at that location. I believe you have a different process for permanence, so the meshing, the two- is not a fair thing for the community, because there's two so total different processes, and that needs to be identified and that's part of the confusion and the lack of facts and engagement to the community again. Why was this location chosen as the temporary location there? So far? There was no answer to gail to gail brewer's question. The money will not follow down here. The money is an upper west side, money pot that you're not getting the same thing. The only thing you're getting thus far from the community in lower Manhattan that I have seen is a lawsuit similar to the one that you're getting on the upper west side. So before those people speak. What we need to understand is how this from a quarantine hotel was turned into a separate facility. What under the emergency order, allows that and how this spot was chosen versus other locations and what does with the permanent? So what does temporary mean? What does temporary mean throughout the pandemic? We have moved ten thousand folks into identified congress settings. We will be returning back to shelters once we're able to do that. So that's a temporary piece. How long will that be? I can't tell you that yet because we have to look at and follow the CD department of health guidelines for that to happen. So it's based on the covent. It's us to return back to our settings right, so we wanted to make sure that we did have escalation of infection rates within our system, and so we wanted to make sure folks were safe. So that's the decision that was made to make sure that folks were safe. That happened was that was that decision made for this group in their second or third move to the Lucerne correct that the identification put them at the Lucerne. Yes, but the distribution of hotels are where people are. You know we have to look at that right. Multiple people, hotels down here hold on hold on this- is my dog one minute my dog wanted to jump in sorry. So we look at distribution where hotels are and the space. So we did it very quickly back in March in April when we started the moon now we're looking at distribution here, have no permanent shelters and only two Covid-19 hotels, and so we have this underutilized quarantine, hotel that we have been using, and that gives us the space to look within and I'm gonna do to continue to move the process towards a permanent shelter. Okay, so I think another question is: we were told that there are 235 men that are going to be moved into this site. Are they all? What is the population at the Lucerne? So are you just? Are there 235 men at Lucerne, or is there another facility, that's being blended with the Lucerne population? I it's 240 men from the Lucerne there's no blending of the men that are there, the men that are going to be moved, that's 2, 35! Now, just so you know it's going to do 30 times great, I mean I'll, be blunt. There's some questions that are being asked about are any of the any of the men in this population. Sex offenders. I could tell you they're, not okay, I mean we sent out a list of questions. I don't know if you have them in front of you to answer those specifically, I saw the email I had to pull that out tammy. What was something I'm trying to find the questions? What were some of the other questions, but they're, small okay? We can. Why? Don't we do this, because it's really important that the community we had sent? We had shared with you list of over 300 questions, there's a lot of symmetry and many of the questions. A lot of them are stable together. I think what we can do is call on some of the panelists and have that dialogue started, because they will repeat some of the questions and we'll try. We have people going through them to try and ensure that we do this with a little bit of grace so from downtown new york city for safe streets is christopher. You should hi hello, everyone. Thank you so much yeah hi, hello, everyone. My name is christopher brown, I'm a resident of two water street in the financial district, and I'm also one of the founding members of downtown new yorkers for safe streets. I've been a resident of the neighborhood for six years and I deeply care about it. I'd first like to thank everybody for allowing us to be recognized on the call and to all of our fellow neighbors who deeply care and love our neighborhood and are on this call. I think it's over a thousand people now with youtube. It's great downtown new yorkers has been created to amplify the voices of our community who are concerned for the following one: the safety of our children, two, the cleanliness of our streets and three, the integrity of our neighborhood. We were founded in just five days and we have a group page on facebook that has amassed 2 300 members of our fellow neighbors. These neighbors are from all walks of life, there's their moms, their families, their. You know, business people, business owners; they voiced all their concerns about the lack of transparency and notice for this impending transfer of over 240 men or 235. I don't know how many there is now, but before I talk about this, I just want to tell you about a personal note. I live at 2 water street 4 water street is a hilton garden inn. It is filled with homeless people. I have compassion for homeless people. I've been living them with them in my neighborhood in front of my building now, since early June. Now one of the points that was brought up was you know there there's not a density of hotels or shelters within this area. I find that highly unlikely. There are a lot of hotels in this neighborhood filled with homeless people, and I think a lot of my other neighbors can attest to that. So when this brings me to my topic about 52, william street and the current Covid-19 19 quarantine hotel, that's set up there, that's going to be turned into a shelter run by project renewal in dss number one is our children they're within one mile, there's 11 schools within a half a mile, there's six schools within 300 feet: there's three schools bright horizon early learning, pine street school and quad prep. You know diagonally across the street, there's an open area called fosun plaza. This plaza is used daily as a place for kids to go to recess. They had a fire drill at the school the other day, the kids use that plaza. We have families that you know let their kids play there on a daily basis. This is right in front of this proposed location. Number two is the location. You're gonna have to go faster. Okay, number two is the location. It's a historic area, we're a very dense neighborhood with narrow streets. We now have businesses with built out areas for dining and such and with Covid-19 and a pandemic that you know, we've all been suffering from we're all used to social distancing mask wearing. I don't know how it's feasible for these people in this shelter. Where are they going to go in the area to congregate and hang out? There is no place to go for them and it just is not safe. We firmly believe this location is not a good location for our neighborhood, so with the health and safety of the neighborhood and the 240 men caught in the middle of this failed experiment. The de Blasio administration is forcing upon us. We urge you to find compassion for this solution that is beneficial for the men in question and to our neighborhood. Thank you for the time. Okay. Thank you christopher. I will say if that music, you hear, is the timer that I have that runs on my phone. Yes, it is a little kinder than a bullhorn, but I will be brutal at three minutes and ask to silence you because someone on the call is going to make me a co-host. So I have the button just saying all right so jocelyn. There was a question, though that has not been answered. Yes, christopher's question. I think that you know. Out of I know you said multiple things. You know, as you were talking about folks who are experiencing homelessness. I think, but you know when I think about my job, I think of people as humans that are experiencing homelessness and not you know homeless people, but this in terms of looking at, and I think the question that christopher I'm going to look at is: where are they going to go? And so we are- and I understand that was a big issue, and I talked to project manual today just today trying to work with my team and project mule to make community, so we could find a place for them to go. I think it's important to think of people as human to think of people. As you know, you know it's. Not every person who is experiencing homelessness is a criminal right, and so I also think that you know to reframe that about who the folks are is important for us to do that. Also, you know so the integrity of the neighborhood, the safety of the children. I hear the schools are there, here's the humans, and so with project venues. I work with them with DHS work. We have to really think about what does that mean? We still didn't really get an answer, though: where are they going to go to socialize and do have recreation? You know I know patricia. I don't have a straight answer for you. I don't want to lie to you we're working on working that out. I don't have an answer for that. How do you see how many people are going to work? I'm sorry, someone needs to mute themselves. We can hear you and you don't this. Is this certainly something that we are aware of and we're working on, and so we I don't have that. I can't tell you that here. Are there right now? Well, do you think you're going to have that answer before the move happens? I would hope I can't tell you definitively yet it is on top of online and so we're looking at. I know at the at the at the radisson site there is space within there's not space within for smoking. I know that, and so we are looking at. How do we find places to do that? I'm sorry, johnson, someone is asking how many people are in the meeting and asking about a password. Would you please mute yourself, elizabeth? What's my computer password 98.? No, it's elizabeth lamore! Just because it pops up yeah, okay, I'm going to ask all the community board members to keep themselves on mute. We have a list that we're going to get through. I see hands that are up April. Can you we need to mute liz lemire and I just want to go. I just want to go back to josslyn. If she can't be muted, then we need. Then we if you can't be muted for whatever reason. Then we will boot you off and let you sign back in because we've got to make the most of our time jocelyn it's important. Obviously this question is going to be asked several times, so I think you have to come back to us with an answer to that question. Before the move happens. Where are they going to go to congregate to smoke where they're going to go to socialize outside of the facility? I understand they're going there's going to be. You know, programs inside the facility, but let's be realistic. People want need fresh air and want going to want to be outside so absolutely patricia. I don't. I could tell you- and I know this is not satisfactory too to all of you. You know folks experiencing homelessness, having right to public spaces too, and but we will work with you all, along with project renewal and my team, to see if we can find a place where it is directly there I mean I know I work down on a beaver street someplace close or not, and so we're going to try to figure out. How do we do that patricia? I can't say to you that this is going to happen tomorrow. I'm going to be really, you know, I don't one of the things when I go to community meetings. I have to tell you the truth right. This is a tough time. This is a rough time for all of us. You know it is not easy, but my job as the administrator is to really think about the people we serve. I mean I've been here for 16 years three years in this seat and it's a hard place to be it's a hard place to sit and talk to all you, and you know with something that's hard to hear, but I stay, and I continue to this work because I believe in the men and women that I serve, and so it is very important for all of you to know that we are going to work hard to. You know really look at what we can do. I don't want to tell you I'm going to have it before we move. I don't want to. You know lead you on that way, but I want to be true from what the community, the community wants you to have these answers before you move these people, you are already destabilizing a community that is starting to thrive and prosper where they are taking them and putting them in a completely new location, destabilizing them entirely without having all these answers is not actually humane for them either. I know you care, I know that project renewal does a good job, but- and you should it's like going on vacation and trying to pack your bag afterwards, I mean it's really just not that's not that doesn't make sense in terms of a planning perspective at all and with that comment, and I apologize for my editorial because I couldn't hold myself back, we do have two large organizations downtown so just for the community board members who are raising hands. I see you. I know you you're on the list right, but we have two large organizations downtown that are represented on the call tonight and we're gonna we're trying to go back and forth between them. So we can hear a multitude of perspectives. Jessica lappin from the downtown alliance is one of our amazing partners in downtown. They are our local bid. They do an incredible job of helping dsny because they help keep our streets clean help. The tourists find where they're going and provide an incredible resource for even just their small district, which is included in what jocelyn's talking about jessica. Welcome and thank you. Thank you. I know passions are running high and I just want to say jocelyn. I think the whole crux of this is that we appreciate that these are real people that we're talking about and human beings, and we at the alliance have been advocating for the homeless for many years and with our work with brc, I mean we know the on a first name basis, most of the street homeless. We placed 62 within our area last year, just 20 in the last month, and so I think we recognize when we're dealing with people who are struggling with substance, abuse and mental health issues like they're, but for the grace of god, and so we respect you eric jody everybody at DHS. We know that you are in this for the right reasons. It's not about you in this instance. It's about, and you know you call it straight jobs and I'm going to call it straight. This is about the mayor overruling and disregarding the advice and the guidance and the elected officials on the upper west side and making a political decision that almost everybody disagrees with, and it's not in the best interests of these clients and what we're seeing and what we're discussing is a little bit of a recipe for chaos and disaster. The idea that this would happen next week if it's been pushed back, we don't know to when, until we have a plan in place, it's going to be a repeat of what happened on the upper west side and it's really nice to hear about a family shelter as a permanent possibility. That's new information, and I said because we have no information and is it temporary? Is it permanent what's happening, and so what I want to talk about is this temporary and I say that because it's temporary can mean a lot of things for a very long time like what are the services and jody. You started to talk about this, but you know if we want to you know now what we're hearing is again. These men are going to move again right. This is temporary, so this is just move four until there's five or six. If the issue is having them on the street like what are the services you're gonna provide, because the borough president is discussing sort of a criminal walking away from real services on the upper west side. So I guess what my question is: why is this better for them and I'm not talking about the long-term shelter and densification I'm talking about? Why is this move better for these 235 men in what way in this facility in what sense of services, or is it just? Let's call it what it is: a political move that isn't really in their best interest, but something you have to carry out all right, jessica, allen's at first and then judy will talk about the services, and so I did- and I know it's not satisfactory to hear you know the review did happen and because of the density in certain parts of the city, the decision was to use this space that was being underutilized, giving us the opportunity to turn it into an adult family shelter. I know it's not satisfactory to you jessica or to the other folks on this call, but that's how we land, but that's not what we're discussing tonight. That's a different discussion that we welcome we're not discussing a family shelter. That's not what we're discussing. We are discussing certain residents, that's what I'm saying. Yes, what I'm saying to you is that the men at the Lucerne will be moved to this site. It will be underutilized and our long-term plan is to turn it into a shelter right, long-term family shelter. So when we look at distribution of where the densified hotels are some places have more than other places right, the reality is, you know where they were and other places in Midtown had more on than other places. After the review happened, the decision was made to move the men to a less density space. So that's where we landed and that's where we are now at the Lucerne in that in that in that area, when they were there, they will be provided multitude of services that will continue to be provided down in the in the radisson and jody, and the project neural team will continue to do that. She can give you more specifics now about what those services are, but before she goes, the Lucerne was the same as what you're saying they were moved. This is the same answer that was given to the people on the upper west side. They were moved to that location because it was a de-densified location, so in it of itself that location provided the d density that was needed. So why move them again versus looking to get the homeless families and people we have on the streets of community board one, why not utilize project renewal and their fabulous resources to set up a way to help the people who are on the street in cb1, get them off the street, help them get to services in the neighborhood. So they're, already here, they're in front of chris brown's house, they're in front of my house, they're in front of everybody's house, help them get into this kind of a system instead of moving people who were already de-densified not once but twice that's the question. This is not we hear you clearly. This is not de-densifying. This is not de-densifying, that's what the what the overall is, but they are already been de-densified. So, if even if you said, you know what we're de-densifying the Lucerne, it's 240 230 and we're bringing 80 people down, that is de-densifying the Lucerne, but we're not de-densifying the Lucerne. You've already done that once and that's what you told community board seven. So could I answer a couple of things with in terms of distribution of the numbers, some areas I talked about had more dedensified hotels, right, we're not intensifying the individual building with our workers to de-densify the you know, distribution of hotels, but I just wanted to pick on two things that you talked about. I think it's important to know. There are two tracks: the unsheltered on the street that you talked about with in front of your house from christopher's house. Those are sheltered on the street is a different population. It's not families, they're really entrenched on the street. Our providers, brc, is one of them. The Manhattan consortium is one of them breaking ground, they're out every single day, 24 hours a day, engaging those on the street takes about six months to build trust before people are even interested in coming in. We have been able to move 18 of those people in off the street into permanency and into stabilization beds. It's a different and into safe havens. So we fully expect that there are two tracks happening, shelters and then safe havens, which are a little bit lower shelters with less regulations and rules. I mean so we're doing both we're looking at shelters for those who are on shelter to bring them in off the street and then single adults and families who can go into regular shelters. So we do have a track, so those are sheltered on the street. We're also paying attention to that. So we have an unsheltered population and we have sheltered populations. Jodie is jody. You can unmute yourself to talk about your fact sheet and I want to talk about other questions. I yes really briefly. We provide a full range of services at the Lucerne that we would plan to replicate at the radisson, ranging from case management. Healthcare entitlements and benefits. Support and vocational services will also provide therapeutic groups aaa meetings and a variety of recreational activities, and because I see it as a question in the chat, I'll also mention that we're going to contract with a security company to have 25 guards per shift, at least two of whom would have responsibility for being posted external to the building, doing block patrols and engaging our clients who they see out in the neighborhood, and we want to have thoughtful planning conversations with the community about what that external surveillance looks like. We will have a total of 50 full-time staff, spread across three shifts and the other question that seems to come up regularly. That I wanted to speak to is that there is no requirement that clients leave the building during the day. They're free to stay in their rooms or in common areas throughout the hotel and we hope to engage them to stay through our robust constellation of services. I just want to clarify that the 50 full-time staff are in addition to the security staff. It's not so. It's 25 security staff per shift plus full-time the 50 full-time professionals focused on the case management and other services. Can we can tammy move on to the other groups that wanted to they had a representative that wanted to speak? I don't know if vanessa is here from pace vanessa. Anyone here, okay, vanessa, herman from pace, is one of one of many universities in lower Manhattan, but the voice of the university population. I think today is going to be spoken by vanessa best, thank you tammy, and to the entire community board for asking me to speak today and to all of our elected officials. Thank you, roslyn jody, I'm not sure how much you know about pace. I have been in pace now. For seven and a half years we have more than 10 000 employees and students that call our new york city campus home. We have several residence halls, that line the williams street corridor and our students in a study that city hall, released last year in 2019, did the second most volunteer hours in our community in Manhattan. So we are very engaged with our local community and giving back and in particular, homeless individuals. That is something that is very important to our students to try to help them. We are very concerned about this proposed shelter. We have 1200 students who are living in our residence halls right now. Over the last two years, we have seen a drastic uptick in harassment, assaults, students being followed into our residence halls by individuals who have been identified as being homeless. We work continually with jessica and the downtown association and the NYPD to try to mitigate all these instances. But what we've seen really in the last few years is our students, for the first time since I have been at pace, have told us that they're not feeling as safe as they usually are around our community over since friday, since this has been announced, we have received so many emails phone calls social media inquiries about this. How this decision was made, what is pace doing? Is my student safe coming to your university, so these are all things that we're trying to talk about and then trying to get answers to for lack. I guess the question I have, and there were many that were asked tonight, that we are very interested in. Is you mentioned more than once about a review and these decisions that were made I'd like to know? Can we see these reviews? Is there a process? I guess there is no input by the public when these reviews take place, but I've also heard conflicting reports that there are several locations in lower Manhattan in the financial district, where there are individuals being housed who are currently homeless, and I don't think I've heard a real answer as to how many people that really is our dis. Our streets, as you know, are very small they're they get crowded and we're just now seeing an uptick and people are really coming back and we just would really like to work together to find a solution for this, but I would really like to know again these reports. Can we see them? Thank you, vanessa. It's jocelyn! I just want to correct. My name is jocelyn. The review was done through a law department and a commissioner, and so that it's that's where that stands. I don't know I mean you know, that's where it was done, so I can't tell you go here, but that's where it was done. I don't want to say a couple of things about safety. You said in the last two years, yeah students have been harassed by those who are, you know, homeless. One of the things that I would say is that they're bad people in every way every place right. You know not every person who is experiencing homelessness is a criminal right, and so the idea that the men will continue increasing harassment. You know I you know, I beg to different. That's going to be all that they're going to do. The work that we have to do together is to be able to help you know stabilize their lives. What I have seen in every neighborhood that I've gone into where we put shelters, is that you know there's always this. You know fear that happens because people don't know who they are. You know people who are experiencing homelessness always get this rap about their dangerous and what they're going to do, but they're humans, and not necessarily that's not necessarily so I think the framing of who the folks are is important to think about them as humans and not really, you know somebody who's out to get you so jocelyn. That was not what I indicated it's with our students are concerned. Our parents are concerned our alumni are concerned, and we really want to work together towards finding a solution because, as we stated in the letter we sent to the mayor, we care about the well-being of all new yorkers, I don't think there's anyone that would question the commitment of our employees and our students to better the neighborhoods and communities where we live and work. It's just. We have gotten a lot of questions about this and we I'm not hearing a lot of answers. Okay, I hear you I haven't. I mean I do I stand by what I said. You know we'll work together, we'll work together with you. May you know we certainly you know, I know I speak for project manual. I hope I'm not talking out of turn we'll make connections with you all. You know also. My team will also to figure out. How can we work best together? I think maybe we should hear about the security plans right. That was kind of one of the questions that vanessa alluded to downtown alliance has alluded to there's a lot of questions in the chat about security plan and whether or not there's a curfew. You said that people aren't thrown out on the streets, but is there a curfew that they have to be in at that involves the security things like. That would be good if you can address that now and after that, we're going to hear from open hearts friends of fidei and go to community board members rosa chang, then justine and andrew. Do you want to talk about? There is a curfew at the site and jody in terms of the numbers of security. That's there sure. As I mentioned, we plan to contract with a security firm, the same one that we use at the Lucerne, so they already know our clients. We expect to have 25 security guards on shift, a few of whom will be externing patrolling external to the building. We are our director of security. Charlie mulham has a strong relationship with the first police precinct. As eric mentioned, we already work with you guys at six water street, we're the operator of that hotel, so we've been able to fortify our relationships with the precinct over the last few months and charlie is actually meeting the nco solomon tomorrow at the radisson location, to start planning and putting measures in place. We also have a good neighbor policy. We expect our clients to act in accordance with principles that we put out in the good neighbor policy. They sign it. The good neighbor policy has multiple components and for people who are either not a good fit clinically for our program, who have concerning behavior in the community we're able to transfer them to other sites. We have appreciated that DHS allowed us to stop backfilling our beds at the Lucerne, so our census dropped from what was 283 to now 235. So it's a more stable population, it's clients who we know, and I would be remiss to say that you know one of the bright spots for me personally in kind of being caught in this crossfire as a provider is having had the opportunity to get to know many of the men who we serve and they are brave and courageous and struggling and trying to get back on their feet, and many of them are making extraordinary progress, and I just want to give that context. But certainly if there are issues, if there are people behaving poorly in the community, we want to know we will plan to be in touch with all of whomever wants to on as regular and routine a basis as you want. We really we strive to be responsive, transparent partners and if there are issues we'll mitigate against them and we will be tightly coordinated with the local precinct and will have significant security operation in effect, would you mind if I just interject one second, just because you mentioned the hotel? That's next to me, chris! No, okay, I hear ya, but no. I I'm dismayed a little bit at the reply only because you want to hear about it. Quite frankly, you should know about it. We don't want to be the ones to tell you. I don't know how to say that. Clearly enough, I know jody that you do good work, but it would be better if it ran like the operation on water street did where we don't get a lot of complaints where you are on top and the security is done that we do not have the problems that the upper west side has had that. I don't want to have to call you with problems or anybody for eric or project renewal. You should take care of them before they head out onto the streets and that's part of one of the dialogues. I appreciate your openness to hearing what our feedback is, but we really don't want to be the extra security on the streets. That's what jocelyn is saying that you and your team are supposed to be, and we don't have enough of that as it is because of the situation with the amount of homeless that we have right now, which grows, and I've spoken to joslyn about this every night. When the subways stop we are, we are a end of the line location in lower Manhattan. You have dozens more people up on the street, so while getting 18 people off the street is amazing, we're seeing hundreds of people on the street down here and it grows weekly and we're not at you know, evictions restarting yet so understand. That's where that's coming back, I'm gonna go to open hearts and they have two minutes. I believe we have from open hearts corinne lowe, hi, so so caitlyn from friends of fight. I said I could have a little bit of her time, because I want to also read a statement from a resident of the Lucerne shelter because I think it's extremely important for impacted individuals to be represented in this conversation and I'm very disappointed that there aren't any on this call today. So what I want to say, I'm a community member on the upper west side, I'm not a professional in this space in any way, I'm a I'm a college, professor and a mom, and I got involved in this because there was a lot of you know vocal discontent with the shelters in our area and for me you know, I thought that was morally wrong and unjustified by the facts on the ground, because for us having the shelters here has been an opportunity for service and virtues and for forming deep and meaningful community bonds. And so I want to do a couple things tonight. The first thing I want to do is tell you that these transfers are wrong. This is unjust. This is not the correct decision, and I think we heard from d from DHS that there really is no justification for this happening. If this space is available, there are things that it could be used well for such as further de-densifying wards island, where there are still five to six thousand people in congregate, shelters while we're having a Covid-19 resurgence. There is no need to move a shelter that is operating well. That has just reached stability because it takes time to reach stability in a new location that has just reached stability and strong shelter relationships and traumatized. The people there who are in substance, use recovery where stability is paramount to their actual successful recovery and traumatize them through this destabilizing move. So this transfer is wrong, but at the same time I am dismayed by a lot of the comments I'm seeing in the chat and hearing that has a tone that says that you know these types of people shouldn't be here. There are children in every neighborhood of this city. Your children are not any different than those that aren't live in different neighborhoods of herds of the city. Everybody has to share responsibility for solving the crisis of homelessness in new york city. Would it be better if mayor de Blasio had committed to permanent housing at the beginning of his term? Absolutely, but that's not what's happened, and so we have homeless individuals. We have single adult homeless individuals and some of those single adult homeless. Individuals are in substance, use, recovery or current substance users. They are still human beings, they still deserve a safe place to live, and if you say not in my backyard, all that means is that it goes to someone else's backyard and that's exactly what we're seeing now, because a small group of wealthy residents on the upper west side hired a lawyer to say not in my backyard and so now they're trying to move it to your backyard. But why should it be moved from place to place? You know these are human beings and we can open our hearts to welcome them, and so that's what we try to do with the upper west side, open hearts initiative, and I want to tell you that I hope that you build a single adult shelter. I think it would be wonderful if it was a de-densification of wards island. It could be an employment shelter, and I want to talk to you about the ways to support that shelter. So what we've done on the upper west side is that we have created spiritual, walk and talks with local faith leaders who meet residents from the shelter and take them for socially distanced spiritual meetings out in the park. We've created weekly community-run, aaa meetings that take place in the shelter we've created free stores, so that we can triage donations from the community and sort them and make sure residents are able to pick out exactly what they want without further burdening sort of the shelter system with needing to sort those donations. We've created resume writing workshops, we've created free exercise, classes in the park and meditation classes, and through this all we have been enriched ourselves through these deep bonds of community and friendship and opportunities for service that we are forming. Our children have been enriched by the opportunity to serve those in need and when we see people in need- and we are fortunate enough to live in high-rise buildings, we should not be saying get this out of my backyard. We should be saying how can I help? What can I do if you don't like seeing poverty in your neighborhood, you always have the option to use your resources to solve it. Now. What I'd like to do is read a statement from the someone who goes by the homeless hero. He is a resident of the Lucerne he's one of the men that will be transferred and he I'm happy and proud to now be able to call him. My dear friend and he asked to speak on this meeting tonight and his request was denied and I want you to hear his voice. This is what he said when he first learned the news. Yes, before you go down that road, all I needed was an email to get him on and I couldn't get one so he wouldn't deny. We are delighted to have him participate in his statement. Okay, so that okay and he well, then he can join. I can tell him and he can join so. I called my friend the homeless hero, and I told him that you know they were being moved, and this is what he texted me back. What I think bothers me, so much is the relationships we built this far, this more than anything we residents never experience such warmth and respect, meaning from us. The upper west side open hearts initiative. This is not the norm for any of us. Many of us have fractured relationships with family and friends. This is one of the reasons why we're experiencing homelessness, to have a community come out with open hearts was transformative in so many ways. It touched us in ways that a thousand aaa meetings could never touch. Our hardened hearts became soft again and began to beat at a normal and healthy pace through the actions of open hearts initiative, we are able to know what it's like to be human again. Moving around is normal to us, but being cut off from a lifeline of love is like a death sentence. The mayor has sentenced us to a spiritual and moral if not physical death, and I don't know how anybody can listen to those words and have dry eyes. This is the trauma that is being inflicted on these men by moving them senselessly, without a single justification. Just to appease some individuals who hired a lawyer who happens to know the mayor- and I think that is absolutely outrageous- I'm also happy to answer any questions about the experience of having the shelter in our backyard because it has been completely misrepresented in the media. There's a lot of confusion between street homelessness and shelter homelessness, and I will say that it has been a incredibly meaningful and wonderful experience to be able to welcome the shelter with open hearts, and I would be glad to work with the community board down there to put the same services in place for a different population. Thank you. Well, I think, and that's good, as I said that's great to hear, because we would like to get those same kind of services for the people who are on the streets in lower Manhattan. I'm sure we could probably fill an entire shelter alone with just the people sleeping under the fdr. Okay. Thank you very much for speaking. Thank you for reading his statement. Tammy mariama is that you no jody is that you no jocelyn, of course, hi. Thank you karen. You know the statement is very moving and I know that you certainly care and I'm what you are doing in the upper side. I really do hope that we can replicate down here the one of the things that we did when we identified our system of a little over ten thousand men were also the identified watchmen and so throughout our system, where they were congregate, most of the single men women in current. We did these by them, so we don't have five to six thousand men you're breaking up you're breaking up joshua! Oh yeah, can you hear me any better? Getting close? Try? Okay, so I just wanted to make sure that the information about five to six thousand men on what's on is not true. We did identify our entire system, that's why we have just over. We moved on ten thousand men and women into the hotels because we wanted to save lives and not have the pandemic on wreak habit through a system. Tammy hughes. Thank you, jocelyn, let's tammy who's. Next, who wanted to speak, I think corrine covered friends of fidei unless there's a something I don't know on that. I think she took time from that. We're gonna ask patrick cannell from the fidei neighbors association to speak thanks tammy, and thank you to everyone for hosting us and being here tonight, I'm patrick cannell, I'm president of the financial district, neighborhood association. In addition to being a member of community board, one I've lived in the financial district for over 15 years. I also work in the financial district. I live at william and john street very close to this site. I also work on william and exchange very close to this site, so I know you've heard from a few of our other neighbors tonight and we'll hear probably from some more. I think part of the frustration is that we need facts. I was surprised by the initial presentation jocelyn and the lack of very specific facts. So that's not meant to be a criticism as much as it is to encourage that there be more meetings. I think we need to have more meetings so that we're able to get enough answers to the very legitimate questions that my neighbors and friends have raised. I want to echo tammy's earlier comments on jocelyn. We know and corinne as well. We appreciate and know your passion, and I want to assure you that my neighbors in the financial district are a compassionate group of people we really are, but we also have legitimate questions about something like this coming into our neighborhood, as would any neighborhood, particularly as I think it's been pointed out, where there's been zero notification, which jocelyn thank you for acknowledging that, at the top of your presentation, there was no community notification whatsoever, so I hope you'll commit to future meetings and doing so as soon as possible. Vanessa asked earlier about the analysis that you refer to as the mayoral analysis that was done for the financial district neighborhood association. We echo pace's call to have a any written memoranda of that produced. I don't think it's fair that such a memorandum be shielded just because it was prepared in part by the law department. I think the public needs to see that the public has every right to see that thank you for as well for talking about the security plans, but one of my concerns and it relates directly to the services that will be provided to whoever ultimately inhabits the shelter is what financial resources has the city committed to this specific site currently and what will be committed in the future. We all know that the city is in a budget crisis and we want to make sure that folks aren't moved here and then just totally abandoned. So can you speak jocelyn, at least to the financial commitment that the city is making so all of the during the pandemic? This is considered an emergency and so we're using emergency funds at this time, but in terms of our shelter system, there is a negotiation that happens to cover costs, rents, social services, in this case the rent, the negotiation for the hotel, there's a contract that happens between the hotel association and the provider, and the bill right now is through emergency services because of the pandemic. The separation between the temporary nature of what's being proposed right now and what sounds to be the future imagined iteration of a permanent shelter that permanent side of things is that something that will go through because I imagine it would have to be pursuant to a lease so either that's going to have to go through euler preview or a section 195 review. A notification is that the plan is that, what's going to happen so and we yeah so patrick thanks for the question. Typically, this is different, so we typically providers or developers bring us a building, and so we've had this this building being used for quarantine. So we will we're soliciting proposals now to make it an adult family shelter. Once we get a proposal through the procurement process is recharged and rated once that is finalized and the you know the person, whoever gets the whoever turns in a proposal and is awarded. Then we start the work in getting a contract, the landlord and the provider. There is a lease that happens between the landlord and provider. Our contract is with the provider, and so then we work in a contract with the provider paying the funds through to the provider and they pay the rent to the landlord, but that's a whole procurement process. I can't because we don't have a proposal now we have said that we want to turn this into adult family right now we're seeking proposals. For that to happen. It is very transparent. There will be a meeting. You know I'll, be coming back in front of all of you to answer questions about what that is, but an adult family shelter. It is managed through otda, our regulatory 491 part 491 in this state regulates us, and so we have to meet certain criteria to be able to open one of these shelters, our just one last thing, patrick. Could I just say this: the agency, you know when I started here at the agency a long time ago, shelters are sprang up in the middle of the night made in 2017 a commitment to be very transparent when we bring shelters to community. I remember coming in the middle of the night and opening shelters. We don't do that, so you would know once a proposal is charged and raided. We will be talking with you know: community board one, the public get an opportunity to ask us questions. We will be able to answer questions that you may have so right now. The plan is to move into adult family setting and we can use it for an adult family setting because it will be able to meet the criteria difficulty set up chairman I have just one more moment. You did actually anticipate my next line of questioning, which was about the 2017 tournament, turning the tide on the timeline. Yes to these commitments. To that, thank you. First of all, will you commit to additional meetings? Yes, sorry, my ij person aaron is on the phone on the call hi erin, and so I think this is not. This is not the last of our meetings. I think it is important and I'm you know I am certainly willing to come and talk with you all again. I am willing to answer as many questions that you have. I do have a stop tonight, but I certainly am willing to come back. I want you know for me right. It's important that we make relationships. I think relationships of course, as a social worker is where it is right. So you could say to me you know you could tell me you know whatever you want to say, and I can hear that and figure out. How do we help there's some things that at this point I can't help you. I can't tell you it's not happening tomorrow. I can't say that, but I want to think about. How can we do it together? That's you know, that's my commitment. Tammy, you have my commitment to come back. Patricia you know, iga will set it up. I am available to come back who couldn't commit joshua, yes, tim patrick, patricia who answered me? Okay, it was me so when you come back to the community- and you are talking about a permanent shelter, the community will want to know why you're looking at adult shelters and not potential adult male shelters and not potentially family shelters when we are a community board, uniquely qualified with our amazing schools, to support families, and we have a large amount of public schools down here. There's a large amount of community welfare and opportunity for family shelters. We do not have support services, you have to bring everything in for a men's shelter. So we would like to be a part of that dialogue in the community to try and help what we can. So because the comments that you're yeah could, I just say, you're telling us we're getting an adult male 1 temporarily. I think it's a permanent shelter. I think we're conflating two things right now the man single men from the Lucerne are coming. Our plan is not to make it a single adult. A men's show there's an adult family shelter right, so it is. We can't because the building doesn't have kitchens making a families or children a shelter. However, my senses of family to children has been declining. Families are not coming into shelter and even before the pandemic, that number has been going down the theaters right now, no offense. You need to wait six months when evictions I've seen that I absolutely hear that right. What we see in community board, one is insane because people cannot pay their rents. We've had this dialogue, we've had families and people come to us already, so that is part of the discussion that we would hope that you would be open to looking ahead, and I know I am open to tammy in in the community board bringing us buildings that could be family for children shelters. They have to have kitchens, they cannot be congregate right. So this is a different setup. If there are no kitchens, I can't use it as a families or children's shelter, adult families, because you know there's two different regulations, one that follows families or children. Apart 900 from the state single men, single women, adult families, part 491, so I can't use this building. But if they're buildings you know in six months, if there's a you know, we start seeing people coming in. I certainly would welcome from you or any buildings that you think could be a family children's shelter, but I just need to interrupt you all. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! It's 7 27., no you're, not no you're, not I! But we it's 7 27! You have already stopped at eight tammy, tiffany, windbush, okay, we'll take a look tiffany. You skipped tiffany, yeah and she's with friends, she'd like to speak first of all, patrick had patrick. Are you finished? I did have one more quick question if it's okay- and I just want to- because I thank you jocelyn for committing to come back more and as often as you can back. I think that will be helpful, because one thing that this community needs right now and that was lacking by this being dropped on a friday night- is that we're living off of rumors and news reports, and I wonder if you can just quickly address when is the planned move-in date and then to perhaps dispel a rumor? Can you confirm that no one has moved in to that facility, yet no one has moved into that facility. Yet we are anticipating the week of the 19th promos to happen. If the building is ready, we will do it earlier, but nothing is happening next week. We are working now to prepare the building, we're working with project participation. It's not until the week of the 19th. I will tell you if it's ready early and I have an empty building, we could start but aren't usually- and do you think you could have another meeting with us next week if we don't get because it's 7 28 and we're not going to get to all the questions, can we get a meeting next week with you? I am game okay, so we can talk about that later. Can we get tiffany winbush to speak, tammy, yeah, sure and tiffany? I am very sorry. I thought that corrine took your time, so no I'm tiffany winbush thanks for giving me a moment to speak. I just wanted to mention that I am a 15-year resident of the financial district. I live here along with my husband and we are raising two kids here and we often use that plaza. That's near the radisson for play because, like so many new yorkers, we need that extra space. I think I'm here just to share the perspective of you, know a parent and not only a parent but a parent that realizes that we have homelessness in our community and we know that it needs to be be addressed. There hasn't been. You know much to be said here about the lack of transparency that the city government and the mayor has provided with us, and I think that's one of the biggest and the main concerns that we have. You know if there is, if there are programs on the upper west side, where these gentlemen are able to be successful, and this information has been put into place and we can clearly see that it's not efficient to do the move. The big question is: why is the move taking place because you're really re-traumatizing them when they're already going through a system where they're trying to better themselves, we've heard so many within our community? Who said you know we could be here to support a family shelter. So if we know that permanently that's what wants to be done at that particular location. How we then activate ourselves right now to begin to prepare so that we as a community, can welcome that family shelter and be prepared to volunteer provide resources whatever it may be. You know, surely I do not have an older kid, so I'm not in a position where my older kid has to walk by themselves, and I know that it's a concern of a lot of parents, but you know whether you have a younger kid or an older kid that safety perspective is always going to be top of mind. I just want to say that you know there have been so many voices within the community who said we are ready and we are ready to mobilize and help that shelter once it becomes a family shelter. So if we know that the process takes so long for a new shelter to get out off the ground, why are we using energy now to focus on a temporary solution which we should really be looking long-term at a long-term solution for that permanent shelter? So you know I am just here speaking on speaking as a parent, not necessarily on behalf of parents, but really just you know, a subset of fidei residents that know that. Yes, we realize that there is an issue within the community. We see the unsheltered with the homeless encampments and we know that there are people now who are housed into shelters, and we know that this needs to be an issue that it's an issue that has to be addressed, but transparency, I mean you know, we're all adults right. We have on our big kids, you know pants, tell us, let us know as soon as there is information. So as patrick mentioned, people are not going off of press reports and rumors the rumor mill has been just you know out of control, but that's because we don't have any information, so people have to really make it up as they go. So you know I really implore us to start focusing on the long-term issue of making sure we are housing people for the long term, instead of looking at short-term solutions that you know aren't going to help anyone in the interim. So thanks for taking a moment to just listen to me this evening. Thank you tiffany. I do want to remind everybody who is commenting in the chat and sending question answers. This is a recorded meeting. This is a public meeting so make sure that what you're saying is what you'd like to live in infamy in public realm forever. If you do then great, if you don't, then I suggest you be careful on your comments, because some have been inappropriate at best and I am attempting to monitor, but that goes to the youtube channel as well. We don't advocate violence. We don't advocate for nastiness. This is gotta, be decorum and I am sorry to even have to make that announcement. So now, returning back to the questions, tiffany, did you direct a question back to jocelyn or project renewal yeah? It needed an answer. Yes, and actually some of it was was asked when patrick was speaking, but we talked about the proposal process to getting that family shelter off the ground. So what do we need to do to as a community to help push that along to help to be mobilized and prepared when it is in our in our neighborhood? Because if we have enough time to plan, we can serve as a resource to those families within the family shelter. Can I just jump in for a second because jocelyn? I think you made it clear that it's adult families, not families and spirituals. I was going to say that it's adult families, adult families, there's no one in the family under 18.. They are sometimes a mom with a son, a son with a mom he's taken care of or a daughter on this you know. So they do you know so, but I do think folks experiencing homelessness, appreciate and welcome any service or you know tiffany's, not just you know, families putting honesty. This particular building cannot have families with children on the 18th, but there is an and a letter. The commissioner stands out every year asking for community force to bring us to the effect. You know you're breaking up, jocelyn. Sorry, you know, I said, I'm sorry, I'm keep falling back. You know I say annually the commissioner stands and they're out saying: do you have building you could bring to us to create whatever shelter you think the building can and can be used for, but because it's not families or children under 18 there still is a need. Once that you know we get proposal once three because connect whatever provider, I will be doing services. There would absolutely welcome any community, a member, any community organization to work with whoever the provider is there to help with the residents that will decrease in the particular shelter. Thank you. It's 7 35 we've got to move along since you have a heart. Stop at eight tammy who did you want to rosa we've got rosa we've got rosa justine and andrew, and then I did get another question that has been coming from many of the community board members around, and it is if this isn't. If these men are being moved to an adult men's shelter, why is it not possible to help the men who are currently on the streets in the neighborhood, and that is a fair question to ask as the numbers recede you've receded numbers on the upper west side, you're moving 240 to 35, not 287 as the numbers recede in this temporary vision, especially with it getting cold? What about the people on our streets in our community? So I talked earlier about- is the population of those who are children on the street and on what needs they have. We've been able to since may actually open 1100 beds off of those ones sheltered on the street. It does take lots of engagement, and so outreach providers are out doing that work. So it's parallel tracks, so the folks want sheltered on the street. We do have providers doing that work to bring them in. We continue to do that. That's 24 hours a day. It's seven days a week. It never ends, but they're not eligible to go to this location, correct they well, they could be right. Every person who comes into a system except those unsheltered come through our intake right. So if a person wants to get a bed, they have to go through our intake for those unsheltered, it's a different process, those who are on the street. So if there's a person you know, jocelyn is on the street and I want to come in and I want to go to this particular bed and we have space. We are making it possible for that to happen. It does take, though, really strong engagements over time for that to happen, people they have to build trust. They have to make connections, they have to feel safe and come in, but we've been able to make that happen, and I talked earlier about 18 may seem like a small number for 18 people who have been entrenched on the street. That is a big number for us. You talked about the end of line people down on the end of the line. We've been engaging and getting people to come in on that through that initiative, it's not the easiest work for those who are sheltered on the street. So yes, if people wanted to come into shelter, we would find a bed for them. It's. You know it's hard for those who have been on the street okay, so that is impossible. I hear you but the answer. I hear you, it's not it's not a direct, yes or no question which is really kind of what I was asking. I'm gonna go. We have justine, we have rosa justine, andrew mariama and michael franco. Unmute yourselves, make sure we're speedy, so we can get some answers and succinct, just rosa okay. Thank you! So much tammy and patricia and cb1 for arranging this emergency forum for our community get informed and voice our concerns, and I just wanted to point out that this type of community engagement is actually what the mayor's office should have been organizing and having with us for full disclosure. I am also the president of the condominium board of 20 pine street, which is a 408 unit condominium, just one block away from 52 william. So I am expressing some of the concerns that have been shared with me in that capacity as well we're not all born with the same opportunities and challenges. We recognize this and I very much recognize my own fortune in life and diversity of people and experiences and viewpoints is one of the most amazing things about being in new york city, especially in these challenging times. We need to give each other, including the people who are currently experiencing homelessness, some compassion, and I hope that we are able to do that tonight. But where I draw the line of safety, the city has a responsibility to provide a safe public realm, and I do not support a city action that would increase incidences where I am threatened with physical violence on the streets, not every homeless person undergoing treatment for substance abuse and mental health issues will be violent or is violent, but it is inevitable that congregating 235 men with a history of these issues in a single building without exterior space, will increase violent events throughout the neighborhood. I'm voicing the concerns of our community when I express that we do not want to be walking down our exceptionally narrow sidewalks, fearful for our safety, and I'm not talking about the perception of safety. I'm talking about the actual physical safety vanessa from pace pointed out that her students are actually concerned because they are being followed and actually physically harassed on the streets. So it's actual physical safety. The fact sheet from project renewal that I saw earlier today ends this presentation tonight. Just do not reassure me that there have been sufficient steps and considerations taken to ensure that our physical safety is intact within our own neighborhood and the constantly changing statements of what is proposed at 52, william, which is you know, permanent versus temporary family versus single men. It doesn't give me the confidence that this is anything other than a fly by the seat of your pants effort to move the men out of the Lucerne, as has been stated by all the previous speakers. Lastly, on a totally separate note, I notified the radisson building management on august 16th that the roof of their water tower had blown clear off and that the water tank was left open to the elements, including pollution and vermin, and they left it untouched for over a month, and so since this is actively being used as a Covid-19 shelter, were you even made aware that the water that you have been drinking there has been compromised since at least august 16th? Thank you, rosa jocelyn. I don't know if you have any follow-up or know anything about the facility. I don't know anything about that and I'll certainly look into that. Is that a question that eric and jody could answer since they have? No, because eric and jody's not at this site right now we do use well, I thought they did a walkthrough. I don't know anything about any water issues, I'll stop with that rosa, okay! Well, the tank was literally, the roof was blown clear off and there were big gaping holes at the roof of the water tank, and it was left that way until very recently, and I will follow up as soon as we get off of this chat yeah, and this is lucian from cb1. The department of environmental protection and department of buildings have both been notified and are responding to our office about what next steps should be taken in terms of inspections for safety and water quality, and then I just want to jump in because throws up for letting us know yeah. I want to jump in because I'm sorry, no I'm just saying that I certainly would father have not. I had not and just a quick answer to to rose's questions. There's the concern is about how many people are being treated for mental illness and for drug drug substance abuse yeah. So can you give us that information? If you can't supply it tonight, can you supply it to us next week at our meeting you're asking me numbers of people who are well percentage? Even this is you know, I don't have numbers or percentages. I think lots of us all have some mental disorder. No, but I mean these 235 people. I don't know the answer to that, patricia. Okay, all right! So sorry, rosa justine is next yeah. Thank you. So much thank you all for being here and for speaking and so okay, I'm gonna go quick. I have three things topics I want to touch on number one jocelyn. Thank you! So much for all you're doing and your approach to everything. I have a real issue with the misinformation that's being put out there. I think part of this reason why there has been such a vehement. As far as I'm concerned, it's a via response against these gentlemen being moved downtown is because they're being labeled sex offenders, drug users, criminals. I think you need to get back to us with information as to see the population. What are their issues what's the deal? Are they really dangerous? Are they people who are not dangerous? These are things that you should know because you've been working with them. I so love to hear what corinne said, because from her perspective, these are people who would be welcome in our neighborhood, because they are not going to be following students, home and attacking them or threatening them. They are people who would be very welcome and happy to be in this neighborhood. That's number one so information and stopping the misinformation. That's out there, because the only way to combat let's say I'm sorry, but it's hate, it's hate. It's fear is information, so please provide that number two. I challenge the public officials that are on the call right now, if they're still here as well as jocelyn and whatever your superiors are in your agency, it is an unreasonable rule or a situation that you need a kitchen to put families with children into a into a shelter, especially looking at where we are now in the world. Every one of those hotels have refrigerators and microwaves and coffee machines and sinks. That is enough to feed breakfast and probably lunch, and you can take. I understand the rules are what they are. I get that I'm saying to you change the rules. You don't have to tell me what the rules are. I get it and I obviously you have no power by yourself, but I'm thinking that we really should make a movement and push to change the rules, because there are things that can be done, that will change and make it feasible. Okay, all these every one of those places have food available outside there can be vouchers givens the people, the children can get hot meals, the children get hot meals at school, they'll be getting breakfast and lunch at school, and then you have a hot. There are so many ways to address this situation and by saying to our neighborhood, who was opening and welcoming, with open arms families with young children to our schools, the 11 schools that I forget his name, but I think it was christopher. The gentleman said that all in the neighborhood they're all there, my child, my children went to those schools, they're excellent schools, and how wonderful would it be to give these people these people with who are houseless or homeless? Then these children, the opportunity to be with our kids and for our kids to be interacting with them. It's insane, sorry, that's wrong. It is unreasonable situation and I understand why there is a rule there. I think that it needs to be changed. I think it needs to be addressed differently and I think it's time to change the rules we gotta move on. Okay, if I would answer if she has it, what does this all cost at the shelter in Lucerne? What does it all cost downtown? That's all I have to know well. Can I just answer a few things, just a few things. First, I am I said earlier and I'll continue to say that chinese children need to be able to be in places just like you and me with you know, and the regulations of the state, and I believe in that right. So that's something that I will ever tell you I'm going to fight to change it this, and at this point we don't need families or children studies we have more than enough at this point and we have a trajectory to bring more on. So that's let's park that, but I also I also want to say that you know the folks who are with us are not, unlike you and me right, not unlike you and me, and so I don't think we should be coming back and saying. Oh justin carter has this disease and jose carter? Has this substance abuse problem? I absolutely don't think that's good. I don't. I can tell you, that's not something I'm going to be doing hold on justine hold on justin. Let me finish what I'm saying to you, and so it is for us to be talking about specifically about what these things all these individuals have don't agree with it. I don't agree with it. Every person and every family have situations it's a mixture of whoever or whatever they bring, and we work stabilize the individuals and the families that we work with. I am not coming back to you with percentages of what who has what that's something I'm telling people I'm not going to do, and I certainly don't expect that project will do that either. I think there is a way for us to work together without labeling. The folks that are in our system, in our in the Lucerne coming to the radisson or any other part of our system, these are humans. These are not people who we have to say. Oh that person has this. You know I disagree with that. I absolutely disagree with that, and so the validation of all folks that I serve and I serve because I love my job and I was you, know, doubled up as a child could have been homeless, and so I recognized that people look at me and say you know, but I have been right there to be homeless. If my aunt didn't take us, they would have been home. It's just passionate to me and I don't want to tell you that my mom has x y and z. When you ask me who is that homeless person? That is not okay. I understand what you're saying if I could just respond to say this. The reason why I'm asking is not because I care- and I think there are people justine- no I'm gonna. Have you not respond? Justine, we're running out of time. We need others to speak. Andrew 49 mariama tammy, thank you andrew mariami, you're next hi, as tammy said, I'm mariam I'm a member of this board, but I think I want to speak more as a resident of this neighborhood, respecting the reason that I got the I'm getting the opportunity to speak is because I am a member of this board, but I think I'd rather speak as a resident of lower Manhattan of gold street for my entire life and sort of like the resident 911 person. There are a number of people on the on the board, who are advocates for 9 11 health issues, but I have been literally since 2002 since I addressed, then president bush from the world trade center, as reported by routers. You can look it up if you want to that's how long I've been doing this, so I've been really bothered by the fact that 911 health has not come up when we are in the midst of a pandemic. The CDC guidelines suggest that people not be moved during the pandemic. Okay, unless there is an overflow to sites to accommodate shelter, decompression or to reduce crowding and higher shelter, demands or isolation sites for people who are confirmed to be positive for proven, 19 or quarantine sites for people who are awaiting to be tested, or no, that they were exposed to Covid-19, 19 or protective housing for people who are at increased risk of severe over 19. but automatically homeless. People are at increased risk for covenant 19, but so is the lower Manhattan community. Most people here have many additional comorbidities to Covid-19 19 by virtue of being 911 survivors, and I think the fact that the mayor continues to not take this into consideration that we are in the midst of a pandemic. This is a health crisis is abhorrent. It is disgusting I mean I could come up with a whole list of words. I think the fact that he is not here is disgusting. I'd rather talk to him. Clint eastwood empty chair then addressed my concerns to you at dss or DHS, because I do not blame you. This is his fault. We're talking about this thing as it is as if it is a fate, a complete that is disgusting, we're not. We should not be talking about we're moving them into the facility they're. Coming. That's what I keep hearing you saying, I'm angered my neighbors are angered. My friends are angered because we did not have conversations before we got to this juncture. We need to roll this whole thing back. I would call upon the other elected officials that are here that they insist that the mayor's office attend these meetings. He's not sending people out like sheep to represent him, he's too afraid to address the issues and that this not be allowed to happen until there is real dialogue, real conversation from everybody, that's involved and everybody that will be impacted, including the homeless, people that are there and the homeless, people that are here that live in our community. We have our own homeless population. The same mayor came in here in July and ripped people from city hall because they were homeless. That was his reasoning. They weren't and they turned out. The majority were not even homeless. These were occupied. These were residents of new york, they were protesting, some were homeless, those that were not homeless were helping. Those there were. There were doctors over there, nurses over there psychologists over there. I know for a fact: I met them in their own recording it's. We have all the data anybody wants to see it. He ripped those people from their home that they'd made for themselves at city hall by virtue of them being homeless, and then close city hall not only to the homeless, but to this neighborhood to the taxpayers, to the people that elected him close the entire perimeter forcing pedestrians, including mothers with strollers and children, and seniors and people with disabilities into the street facing oncoming traffic. That's how we had to walk for up to five blocks at any side, given side of city hall, so on the park road side, all the way up to duane street around to broadway. It was all closed from the literal perimeter of the park, including the sidewalk. We could not all right mariama sorry to interrupt you, because it's 7, 54., okay, so captioning not I available complete what you're hearing not only for a lack of engagement, but there is a lack of planning and it is seemingly dehumanized. It's a horrible thing to do to the people up there to move them when there's advocacy and money and success to destabilize them that in itself, none of us are agreeing with. We have worked with DHS. We have worked with project renewal. You have come to our community board meetings. We have supported helping the homeless throughout this issue. We've worked with you guys and with the city on sanitation issues and other issues. So we are not a community that does not care. We are a community who cares about the people who are actually living on the streets. Here we are a community that cares about the rising sense of homelessness, the impending doom for evictions, for families and other people. We are a community board who has rebounded after 9 11. sandy, you name it you've thrown it at us, but we have also seen the mayor. Throw people out of city hall park have endangered things planned. We want a plan, we want to know the plans are in place. We do not want to be responsive. Those days are done. We want to see the plans in advance. We don't think those people we agree with gail Brewer. We don't think that these people should have to be forced to move. If jocelyn you went to these men- and they said out of the 235 80 of them said get me out of here. We need to go, we want to be someplace else. I would think that was a humane thing that you could offer them and plan accordingly and give project renewal the opportunity to plan for a building, but we're talking about moving in what's justifiably weeks, and you don't even know if the water tower is fixed because I, the developer, hasn't, said anything there's so many things in here that need to be looked at and that's there are more questions that keep coming up. You know how does security work project renewal can come back to us and answer many of the curfew, questions and safety and security questions and the operation questions, but no one has yet been able to answer as mary alma and everyone has said, the basic question that we have asked that you cannot answer other than it's a mayor's directive and he needs to answer for that. These people are safe and secure and you're ripping them out of their place. We're not saying we don't want them because they're homeless, we're saying, is he inhumane? What you're doing? We also want to help the people who are in the streets of cb1? There are no places as you've stated, that people can come off the streets in cb1 and yes, we understand, there are many places. They may not be appropriate for 52 million. Maybe they need to go to a different type of facility, but we want to see more action for the people who are here in cb1 because we see them, we know them, they used to live in city hall, some of them because not everyone was a protester. There were homeless people there, but at the end of the day the mayor doesn't see any of them because there are gates that he put up- and I think that's the problem that we have is. You are doing the best you can with the resources and services you have, and I appreciate you coming and listening and being a part of this meeting to hear all this. We don't want to hear that it's a fade of complete. We want to be able to plan for the community to help the homeless here, help whoever needs help, but we want to make sure that this is a plan. This isn't just a knee-jerk reaction, because he's chosen to pit community against community to the detriment of a group of people who are happily getting services according to open heart and others. I mean they're calling me about just jump in and add. We asked the mayor's office via DHS a few months ago. Could we use the hotels in our neighborhood that are closing for low-income housing for homeless people, other low-income people for our neighbors, our friends that are being evicted? Well now it's been extended, but that then it was a crisis we're going to lose their homes. We don't want them to have to leave the neighborhood and we use these buildings. We were told no again via vhs on behalf of the mayor, because the program was going to be temporary only and he refused to use hotels as permanent housing for people. But if this is, if this facility is being used for adult families, then it means that it can be used for people who don't have children under the age of 18.. So the answer is really yes, that these hotels can be used as housing and that's kind of you know one of the things we've talked about long time in community board. One is building a base of diversified, affordable housing, downtown and being able to have the teachers, the city workers. You know the kids from families in the neighborhood who cannot afford to rent down here. So thank you in a way to the city for proving proof positive that hotels can be turned into affordable housing, and maybe we can solve those crisis instead of just moving people around as well as our homeless. It is eight o'clock very well. It is eight o'clock. I know you have to leave. I think that was the last. Can I have closing word absolutely. I am. I am grateful for the time that you gave to me and to project renewal and for the respect that you showed to us. I've been in other meetings that have not been the case. I know this is difficult. I know that you know. Decisions were made that now we are we're working with and we're following up on. I did. I do commit to coming back. I do understand. I've been doing this for a long time, so I understand the feelings and I understand how your perception. I understand that I got it, but you know sometimes- and I said early on that- I wouldn't tell you something- that's not true. So you know we are working to move the men anticipating the week of October 19th. If the building is ready, we probably will move earlier, but we're shooting for that time. I'm hopeful that we can make connections and relationships. We can continue the dialogue, I'm hopeful that we could figure out ways to duplic to replicate some of the work that was happening in the upper side of current gave us some ideas around. I'm hopeful that you, knowing that project renewals good service, that they've been doing that we can continue to make those connections with the project renewal staff. I'm hopeful, I mean, I think time is what we have and we can certainly figure out how to use the time appropriately as we move towards that date. I can't tell you on this call that this is not. This is going to stop her. I cannot tell you that, but I do want to tell you that I am. I am here to answer questions I'm here to give you answers that I know I did not know about a water tower issue. We're gonna follow up on that immediately, but I appreciate the time and I appreciate the respect for patricia and tammy. I certainly appreciate that elected officials are still on and you know you have. You have my commitment to come back and just speak to all of you. Jocelyn I'd like to thank you for you. We want to thank you before you leave before you leave. Can project renewal stay on to answer some of the questions about program, security and other things that were asked? They may not know the cost to transfer the people from the upper west side down and the overall budget and whatever the city is paying for the hotel, but they can answer the questions about services that they offer. There's been lots of questions on security in terms of how does curfew work? How does you know where are people allowed in and out? Are there you know, is this a type of facility that people are only told that they have to leave during the day? Those kinds of questions are really important for quality of life. Things and we'd like to know how that happens. We are, of course, sad that it's not going to offer options for the street people on our streets, but we want to know what services are offered for these people. How does security work for the community right and what is the? What services are rep are able to be replicated from the upper west side and which ones aren't that you're going to have to do before you move and will all the services be available before you move in? I don't I don't you know, I want to speak for eric and jody in terms of staying on. I know that we are we're able to do another meeting or to to answer those questions, but I leave that I don't want to talk to you eric or jody, but I'm certainly willing to come back and answer those questions to be present to help the questions you might have for the department of public services, but maybe we can jump on email tomorrow and try to figure out a date schedule a day, eric nodded. So if eric is available and jody isn't available, if you are okay with them answering more questions about their fact sheet and their services, I think for the even if you I think that would certainly help the community eric jodi. You go with that or I'm certainly willing to for a while longer. Thank you. Thank you guys and we will talk soon, thanks, jocelyn. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thank you. Jocelyn, okay, do you want you want us to eric? You? Have you have many questions that came about security? So that's you know security and services. That would be really, I think, probably great. If I can find the link from the community board website, we did post your fact sheet, so that is out in the realm, but it would be good and I can certainly take questions I'm trying to read them along about other services. Those were the biggest broadest categories and I'm going to go through and see if I can find the other ones as well. Okay, I'll make a few general comments about safety in general and then jody can fill in any other any other blanks. I totally understand the question about safety on the streets. I without pitting one group of homeless people against another. I do want to say there is a huge difference between people who have who are on the streets and have refused services and help and people who have agreed to be in shelter and accept the services and the constraints and the rules that come with living in shelter and while there was enormous a number of reports and photos and statements about violence associated with the Lucerne. The fact is that there were there were no violent incidents of violence and there were no arrests for violence of our clients at the Lucerne and there were no investigations by the police department. For that. So I understand I under totally understand the concern, but- and there were absolutely men who didn't behave so well- who violated the good neighbor policy and eventually, as jody said, we moved many, if not most of them to other places where we felt the environment was more appropriate for the challenges that they were facing and, to be honest, the 235 men who are now at the Lucerne. If you were first of all, if you were to talk to the head of the 79th street block association, you know she would tell you that the situation today is remarkably quiet that that the men are not out on the streets. You know congregating in ways that make people uncomfortable or nervous. I actually live five blocks from loser and I walk it. Quite often, I've seen that myself, but the men who are there now they've kind of learned that they've kind of learned the drill, and I suspect that, whether or not they're happy about being moved downtown. They have a much deeper appreciation for what they're getting into and will be, will be pretty respectful if they're not downright scared themselves. So that's just some. That's just some context about the population themselves in inside the building, as jody said, we'll have lots of security and we're installing or we're having the hotel, install security cameras in almost all of the visible locations, so that we can record on what we can't see directly. We will have staff that will be walking around the neighborhood. Some of that will be uniformed security, and some of it will be engagement. Specialists who are really peers, who know the population know who we're working with and if they see our clients out on the street, they can engage with them and we'll have ways for for people in the neighborhood to connect directly with us, so that, if, if you see something happening like right now, there's always someone at the shelter who will respond to that, and we certainly, you know, will and that's no different than the process that we have at all of the other hotels that we've been operating, all of which have been kind of remarkably quiet, so that that's kind of an overview of safety and security and I'll. Let jodi talk more about some of the details and also finish what you starting to talk about the services that were available on site. Oh one, last thing: all of the fifth all of the staff that that will be working at this hotel are the same staff that are working at the Lucerne and they're all the same staff who are working at the third street and kenton shelters with these men. So the staff and the budget associated with the services we've provided has all moved with the men. There's no reduction, in fact, there's some increases in funding and services, so the program is essentially the same. We've had to obviously reconfigure the spaces in which we offer it, but the staff and the programs are really the same as the ones they had in the shelter the ones they've had in the Lucerne jody yeah. I mean, I think, eric you said much of it. I just wanted to add, because I, the question about curfew keeps coming up. There is a 10 p.m. System-Wide curfew that DHS imposes this does not mean that we lock our door our door. Our front door is open on a 24, 7, 24 7 basis to all of our shelters, but clients who come in after 10 pm at night risk losing their bed so for clients who come in after 10 pm. We sit them in a chair. We give them a snack and we go through a process with DHS centrally, because they're sort of the managers of capacity across the single adult shelter system and a determination is made as to whether we're supposed to then give the client a bed at the Lucerne or the radisson, as the case may be, or whether DHS is going to provide transportation for that client to another available bed within their system. So there's no barrier to coming inside and there's no ejection of someone out on the street. The question that comes up when people miss that 10 pm threshold is whether they will in fact secure a bed at that specific site or whether they'll get a different bed within the DHS shelter system and there's typically transportation. That comes along with that one at night associated with a change in placement associated with missing curfew and there, and you will see people coming in and out of the shelter after 10. That doesn't mean that we're not enforcing the curfew, some of our clients work and have jobs, and obviously, if they have a pass for work, they'll come and go based on what their work hours are. There was also a question about what they do. During the day. There used to be a rule that that shelter people had to leave shelters during the day, because they it was presumed that that they should be out working or looking for a job or are getting their benefits. I think that rule was was eliminated several years ago and we do not push anyone out and even if we, even if we were thinking of doing something like that, it would be the last thing we'd be wanting to do during a pandemic, because the point is to keep people as socially isolated or socially distant as possible. So no one is pushed out into the streets during the day and and we will be offering a full scope of programming and including, as jody said, 12-step programs meetings with their caseworker or entitlement specialists, or peer engagement, folks or recreational programs that we'll be offering on-site okay. There were several questions about security as it amounts to why were people removed from the facility? I think it says here was it for security breaches basically or criminal activities are they removed? And if so, what happens to them? Yeah sure I you know, we had dr transferred out a couple dozen clients from the Lucerne, based on repeated violations of our good neighbor policy, and our good neighbor policy has several different components: we're essentially encouraging our clients to be good neighbors, so we're prohibiting a lot of noise in the community external to the building. Yelling screaming those types of things we're discouraging loitering and people hanging out and again, we use our engagement specialists and our security guards to engage clients who are congregating outside the facility or on the block to encourage them to come back in for services. Use of drugs and alcohol are against our good neighbor policy. Public intoxication smoking, income inside the building is prohibited and congregating outside the building or in the community to smoke is also prohibited. Littering is prohibited and we've added, of course, use of masks, as required under our good neighbor policy. So we, you know repeated violations of the good neighbor policy can get you transferred out of the Lucerne or the radisson. As the case may be, you know, some of our clients are more behaviorally complex and can act out, and if that happens repeatedly in the community, we would certainly try to transfer them to a more appropriate facility. We think these transfers were really helpful at the Lucerne. Not only did it decrease our head count by about 50 clients, but it created a more stable population of clients who we know better, so we feel like we have some harmony at this point in the community. I also wanted to add. In addition. Yes, I'm sorry, can I just interrupt you for a sec if you, if people can't smoke inside the facility and they can't smoke outside in you know in front of the facility, where do you expect them to go to smoke? So this is. This is an issue that we've that we have raised with with DHS. We need to identify a place and we very much think we should identify that and know what all of us know what it is before we move clients in. Otherwise you know people will get angry. We need that okay. Well, hopefully, when you come back to the meeting next week, you'll have some more information on topics like that. Absolutely okay, jody! I'm sorry! I interrupted you. I think I just I wanted to add you all heard from corinne lowe from open hearts. You know, in addition to the scope of services that project renewal provides at the Lucerne through our contract with the city. The open hearts group really took it upon themselves to add an additional scope of support for the clients that we serve so they've been doing voter registration events, spiritual walks, other group activities, you know doing talking, events to welcome and engage our clients and that's been really meaningful. I I've worked at the department of homeless services for 13 years before coming to project renewal and never quite understood what the what the best practice model looked like in terms of a community coalescing in a positive way around a shelter, and we feel, like we've achieved that with open hearts, with the constellation of supported elected officials with that program, as the borough president mentioned, that we were about to launch with goddard riverside, and all of that has really enhanced our programming at the Lucerne. You know it does make it heartbreaking to leave and it also serves as sort of the best practice model that we'd want to replicate going forward. You know in all of our programming that project renewal operates in terms of really cultivating those meaningful relationships with community groups that can be transformative in the lives of our clients. You know one of the things that I'm saddest about in this move is that part of the goddard riverside program was was something called greenkeepers? You know everyone has observed that there's less trash, pickup going on the streets and so part of what we were going to do with them was they were going to offer employment and stipends to our clients to actually pair with them and go out into the immediate neighborhood and do beautification projects for which the clients would get paid, and you know and they'd be visible in the community actually doing something to help clean up the community, and we lost that with this, you lost that with the potential move. Yeah that's heartbreaking. Quite frankly, I mean it'd be great. It would be great if they would have that up there, and then we could replicate that down here for people who are living at the six water street, shelter that you manage. That would be the ultimate win-win for everybody in the situation, but yeah question about mask enforcement. How do you enforce mask use and where I'm going to be honest, that is, that is a tough one. I have been sent hundreds of pictures of people not wearing masks with the assumption, by the way that they're all our clients and a lot of them aren't, but we we have masks available constantly. We do enforce that. Someone is wearing a mask when they leave the hotel. The security guard checks that all of our security guards and anyone who's roving has their pockets stuffed with masks. So if they see someone not wearing a mask, we give a mask. I was told that we distributed 10 000 masks in the first month that we were at the Lucerne, but when people are out in the streets, the enforcement of it is it's a challenge. We talk about it all the time, but it's I'm not gonna promise that you'll never see one of our clients not wearing a mask. It's a challenge. Can you talk about job training? Do they all receive job training and what kind of job placement things do does? Is project renewal able to help them with joe? Do you want to take that yeah sure so? 15 of the clients currently at the Lucerne have jobs. Not all of our clients are currently seeking employment, but for those who are interested, we have vocational counselors on site. We provide sort of tactical support around resume, writing and interviewing and job search support, often in the food service sector. Sometimes in the social services sector, in the homeless services sector, we place clients in a variety of sectors. We also have a signature, culinary arts training program, which is a six month program and people leave with their food handlers, certificate and placements at catering companies and restaurants, and all of the clients at the Lucerne or the radisson will have that full scope of programming available to them. I know it's. I know it's in the fact sheet, but it's probably worth saying here that that city, beef kitchens will be delivering individual packaged meals to the hotels and we will be distributing those meals, three meals, a day to each person in their room, so we're not having congregate, dining in the in a restaurant space or anything like that and we'll connect with each person at least six times a day in their room, to make sure that they're, okay, to do temperature checks and and just to keep tabs on everybody and DHS, comes on site every few weeks to do Covid-19 testing for our men as well, and if anyone is positive, they're immediately removed to an isolation hotel our test, our test, our recent testing results have been incredibly low. I think, in the last month we've had four positive results across all of project renewal, fantastic. I apologize I'm trying to look through the questions as we're here. So one of the questions that came in is about community engagement after the shelter system has been set up and because the comment that was made is temporary has no time limit on it. According to what jocelyn has said, she could not tell us how long temporary is so what kind of process once and if you are in place at 52. William, do you do with public engagement for feedback with the community? So in a typical shelter situation, a cab would be formed, a community advisory board, and that would meet more often in the in the beginning stages of a shelter when things are still settling in and then usually they meet less often afterwards we're. We are certainly willing to meet. You know quite frequently, if it's productive and constructive, you know absolutely and we'll be we'll, be walking around also charlie, our head of security. If he hasn't started it already, he'll make personal connections to all of the businesses in the neighborhood he'll give his personal card so that people can reach out to him he'll. Do that with any residential buildings in the neighborhood as well. The program directors will make themselves available also, so I so that's kind of infinite day-to-day basis engagement. But if you want to have more formal meetings as long as they're as long as they're, constructive and helpful we're happy to do it. So one of the things that I do that I did read through the chat. A lot is that there are concerns, I'm happy to hear that charlie's going to go around to the neighborhood downtown alliance. Actually, I know for a fact needs some outreach and connection because they do so much work on our streets and it would be very good for you to connect with them to work out for dsny. There are still many people wandering the streets. So when you do outreach and things like that and charlie's walking around, is there any reporting if there are to help the people that are on the street? Dhs says there is, so how does DHS get the information if, while your security team is outside, if a homeless person comes to you and says? Oh, I understand that I, this is a shelter and I'd like to come here. I understand that, that's not possible. How do you help that person? So that is a fantastic question and it's a real challenge, because there's a there is frankly a disconnect, I think, between the various you know, providers and what their roles are: we're not responsible for street outreach, and I- and I know one of the problems that we will have- is that neighbors are going to assume that anyone who appears to be homeless within a one block radius of the Lucerne is probably one of our clients and there's there will be confusion about that. We typically don't engage with people who aren't our clients and that's it is. It is a coordination challenge. We don't know those people, our security guards, aren't really trained for engagement with strangers. You know around those kinds of things. That is something we should we need to work. We need to work with you in DHS and how to handle that, particularly if there is a large population of street homeless people right in the immediate area. That is a problem that we face, that is over by six water, and that is a problem that we will face at 52, william as well, because there are street homeless everywhere. Around community board one, so that is going to be a concern that we have for you are you looking? Are there outreach workers today on the street all the time engaging with those people? Already I mean, in other words, is the problem that they refuse to engage or is the problem that there's not enough outreach workers? Would the answer be? Yes, yeah, okay, yeah. I think I certainly think it's it'd be very fair and appropriate to ask DHS for some additional outreach workers in the neighborhood under the circumstances. So thank you. That would be great sorry, kids and husband running around the back of me. I apologize so I think we've asked we've answered a lot of questions about the jobs. We've answered a lot of jobs about security. We've answered a lot of questions about you being able to help the people or not outside, but you would be able to report. I would assume that with better resources and connections than we do to help get other people who cannot access your facility, it's a 28, how long yep I'm hoping to get through a couple. Other questions, maybe 10 minutes. If you don't mind, do you have any idea how long it usually takes you to set up a location, October 19th is a week of is a target that they mentioned. She said, or sooner the you know, it's a I think, based on the conversations that we've had and the city's lack of notification. We understand that you're not moving in on the fifth. But what is a reasonable timeline if nothing changes and they are not? How long does it normally take you to set up and transfer a property into an appropriate location for this type of a temporary shelter? Well, I think I think we've certainly learned our lesson that doing it when it's too rushed means that the first few weeks you're both setting up and trying to serve people at the same time and that results in disorder. So so we've certainly been pushing for more time and there's a lot of negotiation happening around that, but really we're still getting to know the property I mean we only saw it for the first time. On monday, I mean jody- and I were there today because both of us were out for yom kippur and we've been putting we've been giving the department of homeless services a list of what we see as the requirements. In order for this to be set up to succeed or to succeed as best as possible, they are, they are absolutely working their butts off to try and get everything on that list done, and so are we, but some of it is you know it's. It should be when it's done as soon as possible. I is that typically a week two weeks it I mean three to three to four weeks. We three to four weeks is kind of really needed, so I'm just I'm just going to put it out there and say it directly as of this week, and when the mayor made the announcement on friday, there were people being quarantined in that location. So there's no way the work could have possibly started until you get those the people who are currently there out. If you're talking three to four weeks, it is unconscionable to try and open the week of October 19th because you won't be able to you'll replicate the problems that you had uptown downtown by not having everything ready. So I mean at the very base, if nothing else, that seems to be number one a priority to get everything up, safe and secure. The other thing, of course, is you know the community. Is the community is concerned for just like the upper west side, there's no different in terms of community concern for safety. There's a pre-k center. There are several schools, you've heard from pace you've heard from neighbors. So when you're talking about security outside, I think one of the things is to make sure that you are up you're ready. It is absolutely a seamless connection in that front. The people from open heart said that everything that they have goes with them, that this is not a restart which is really destabilizing for people and not fair, there's nothing. I disagree with yeah thanks, I'm sorry, I came out a little snottier than I wanted it to be. I apologize about that. So a couple people have asked the same questions of if someone is turned away for cause or does not make quote-unquote curfew, what services does project renewal offer or for them, and where do they go or do they just basically hang out outside the hotel beyond the security gates? No, as jody said, if someone, if someone's going to be transferred, we keep them inside the building until they're transferred on the DHS we'll actually come in a van and they'll go in the van to the next place. We would we're never going to push someone out into the street. I mean, let's be clear. One thing we all know is that everyone is safer when people are sheltered, getting services as opposed to on the street, not getting services. So it's not in our interest as a provider, nor just as you know, compassionate people to be kicking people out to a less safe environment for them and for the community, which is why, when which is why it's not a zero tolerance situation, if someone's you know caught not wearing a mask, we don't kick them out. We try and engage with them to get them to wear the mask and we're trying to attract and engage people towards better behavior, because that's the goal here, if the department of homeless services takes that person to a different facility, that person will become the responsibility of that other provider, often because we're a large provider and we have multiple sites with multiple conditions- we're sometimes able to transfer the person within our own system to a more appropriate place and that's usually better because it means that we can maintain the continuity of relationships with the person. Sometimes we do that and sometimes we can't okay, I apologize. I'm gonna ask I'm looking through the questions and we had. You know there are a lot of repeats, but we have over 400 questions that were emailed. So pat I'm gonna ask if you remember any questions that had not been answered yet by project renewal trying to say no. I don't think so, and I can't I'm not privy to those email questions. So no, I can't think of anything at the moment. I think it's 8 34. Why don't we adjourn and schedule a meeting for next week? That will also give us you'd, like an update. Clearly we'd, also love, if you don't mind, updating more of your fact sheet and we'd, be happy to post that and share that we'd like information to help the public help you if you are ending up. Even you are already in our neighborhood at six water street, and it would be important to know when the community sees things that are happening that are related to any of the shelter locations who do they reach? How do they do the outreach if they see someone who is not, I mean, obviously, you can call 3-1-1 for the homeless to report a homeless person and they either accept services or they don't, and we understand that. But the question is: what can we? What else can we do as a community right to help both you understand? What's going on around your facility and the people on the street? Well, can I can I interrupt here, you know when we have people come when we have developers come we ask for a number that the public can use. If we see a problem that we can contact someone is there a number that can be provided to someone in charge at the shelter so that we can publish and the public can use to call if there's a problem, so in all in all of our shelters and in all of our hotels except the Lucerne, we have a 24-hour number that goes directly to the desk at the at the hotel. So there's someone there who can respond. I have to say that what happened on the upper west side was that number got published widely and the number was overwhelmed with people calling either to just vent or rant or complain about things that had nothing to do with us and it became it became functionally impossible to actually respond. So so that's going to be a challenge here. Well, let's see if we can work something out, because maybe we can you know just I don't know, maybe we can have our district manager have it. I don't know, but let's see, maybe we can think about that and discuss it again at our next meeting, because we do want to be able to respond immediately if something is happening like right here and now that people see. But if someone wants to call and complain about something they saw three days ago, that might not have been one of our clients and there's nothing to identify it's impossible right all right. So, let's think about it. You think about it, we'll think about it and we can discuss it at our next meeting. Yep tammy. I want to thank you, I'm sorry. Yes, I apologize. I was typing an answer to somebody who asked about our location and being in a highly targeted area for terrorism and another one commented about marches. I will say that if there is a protest in a March, I am sure that the shelter probably does the same thing. Every other residential building does along the way and they station somebody at the door to prevent people from coming. In I mean that seems like a reasonable comment that I could guess on eric's nodding and in terms of the continuing terror threats of living down here in community board. One all of us have the same one, so I would suspect, if you're a resident, whether you live in a rental, a condo, a co-op or a shelter. We all experience the same thing and then a closing question. So we kind of understand for project renewal, because you are the city's contractor. If for any, you are still their contractor. So if you, if the shelter plan changes and the Lucerne remains a location, you still remain with that location correct. So you will be able to continue the work that you do with them. Yeah and you will still be remaining here- handling six water, oh yeah. This does. This does not negatively impact you guys, no, yes, okay and but we're all starting to get water only on a temporary basis at the discretion of DHS until the threat of Covid-19 subsides- and it does- I mean I'm sure people have heard the governor saying that shelter should be open, especially in his concern for the weather getting colder, and things like that. You know to be able to get more people off the streets, so that will in itself not allow de-densifying, and I'm not sure if you can comment in your operation hat how that will work so like, for example, yeah. So obviously none of us know when we're going to be. You know, returning to shelter and some of our shelters are still open and they're, not all emptied, but the density is enormously reduced. We've had a task force internally, that's gone through every single one of our buildings and identified what are the things that we think are needed in each building to make them as protective against Covid-19, as is possible, given their nature as shelter, and you know things like putting up. You know translucent pvc plastic barriers in between beds or changes in the scheduling so that far fewer people are eating in your meals at the same time, and we're doing all of that planning and anticipation of the day that we that we are moving back to shelter, but we don't know when or how that's going to be, and I don't think that guidelines have been actually been issued yet for what the requirements will be. You know from the state or the city for shelters in that in that moment, so I mean we're doing it, based on our best judgment and our knowledge of the facilities, but there's not like a formal set of guidelines that have been issued yet saying do this? Do this? Do this? Do this gotcha and is project renewal brought in after a location is determined or are, is? Are there people in project renewal who are part of the review team? We found out about the the radisson friday afternoon at five o'clock, that kind of answer's not for everybody, and I mean I'm so that actually makes me even sadder than anything else, because that means that yeah notice. Okay, I think we've gotten everything. It's not right. Can I just jump inside firefighting? I think your observation that the you know the existing use of the facility delays instead of startup. You know the review and startup operations. Is that eric? Is that at what point do you get? You do not yet have access to this facility and no, we, some of our team, visited it on monday and jody, and I saw it today so we've all we put together an initial list of requirements and challenges to be overcome on based on monday's visit. I mean we've been revisiting it and you know and updating it as we get to know the building better, but it's yeah and I don't want to put hey. I don't want to put you on the spot, and you know DHS is, I think not here, but just how real we had DHS come here and say that they're trying to do it by the 19th, maybe sooner, which is, I think you know a little mysterious for people, but how realistic it is it that this could be. Actually you could have that operation up and running in 18 days from now. Well I mean yeah. We certainly have moved into hotels previously with that amount of time or less, but we learned that while we were getting the men into rooms, we were still getting the wiring and the it connections and the computers and the printers and the access to cares and and the ability to set up schedules and all of that stuff was happening in parallel with the men already living there and that's what we'd like to avoid this time around how much time would be necessary to do that? A lot of it I mean some of it is dependent less on time and more on effort, but you know it. This is very compressed. Okay! Well, we'll continue that we, I think that you know just I'd, maybe consider that an open question here like what, when you'll, learn more, you know and again I appreciate that you I've, you know you and I've met in various circumstances, but I appreciate your being here tonight and your expertise, so I think, to the extent we're scheduling a follow-up. I think we're going to want you'll know more in a few days or something yeah, oh and there. Thank you. So I think thank you brian. I think that's a good way to close it down. For now we would certainly seek and long for more information and to hear back from the mayor's office, and things like that. We appreciate everybody's time and attention on this call. It is a very important topic, as we take care of people who need help and the people in community board one who still need help who are on the streets, and we look ahead for what we can do in the upcoming months and years. So we look forward to a continued dialogue jody eric. Thank you very much. I know jocelyn's not here anymore, but erin. Please tell her. We send our great thanks and leilani. Thank you very much for everyone who spoke tonight. Thank you for those I did not get a chance to call on. I am hoping we got most of the questions answered. All of the questions have been shared, we'll be trying to pull up others. So if we did not get to something, we will try and get the information out to you or for the next time they return. Also tabby. You lean. If, if I encourage the members of the community, if you have questions that you weren't able to ask or if you think of something new, please send those questions into the community board so that we can address them next time we meet I'll, also say, and for those sorry, we put up a web page on when we moved into the Lucerne with information about it, that's more extensive than what's on the fact sheet. So, for instance, bios of our healthcare leadership team, our clinical staff, some more information about you know. So if people want to go there, it's project renewal, Lucerne. I guess we'll change it from you know, slash Lucerne to slash radisson or something, but there is more information about about who we are and the services that are available. That's available there, that's good to know, I don't want, but you might not want to change that email address, because this will be their fourth location. At this point, I'm not 100, confident that you know there won't be a fifth or sixth, so I'd be careful. I want to thank you Brewer, gail, Brewer and yulin for coming and gail. I hope definitely that group of money and jobs does not disappear for these people, and you know perhaps they can truly look at de-densifying. So if there are jobs up there for people can stay there to have their jobs and for other people they can move to other locations to make it a win-win for everybody at that location who needs services. So thank you, everybody we do. If you want to stay in touch with community board one. You can certainly sign up to be on our mailing list. We do have a youtube. If you are on youtube, you can follow us there as well, and we have our quality of life committee coming up stay in touch with us through our website. Thank you, everybody and good night, great job, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all so much. Thank you especially you tammy. Thank you.
