I want to thank everybody who has come and recognized Manhattan borough, president Gail Brewer, because you do represent all our community boards.
I think you have heard me say over and over again that at the beginning of July 27th and the following time in board seven, there were a lot of issues when, without any notification same thing, the folks were moved from a hotel on 51st street up to the 79th street hotel Lucerne, and there were a lot of issues.
I will tell you that project renewal has made great strides with excellent services in the hotel, etc, and guess what, as you have heard, as members of Community Board, one and the reason that I am upset, is they got a Riverside community center, a settlement, house?
From, my perspective, for the city, to let that mind just disappear and say sorry , we're not interested we're going to move, and so that's why I'm opposed to it, and I appreciate very much the fact that this discussion is taking place, but I just want people downtown to know we arranged this.
You, know I have to say during this pandemic it's been an effort to keep the normal channels of community engagement up and running, and CB1 has done a great job of that, and that is why your community board is ready to take this on in this technically sophisticated way, and I can tell you I do a lot of community boards This smoothly, especially in a borough that President Gail Brewer, is not responsible for that.
This particular group of men from this particular facility at the Lucerne on the upper West side to the location that they are proposing without prior notice on Wall, Street and William.
You know sympathy for these men and the work that we want to do to stable, to help them stabilize themselves, and you know, get into permanent housing and live their lives and also be very skeptical of what the city is proposing, particularly here.
We should have a longer- term conversation about what is going to happen with that Radisson Hotel site and what is best for this community, including as Tammy Meltzer mentioned the many people who are already homeless and already living in our communities.
Lot of effort was made to make it work after a lot of services were put in place after a tremendous effort by a provider that does great work in other sites, I'm familiar with as well, and also just again for this for the city to do this on an emergency basis Be, without you, know, proper consultation and without really articulating a service or policy reason why this makes sense.
You know opportunity in community world one because we have a large homeless population here that needs to service, but.
I want to make sure that we can sit down with the city and plan for a shelter that can help families and people in need in lower Manhattan, and that's something that we can work.
So I wanted to see the rest of my time to community to speak, because I know that we're in a rush here, Assembly member, I, believe Scott Stringer's office has a statement.
I want to start by talking about who this conversation should be about, which is the 235 new yorkers experiencing homelessness, who are at Lucerne on the upper west.
Community, leaders, elected officials and project renewal have been working hand- Hand to address community concerns and provide the residents with the support services.
We all need to come together now to send a message to the mayor that we are not okay with this administration playing political games when lives are at stake, we need to plan to address homelessness, build low, income, housing and work with communities, and we need it.
I think this actually may be their fourth move, which makes it even more unconscionable in terms of humanity, but I will leave that to DHS to talk about So, DHS and project renewal are going to give their presentation now, which hopefully will answer many of the questions that the public the community is asking.
You, see I like to say that DHS is the safety net of the safety net when all else fails where they are 24, hours, a day, stabilizing lives and moving folks to permanently when the pandemic hit back in March, the single adult men and women are primarily in congregate settings and we thought about how do we save lives First, we started by really looking at the vulnerable senior population, and then we looked at.
We would welcome, shelters down in this area, we're using this temporarily, and we are going to turn this into a adult family site.
Briefly, project renewal is one of the oldest and largest homeless service agencies in New, York City, we house over 2000 people, every night, half of them in seven shelters.
, I'm Jody, Rudin, I'm, the executive vice president and chief operating officer from project renewal, as Eric touched on at project renewal, we work with nearly 15,000 clients a year to help them renew their lives through health homes and jobs, and that's what we did at the Lucerne So I'm I wanted, first and foremost, to give you a picture of the services that we're going to provide at the Radisson Hotel.
Then we started to look at the distribution where hotels were some areas, had more hotels and covered hotels than other areas- town, for instance, Upper, West side for instance, This site gives us an opportunity to use temporarily for de- Densification and gives us the opportunity to have a permanent shelter on this community.
One of the things that we wanted to do in this administration is to make sure that we have equity in where we have shelters and every community board we've been talking, about.
We, have people going through them to try and ensure that we do this with a little bit of grace so from downtown New York City for safe streets is Christopher.
It's great downtown new Yorkers has been created to amplify the voices of our community who are concerned for the following one: the safety of our children, two, the cleanliness of our streets and three.
Hotel, that's set up there, that's going to be turned into a shelter run by project renewal in DSS number one Diagonally acrosss, the street , there's an open area called Fosun Plaza.
Every person who is experiencing homelessness is a criminal right, and so I also think that you know to reframe that about who the folks are is important for us to do.
You know folks experiencing homelessness, having right to public spaces, too, And, but we will work with you all, along with project renewal and my team, to see if we can find a place where it is directly there I know I work down on a Beaver street someplace close or not , I.
Before you move these people, you are already destabilizing a community that is starting to thrive and prosper where they are taking them and putting them in a completely new location, destabilizing them entirely without having all these answers is not actually humane for them.
The whole crux of this is that we appreciate that these are real people that we're talking about and human beings, and we at the alliance have been advocating for the homeless for many years and with our work with BRC, I mean we know the on a first name: basis, most of the street homeless.
We placed 62 within our area last year, just 20 in the last month, and so I think we recognize when we're dealing with people who are struggling with substance, abuse and mental health issues like they're, but for the grace of God, and so we respect you Eric Jody, everybody at DHS.
The issue is having them on the street like what are the services you're going to provide, because the borough president is discussing sort of a criminal walking away from real services on the upper West side.
Call it what it is: a political move that is not really in their best interest, but , Jessica Allen's at first You know the review did happen and because of the density in certain parts of the city, the decision was to use this space that was being underutilized, giving us the opportunity to turn it into an adult family, shelter.
Why not utilize project renewal and their fabulous resources to set up a way to help the people who are on the street in CB1?
Some areas I talked about had more de, densified hotels, right, we're not intensifying the individual building with our workers to De- Densify, the you know, distribution of hotels, but I just wanted to pick on two things that you talked about.
The Manhattan consortium is one of them breaking ground, they're out every single day, 24 hours, a day, engaging those on the street takes about six months to build trust before people are even interested in coming.
I do not think there's anyone that would question the commitment of our employees and our students to better the neighborhoods and communities where we live and work.
You said that people are not thrown out on the streets, but is there a curfew that they have to be in at that involves the security things like.
Certainly if there are issues, if there are people behaving poorly in the community, we want to know we will plan to be in touch with all of whomever wants to on as regular and routine a basis as you want.
I said I could have a little bit of her time, because I want to also read a statement from a resident of the Lucerne shelter, because I think it's extremely important for impacted individuals to be represented in this conversation What I want to say, I'm a community member on the upper West side, I'm, not a professional in this space in any way I'm, a college, professor and a mom, and I got involved in this, because there was a lot of you know: vocal discontent with the shelters in our area and for me, You know, I thought that was morally wrong and unjustified by the facts on the ground, because for us having the shelters here has been an opportunity for service and virtues and for forming deep and meaningful community bonds, and so I want to do a couple things tonight.
So, this transfer is wrong, but at the same time, I am dismayed by a lot of the comments I'm seeing in the chat and hearing that has a tone that says that you know these types of people should not be here.
He is a resident of the Lucerne He's one of the men that will be transferred And. He asked to speak on this meeting tonight and his request was denied and I want you to hear his voice.
A lot of confusion between street homelessness and Shelter, homelessness, and I will say that it has been a incredibly meaningful and wonderful experience to be able to welcome the shelter with open, hearts, and I would be glad to work with the community board down there to put the same services in place for a different population.
Well, I think, and that's good, as I said, that's great to hear, because we would like to get those same kind of services for the people who are on the streets in lower Manhattan , I'm sure we could probably fill an entire shelter alone with just the people sleeping under the Fdr. One of the things that we did when we identified our system of a little over ten thousand men were also the identified watchmen and so throughout our system, where they were congregate, most of the single men women in current.
Thank you for as well for talking about the security plans, but one of my concerns and it relates directly to the services that will be provided to whoever ultimately inhabits the shelter is what financial resources has the city committed to this specific site currently and what will be committed in the future.
You know I'll, be coming back in front of all of you to answer questions about what that is, but an adult family, shelter.
Had this dialogue, we've had families and people come to us already, That is part of the discussion that we would hope that you would be open to looking ahead, and I know.
I certainly would welcome from you or any buildings that you think could be a family children's shelter, but I just need to interrupt.
I, think that will be helpful, because one thing that this community needs right now and that was lacking by this being dropped on a Friday night-.
I just want to say that you know there have been so many voices within the community who said we are ready and we are ready to mobilize and help that shelter once it becomes a family, shelter.
We see the unsheltered with the homeless encampments, and we know that there are people now who are housed into shelters, and we know that this needs to be an issue that it's an issue that has to be addressed.
Did you direct a question back to Jocelyn or project renewal, Yes, and actually some of it was, was asked when Patrick was speaking, but we talked about the proposal process to getting that family shelter off the ground.
You could bring to us to create whatever shelter you think the building can and can be used for, but because it's not families or children under 18, there still is a need.
Any community organization to work with whoever the provider is there to help with the residents that will decrease in the particular shelter.
Why is it not possible to help the men who are currently on the streets in the neighborhood, and that is a fair question to ask as the numbers recede you've receded numbers on the upper West side What about the people on our streets in our community?
If people wanted to come into shelter, we would find a bed for them.
The city has a responsibility to provide a safe public, realm, and I do not support a city action that would increase incidences where I am threatened with physical violence on the streets, not every homeless, person undergoing treatment for substance abuse and mental health issues will be violent or is violent, but it is inevitable that congregating 235 men with a history of these issues in a single building without Exterior space, will increase violent events throughout the neighborhood.
I think there is a way for us to work together without labeling, the folks that are in our system, in our in the Lucerne, coming to the Radisson, Hotel or any other part of our system.
And so I recognized that people look at me and say you know, but I have been right there to be homeless.
And I think there are people justine- I think I want to speak more as a resident of this neighborhood, respecting the reason that I got the The opportunity to speak is because I am a member of this board, but I.
We are a community who cares about the people who are actually living on the streets.
I would think that was a humane thing, that you could offer them and plan accordingly and give project renewal the opportunity to plan for a building, but we're talking about moving in what's justifiably weeks, and you do not even know if the water tower is fixed because I, the developer, has not said anything.
Project renewal can come back to us and answer many of the curfew, questions and safety and security questions and the operation questions, but no one has yet been able to answer as Mary alma and everyone has said, the basic question that we have asked that you can not answer other than it's a mayor's directive and he needs to answer for that.
We're, not saying we do not want them, because they're homeless We also want to help the people who are in the streets of CB1?
The answer is really yes, that these hotels can be used as housing and that's kind of you know one of the things we've talked about long time in community board.
Thank you in a way to the city for proving proof positive that hotels can be turned into affordable housing, and maybe we can solve those crisis instead of just moving people around as well as our homeless.
They may not know the cost to transfer the people from the upper west side down and the overall budget and whatever the city is paying for the hotel, but they can answer the questions about services that they offer.
But we want to know what services are offered for these people.
I know that we are we're able to do another meeting or to to answer those questions, but I leave that I do not want to talk to you Eric or Jody, but I'm certainly willing to come back and answer those questions to be present to help the questions you might have for the department of public services.
If you see something happening like right, now, there's always someone at the shelter who will respond to that, and we certainly, you know, will, all of which have been kind of remarkably quiet, so that that's kind of an overview of safety and security.
The question that comes up when people miss that 10 pm threshold is whether they will in fact secure a bed at that specific site or whether they'll get a different bed within the DHS shelter system.
You know, in addition to the scope of services that project renewal provides at the Lucerne through our contract with the city.
I've worked at the Department of homeless services for 13 years before coming to project renewal and Never, quite understood what the what the best practice model looked like in terms of a community coalescing in a positive way around a shelter, and we feel, like we've, achieved that with open hearts, with the constellation of supported elected officials with that program, as the borough president mentioned, that we were about to launch with goddard Riverside, and all of that has really enhanced our programming at the Lucerne.
You know in all of our programming that project renewal operates in terms of really cultivating those meaningful relationships with community groups that can be transformative in the lives of our clients.
It would be great if they would have that up there, and then we could replicate that down here for people who are living at the six Water Street shelter that you manage.
There is frankly a disconnect, I think, between the various you know, providers and what their roles are: we're not responsible for street Outreach, One of the problems that we will have- is that neighbors are going to assume that anyone who appears to be homeless within a one block radius of the Lucerne is probably one of our clients and there's.
We need to work with you in DHS and how to handle that, particularly if there is a large population of street homeless.
One thing we all know is that everyone is safer when people are sheltered, getting services, as opposed to on the street, not getting services.
Even, you are already in our neighborhood at six water street, and it would be important to know when the community sees things that are happening that are related to any of the shelter locations.
Maybe we can think about that and discuss it again at our next meeting, because we do want to be able to respond immediately if something is happening like right here and now that people see.
You know to be able to get more people off the streets, so that will in itself not allow De, densifying, and I'm, not sure.
Or if you think of something new, please send those questions into the community board so that we can address them next time we meet Also say, and for those sorry, we put up a web page on when we moved into the Lucerne with information about it If people want to go there, it's project, renewal, Lucerne, I, guess we'll change it from You know slash Lucerne to slash Radisson, Hotel or something, but there is more information about about who we are and the services that are available.
