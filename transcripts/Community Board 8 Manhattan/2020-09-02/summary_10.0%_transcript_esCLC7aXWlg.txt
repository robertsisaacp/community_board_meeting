Let you guys, okay, welcome everyone meeting of the transportation committee of community board, eight, my co-chair chuck warren and my other co-chairs craig why don't we get to the agenda?
The first item on the agenda is something that we back for reconsideration: a revocable consent application for proposed fenced in area, including steps planters, together with the snow melt system in front of 106 east 78th street.
Yes, all clear, so this application is to modify an existing area way, which is at 106 east 78th street between lexington and park avenue on the south side of the street.
So we're proposing to expand the green space of this area away, as well as modifying the fence, aesthetic itself and finally, as was previously approved by the community board at our last hearing, is a proposal to heat the sidewalk with the snow melt system below the sidewalk level, so that the snow melt system would extend for the full width of the townhouse from the sidewalk at the curb back to the townhouse facade, so that the snowmelt system would be maintained and in use and help to clear the snow and ice from the sidewalk in the winter.
I meant to come back before the cb8 landmarks committee, about the fence and the planters, and I know this isn't transportation issue chuck, but as long as the applicant is here and raising these issues, Well, the application was approved at that hearing so and that the design that I presented last time.
You have the school and I think it makes a lot of sense, and since you also said that defense, we discussed in a landmark committee, so I don't have no problem with this application.
Is that since we turned down the application about the extension , I think we probably did it in two parts, so we voted affirmatively for the snowmelt and since we voted down the application for the extension, I assume that the fence was in that you know in that part of the resolution and maybe that's why neither she nor I are remembering specifically discussing this fence, because I don't, I think So when you in the in the resolution, it's a matter of approving the fence and the planters, because there's nothing else up for consideration- and if I may just make one comment about that.
It's always noted and appreciated when an applicant does what the community board requests, but so I did want to apologize for my gnarliness and say that I appreciate it, but I'm looking at the resolution and all it says about the fence is a whereas clause, which is, whereas the fence at the front of the house is made of black painted painted iron.
and it's been obviously before our landmarks committee, because I've heard a member of the board seriously questioning the design- and I don't know how much weight that should carry with me in terms of approving voting on the application.
sort of like this is how the direction we had to go to make it accessible, not a dangerous situation, and so that the new stairs did not hit the front door and have no landing If that makes sense right, I understand I think, well, why don't we see if there's any members of the public that have any comments on this application?
when this family bought the project, they said we have a 1 foot, 10 landing, it's untenable and let's try to make an application to expand the area way.
I really think that we need to vote to disapprove this, even though it's already been built, and then we need to send a letter to the dob with copies of this correspondence, alerting them to the fact that they are approving things that they should not be approving without our approval, and we should be very strong in this, and I don't want to take up any more time, but this can happen again and once we and once this is of record, which now everyone's going to know about it, they're going to try to do it again, not this particular architect.
Okay, because I support what valerie said, I'm really troubled by forgetfulness on the part of applicants that they don't know or don't realize that they need to come before the community board or they need to go before the board before going to city agencies.
So I just can't support this on principle that I know it was built and it looks like it's a lovely job, but I see a second doorway to the right I just I'm troubled by the fact that I was not recognized by anybody and the landmarks committee, because I looked at the resolution, disapproved the original extension into the sidewalk.
I wanted to understand what the consequences are of voting no on the revocable consent and then my second question is: how do we make sure that this sort of issue doesn't happen again to the point that elita and others have raised?
Maybe barry might remember, but I you know from back to transportation a long time ago, but I certainly don't remember and the other thing is you said you know what are the consequences probably remembers the famous 96th street 12 stories, where you know an architect made a mistake in reading the zoning map and the park improvement district But then the department of transportation has the same has to make the decision.
You can just if I understood this speaker before I should be looking at this application Do we have the actual email or was it a conversation, So in looking through the presentation and I've been looking through the whole presentation on the community board website, all of the documents are dated january of 2020 and are presenting it as if this were, you know, had nothing had happened yet from what I can tell it is the the photographs on the dot-one sheet are those the original condition prior to the extension expansion of the sidewalk?
I think they did a very good job Is there a second there Well, let's put it in the affirmative, and people can vote the way they want.
Number three is a request to change the parking regulations on east 72nd street east of york, avenue and craig I know we put it on the agenda because someone wrote in about it, but is that person here?
We asked to put this on the agenda because some of the board members had talked about this and had come up in other contexts about parking and things like that, and this is the prevalence of illegal and counterfeit placards and impacts on safety, resulting from placard packing and parking in those standing zones and stuff, and that came up from some of the issues that we have chuck before we go there.
You know in a resolution that will go to the mayor's office and a number of the other agencies, but it's really the mayor's office that has to get control over this because placards are issued by any number of different agencies, but I'll throw open the floor to people who want to discuss this.
I don't know if there are any members of the public that want to talk about this issue, just a reminder: it's star nine times, to raise your hand if you're on the phone or to use the participants menu if you're a member of the public would like to speak about this issue, and let me just while we wait for anyone to possibly raise the hand just mention that in march of 2019 we did pass a resolution related to park and placard reform.
I'm actually just following up on what julianne brittany was speaking about in regards to the placards, so I'm resident of lifelong resident of 61st street between 2nd and 3rd avenue, and we have now developed a new issue and I don't know if that's going to be addressed by the committee.
I have my 85 year old mother here, and so there is something where I've seen how the traffic patterns in this neighborhood have changed because of the 59th street bridge and second avenue, and how it's all developed placards have been an issue because they cut off a lane across the street from us.
Now, please, let me know if I'm going on about something that we're going to be covering, otherwise, because I really do want to address the issues that have developed since the installation of the bike lanes on 61st and 62nd street, or, more so specifically, 61st street, because that's where we're going to talk we're going.
I mean people just take a sticker and slap it on something with a circle, a circle and it looks official you know, they're, taking up all the parking spaces and really, I think that the major or one of the major issues is that you know because of Covid-19 19 everybody who has access to a car is coming into the city.
I mean people don't want to ride the subway, they're afraid to take a bus, and so, if you have access to a car in any way, you're driving You know few months and when school starts, you know it's going to be another problem, but this is what I wanted to ask when we passed the resolution a few in 19 about this very issue.
I thought these bike lanes were to help people coming over the 59th street bridge going directly across to central park, so I assumed that the bike lanes on six one and six two would start at second avenue.
Can I ask if anyone present knows whether they've put in the bike lane , let's say between second and first on 61st or 62nd street Yes, yes, so basically the signage has changed all across 61st street from york avenue to fifth avenue.
So I think when it comes to the permanent bike lanes, then you know, hopefully more people will be back and we'll be able to get a fuller dialogue on it.
So not only do we have to dodge right off the curb, e-bikes and bicycles, but then a lane of traffic to get in a car, I'm even willing to do that, but then remove the muni meters from across the street so that we can actually have some place.
Why don't we go first to sort of reverse here, but when we go to old business- Yeah you're right, jordan, now sorry valerie, I feel for these people, and I just think you know once again Nobody is really checking in with either the community board or any of the neighborhood associations that govern not govern these blocks, but at least have a look-see into them, whether it's e-60s or and we're going to go back and report and talk to them about it.
We passed a resolution last month for 81st 82nd street between york and first on saturdays, and I think we just left it.
You know I'm a regular cyclist in the city, my kids, my wife or our cycling family we get around regularly by bicycle, and so some of the new bike lanes that have come up have been very helpful So I just wanted to raise to the to this committee that cd7 on the west side- just I think it was yesterday or the day before passed, overwhelming vote for a resolution for a two-way protected bike lane on 72nd street and to keep in line with what this committee has done earlier in the year to ask for a cross-agency study or cross-agency group to work on river to river bike lanes that work from east river all the way to the hudson.
If we were going to look, you know, take up the issue of having the city pass, something because the state law came to legalize these things and scooters and stuff like that.
