Think in having these important conversations is just really terrific right now, listen I'm really excited about tonight's conversation, because we're gonna actually be able to hear directly from small business owners about what they're going through what they're, seeing and, of course, most importantly, how all of us can be very helpful to them and what they're trying to do so I think, let's get it started.
I'd also like to thank Vaughn and Julianne for taking their time out of their busy day today to speak about their experiences and also their hopes about moving forward.
Considering our current situation, a leader camp, who is a wonderful engaged positive chair as well as all of my former colleagues on the board, your support, energy and collaboration in particular of tonight's presentation, is both inspiring and gives me so much hope that we can really make a difference in helping our local small businesses survive and thrive.
Our sidewalks are stuck in our shelves of toilet paper and all the other essential needs, and of course, there are- and there will continue to be massive challenges and changes to our lives with covered, but the simple things like working from home, if you could wearing face coverings in public hand, washing and sanitizing on a regular basis, all meant that we collectively were able to flatten the curve.
Not only did these simple measures aid, our health care workers, it also gave me personally and I'm sure many other people and a sense of agency ownership, responsibility and, above all, control in such an unsettling situation, which is very often not the case in time of disaster and uncertainty.
Sadly, it's already too late, as you can see, by taking a walk around the neighborhood by focusing on that unspoken contract that I spoke about earlier and the spirit that flattened the curve, and we identified a number of guidelines that people can take or leave but bear in mind by adhering to these simple guidelines, you will be making it easier for your local cafes book, shops, bodegas, grocery stores, apparel stores and even Irish pubs to navigate the uncertain days weeks and months ahead.
It's important I think for people to have a message that they can kind of get behind and, as you look through it, it's quite simple: it's a number of guidelines and the first three which are really you know what we've been doing anyway.
You know always wear a mask or a face covering when you go into a store or any place of business, and not only are you protecting the workers there and you're helping to prevent a spread.
What push at the moment is a good lesson to just stay and if you feel at all ill and also remember that a lot of our local businesses are available online, you can shop online from a lot of local businesses and a message I think you're going to hear more later on is when you invest in a local business, you're investing on in your block, you're, investing in your neighborhood, and it's really important.
So if you are doing any online shopping and you can't leave the house, you can go online and another important thing to point out is you know, with the proliferation of a lot of apps, sometimes they're, not the very best for a lot of our small local restaurants and restaurants that provide delivery and take-out.
If you give yourself that bit more time to actually plan when you're going out to do your bit of shopping or running a business that you do, and that brings us to you know the final three little guidelines that we'd like people to be mind.
You know, ask the staff to handle merchandise, so they don't need to unnecessarily quarantine or have to disinfect or sanitize goods, and also this kind of it's a simple thing like when you're in a shop.
We've heard lots of stories of you know people getting anxious and getting into panic attacks in stores over the last couple of months because of what's going on.
But you know our businesses and other customers will appreciate it, and a little bit of kindness of flexibility goes a long way when you can't see somebody's face and you can't see their lovely smiles, so I'm, making a little extra bit of effort to be mindful it is, can really ensure that we can all collectively help restart New, York City together and well, if you wouldn't mind just taking down the poster, but for now, if that's ok, so that's pretty much it for me and we'll be sharing this document with our local business owners and partners.
I believe, by adopting the same responsible approach to how we conduct ourselves while shopping eating out and going about our everyday business, it will also give us a better sense of control over Hispanic and, at the same time, give our local business owners a chance to reopen grow, survive and thrive, and I just like to thank you all so much for taking the time out to come by and listen to what we have to say here this evening and I'll hand it back over to our moderator, Jessica well done, Michael.
I want to let all the attendees know that if you look in the chat, you can download a copy of the guidelines that then Michael spoke about just a moment ago, so that is available in the chat area all right.
All you know the old-fashioned stuff that people from the neighborhood were used to having it's been tough time in these times, because we've had to try to do many different things to keep our customers.
For them, I guess are what we've been having a hard time with lately is that it was hard getting workers to come in to work, because you know they were afraid to take subways and things like that.
The other problem we've had is that in this area, a lot of our customers look like they've left during that ademma con its March 23rd things all changed so who's.
Some people have it and those that haven't I, guess they leave and they call over the phone or I'm not sure what they do but and that's pretty much I, don't know other things we have done for them.
Guys are worried so I guess I, guess that has made them more aware that, oh, let me wash my hands, let me make sure I'm clean and that's what we've been doing lately to make sure there's no prevent you know no one's getting sick or happen as far as customers that come into the store and say I, don't want to wear a mask and things like that.
There were times I come in and I go I wonder why I do this, but you know something it's beautiful when Mrs Butterworth says thank you and says you know: I, don't know what I would do if you guys weren't there try not to get emotional, but so it breaks my heart, so I feel like.
If I wasn't there, what would happen to Mrs, Butterworth or others that need us, and you should see the letters we get and the thank-you cards, and sometimes people even donate money, say please, you know give this to the delivery guy you'll give this to the cashier.
Please tell us about the business and we'd love to hear what your what's happening with you and how again how consumers can be helpful as you start to reopen okay.
So you know the experience actually I just want to grow back just a little bit because I buy a lot internationally to offer.
First, it's a frightening time for that, and then you know how it will present, but strangely I feel incredibly optimistic, because there's no place like New York and don't want to be here.
I feel like people will always want to be in New, York I feel, like tourists will come back to New, York I, just think it's going to be a slow process, so much of it is going to be dependent on how landlords can absorb and I know it's hard for them as well, but how we're able to work out deals and that's still big question marks, but I believe that customers will come back.
It is like no other Street and, as I said, you know it's interesting, because I would have to pop into my store to take care of things and as people would take masked and gloves and everything their walks.
They always looked for me and would wave and then, when I was able to put things out last week, like everyone was like giving the thumbs up, I mean it was just so heartwarming and sweet and I know that customers that did order during this time they could buy anywhere because things get delivered all over, but it was really a matter of heart and love.
So we have we're gonna start the questions and I want Michael and Vaughn to be able to weigh in too but I'll start with you, Julian and maybe Yvonne can weigh in as well I'm really interested in the marketing aspect and how that's changed, and you touched upon that quite a bit because it sounds like you're doing some really new and innovative things, but I guess one has your marketing change just generally.
Quite you know, all the things he's doing to really showcase that he's, taking all these extra precautions to put his customers at ease, which you could market that as well, because I think it does.
You know, make certain businesses stand out, but anything about your marketing and how that might have changed throughout this first whack I mean I, don't like to talk about that.
You know I and I, accept lots of photos and done things that way, but really I think in terms of marketing.
To put you know, they're going to digest Annie, so I have to market that it's not something I want to market, but I do because, like I said some of you should see some of the questions when they come in is everybody.
Timmy is here today, so I know that that's like okay, someone sec thank God. No one has been so I have to market that I have to protect the stuff that are touched.
People don't want to talk about this subject, but at the same time you have to make them know that you have to let them know that things are clean, that yeah I've acts.
You know arguments with potential customers who don't want to wear them.
You want to weigh in on the mask issue at all I'll Julianne, because she's kind of dealing with customers on a one-on-one basis, so okay hasn't been hard to find masks on and yeah I, don't I think maybe in the very beginning, but we were closed, and so it really didn't matter and we were becoming aware who was making them, but now it's not at all hard I've.
So I've done my mouse I like the ones you can read out easier, but I think the black ones are more attractive, so I'm trying to get used to bad what I'm wearing but I mean there are so many adorable masks where customers have had some really cute ones.
There's no law for that, but I just didn't know, there's anything that you that you might want to just sort of say: hey when you come into the store.
You know if we can remind people with signage and which is the reason we kind of came up with that little poster and also just communicate to people what what's required, because I think you know over the last three months, a lot of people have been going stir-crazy and, of course, like people wants to get back out eating going to their favorite restaurants and cafes and bars that people want to have a sense that life is somehow returning to normal and I.
Think you know by you, know subtly reminding people that they have a little responsibility and to just put your mask on and just be mindful and one of the other things about the poster.
You know they don't want to seem like they're doing something.
That's too cool or my people might have some sort of a thing to say about them so and I think that's something that we can do is just to kind of subtly and friend, in a friendly way like just you know, reinforce the simple things that people can do, and that goes a long way because that's I believe, oh, they got us to flatten the curve in the first place, I think the young people that are the ones that don't I, noticed that a lot of my customers, they all wear, masks and they even come in with gloves.
Unfortunately, so it's been a tough time for a lot of people, but I am you know if we want to get back to some sense of the life we once had before and bringing all the good elements of that and leave some of the not-so-good elements behind that's fine by me and by following these simple guidelines we can really.
It really matters to our businesses, to our neighborhoods, to our city and to be able to shop local, so I want to thank our speakers for Julie, Ann and Vaughn and Michael, who have been invaluable, I.
