But the problem is, it only works if everyone participates and it's very hard to ask someone who has little faith in our government right now that this information won't be shared with ice and with other law enforcement agencies or if the individual cares deeply about privacy, and so with that, I would like to turn it over to Assemblymember Godfrey to discuss the bill.
You know if you're gonna test people, you want to provide that information to their doc, there's and health care providers and what took months to get this drafted, but once we got it enacted a it was very successful and B.
We better do something to guarantee confidentiality of this information, or else people aren't going to give up their information to city health authorities and again, I said to my son: isn't there isn't there confidentiality legislation to protect information, particularly with communicable diseases, as this is and again, I went to look for it and discovered guess what it isn't fair, and so we very quickly working with the New York, Civil, Liberties Union and several other advocacy groups.
You know if you're dealing with the city contact tracing people, apparently they will do things like offer to help in a hotel room for you or arranged food delivery, etc, and so we wanted to enable that information to be used for that purpose, but we said it would have to be with the consent of the person whose information you're dealing with and that's what the bill does it's.
You may think that D identifies them, but if you've got all the information that Macy's and the Facebook and all those other people have about you, they probably know that you're 6 feet tall and you were in Mason shoe department last Tuesday, buying brown shoes and that your size is 8 and a half so scrubbing information about you takes more than it did maybe 10 years ago.
My recollection is that, a few years ago we passed genetic information, confidentiality legislation which at least applies in New York, yes and I did go through the genetic testing, but yo years until I did it yeah, and so your other question.
It'll help contain it yeah and I think yeah for sure, and certainly knowing you know where people have been, you know, they've come in contact with I mean it's all gonna lead to, hopefully God willing some type of herd immunity if we can get there before we get a vaccine.
The cloth begins to run when the information comes into the hands of the contact tracing agency, so that postpones when the clock begins running, we authorized them to keep it an extra 15 days if they're actually using it racing so that it isn't just sitting around and certainly if it, if it turns out that the infirm that information is generally needed longer than that you know the bill is not going to be engraved in stone and, frankly, if between now and when it's enacted, if the State Health Department wakes up and pays attention to the bill and says: oh my god, you know 30 days isn't enough, it's got to be 60 or we're.
If somebody is more highly contagious than others, a higher percentage of the person's contacts might have become infected, but how many people they contact in a given period may not be any different from anybody else and again, if the, if the information is being actively used for contact tracing, you can get an extension of the time and then, when you're, reaching out to the contacts, essentially they then become the starting point of a new round of contact tracing and you've got.
It can be difficult to predict these kinds of things, but you know, given that contact tracing is already going on and the sooner we can get these protections into place right, the better.
My question, though, is what can be done, or is there any possibility for federal law enforcement to get this kind of data notwithstanding the bill, because you know through a federal subpoena or something along those lines, I mean.
You know there are federal laws about how the immigration people go about their business and, to a certain extent you can make a case that the states have authority under the 9th or 10th amendment to be to have primacy in areas relating to public health and if I was to change, I would I would make I think a fairly strong case that New York has this ability, if necessary, to protect public health to keep it out of federal hands.
Numbers for contact reasoning are still too low, in my opinion, for it to do all the success that we need it to, and so my question is: I mean I'm, assuming that, if this drill is fast becomes law that, hopefully those rates will increase, but have you thought of any other ways besides, just through protecting the confidentiality to help improve our number?
I. Think in terms of legislation, though, the confidentiality protection is the main thing within my you know, work area, okay, thank you and we have another question from card yeah.
I. Don't think I've heard stories like that in a long time, partly because hospital records are now almost all electronic, but the health department's confidentiality track record is pretty darn complete, but could something be written in the bill that all the information collected wherever it goes is protected?
The New York, State, Health Department knows exactly where and when that was, and what the diagnosed and that information doesn't get out, and it could do a lot of damage if it did the HIV data and all of that all has a very successful record of being kept confidential.
I understand also, obviously, information about symptoms that people may have been experiencing and then the people that they come into contact with, including household members, intimate partners folks who come and work in their homes, and then just you know anyone they might have come within six feet of and spent ten minutes or more with, and disclosure of this kind of information you know, certainly beyond the health authorities, would raise very significant privacy concerns and so I'm very encouraged to see the bill.
So, first you know these programs should be voluntary and it seems as though New York City's is that no one is being compelled to share information when they're called, and it really relies on a kind of active participation of the public, and that depends on trust in the system.
When it comes to sharing of information collected through these contact tracing programs, you know we would emphasize that voluntary participation means really informed consent based participation, and so that's something else that were encouraged to see kind of reflected in the assembly bill.
It's not going to reveal the identity of somebody who has tested positive for Cova 19 or displaying symptoms after coming into contact with someone who's been exposed to that person's contacts when they reach out they'll just inform contacts that they may have been exposed within the relevant time period, and so that's a great starting point for maintaining anonymity of the folks who are sharing their health information with a contact tracing program.
The information that I described as being collected as part of New York's program fits the bill and it all seems directly relevant to the public health purposes that are motivating this contact tracing effort.
This massive, very impressive contact tracing effort underway in New, York City, but you know importantly, the fact that we're facing a current health crisis should not be used as an opportunity to collect information and stockpile of government data databases for use for unknown purposes down the line.
It should be erased after it has served that purpose- and we were just talking about this with the Assembly Bill, but the kind of detailed contact information that's being collected through these programs may largely irrelevant for public health purposes.
You know change and it may be that contact tracing programs, as we were discussing earlier, require the detailed contact information for a longer period just to be able to reach out to as many people as possible, but there should be some end points to the retention of the data that's being collected as part of these programs and then ideally, but information should be kind of automatically deleted after the end of that period- or at least you don't know, mentioned this a little bit later, but de-identified and mentioned earlier.
You know the program has to impose strict limitations on the sharing of information that is collected through contact tracing.
Systems and databases should be tested by data security experts and you know kind of examine to make sure that they're as secure as possible to prevent inadvertent disclosure or hacking, and it seems as though there may be pre-existing health, different regulations or other laws in place that assure that health information is being maintained in a secure environment.
By focusing its effort on human contact, tracing programs, you know door to door kind of telephone based individuals, calling other individuals and asking for their information, and that concern relates to the digital divide that exists in New, York, City and other places in United, States them all around the world, and the fact that a lot of people may not have an up-to-date, smartphone or reliable data plan, and so any contact tracing tool that relies on an app that you would install on your phone might leave out large portions of the population and potentially portions of the population that are particularly hard hit by Koba 19.
You know in particular, I think to Bill does a good job of trying to address the disclosure of contact tracing information and it seems to be the key purpose of the bill in ensuring confidentiality the bill provides.
So this goes back to the purpose limitation that I mentioned before you know again we're only collecting this information because we're in this current health crisis and it's needed for that purpose specifically, and once we start letting it bleed out into other purposes.
I think then need to retain information for much longer periods of time, and you know I'll just kind of emphasize what the Assemblymember was saying.
It's just worth noting that the identification can be difficult and you know savvy technologists with access to enough other data often can readily reaiiy denta fie somebody, but the language of the bill, as I said, seems like a good initial protection on that score and then again, just going back to the purpose.
It really limits the collection and disclosure of that information again to public health purposes, and you know it seems like the core of this bill is preventing the sharing of this information, particularly with law enforcement and immigration authorities and in the context of administrative and judicial processes, and you know, especially at the state level.
In my view, I'm happy to touch on Russell's question a little, but unless we want to save that for him to ask again, but it's I think this is an important protection, even if federal authorities may be able to override it with subpoenas and court orders in certain cases.
You know, information being shared from the contact tracing program with federal authorities.
So there are, you know, I think it certainly would end up in court if that conflict arose and I think that there are arguments to be made against disclosure of contact, tracing information to federal authorities, but at the outset, even just issue, a subpoena.
You know that does go a long way in state court and again state law enforcement and local law enforcement like there are a lot of very worthy protections that are not subject to the same kind of override by federal authorities.
So if you know within this time frame where your identifying information is being maintained by the public health authorities, researchers say this is a person that we'd like to followup with and asked a lot more questions.
As long as you understand fully what you're agreeing to- and you know sign in writing that you're waiving the confidentiality provisions of this bill- that's another way to get more information and potentially a lot more information about people who have tested positive for come into contact with Co vat19 and that still respects Lewis.
Think the first point is really important: I mean even if you are even if the health authorities do receive a subpoena from federal authorities, it has to be reasonably specific to begin with, so they have to kind of know what they're looking for, and that is a protection in its in its on its own I.
Security provision and I know the Assemblymember addressed this and said that there are probably other laws or regulations in place that require health information to be maintained in a secure fashion, but I just think that having some outside data experts or some kind of security audit is probably a good idea just to provide added assurance that this information specifically won't be exposed to hackers, or you know, just sent in an email like a password shared by mistake or something along those lines.
I, do not have a technology specific background, unfortunately, but there are lots of experts who I'm sure would be willing to help out with that great, oh I see we have another question from Peggy price: hi yeah thanks very much so I've been reading that some people who have become victims of kovat 19, refusing to disclose the names of people they recently come in contact with there anything about the bill or any other way.
This issue of what to do about refused to divulge the names of people they've recently come in contact with so not from what I see to be honest, and it may be that other people haven't more information, but I do think that one of the strong features of this program and most of the contact tracing programs they've seen in general or that they are voluntary and that provides a good protection against people who have particular concerns about sharing certain sets of information.
But it also means that it's that Community Trust is the most important element here, because that's what's going to encourage people to share their information and so putting these other confidentiality protections into place.
Next Aleta thanks Rebecca I, don't know where the place for this is and I don't know if you've looked at this enough, but given that someone I think which Harry had said that the analog people calling and having that personal touch is more effective for getting a higher percentage of people participating in the contact tracing.
Yeah and I guess what I'm wondering if we want to, if it's better, to separate everything, we're discussing into two resolutions or just one, if we, because I do think it's very important to show how supportive we are of the bill and so I, don't know, I, don't know what everyone else wants to do, but I'm wondering if maybe we address the federal.
You know speed this along and support this bill, so I see well know who's on the phone has a hand that I asked questions about privacy of if I go to get my get tested and the places where I got tested said that I'm positive and after that, how can I everybody should be protected a day.
So every other information I'm hoping I'm not protected, whether the privacy at all well I, think you know in the first instance.
If you do decide to do that, when the contact tracer reaches out to your friends or family members or whoever you list, then they won't say that you were the person who tested positive or was exposed to Coba 19 they'll, just tell those individuals you may have been exposed, and so please get tested or please start self quarantine or what have you so there is kind of a second layer of privacy protection in the sense that your name will not be shared with your contacts through the program: okay, hey, okay, that's right!
That gives me encouraged to let them know everybody that I feel was exposed to, and then they of information who can explain and I would just like to offer a friendly amendment to Barbara's resolution, which is that we include a clause that mentions that we're in support of this remaining totally voluntary, both sure and mention that it's essential to gain public trust and because I think they kind of go together.
I think, let's call the question and then I don't know if maybe Russell wants to introduce the second part a separate resolution.
Is there's one like omnibus resolution for everything else that isn't the Assembly Bill right, yeah, that's fine with me I think that's a good way to do it so I would that's how we should do it kind of be framed as a you know, what else needs to be addressed?
It is that you know anytime you're dealing with public health, information or individuals, health information that's very sensitive, and it could be the kind of thing that bad actors would want to go after, and so it's particularly important when you're dealing with information like that to ensure the security of that data and so I think that's you know the need for the strictest and strongest data privacy for that type of information isn't specifically addressed in the bill.
That is definitely what the Assemblyman is wanting to do about this, and so it feels to me like this is the DoubleDown is like, and we really mean it kind of thing now: I'm, not sure that it addresses anything, that's different from what's already there, it's just my opinion and, as I said, yeah I think the question I think Murray's question was just about to do the privacy stuff, ya, know and I, and yes, it was that what and I also I'm in support of encouraging federal legislation as well I think my understanding is this would be a resolution.
Privacy, I don't know that you know really doing a resolution just for more data security is really necessary because never yet I think carry still on because she stitches what this is an issue that she alerted us to throw I'm wondering, if maybe you could I guess, I kind of like Russell's formulation, just the idea that you know you can put all of the legal protections in place that you want to protect against disclosure of this information.
You know it does seem to me that, with this information in particular and again going to the community trust point, it would be helpful to have some assurance that you know security experts, whether internal or external, just that there's some assurance that the data is being maintained in a secure system and I think, but you know by us asking for it, who knows: maybe they're already going to do it, but making a statement also means that it we want a response.
It's really a separate point and it's a point that so I think that's why it's being made separately- and you know again in the absence of knowing precisely what the sort of general data security stuff is in the state- and you know certainly there's going to be protections and stuff for health, related information.
The idea is that you know for this: that's going to be collected very widely and again to provide the assurances to people as much as possible, which is really the goal here, because we want people to feel secure enough to actually participate in the program that there's really no harm to provide to suggesting the strongest possible data protections and hope that the you know the state and any entity doing contact tracing would implement those and really ensure that the data from a data security perspective again not from a sort of like confidentiality perspective of who you're allowed to share it with, but purely from the sense of just you know, your gonna have a database that has a lot of personal and very sensitive information in it.
No, but even that first individual I think has a lot of sensitive private information that can be revealed through contact tracing, but they don't they don't ask.
But I read about this issue and I understand what you're saying but I, haven't they Geron guaranteed or instructed that, like police and authority of you know that native people in law enforcement are not allowed to be contact tracers and that's in the assembly bill as well rightly stated, I think this just to refocus what exactly were talking about for this resolution.
I, just I, don't wanna I, don't want to put people in a position where they you know are like if they support the federal portion of it and want to vote against the data privacy.
