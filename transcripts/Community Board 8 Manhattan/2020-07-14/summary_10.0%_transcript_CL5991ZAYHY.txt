There are three interconnected structures: 706 708 is a neo federal style Bank, building designed by Frank Easton constructed in 1922 702 and 704 Madison Avenue and 22 East 63rd Street are designed by Paige irons, Crowley and constructed in 2014 to 2016 space Smith architects.
So sorry, yes, okay and our mechanical engineer is with us just in case there are questions Katie tunnel.
I will do my best and, if I forget just ask me and we'll circle back to it so great good evening, everybody I'm, kastanka, Berg, bikinis, grace bars and partners, as I mentioned Michelle frog from space smith, who is the architect of record, is on the line as well as is katie tow, henderson engineer she's, the MEP engineer, Michelle and Katie are available for questions I'm going to run through the presentation.
Our clients from fermez are also on the call, as well as I said, I'll go through the presentation and if you have questions afterwards, any one of us will step in and answer questions the product is for permits who will be relocating from its flagship location at 691 Madison, one block to the south, to this collection of three buildings on 63rd and Madison.
Historically, a bank building at the corner and, as you noted it in the introduction, new construction dating to 2014 2016 flanking it here at 7:02, Madison, 702, 704, Medicine and 22 East 63rd Street.
We will be presenting at a public hearing of landmarks, June 23, July 21st, and the scope of that review is for signage and awnings storefront and window replacement and rooftop mechanicals and railings and I'll.
This is the current location of ramez's flagship, one block to the south on the northeast corner of sixty-second and Madison 1920s commercial building designed by McKim Mead white.
The CFA notes that this sign, or this sculpture on the roof, would be in keeping with historic advertising methods and was being keeping with a commercial character of Madison, Avenue and I point this out, because, as this store, when this store closes and the other store opens, we are proposing to install a similar statue on the roof of 706 Madison a bit of history.
1980S designation photo from the Landmarks Commission, showing that the commercial building had been also demolished that in 1940 and replaced with a two-story extension of the bank, and then you can see this brick wall in side yard, on the 63rd Street side of the of the Bank building fast forward to current day just to look at the current conditions of the building.
So again, this is the historic building at 7:06 Madison, and then this is the four-story commercial building to the south, at 702, 704, Medicine, the certificate of appropriateness and the permit for this construction designed by Paige Cowley included the demolition of that extension, construction of a four-story building, new storefront, infill signage and construction of the building on 63rd Street.
One significant thing to note, which I'll come back to later in the presentation, is that this proposal has approved did not include any mechanical equipment for the entire complex.
The idea was that the architecture was approved and that when the building was tenant, 'add the mechanical systems would be designed and proposed as part of that future work.
So that is part of what we are presenting to you this evening, turning the corner on 63rd Street, again, the original historic Bank building and then the 19.
You a view of the scope of work at 702 704, replacing the existing infill, a storefront in filled with new infill matching the detailing and configuration, but in a dark painted metal and signage of the sign band.
Installing awnings of the second floor here and around 706, replacing the entry door at 7:06 and replacing the replacement wood windows at the ground floor of 706, the installation of a cabaret at the corner, and then mechanical equipment and railings that are not visible in this photo we'll get into details of each of those.
Looking at this existing photo and then an elevation sort of similar scope, I'm not going to spend much time here.
Most of the changes are occurring at the ground level of the storefronts and the entry, as well as the rooftop mechanicals, and then, of course, the Kelly on the roof 706, the 63rd Street elevation again, as I mentioned, replacing the windows replacing the door here, the side, entry on 63rd, a new storefront infill at the base of the 63rd Street entry here, I'm.
So one of the reasons that we're proposing to replace this opaque wood door with a glass door is to allow for views actually into the store from passers-by on the street, and so you can see this person walking by on Madison and then similarly, here on 63rd, just given the height of these sills, one doesn't see into the store from the sidewalk, so there's a desire for improved transparency at the main entry on Madison and on 63rd Street, the other piece of the work at the entrance.
The proposal is to put a new marble panel in front of that not removing the historic sign, but actually installing a new marble panel with stainless steel letters 7 inches tall.
The proposal is to replace that with painted metal, storefronts matching the configuration of the existing in a dark charcoal black finish again: 7 inch tall, non-illuminated letters in stainless attached to the sign bands above each of the storefront panels, decal signage as well, on the storefront doors and typical installations in that regard.
The transoms will be back painted again to mask some of the systems and things that are up in the ceiling above this part of the interior sort of back of house area for building turning to the windows, so the windows at the base of 706 Madison.
The other important element is that these windows will be positioned in the openings in exactly the same plane as the existing windows, which is very important, given the scale of the building and the fact that we're only proposing to change the windows at the ground floor and not.
The final element of the proposal is the rooftop mechanical equipment and, as I said at the outset, the current building and the current approval from 2014 anticipated rooftop mechanical equipment, but it did not include any rooftop mechanical equipment, so our client is had to sort of figure out a way to fit the equipment first within the existing roof plan and then realizing that there were some deficiencies in that an updated roof plan so showing you the existing, approved roof plan with a series of new skylights here and then some ductwork I don't know.
There are low units here that are not visible from the street and then there's some flus and things back in this corner also not visible from the street I'll just point out that there is a catwalk here and they were quite the reason that is there is the ductwork, for this large unit comes out to the north, not visible out of the back of this unit, and it's necessary to have a catwalk over that ductwork in order to sort of get up and over to this roof level.
This is just a simple drawing -, showing the new skylight three feet in height above the roof, slab, so very low profile and, as I said, not visible from the surrounding streets.
Here's the skylight, here's the package unit, here's the elevator, bulkhead and stair bulkhead, and then the Lowe equipment on this roof and the equipment here that you don't see so I'll, then take you around the building on 63rd Street, there's a the smallest amount of visibility here.
So, as I mentioned, one of the goals has been to locate all the mechanical equipment on the new construction so that we didn't have any visible mechanical equipment above the historic pillar, heading up, Madison Avenue, looking south and southwest to elements you're, seeing here the front edge again of the packaged unit, and then here this is the equipment serving this seller so a little bit of that unit and then the rendered view obviously seen with taller buildings behind it, not silhouetted against the sky and somewhat visible, but not over the historic building and then.
Finally, just a final rendering I think one thing that's important is with the scope of work, this historic building, this simple, neo, Federal Bank building, remains a distinct element in the composition, with changes really at the ground, floor windows and the door, the introduction of the cafe at the roof and the railing and the signage, and then the changes at 7:02, 704 Madison and at 63rd Street for storefront changes in signage and the rooftop mechanical equipment.
The flagpole has been on the building for a number of years in general, MS has no use for flagpole or for the flag for itself, so we'd like to ask the possibility that the flagpole also be removed as part of the design for this for this project.
At any rate, it's a lovely building and it's a lovely presentation, but I am concerned about the complete removal of the historic signage designating where the bank was and can that be preserved and just moved even over to the side and a plaque something to designate part of our history.
I, understand the reason and I probably will support this, but I would prefer the look of wood windows there's, particularly because this is such a great building here, but otherwise I think I'll support this Thank You Elizabeth next big Kilburn, yeah I, agree with Elizabeth I think it was an excellent presentation.
So the only way that we really will be able to provide a safe space is to have an a steel window or essentially a frame, a glass that is all encompasses with the steel frame that is open, like the adjacent building 70 to 74, but that it would not be in keeping with the building so we're trying to do the best possible thing by having a steel window that is essentially mimicking the existing wood frame as much as possible and maintaining the mullions in the same appearance by using wood frame.
Sorry just to address the detailing point, I think I certainly understand the committee members comments about wood versus steel, but I think what's important is to remember is that these are you know these windows are four years old.
There is more visibility for sure, but then I think you start seeing this sort of in the context of the city beyond, so it has less of an effect on the building.
Well, if I may add, is that the more the further back you move up on Madison Avenue, the more the building behind the 702 704 would become apparent, and there is a wall just adjacent to our air conditioning unit.
You can see in the axonometry of the yellow box there just next to that unit, there's an existing building that is taller, then our as this yeah we talked about when you're going north right.
Think as you get north, what happens is you'll see a little bit more, but eventually this line will eclipse the building.
So on the facades of the building, can you just go back to the rendering where we see how many windows there are on both the Madison Avenue and the 63rd Street side, because okay, so now, if you're, starting from the southernmost building the ones south of the bank and you're going to have awnings on that building, plus the bank building and around the side of the bank building and on to the new building on 63rd Street there no awnings on 63rd?
So you got about 13 or 14 windows on the second floor and if each of them are going to have awnings and each of them is going to have a logo as well- yes, that's I mean I, love, awnings, but I'm just thinking, that's an awful lot of warning and an awful lot of logo.
Yes, is there any way you can move that Bank of New York I understand you want your logo above your front door.
The other thing I will say, having worked on you know with Marvel material in New York City is that Marvel not a very good building material for the city, and while it's you know it's only a hundred years old.
I think you know we, the team actually talked quite a bit about this and we all felt it was important to keep it and perhaps someday your meds won't be there I, don't know that the Bank of New York would come back, but that sign will always be there and that's important I think as a sort of I appreciate that.
Yes, all right, so you'll be dealing with all of that maintenance right, yes, okay, yes, okay and then I do think it's a little bit visible from 64th Street I, it's hard for me to judge about it, blending into the skyline and I trust that you would pick as neutral, whether it's gray or something else that just blends in somehow to the building that it's that it's next to and I also agree.
I have to say, with the idea of some kind of historic plaque, I like to read them when I see them, so maybe the space on 63rd Street, it looks like there's more brick, I, don't know how Hermes would feel about it, but it would be a nice thing, given the historic value of the of the building.
Thank you yeah, and we understand the need for maintaining it and that's why we, as cars mentioned, we plan on leaving the existing one within the wall and putting our new one in front of it and in the Madison side, you're like to say Bank of New York.
Finally, a question are the new windows fixed sort of like fake one over ones at 12 or 12, right I think they can be operable, but I don't think they will be operated because they correct for air conditioning purposes.
If I may just read the sign on 63rd Street, it does have some signage over it and the text a cast I sent I emailed this you the image also- and this is what it says this building was erected by the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company ad 1922.
Thank you well, who comes after Anthony, Marco, I, think it's how that you know I'm sorry but I Sarah's, not here today.
Third street des moines, painting the consistency of a black door, which is basically I, think that's right into the oil, but that made me feel a little bit uncomfortable that part.
If they didn't see it on the news mhm, they should look on YouTube for the incredible vandalism against their building, and the group of people in the one young man who had a crowbar it appeared to be who kept beating at their window would walk away and came back again and again, it's the most extraordinary thing, so one can fully understand, unfortunately, necessity for their security and their attention to it and I'm delighted to that you're moving to a bigger space, I love shopping there.
It is well I want to speak to I'm gonna even go for the metal windows, but I cannot go for the covering up of the original Bank of New. York saw how many windows are there along Madison and along 63rd Street?
How many are needs and their signage also on the adjacent building on Madison there's the logo that will be on every single awning there's the logo is going to be on the new, transparent glass doors with the beveled glass that Bank of New York sign there plenty of buildings, old buildings, reused for other purposes that have the original signage and just keep it.
Given the history of that Bank, Alexander Hamilton and the beauty of Madison Avenue and as Aleta athelete said, everyone is kind of interested in what these buildings used to be.
I certainly feel that people would know it was air may is without the air may sign above the door, so I'm going to have to abstain on this application, but I think it's a move to approve.
Okay, here you right now David push the button on your screen to confirm I'm, very happy to let you read it, but if you want me to I, do not mind an 83 Albany 89 to 90 of streets, expanded Carnegie, Hill, historic district Jeffrey, our car Ogden I've been Condon LLC, Brian, J, Connelly architect.
Those are style townhouse designed by Turner and Killian, and built in 1901 o2, with significant alterations by optic Todman in 1913, 15 application to installed a low wall and railing at the front of the building.
The proposal is for the creation of a new limestone wall railing with the view to creating a typical transition zone that you would normally find between the public realm of the sidewalk and the private realm of a.
In addition, we're playing to the Department of Transport to replace the defective and discordant sidewalk in the course of this presentation, we're going to walk you through several examples of this type of feature in front of townhouses, on Fifth Avenue and in the immediate neighborhood, and we're also going to sort of show how the proposed encroachment onto the sidewalk it's significantly less than we're.
The initial first, the first floors were originally slightly higher than the street levels, and you can see a slightly better version of that in the second photograph which I'm zooming into you can see the railings and transition zones all three of those properties, the next photograph and window over to is from about 1915.
The other thing Coughlin did was he eliminated the steps that led into 1083, because he lowered the first floor to sidewalk level to facilitate the carriage and the next picture to the right of that is the building.
We believe that's also the location where the original transition zone, low wall steps and railings occurred and that they rested directly on that and not to mention for that vault space below and the presumed mention of the transition zone above is reasonably consistent with other buildings.
We moved across and used that roughly as our starting point for the new enclosed area, then we offset that seven feet, eight inches off the existing curve and return this back to the wall.
You are, for the most part, still looking over the proposed features of the transition wall and that's much lower than some of the larger railings and definition defining zones around Marymount College, for example, in a number of other buildings in the area which still have their walls and railings.
The other thing we're doing here is we're proposing that there would be loose planters behind the railing and the reason we're doing them loose is that we don't want to physically do anything hard up against the original Codman elevation.
If you look down at the plan I'm, where my cursor is, you can see that the proposed new wall and physically touched the building, there's a small gap of a few inches away from that.
So if it was ever removed, it won't leave any marks on the limestone or sort of granite water table at the base of 1083 right now, I'd like to go to page five and page five I'm going to zoom out.
The Thiele proposed low wall is lower than the windows of the building.
I'm gonna go through a couple of pictures on the next page, and mainly these were done for Department of Transport requirements to sort of show comparable installations and how much of the street remains available, and what you're going to see in these photographs coming up is the degree of free sidewalk on the neighboring buildings.
So, even looking at these pictures here, cooper-hewitt, which is on the next block, the sidewalk averages around ten feet and there's a couple of locations where it goes down to seven, where there's light fixtures the adjoining building at ten eighty Fifth Avenue there's some points.
Some nine is showing up on the next page, there's a five foot: nine at Marymount College, there's another 5 foot, 9 further down moving down near the Irish American Historical Society, which we believe is one of the last fully projecting area waves, encroaching that deep onto Fifth Avenue at the planter that goes down to five foot nine at the sidewalk.
It's nine foot, eight, as you can see in the lower left picture, so going back to my drawing we're proposing leaving 15 feet at the apex of this curve here and we're going to have 1710 at the two corners, so we're generally much greater than the average of the three sidewalks further down Fifth Avenue, as you saw in those pictures.
They are also out about 12 feet into the sidewalk moving down onto the next row of slides here, we're just demonstrating a number of precedents in the area where curved steps, low masonry walls, low railings of top, are used in some cases.
Let's do it in reverse order this time and we will start with Marco Tamayo, and you know you want to do the public or the public members afterwards right.
Sorry, alphabetical order, starting with the regular members and then public numbers afterwards, yes, I think there.
The Irish American Historical Society, which is by the same original architects, was the existence of an area way and stairway separate entrance down directly to what we would call the cellar that no longer exists has not existed as far as I can tell since Ogden Codman redesigned the facade of this building, which is to say the functional purpose for extending the private property as far as possible.
If I may, if they let me run it Anthony, please, okay, sorry, you can come back in a second I only wanted to say that we don't need a lengthy interior description.
You know, we trust you as a professional, that you say those drawings label, the carriage way that it was but I will ask whether his section actually went out to the street and showed a curb cut or not.
So I don't like the design because of the suggestion that it is very closed off other than the other buildings and I had to look because of the way this works.
So you have the church on one side, 1080 on the other and yet you're coming out you're out from your property line as Michelle note it to begin with, coming out close to another eight feet and I understand that part of it is for security, knowing that building there's a way to consider having an internal vestibule which would create more security, but I just think that taking space away from the public just is inappropriate and that when this building was purchased, the owner knew that okay, here's the building it doesn't.
At no time does he put a fence like this in front of his buildings, you're quite right that this probably was a carriage entrance, because what he often used on his houses is that the main front door you go in there and then a very on the one across the street which he does for me, which he designed for himself.
The other things are not landmarks questions they may offend other people, but the fact of putting a fence in front of a cardamon house is something that I don't think we should ever accept Thank, You Elizabeth.
I tried to acknowledge him, but if you want to go back to the low at any point, let me know I'm gonna go to speak unless he's got a very lengthy discussion for us, which afterwards it's good a low now or to go to the public members now.
The next slide is 96th Street, looking south and then we're gonna walk south okay, even though the historic district goes, another two blocks north we're.
Okay, and here at the corner, is the is the is the is a great mansion, don't know Aldrich, and here we see the entrance is actually on the inside of the street, but the space, the space part of the sidewalk is a is a planted garden and that is to contribute to the public and also you'll notice, the dark, the dark wrought iron, fencing and you see that repeated okay.
But also, if you look at it, then you're in front of this building is very open to the public and that to Gail's point and to Anthony's.
I have a few questions and some comments, particularly some of the buildings that Oprah presented, were our institutions whose entrances were not on Fifth Avenue, but I want to ask for how is the landmark guiding you, because you saying Jared has become very interested in this and giving you guidance and I want to know what guidance they're giving you, which you said they were supporting and then I have a couple of questions to put it to sort of put this building in context, which I think we may have missed in some of the comments I'm just in working with them.
The second step was to present some initial sketches that were slightly different from this one, and then we worked with them to fine-tune the shape the degree of projection and the details for the materials, but in general they were supportive of the idea of a space in front of the building that they felt added Beauty not only to the building but to the street, because they felt that the building as it currently stands was somewhat denuded that it's one of the few building is in that area.
So we were starting with the same exact same way of projection, that's elsewhere on the same block and just bowing it out slightly, because if we had created a straight line at that point, it would become almost tangential to the building, and that would certainly look like an error.
Why the landmarks is, you know, understanding what you're trying to present and many of the buildings have larger institutions which this was and is no longer and is on Fifth Avenue, so I think we have to keep it in context.
Thank you, I'm, going to keep this incredibly brief in the interest of time, but I do echo the other comments about encroaching on public space in the sidewalk.
The fact of the matter is that if they chose to live in that live in that house as a private house that doesn't give them the right necessarily to encroach into the sidewalk and I think given the Church of the heavenly just given those point about this becoming such an important public plaza.
We're very excited that she's taken on that we're taking on that project and certainly she's excited to realize the goal of opening this flagship gallery right across the street from the Guggenheim which, as we all know, it's such an epicenter of Contemporary Arts, not only in New York City but in the world.
So with that said, I think I'll pass the mic to you, cats and we all will get started good Thank You Christiana Jim. Do you want to pull up the presentation?
So since, following the public hearing, the design team worked with our client to develop a rooftop scheme for the sixth floor, that was smaller, it was a standalone element and would it would be more architectural II, distinctive and distinguished the setbacks are significant 10 feet from this east side of the building and then 56 feet as you'll see in a short lee from the front facade next line, we talked a bit about Christine I talked a bit about the program, it remains the same, and that is part of the modification abuse that we're proposing as part of the 74 7-eleven to allow for a commercial art gallery you can see this is the restored exhibition space.
Obviously this is our property here: 3 East, 8th and 9th Street from the previous application, and from the many times we've been in front of you, I think you know the history of the building.
Thanks for having us back to show you the updates to the to the building we, as Cass mentioned, we tried to push the sixth floor, Garden Room pavilion as far back and to limit the sight lines as much as possible.
Yes, exactly what Michelle said, what we really want is to get as much input as we possibly can from the committee any board member who might be interested any member of the public, because we really it's going to take a lot of work.
So that's going to be the bulk of the work, but I have some experience doing that when I work for the historic district, because I had to do outreach and every one of the buildings I'm hoping those contexts it's many years now, but we'll see what I you know, what I have them, but we'll see how many of them are viable at the moment, but we'll go from there and we'll fill you in as we go Thank you Thank You, Michelle, Thank, You Gail, any other new business items alia has her hand up and Cristina Davis has her hand up.
I think it might be before school starts, it might be or right after Labor, Day I, don't know, but we'll see what else but anyway, just keep me informed and I would very much like to go with David to be there.
They know what they've got very smart people, so I didn't feel like thanking them for coming.
You know I, don't it's why we I'm sorry I shouldn't have said anything I think we should just move to adjourn at this point.
I know that Aleta and it's great that you did that I just didn't feel like thanking those the applicant for returning to us when they totally ignored us.
