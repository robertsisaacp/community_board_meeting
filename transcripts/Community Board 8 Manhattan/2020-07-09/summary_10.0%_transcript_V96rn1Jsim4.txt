If you wouldn't mind raising your hand in the participants menu, if you are going to be speaking on behalf of the application I'm trying to find Ryan, is that you push a button to confirm unmuting, yes, is there anybody else, who's gonna be joining your presentation, or is it just you Frank is?
That's shown on the plans, if approved, only Barry's bootcamp as the applicant would be permitted to operate this specific gym and any changes that you know we're made or would need to be made would have to go back before the BSA for an amendment and actually come have to come back before the community board.
Let me just ask one other question: no, you know what Michele I really want to know if you can see through Michele hang on, please, because we have a lot of people who have raised their hands and I want to make sure they each have an opportunity to speak and a lot of people.
So I have two things first: well, could you find Josh again I want to get for the record his name and address, as we ask all public members to give, and then I'd like to ask that no one called a question until everyone has had an opportunity to speak, please so, if anyone's raised their hand and intends to well ask for a resolution, actually I'd like to make sure that everyone has a chance to speak before we get to that point.
Oh okay, I'd like to know, if you could you hold off on that show and we'll get to you right after Elaine, Anthony and Elaine want to speak.
So while we give people a chance to raise their hand I'm moving into this building, and so just avoid any perception of impropriety I'm gonna vote for cause, I, don't think honestly is having taken McCoy training last week.
Let's talk about what we started talking about it, a previous school board meeting, which is the idea of having the virtual meeting versus in-person meeting, and this is all presuming that the governor will at some point make us go back to the open meetings law with the exemption, and so let's just talk about what we'd like to do at that point.
So who'd like to start, there are a lot of people who had their hands raised at the full board meeting.
All of my remote I have preface my remarks by saying that it is because I'm making this request because of the pandemic that we're in right now and also because there be there, won't be a publicly available vaccine and also the difficulty with spacing issues being socially distant from one another raises all sorts of complexities and I'm, not sure that and I don't have a high degree of comfort with being able to socially distant from my colleagues as well as from the public who will attend.
It's very important to have meetings in which it's really easy to participate in and I believe that there are others like they are out there in terms of community board members as well as members of the public, who believe the same as I do that it's really easy to participate in this I.
Well, you know, because the last time that we, when I raise this there was a significant pushback and the idea of doing video conference says in this way and there seem to be an emphasis on traveling to meetings.
I am supporting a hybrid if people want to travel to community board meetings, they should, for others who wish to participate virtually.
We have the longest commutes and I've been doing this now for a while, but I want you to know that I have enjoyed and appreciated every single day that I have ever attended a community board meeting.
If you would milk unmute her will and is there anyone else from the public that would like to comment on the nature for board meetings, whether they should be virtual or hybrid, or only in person once the restriction is lifted.
So much for letting me speak and I really appreciated the remarks of Miss Bob Marshall I want to make sure that when it is safe to do so that we are able to have an in-person option always available and I do think that a hybrid meeting is certainly feasible.
Don't think we can say that anybody would feel totally comfortable with having face-to-face meetings until we really know that we're totally safe the open meeting laws mean that people are there.
We can't limit, we can't say you can't come so I certainly think, and what I would disagree with Sharon if I may is to get any time we do not know if it's December or January or January of 2025, or something like that.
There is nothing like face to face I've been my work, was doing training on a big system very often and doing it over the phone or video never took the place of looking at somebody's eyeballs and face to face and having the come on moderate, but I'm, very much for, as Wendy had said, a mixed concrete when we do it with an encouragement that we community board.
I will share that I agree wholeheartedly with Sharon's comments and I also agree with what Barbara added about timeline that if we are going to offer any type of guidance in a resolution of what we think the sort of Governors open, meeting laws should look like or what the future should look like.
I think the requirement is social, have six feet of social distancing will really substantially limit the capacity of the New York Blood Center and before we even think about being able to return in person whenever were allowed to by the open meeting law that we really need to be able to figure out what that does in terms of capacity and whether or not that limits additional participation of people attending so I think it will be a substantial restriction.
You know that the attendance is better than it's easier for parents, that it's easier for the disabled, and you know I, certainly don't feel a distance with you all and you know so I just don't think that that's an issue so I would very much support always being able to do virtual meetings.
The one thing that I'm concerned about is that when you talk about hybrids, that I think is problem problematic in that, if you have some people who are participating virtually and some people who are participating in person at the same meeting, I think that sets up a dynamic that is totally different between the two groups.
So what I would propose is that if you want to go back to all you know open meet the open meetings, laws or whatever, if that you know, comes down the pike that we should alternate having a total in-person meeting and then a total virtual meeting III having both at the same time, I think is problematic.
You know what there were some members of the public, but because of the nature of this, that's in the way virtual meeting I can't see who everyone is without scrolling up and down continuously, and there are a whole lot of people who have raised their hand.
Even since you finished Lori, so I'd like to be able before we go back to the board, if you would bear with me and allow switching back and forth to the members of the public who have raised their hands and so I'm going to put you on hold for a second Chuck and Wilma I'd like to go to Andrew rabbits Gary and Betty, Cooper Wallerstein and John's iPhone, whoever you are John and except I'm, going to ask you because I don't want to bifurcate.
I think one of the key important factors that comes with the Open Meeting Law is that we are better able to find consensus when there's an audience that is either cheering or clapping or disagreeing it's a little hard to do that on the zoom, because in our chat I know, for me, I'm only able to message will which is lovely, but it's not a totally open group discussion, so I would be in favor of a hybrid model in the future, because that allows both consensus that you get when you are in person which provides us with information on a variety of issues, but I also hear what others are saying regarding online availability under the current pause of the open meetings, law, I think and I could be mistaken- that there's a stipulation that we should be getting the transcript of these meetings.
Your question was yes, it would be opposed to just like our minutes are posted okay and then is there also a way to open up the chat so that we could have greater cross dialogue during these meetings?
Yes, okay, I, just I had assumed that the question had to do with when we will no longer need to be doing this virtually because I think it's very important for people to be present.
There were a lot of people last time with the Schools, Board, presidents etc, who were did not have a chance to speak, but a couple of them said they were so impressed with the board and they had never gone to a board meeting.
This is very convenient for everyone doing this way, but it doesn't really give people they're, really good information about how the board works and whether those people who would not have had a chance to speak if they were at the open meeting, but they would have sit, sat there with their friends.
I think it's very important for the board to have the meetings where people will come and, of course the meetings will be shorter and that's good too.
Joe I lived at 4:15 East 85th Street between first to New, York, Avenue's, I've, been attending board meetings in person and now virtually for the last couple of years and I think you're wonderful.
Maybe this just comes with the territory with the virtual meetings, but certainly I think an argument for going back as quickly as possible to in-person meetings is the length of time.
Thank you, yeah I'm, well, aware of that, and we are working on it too, and it fluctuates with the number of issues in how controversial they are and other people may differ, but I like to make sure that people everyone has attempts to speak I appreciate when comments or sixth synced and non repetitive.
A war is a war, and we have enough time it's seen to try to work on making the more so that when we can't find a spot to have our meetings, because it's getting harder and harder to find a space big enough to accommodate the board and everybody else, maybe one every two months or a year a month or every three months they can have a virtual meeting.
If we have a time with well, we know three months from now we're going to be able to have a virtual meeting.
You know in-person meetings for a while I, don't think I'd really make sense, I, actually Oh, Lina and I.
Had some curt discussion about I didn't think we should have the March meeting when we had the market I mean I was like I was up in arms and Aleta and Russell were kind of disagreeing with me a little bit.
You know it seems to work, we're all we're all vetted by our council mentor girl, president and our peers, but as far as the public I, don't think so, I could see often there's a hot topic where developer or someone else or a lobby may stack the room with people to speak on it and virtually that could go on for a long time and we don't know where, if the person's going from Upper East, Side or Texas.
What we do have is the opportunity to really think about you know with new technology that was not contemplated when open meetings law was developed and that certainly was not contemplated when the Community Board process was developed.
So I would like to sort of see if there is interest on the board in developing a set of recommendations that could be brought to the borough president, you know towards the notion of you know in this new world of technology, that was, you know that fundamentally changes the capabilities and capacities of meetings.
You know what should an open meeting look like in the future inclusive of what our norms and expectations of board members in terms of in person versus virtual participation.
You know, and one of the things that we can benefit from this experience is how do we use this experience to move forward and create greater access on a long-term basis and one small point: I personally participated in community board meetings when there were too many speakers for everybody to be heard.
There was a time limit there for both individual speakers and for the meeting overall, so I don't think that being virtual absolutely requires that every single person necessarily be heard, but that's the kind of thing that might go into a set of recommendations for how to leverage technology to remove barriers of participation in the future, even after were able to have gatherings of unlimited numbers of people.
I really do like idea taking this as an opportunity to come up with some best practices or suggestions for how this might work long term I'm very supportive of a hybrid model.
There's no way to tell from this or at all and I think that, for me, that's as a person- that's really lacking in this, but I should keep probably my comments to myself since I haven't raised my hand so Rita and Craig and Valerie will you did you have anything else to add Trisha before we go away from you, I, just muted ourselves: okay, good, never mind Rita, you're unmuted!
I just want to say that I think that we should keep virtual meetings until the vaccine has been tested, and the other thing is that several of us have to take public transportation to the meeting and we're really trying to stay off that as long as possible, so I hope everybody stays well or as long as possible.
How do we accommodate those who are unable to participate while there are barrier or and address some of the barriers that may prevent some people from doing it in person at a time where we are able to meet so talking about not only just as current koban 19 environments, but beyond that, so, for example, if someone days under the weather we're all much more sensitive towards fighting germs, and even when this whole crisis is over, hopefully we'll all have learned our lessons that, if anyone's feeling sick, they just stay home, and sometimes we all want to be there- we're all invested in the community board and we all want to participate.
So I say this after our transportation meeting last week when till 11 o'clock, four and a half hours and part of that was because we had great participation and we felt it was very important to make sure both chuck and I that everyone who wished to speak and participate and the public did so and that becomes a real challenge and I think we'd have to work through the issues of how do we make sure that we allow the public to participate if they are participating remotely, but in a way where it doesn't slow things down?
If you had to attend every meeting in person, I would hate to have to put him through that and how would we make sure that we can, if the point of this would be to get the public to be able to participate and the members to be able to vote, to make sure that we had mechanisms in place to allow both things to happen without causing meetings to go till all hours of the evening?
If anyone wants to respond to Craig's question about the open meetings, law just raise your hand and you'll be at the end of the pile, because there's no way of differentiating and no way to ask people to lower their hands.
If you don't mind, Adele was actually spoken to us about that in the past, and because we had talked about the idea of using just a conference call line, and she said that everywhere the person had been calling from would need to be posted as a place that somebody could go to be a part of that conversation.
Okay, let's go to Valerie and Rebecca Dan Gore and then Michelle you have it: okay, I'm, sorry, Valerie well, I just wanted to say that I think you know just going back to Adele Bartlett when she said about open meetings law in the key words Craig that you read or stated, or that you can participate, you can observe and that's why the live-streaming work, because it doesn't violate the Open Meetings, because all you're doing is giving the public an opportunity to observe, and so that doesn't violate the open meetings, law.
The community board give them the opportunity to observe through Facebook but at the same time, show up for things that they feel passionate about in person and, while I think it's.
You know we get the message that you know certain buildings didn't want to Street closed and you know we can hear from everyone, but it doesn't really move the issue along and we get you know we can tell when we're in person better who you know what are the different points of view and I think it's easier to conduct the meeting to see in the room to make sure we get a balance of opinion when we're talking.
So I guess I go back to Betty and to Chuck and to say you know, the best of all possible worlds is an in-person meeting where we can evaluate all the people who have come and to speak out on an issue, but I think it's important for the community board to have the live streaming option so that people actually know that we exist I mean it was interesting at the transportation committee meeting to hear people talk about how they never gone to one or whatever and in my opinion, even though they participated virtually.
But in any event it's not the same thing and I'm looking forward to be able to be in the room with everyone, I know and everyone I don't know to evaluate issues and the way that they are supposed to be evaluated, whether it's a community board level, whether it's at the House of Representatives, whether it's at the city, council, public hearing and MTA public hearing in person meetings are the best.
I. Do think, though, that in this way that there does have to be some special accommodations for people who do need to speak on issues who, for whatever reason, can't be there to make it but I'm more in favor of continuing the livestream and bringing it back to all in the same place meeting.
Thank You, Valerie, okay, Rebecca, Dan, Gore and then Michelle Birnbaum, hi I, think there are two different issues here.
I think that the fact that community board meetings and committee meetings livestream the public is a pret is a prized of what we are doing.
First of all, I agree with Michele that we should not have a resolution tonight, but I also want to follow up what Chuck said a lot of you who have been on the board when they know how strongly I believe in open meeting law.
I just don't think we're going to be able to have open meetings.
It's not completely open and we wouldn't want to change the state law, because it's think of all these places throughout the state that would love to have all closed meetings.
Are we going back to the open law next month or six months or 12 months or 18 months down the road I mean the discussion should be had, but I think what we should all do is think about what we would like what we would recommend and wait until the law or the open meeting gets reinstated, I mean until then we're just spinning Willis, and this happened last time we went on till 10, 11, 12 o'clock and everybody's got their opinion, we're not voting on anything tonight and we're just spinning wheels again and again and again.
I have a little bit of suspicion of how many people have actually attended meetings that are half in person in half on zoom', because this is new territory and I want to also remind us that, just a couple of months ago, in March, when I was - expressing deep concern about the March meeting, we didn't even think this was possible.
I also respectfully disagree with the comments and the decisions that have been made about the use of all of the tools that these virtual platforms zoom that we're currently using offer I have I know that decisions were made about the chat, but I do think that there are a lot of different parts of this platform that could be used that we're not even exploring right now.
How are we going to adapt and I think that the that means a few more meetings, maybe even working groups with people who want to explore some more of these digital options before we dive into really making recommendations?
Okay, I know that Elizabeth and chair and you've been patient, but Marco and Billie have not spoken yet so I'd like to go to them first, if we could go to Marco and then Billy and then back to Elizabeth, if no one else raises their hands, so will Marco you are needed.
Go god you're, not urinated, okay, I think you know last time we kept going on and on it's an important conversation to have.
I think we should come up with a plan of what we really want to do in the future, whether it's an in person or both for virtual or hybrid, the hybrid is an extra you know, basically in-person and virtual, so I think we can all come up with certain recommendations and, let's you know, put our heads together, but we could be discussing this for the next hour or two and we are not going to get anywhere so and the law that the rescinding of the open meeting it's not going to be for months.
Yet so, let's discuss this in a proper way, come up with plans to or recommendations to basically suggest or we would like and go from there, but I think just carrying on this discussion.
Are you suggesting sorry, are you suggesting creating a working group to come up with recommendations that could be presented to the board in another special meeting like that?
So I think if we all write our recommendations, send it in to you and we'll, then we could basically have a select meeting, basically the board without the public and come up with suggestions.
Think, sorry and I think your idea sounds very intriguing, except that I think the idea would violate the open meetings law, which is that even committees can't formulate resolutions in advance of even to propose I'm, not sure about having a board meeting without the public being invited to discuss these things would be a good idea, but it's something that could be looked into.
That I think was right on the money starting with Sharon, and you know: Rebecca Dan, Lawrence, Andrea and many others have just said things I completely agree with and then upgraded up the cause who kind of took the words out of my mouth, a I.
Why there'd be an open meetings problem, because why not just have an ad-hoc committee that meets publicly on zoom' to discuss these things, but here's my only concern about that, because otherwise I think it's a good idea.
Don't know what the Manhattan borough president office is doing right now, but there should be maybe something run centrally out of the MVPs office to talk about what the community boards can do going forward and whether we can make a united front to request the funding.
You know we create a sort of and made risk to our democratic institutions by suddenly going back to in-person meetings and shutting a lot of people out so I just think we got to be patient and wait for a vaccine or wait for a suitable, hybrid approach which I don't see happening unless we have a huge infusion of funding for community boards.
So the upshot of what I'm trying to say is: yes, let's have a committee to discuss it it'll be a great vehicle for people to get expertise and really think these things through with the time this issue deserves, and maybe it ought to be run out of the borough president's office even putting together all the Manhattan community boards.
I, don't think just to clarify my comment to cause about the other meetings law was it didn't sound like he was talking about a public meeting.
Don't know what the answer is and I don't think anyone is suggesting that people come back to a meeting without proper person without a vaccine or without proper precautions because of the health risks.
Alright, so then I think since we're just talking about tabling it, I'll just skip I hope you don't mind Michelle and whoever else I know there was someone else had raised their hands and let's just vote, we have a different secretary who wants to call the roll for the voting on the tabling of a discussion on in-person and virtual meetings?
I'm all ears, not right this second, but in general, okay, I'd, like to turn to the last item on the agenda, which is a conversation on how the board could better support the black members of our community and black businesses within our community.
So I just think every single committee should be able to come up and maybe send you some ideas of what we want to do.
But I would I would like to hear that, of course, and I have asked committees to and not with respect as much but before to come up with ideas and talk about things.
Are there any other members of the community that would like to participate into to have a say now: okay, I, don't see anyone raising their hands from the community?
And if the end that, if a seemingly small business isn't is or isn't what it appears to be, and then the other thing which is slightly off topic but I think is relevant as well as perhaps we want to even expand this effort, and this goes along with the idea that maybe all committees have a role in this.
But have we ever considered having some sort of perhaps task force for people of color or something that will allow community to address issues regarding people of color and whether it be promoting businesses or other issues that are faced with, based on a regular basis like these matters and stuff and such but things that are more systemic.
We have our committees that are able to plan and talk about and come to some kind of resolution or how forums with speakers on various local issues right now, but I'm listening to everybody, so okay, Thank, You, Craig, Billy and then Tricia and then Sharon.
But I do think there may be an appropriate time for us to consider whether a community board Rachel does justice committee or Task Force is warranted, but let's start first with the committee's.
That's my understanding as well know black owned businesses and community district 8 I think we all have to ask ourselves why that is.
It's obviously there's a long history in this country and it's too complicated for this one meeting, which is why I go to sort of my last idea, which is: let's have a full board meeting or somebody you know instead of a land-use presentation or something at the beginning.
Not many of us have the expertise to tackle this really entrenched problem, so I think we should would benefit from starting off with somebody presenting to us helping us gain the expertise, giving us a foundation for doing our own work as a community and then, lastly, let's find ways to reach out to the people in our community or black and brown, who don't necessarily look like this community board, but you know we know there in our community.
I think that I thought I'd be more clear by the time I got to me and I think that this is such an important conversation to have and I'm really glad to have it with the entire board and I applaud Thank You Leah for creating an opportunity for everybody to talk about it.
Think it's very important for a community that isn't primary, that isn't majority people, color majority black for us to be having these conversations to it, makes it bigger and it elevates it so I would be very supportive of the idea that we continue these conversations past tonight.
They would obviously have to self-identify as such and contact Yelp, but that certainly and I'm not I, don't work for you if I'm, not supporting you by just saying that that's certainly a place to start and companies and committees and organizations around the country are having these types of conversations and I'd like to thank a leader and Bill as well.
The idea of intrinsic biases and I should say that we should look internally as well, overall and I think that Billy touched on this and, more specifically with black owned businesses, but with our communities overall and certainly how we interact with each other on the board.
So that way we can at least identify second thing: I do want to figure back on what Billie was saying, because I think it really is important to we're talking about it now as a group and then to take it back to the to the committee level and I think you know.
Think that would be a good test for each committee to do on his own and it may be bringing everything back to the next board meeting Brian when you find out whether other black owned businesses.
So maybe it's something to think about approaching them and asking if they would want something to identify they may or may not, I don't know, but that, but that's something that someone had raised.
Okay, yeah right and so I echo a lot of what's been said, I, you know, I want to piggyback also off of what the points that Billy made agree with the idea of a task force.
Think the biggest issue is, we definitely have a deficit of black community members and the fact that there are there is no one from the community and please correct me if someone did speak to is here to ask a question says a lot, but it sounds like we're all on in agreement that has to be changed.
I need to be an ally and I need to work relentlessly in support of you know, addressing systemic racism I'm starting kind of framing my thoughts in that way, because I think this community board, as folks have you know have said you know, is- does not appear by virtue of a quick glance to be the most diverse board and I.
I think the committee's are a great venue for that, but the starting point has to be that there is a collective understanding, perhaps and a statement to be made to say that this board values understands that, creates that it what its job is and that is to represent the needs of its community at the same time, I think there's something important about us in this moment of national reckoning to say that there is systemic racism and we need to speak up any chance.
Yes, thank you and I really appreciated all of this discussion, and particularly what Greg, the last speaker, I believe that was her name was just saying: I, just I loved the thinking about trying to understand and listen past our biases I, like the unconscious bias, training ideas, I like being able to reach out and understand who the community board is and what they represent and I was just gonna say, as y'all were talking about getting a list of the black businesses in the community.
It would be really helpful to hear from them what would be helpful and I think you know what I have learned in through my professional career development that we're tackling this as well we're trying to listen to those black and brown community members.
So I just really echo the things that I've heard and would love to see having people brought in either call to you know, ask what could be helpful and bring in those community members to adhere their voices and thank you, yeah.
I think we have a real opportunity, like Sondra just said, to really make something more of this and not have it be a Manhattan Board thing, but a cb8 thing, because right now, while we're meeting, hundreds of our community members are at Carl, Schurz Park, marching to support racial equity and justice and I think the community's really ready for change.
That's not just supporting a black owned business, but it's the board having a mission statement about racial equity, injustice and the work we want to do to write past wrongs in our neighborhood, be it with zoning or transportation access or education and equity, and for the task force.
I, just I'm, remembering back in the day, I think taina and Elizabeth were part of about 10 or 12 years ago we were having a discussion about the J rec complex in I, think 68 and second, and whether or not the school would be raised to be replaced with a research center for Hunter and I was really surprised and struck by some of the comments from the that I heard in the course of those community board meetings and at one point, someone from the community stood up and said these kids don't look like us, they aren't our children and so I.
He doesn't want to be in the Upper, East Side and he's right and I respect that the other point I would like to raise is social equity, many time in the community war they coming to us, and they said we wanna feel more for more of your area and we want to put our affordable housing in the Bronx.
Think Sarah Chu knows my feeling about just mercy with Bryan Stevenson that would bring tears to your eyes and so on, but I'm afraid that our community board I don't want it to be personal, so I'm trying to be very careful and I've thought of it, but I think we have very good words and I think we don't necessarily follow through and what's brought great emotion on.
What I'd like to do is borrow an idea that Rebecca lamort mentioned, which is that this task force should be made up of representation and the various committees to make sure that the expertise and what those committees is working on is being reflected, but I do think we need some body that brings together all these areas because they do intersect.
Thank you sure I, really like the idea that believe would forth about a passport I think we should maybe allow the committee to work a little on doing some things first before a task force, because a task force is a smaller amount of people and they don't meet as much and the committees would allow a lot more people to gather information and go back and forth thoughts and then eventually a task force to be used.
Think at this point, we've all said: I know and I don't need to respond to anything anymore.
Okay, Thank, You, Billy, I, think I thought I got cut you off again and I'm.
I think we all ought to be doing a lot of listening, but my the one thing I want to communicate is I feel very strongly that we could very easily leave this meeting and have no real plan for what to do next and if we just give it to the committee's I'm, worried that there will be no structure to what the committee's are doing.
One committee is going to come up with something detailed and thoughtful another committee, maybe just does something at a surface level, so what I think we can do going forward is have it if we do have a taskforce and formed by the ideas and strategies of members of this community board.
So I just wanted to put that on the table, because I think we could very well leave this meeting without a direction and I want to make sure that we've got some sense of where we're going as a board on these important issues.
And if you have ideas about other people who either can advise or it could be on the task force, then please email, those suggestions as well, because the time is right and we are leaders in the community and in this and in the borough and in the city, and we should be doing something or many things so and for Loraine Brown.
I really think that at this time not a task force, I think there's going to be a lot of work to be done in their community committee and I.
