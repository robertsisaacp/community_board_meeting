Council member just to give you a little bit of backstory, which I think you already know, but of course we were all very concerned about open space, we're so proud that you have helped champion this issue during your tenure in the city council.
The idea is that you might have with regards to this, but really we'd love to just get your thoughts on all the parks in our community and then, if you could give some kind of specific thoughts on Rupert I think that's where we're going to naturally transition to afterwards bringing the board.
Many of you joined us to break ground on three point: three million dollars to rebuild Carl Schurz Park playground, which I am hoping and I'm hoping you have an update, but I'm hoping we can have it open in September, because the kids will need it.
We just reopened a new ad, a ramp at if I believe, 82nd Street I mentioned the Carl Schurz playground and then from 99th 90th Street to 88th Street, one of the first money I ever secured 35 million dollars in my first three months in office went to that and that is actually already open.
We have John Jay Park a senior space that this committee did a lot of the public hearings on that we need to move forward with and so for.
What I would say is one question that we've had and I would like to say that this should be off topic, because I know that one of the co-chairs has devoted at least one or two meetings on this is whether a dog run would be appropriate for Hartford for Rupert, given how many people bring their dogs there.
Let Park speak to it, but I do know that David, Rosen, cien and other neighbors who are nearby would mention that there are a lot of dogs barking and historically, as far as I know, at least in our neighborhood.
So the idea was to take down the fences and the gates and I think the board had been opposed to taking down the fences and the gates, because there are already there may already be an individual who sleeps in the park at night, and we didn't want to make it easier for people to just come in.
I'll just say the other big challenge we have is just no matter how much amazing work the Muslim volunteers do in terms of the plantings we end up at having all that get torn up very soon thereafter by folks who are not being good neighbors and are letting their dogs off the leash and then the dog ripping things up.
Well it's over eight years now, as you know, been that we have John Jay Park theme, one section, the it's actually a playground and it we were expecting to fix a section, so people could sit down there.
So anything in construction is continuing, so Carl Schurz park playground is continuing, but the John Jay, Park seating area and even the East River Esplanade project that I funded with the mayor have been a contractor, is close to being selected they're ready to do the contract award, but the city has placed a hold on any of these new construction projects.
So we really have to talk about it, then, because this is not fair to the community, the three seniors, two of whom were on board eight, who asked for it so badly and needed it eight years ago, have passed away and we have so many people who I'm sorry I was just trying to get something to eat.
I just want to address some kind of immediate and I, see mark sicarios on the pole and we brought them up with Wesley, but there is a lot of vandalism and the southern part of more attention to that area, since more and more people are using it since there's such a dearth of public state in the area and the waterfront of so beautiful here, that's one thing number two you're talking about exercise equipment in John, Jay and one of our next project, because we've got a lot of requests for it to put exercise equipment in some form on some part of the Esplanade.
Let me know that the parks department, you know, will work with sanitation and others, something that you may have heard about in the city and that I tweeted about today is that one of the reasons I voted no is because they've been cutting random things that we didn't want them to cut.
Thank you for making this time for Rupert Park in particular, so glad that you brought every all the players in question in one forum, so hi Ben, hi, Commissioner, Castro, wonderful to hear from you after some time, I just want to first thank both of you and CB.
We've talked about a lot of the issues that were aired at today's meeting over the years and we would really encouraging everyone granted its covert environment, but we can have a zoom called and I think all the players need to sit down and actually hammer out future renovations improvements to the park.
Someone is coming and chopping down the plants and we have notified on New York, City parks, usually Wes or somebody there immediately, but I think we need to take it to the next stage.
It really is not the best ground to put a park in of this kind because of the slow causes, erosion as I'm sure most people know, but I think that's the initial thing that we should do the September's doing a major planting throughout the park and I'll work with the councilmen, as we have in the past, to see how we can do any capital renovations temporal renovations are increasingly expensive.
Member is that this Liz Krueger the state senator all these different elected officials, to let folks know that this is a park that is a priority and then just one other part, but I don't want to get lost.
Unfortunately, councilman Kalos left after I wanted to address the issue that I thought was really important and I know attrition you've been to the John Jay Park numerous times, as we discussed previously, but I think it's very irresponsible to go ahead and remove the equipment at John, Jay, Park I'm, considering all the gyms are closed.
Think you just need to go there and see what's happening and Trish like I said: you've been there so I understand and another point mark I understand, really understand what you were talking about: adding new equipments versus the equipment, all the way downtown.
Scuse me I mean those are excellent pieces of equipment, but the other equipment that was put in there had lots of moving parts are not useful pieces of equipment, they're easy to break, which is really what happened, but I have seen other equipments in other parts in other parks in the city that are very functional, so you were talking sounded like there was the possibility of adding additional equipments on the squad further down, but no one from the upper east side is going all the way down to Chinatown with a lower Eastside to go exercise.
Sorry, everybody on my I think that the next person who had their hand raised was Justin hi how's it going yep, hi I'm, a resident of the neighborhood 79th Street I grew up in this neighborhood grew up in John, Jay Park went to PS 158 with my wife.
That's one another issue and lastly, I'd like to address the issues with dog walking in John, Jay Park I know it's.
It's been mentioned as an issue in Rupert part, but it's also concerned to many parents in John, Jay Park, there's a cabal of dog walkers who like to bring their dogs into the kitty playground and also on the ball court area, which some years ago recently was renovated.
For his sake, you know such wonderful words that he said about Rupert, Park and Muslim oranges for New York's I just wanted to add a couple of things just wanted to mention about that.
We are still trying, although given that, like another fact, was closed off to continue some of the some of the activities related to parts so just to keep that interest going now that the parks are like, you know, they've opened up, hopefully like my October is our next event on the calendar and hopefully by then you know, situation would have changed and we would be able to bring in and invite everyone to come, and you know clean the park and also to launch new paths for the next season.
Think that's what moving was also mentioning and I want to just I kind of emphasize that as well, that we would definitely cross to be a part of that yeah, big role in that in engaging the community in helping in many ways.
But since this was technically questions that people had raised their hands with regards to kind of a broader scope of parks, I think we can continue Jen her Ratner was next may I.
You know there are lots of water spots where there's small little areas where people can do chin-ups or whatever they want to do pull-ups, and it would, you know, be a great location for people to use that kind of exercise, equipment and would certainly be able to help coordinate.
But what I wanted to ask you is everyone is complaining about the conditions that you heard just a while ago and John Jay with the dog feces and with all the money and the wonderful things that were done for the other parts of the children's unit and the basketball courts.
Don't hold me to that number, but that's roughly what it is, but so that and other people who we usually have available have not been reporting in as much as we would like, and there are some real, legitimate concerns of people who have health conditions, who you know, have difficulty coming in and need to stay home, it's very important that they take care of themselves.
The second part of this, my answer is that I've spoken with our regional managers and mark Vaquero is one of them and a very good one and I've asked them to look at locations where we are having problems because of use primarily for litter, where we found this to be true at Carl, Schurz, Park and other parks throughout the borough, where people go out because they're going nuts inside and that makes sense they want to get out.
What this has done is it's started to have an impact on your local parks, whether it's grass areas have become worn as a result of this other things that you're seeing people using them in ways that they and been, as one gentleman said earlier this evening, or it's been an increase in some of the uses.
It's made it harder for us to lock parks at night because our staff has to get home and they need to leave earlier than they ordinarily would they usually work fairly late, but we're I've talked to our staff and I said: look find the locations that seem to be problematic, and let's do a number of things to address that, because I want the public to be well served and I want their parks to be clean and well-maintained.
So now this was a very expensive piece of equipment, I'm sure you know which one it was because I can't remember the name of it, but that was causing problems, and so the manufacturer had it removed, have you removed, but we should get the money back, for that was one of the things I did want to mention, but the other issue had been voted more people wanted to have.
But I do remember that the people were asking for their furniture and wanted it and I'm very happy to hear that the Esplanade I would like to have it because I believe there are four pieces.
So we're going to the board members now Rita hi I want to just thank Mubeen and all the Muslim women of New York do an incredible job at Ruben, Park I, don't have a dog, but I do have grandchildren who do have a dog, and they did come to visit this past weekend and we only met outside and my daughter-in-law, who is not afraid of anything decided to walk the dog in the area where it's a dog area I never saw Jackie move at the speed of lightning to get out of it.
I'm glad that we have the money and the inclination and also to moving in her Muslim group that looks after I'm, sorry, I'm, so bad at names that looks after the park and takes care of it because I know what he's talking about.
So I just wanted to point that out and see if there is any way that we can have an arrangement so that there is still security provided for Gracie Mansion, but perhaps that it doesn't result in these closures that are in commuting people well mark I, don't know if you can shed any light on this, but I'll certainly talk with mark Recaro tomorrow and he's in contact with the Gracie Mansion police on a regular basis and we'll find out and get an answer for you great.
Lowell hi I, just I, want to talk about the funding and parks and the frustration that every Community Board has across New York City is when we gather funding for jobs in parks, especially we don't really see by the time to get design chairman, maybe four or five years have gone by, and this is a little long process, and especially now within times changing and the funding going down I'd like to see everyone take advantage of.
The design-build Cuomo announced that New York City now on parks projects up at 1.5 can do design-build I haven't seen any come out there, but I know that design-build takes a shorter time and it's cheaper and I'd like to see with some of the smaller projects, because, like a dog one or tree planting, I, think there's six or seven people on this phone call I can design and build that.
It's now legal to do, but you know thanks Cuomo and I'd like to see parks, take the initiative to do that and make it also inclusive more minority businesses and workers and women workers, not just the businesses, but the people who live in a city and represent the city be included in those projects.
I think the last person who has this and then we'll a little bit more of a discussion on Rupert is moving first I just want to thank a lead and Rita for the very kind comments we truly appreciated.
We really couldn't do anything without the collective support of the community and the Upper East Side to help with Rupert Bart I have a question for Commissioner Castro I know the parks such as beginning to open up and in this current covert environment I'm.
Just wondering that, as we are looking at a forward calendar, you know we currently have planned our fall planting for Rupert Park, which is the big planting in the fall that we do I'm just wondering as far as going to provide all the necessary PPE, etc to make it a safe event for us to invite volunteers and participants to come and work in, and city parks.
If you want to go ahead with a resolution that can't hurt- and it's always good to hear from the community boards about what they think is important- and you never know when it comes to and saved the day, thank you for that direction.
And so, if you don't mind me summing up what I think our general feelings are about, this is that we've heard from Beck councilmember Kalos that there's four hundred five hundred thousand dollars but he's allocated for this space but in reality to get those big, meaningful capital changes that we need for this park.
So we can't we can't prepare a design or a plan and peddle that we can do is we can sit down and get the best thoughts from the member of the community from our leaders at in the council and the and at parks, particularly from bill castro, and on to what let's get a vision going for?
What we think this park could be I mean, maybe we'll do a sure, ed or something along those lines to at least have a thought that can be visualized that what your money's going to go to this.
Just I just want to use my position as co-chair to just suggest that, instead of us forming another subcommittee for something that we try to see, if we can't make some actionable steps tonight to in our committee as parks to see if we can take steps forward on this, if we need a separate subcommittee or when I'm okay, but I would like to first see you if we can't I, like the I, like what you're saying so you're saying that we first come up with opportunities to get visions done on what Rupert Park can do.
That's what propelled this exactly so having everybody put in some part of it and then I think also having maybe we can all and obviously you know the Commissioner has Troy and Mark and everybody from the parks.
We can also have you know like a pool that can be created for rupert part where people chip in and give some resources as well, so that we do have the financial resources and I'm sure the amount that has been mentioned is not like over one year that we need to like that will need to be come up for like two years, but it's going to be, and I think that somewhere where commissioner castro can mention that over how many years does this kind of money need to be collected or like would be needed and again then, maybe having all of us on a call where we have kind of part of it in detail which parts of the quadrant how they can be worked and with various ideas.
You have an awful lot of connections up there if it's worth talking to someone from the school from the urban planning school, an outside point of view, who can who can look and maybe have some ideas that they'd be willing to share about how to get community buy-in to the idea of what ultimately is done with the dogs about the dogs, because that is so central to all of this, it just seems like and I have more of an outside because I'm not as involved in the parks on a day to day basis and then for the funding.
Although I know the time is really hard right now, but some of them the buildings around there whose residents use the park, maybe there's something possible there, but I was just thinking it's it.
There's no I know that there's nothing quite like it really close by and near it and a lot of people use it, who can't get to Carl shirts and with their dogs, or just to go and sit in, and so there are a lot of stakeholders just outside points of view and getting all those stakeholders at the table and making sure you have the right representatives.
So if you can reach some kind of idea that there's a buy in to it and that's all thank you, I'm gonna, just like sahar speak, sorry, I didn't so I wanted to ask about the same thing that we have also been hearing about.
So is it possible for community board to maybe send a small form to all the neighbors, and then they fill it up and say what would they like to see in Ruppert, Park, I?
You know they would feel like they are involved in it and they would feel interested and also this would give an exact idea what the neighbors want right.
They don't want a dog, Iran and obviously Commissioner Castro can mention the technical aspects and play a big role here that whether it should even make sense to us but I just feel like, if weakens us, since this is something a part, is something that belongs to the to the local community, to the people to the neighbors.
It is I mean we go through the community board to get their recommendation whenever people want to put in a dog run, and it works very well so I like to hear from the community board first as to whether they thinking it makes sense or not, it doesn't mean I'm going to do it if they say they want it or not, do it if they say they don't, but it's taken seriously.
Normally, when there's planning for a new park and Commissioner Castro connect me correct me if I'm wrong, the parks department has meetings with the community one two, three, four: whatever is needed in the planning stages and then they come back and they bring a plan to us for our approval and discussion and maybe redesign etc.
They do not come to the Community, Board and they're designated for rupert park, and I think it's not too soon to start that we should start doing that as soon as possible, respectively and to work out the plan.
What's what the broader community wants to see for this for this space in the future before I start to because I guess I, just don't see how I'm can justify saying, give me a million dollars without a more concrete proposal in place of what I know that I should go to.
So that's number one and number two is that if you ask you used to have a saying in advertising that a camel is a horse designed by committee- and you know you ask a hundred people and you get a hundred and twenty-five answers and we should ask them but I think one of the things that we should do.
This is like no other Park in the city that I know of I mean I'm sure in the Bronx learned about later so mark.
You know this park is Jack was a disaster from the beginning, so I think that we really need to go around.
I think that I can't do it without the broader community's input in this, and so I would like to suggest that we use August and September to solicit people.
We could ask the Muslim volunteers from New York to reach out to their list - for whoever is around and just try the best we can to get as much community input as possible in this, not any one meeting, not in a one town hall standpoint in a prolonged way, people can send us feedback, and then we come together in September in a separate meeting led by whatever small sub committee wants to lead it, to discuss this vision and to then discuss how we go about advocating for the pieces that are most common and that kind have the most common ground.
Well, traditionally were away, but with the advent of zoom that shouldn't matter, I think if you're going to look at and I'm sorry to keep bringing this up the dogs, and if it's not part of you need to have the parameters, as Rita pointed out of what is impossible or what's not ideal, because if people are all talking about how it should be 90% a dog park and that can't be done, then you have to be able to deal with it.
I think yeah people may go away and come back with a brilliant idea or ideas, but in the meantime you need to figure out what is possible, what is impossible and what and just some different ways of looking at it for the community to be able to respond because you need you need buy-in.
We can create that before the before August recess, Barry and I will work together on creating a survey and that will go out to the broad community asking for their thoughts on River Park and their and what they think a large redesign would look like and what it should have and what who it and how it can meet the needs of the most stakeholders will share those will and then in September we will hold both a subcommittee meeting and a parks committee meeting to have a subcommittee work on looking at those pictures that Rita have said and looking at these designs and looking at the feedback that came in and then we'll address it at our September meeting as well.
We're going to have to close off another section of the Esplanade completely, you know either this is all depending and what the engineers tell us that an 80 year old piece of infrastructure that hasn't been taken care of is not in the best of shape so that that's a possibility coming forward.
We have to just talk about Central Park for a second, because I think Elizabeth Ashby was waiting to hear about Central Park, yes right, but I just wanted to say that this is extremely frustrating, because I sat in person listening to parks, talk about which was what was funded not six months ago and I said that it was bad that we didn't fund 76 to 78, Street and I said I said it and I said it even in her in our full board meeting I told our the committee and the full board meeting we need to advocate, for this is not good, that this isn't funded.
So I would urge this committee to think about ways that we can bring this to the attention of our elected officials again and those who are the decision-makers on this, because I mean I'm feel like I'm, seeing the same things over it again, except in a different light.
A second orderly I said: I loved you I love your idea for what to do in August and September of the only thing is I again would reiterate: we've had so many conversations with New York City Parks, where they've talked about the almost impossibility of having a dog run there.
The commanding officer of the Central Park precinct on those two issues and Elizabeth had and I have my report right here and I'm going to read this because that's the way it's written, Elizabeth Ashby community board member had brought up two items regarding Central Park traffic signals not being a DA accessible meaning when people new wheelchairs came up to try to push the button on the light to change the signal from goddess to stop.
The other item I would like to bring to your attention that was mentioned earlier, that some 500 people have signed petitions to have the pool at John, Jay Park, open I'd like to suggest.
As always, you have convinced me, you convinced nutrition, so I guess I, don't think we need to I, don't know if we take a vote or not to decide on the pool matter or if it's just something that Aleta is able to do, I'm, not sure if it is still on the line.
Think it's wonderful that you're here I wanted to just mention one other thing, and this was something that when we talked about Central Park, it happened about a month or two ago.
At this point that there are no there, no dogs are off leash in the ramble and really, if and you talk to, neighbors I- just hope that as good park advocates, you would remind everybody of the rules and try to make sure that spaces that spaces is preserved in the way it should be, and I guess I just wanted to say that I'm gonna talk to Barry about this more but as we move forward as a committee, I do would love to think about equity in all senses of the word and this committee, and what we can do with that.
I think that Rupert Park and The Esplanade and the fact that the Esplanade connects three or three or more different communities with very different populations of people that you that use it and there's a lot there.
