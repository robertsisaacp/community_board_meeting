We ask that everyone participate in new york's test and trace program for yourselves, your friends and family and neighbors your favorite businesses and everyone else in the city I'm thrilled to introduce dr ted long executive director of the test and trace corps at new york, city's health and hospitals.
We want to answer as many as possible and we'll provide contact information for dr long if you have additional questions or would like more information after the program, I'd like to turn it over to russell now russell.
You know, working together on these contact tracing meetings and the first one that we did was a q a session, and we had a number of questions sort of left over from that one.
We thought it'd be helpful to to have another session where the public could get a chance to ask questions and members of the board could ask questions that they have about the contact tracing program and so with that, let's turn it over to dr ted long.
Well, I first wanted to say thank you everybody for your time tonight on in the evening to listen to me and to hear about our contact tracing program.
But I do want to give a little bit of a backdrop to how we've structured our program here just to make sure that we're all on the same page, because if you take one thing away from me here today, it's that our program, all of the work we've put in, is only as strong as everybody in new york city that participates in the program and our tracers themselves.
So I hope that by the end of this I can gain your trust in the program and if we call you that you'll pick up the phone and want to be part of the work we're doing together to suppress covet so there's three ways that we want to suppress the coronavirus in new york city.
Our team of more than 3 000 tracers calls every single new case and talks to them and then figures out with them who the contacts are that we then need to track down, in other words, who the people that are in new york city now that are at risk for having been exposed are, and how can we get through to them?
And how can we then bring them in for testing and then how can we give them what they need to be successful in getting through this, because, if you've been exposed to the coronavirus, it can take up to 14 days for the virus to present itself, we call that a 14 day, incubation period, so, if you've been exposed, we want you to stay home for 14 days without running the risk of exposing others to the coronavirus.
So what we've done is we've created a new role called a resource navigator, which is where we pair new yorkers up with things like food delivery, help with medications even help with things like if you have an eviction threat or if your employer is saying that they're going to fire you if you're staying at home and quarantine, which is the right thing for new york city, which, by the way they can't do state law, precludes them from doing that.
We can do to help you and for thousands of new yorkers, I'm proud to say, we've been able to help so far, so I actually I'll be brief, but I really am here to listen today and to answer your questions, so I can actually I'll pause there and happy to go into any more detail about what contact tracing is what you can expect from us, our team, our contact, tracers or take us any direction.
Contact tracers ask when they call you in the course of contact tracing- and I guess, are there different questions that you get as a contact or you know compared to questions that you might get as somebody who's tested, positive, great question.
Do you need help we have if you do need help, we have our covet hotline, which we stood up at the peak of the crisis, where we can pair you with the clinician instantaneously, so we're there to help you clinically in any way that we can once we've asked you about your symptoms and once we're make sure that you're safe, where you are at home, and everything like that from from the perspective of if you're, feeling, okay and able to continue the interview, we then go in and ask you questions about who you've been in contact with and where you might have been so who you've been in contact with we defined for you, one of the one of the definitions is somebody that you've been within six feet of for more than 10 minutes.
That's another question that I have so the assistance that the city provides and resource navigators and that kind of thing you know, we've heard that you know if you are in a situation where you live with other people, and you can't isolate from them that the city will put you up in a hotel.
I I've heard also that there's assistance with things like having your dog walked, and I think all of that makes a lot of sense, but it almost sounds too good to be true, and so I'm wondering if you can provide basically if there are statistics about how many folks have been helped in this way, to kind of make it more real for people and also just other information about the mechanics of how that sort of assistance is provided to sort of reassure people that is there and they do have these resources available.
That's why getting tested is important because, if you're positive, we want to know that now because then we watch for your symptoms and we want to then figure out who you've exposed to the virus if you're positive, but a negative result before 14 days, doesn't tell you that you're definitively not going to develop it on day 14, because the incubation period can be a full two weeks, but I do think of timing.
If she shows no symptoms, does someone come in and test her any time during that period to see whether the people in her family have been exposed to the virus?
It takes a few days for the coronavirus to have that effect on your body, so what we say is best to get tested and we do want in your situation that the person that was exposed to get tested, but if you can best to wait at least several days, because that's the window when most people, if they did contract it, are going to have a positive test result and or are going to have symptoms.
As other cities, you know, unfortunately, are going through what we went through in april, so that piece is something we're working on, but that that's to decide for your question.
It's been years of my life taking to make this this program work, but I think we're doing a good job and our goal is really to do exactly what you said to meet the challenge of getting through to everybody within 24 hours, to the greatest extent that we can so the digital piece is an interesting one, and this is something we've thought a lot about.
These are not people from they've never been to new york before or you know, don't understand what it's been like for us here.
If there is in fact a positive case, classroom or dorm settings also, I was wondering whether or not there is you know, plans for a specific tracer to be, or maybe a team of tracers to be assigned to schools- or you know oh yeah, those are finished, but you're dead on oh good and also on also on that note testing for institutions of higher learning in the works.
I agree with the sentiment of everything you're saying we will and plan to and will have dedicated teams for different types of settings for sure, because that way we can really figure out what's going on in different settings in terms of price and that's what orange do in terms of pragmatically around your point of what can higher education settings do I just want to really drive this point home nothing's 100, but it makes a big difference if you're wearing a mask and if you are socially separating more than six feet apart.
If everybody- and you know quite frankly in new york city now, we have the lowest number of cases that we've had since this whole thing started, and that is you know, new yorkers have earned this.
It really makes a big difference, but beyond that, if there is transmission, we're doing everything that you just said and we're going to be calling institutions if there are clusters of cases things like that for sure I totally agree with you.
The first part of your question I just want to emphasize too, though, is that contact tracing for any setting is up and running now.
Is it something that I should do you know once a month I mean I just I don't know what the protocol is yeah great question, so the first thing I'll say is that we do based on our universal testing policy.
Unfortunately, people that are older, with comorbidities have a more severe reaction to the coronavirus if you're worried about potentially being contagious to a family member, but you feel fine come and get tested before you visit your family member, it's a safe thing to do, and it's something again that we want to offer to you.
Other programs, like this in other cities, have not taken the step that we have to offer them a huge amount of resources to help people to get through this, with their families to be able to stay at home or to be able to go to a hotel.
So our my view on this, in our view on this is definitely that we want to earn your trust, and we believe that, if you believe in the program, you're going to tell us be more likely to tell us more people, more contacts or more people that you may have exposed.
So we want to do everything we can to do a good job with the program, and this is where we could use your help in terms of getting the word out to people, because if nobody trusts our program and if no, if, if we can't earn your desire to participate in the program, I don't believe it's going to succeed.
So that's another thing that we, you know from a policy perspective, can do to mitigate the risk of having the coronavirus transmitted and in terms of how contact tracing works.
No because sick people, we know, are contagious, of course, but if you do have a positive result for coronavirus and you're a case, we're going to call you and we are going to ask you if you've been at a restaurant, we're going to ask you who you've been in contact with the restaurant.
We put a lot of hard work into making sure that we could communicate to people about the vast protections that we do have to be clear with you to first part of your question, we will not ask you for your immigration status.
But if people don't know that, then they can't trust our program as much as they possibly could and that's where we need to work together in terms of the the state bill.
We also want to make sure that, there's that the bill is compatible with our program being successful too, and that's what our teams are reviewing now, but the principles that we applied to nyc care we've fully leveraged those same principles to this program now and if anything, I would want to ask for your help in terms of being able to address legitimate issues or questions that people have, but once those are addressed, helping to work together to convince the yorkers that they can trust us, because if we don't have that trust, the program can't succeed in suppressing the coronavirus.
Elite actually asked to have cos, go first yeah, but, oh sorry, I didn't see that so dr long, this program is very robust in new york city in new york state, but we have a lot of people coming from jersey, connecticut, massachusetts and everywhere else.
You know, new york and the other states yeah good question, so we do work with other states of course, and like, for example, in the tri-state area.
Are you guys getting contact information from other jurisdictions like if someone in you know new jersey, let's say, has a positive test, and hopefully there's some kind of contact racing going on there, and one of the contacts is somebody in new york?
So our program we're only calling people that are in new york city, so let's go to pixel 3 xl and I would just when we unmute you.
What is that number city, nothing hospitals, contact, tracing, right, yeah, there's we have an inbox and more than one phone number, but I think julia, your point's really well taken.
We've really gone out of our way to do things extra that we think are important for new yorkers like the hotels program.
Nobody said we had to do that and that's not in any textbook for contact tracing, but we want to do it because we want to convince new yorkers that we're in this together and that they have our support so that things like that have meant a lot to us and we want to.
We need people to know what we're doing so when they get a call from a contact.
The call because we're doing all of this to support new york and the program will only be as good as people believe in it to be.
You know, I don't think we have more of an agenda really for this meeting other than the you know getting these questions answered, but these are very it's a lot of helpful information, so we will incorporate that into what we're doing going forward and obviously we'll try and get the word out so and then I hope everybody on this call will get the word out.
