If we have all the applicants here, if we could take them all in turn, I will let the fellow board members raise their hand to object, seeing none I think thank you.
Yeah, because I was thinking that, where a lot of these applications, where always be supportive of the community zone, that there's a strong objection, I would make a motion seconded to take them all together, as approvals I see a hand up, maybe and one for my board member and one from a guest too from board members.
Let's ask what their position is: okay, yeah I was just gonna ask if we just have a few more minutes, just to go over everything, one more time and just make sure before we vote on everything.
You hear me now, yes, okay, thank you.
No. On the contrary, we would like to hear one by one and hear exactly what are they greatly concerned and promise they come, so the community will come, learn more about the situations under which they are living, and this is why I believe the first thing is: we have to walk location by application and learn each of them.
I'm just wondering the Upper East Side has been notorious during the latter part of this crisis for having restaurants and bars that are serving liquor to people on the street and I'd like you to ask them.
Thank you so just to follow up on that, you would like us to ask the applicants whether they have received complaints about the congregating.
They were seated or they picked up, orders to go and they took their alcohol and instead of staying seated taking it home with them, they were drinking on the street, and that was a real issue and I think that's something that we have to ask the people who are coming before us.
So if I understand you correctly so yeah, the establishments can serve to go so you're asking whether what type of prevention mechanisms they are taking to prevent individuals drinking on the street right because that's what's happening, I understand in the 80s and 90s and 70s people are walking around with open containers of alcohol.
So, okay, we can ask them I, guess no I, guess a question and that I think the conundrum were in is that even if a establishment is serving and sealed containers that doesn't prevent an individual from posting as they're walking down the street and therefore an establishment should not then be penalized for the actions of the individual.
Actually, we have I've written the policy to make sure that we don't ask people to stick around if they've gotten something to go and they don't congregate in groups that would exceed any of the regulations, and we were also very attentive to the governor's executive order regarding a hundred feet within your premises, you're responsible for the individual opening that container or violating a liquor laws.
So it has been a give-and-take working with the community on that so I think I'm, comfortable and saying as in-house counsel, that we've addressed the alcohol issue, given the current standards that were there and we're always vigilant and look for any input, the community might have thank you yeah and to the application.
Okay, with that I will are there any hands up or members of the public Judy Schneider they've been a good neighbor since they've moved in I recommend their food highly would hope that the board members would support this application.
Are there any other non board members right, I do not see any hands that are raised, I, say Russell Squire and Marco tamiya, okay.
Just wanted to address the point that the Judy had made that Abraham also spoke to I mean I, think that's a question of you know: people with open containers and taking the drinks away from the bars I reluctant to really press people too much on this I think you know there are some places that have been operating, that haven't even been allowing people to congregate or haven't even really made spaces for people to congregate and I.
That's now approved that you know that wouldn't be okay, but it just seems to me that if we're gonna allow, you know we're in this sort of weird situation now, where we're a lot of the old rules, obviously have been sort of temporarily put aside and we're allowing people to basically purchase alcohol without actually setting foot inside of an establishment which is a new thing and we're allowing people to sit outside and eat and drink without the full.
You know inherent that if somebody's going to be getting a drink from a bar, that's got basically like a counter set up and their door to gainers outside, and you know certainly the I just you know that I just think that that's sort of built in and so I think going beyond that in terms of what we want the establishments to do.
Just more broadly, for the whole meeting for this applicant I didn't see like an estimated percentage of or I guess it wouldn't be estimated in this case, but what your food percentages and your drink percentages in terms of your you know your sales yeah, the rough percentages I have on-hand a debt rejected accounting to be specific at this point, but is a 75 to 25 percent, seventy five being through twenty five percent during.
The issue of open containers outside I would like to see something, and they are in the approval that the applicant are needed to avoid this kind of trouble, because the whole mess that we cover here is the virus, and we have to have the eight feet wide.
I will move to approve this application if we have hand raised the second bit, that would be great I see.
I wanted to follow up on Judy's comments, because I think one of the things she was referring to the Transportation Committee was my comment and I just wanted to share my comment with you tonight, because it's relevant to every applicant and just for everything going forward, and it's just a personal experience that was relayed to me by my daughter that happened a week ago, this past Friday night, when she made an attempt to go down second Avenue and have something at one of the outdoor cafes.
So if you want to have a further rather than hold up each applicant tonight with this discussion, although I think they should be a part of it, because they're going to be the enforces as well as the sellers, I think, maybe a new business.
Now, considering that phase three of restaurant reopening has been pushed back by the governor hi Brian, we currently don't have any outdoor seating right now we haven't actually been operating out of the ideal and location since the shutdown has occurred.
What I was just gonna say and if, in the future they do want to have a outdoor cafe and I, don't know if they have the license or a that is a separate application and they would come to us before they do so.
Okay, all right thank I'm, good thanks, okay, great any more handle only Marco who is I think it already spoken on this issue that I could be hurt right.
So, let's see, if there's any, can an objection to the approval or IV line board members, please raise your hand to participants menu our star nine.
So you have two board members who have their hands raised in order Michelle and then mrs.
The other thing was the food to alcohol ratio, sure that's 84 percent food to 16 percent alcohol, and so, if each applicant can tell us that would be helpful thanks, Michelle Abraham, you're, muted right now, but I heard a lot of noise coming from your background, so I'm just gonna go to the next board member.
What I wanted to do is to amend Michelle's request in addition to that, I would like each applicant to state if there is outdoor space in addition to the food beverage ratio.
Thank you and the hours are the proud outdoors, Thanks correct, yeah sure like hand washing no that's our space assuming, oh sorry, yeah all of our seating space was actually outdoor in this location.
Thank you, Oh, second, that, let's see it Marco one thing I had to mention to all the restaurants are in bars all of them they had to apply in do T or the outside, because the inspector from the OT running around the neighborhood checking if the ceiling is, according with the new regulations of do T and I.
Thank you unless there's any other hands seconding the approval by Russell and let's take the whole hands up for a negative works and just raise your hand if you are voting against abstaining because I don't see any hands up Abraham, so I think you can confirm it.
We will we're operating at a seventy percent to thirty percent food drink which already a lot of coffee and things like that and alcohol outside.
So anyone that wants to vote no or abstain raise your hand.
We took the motion to make sure that we got rid of it as soon as possible, anything under 13 days to get that you know, would have done it as quickly as we could and at which time we also had the proposal for what we wanted to do after which was open, seating floor plan, which was approved by thankfully by a community board and by the city as well.
Okay, great, so I think that's all the hands.
Okay, I would second that motion through a probe is there any other hands?
Please raise your hand going once great okay.
There is the only one we'll have to approve marco raised his hand as well know if he's won in a second or Marco -.
Thinking yeah I just had questions so I didn't see on the application what the hours were and what the food and drink you know revenue percentages, whereas you have this in the application.
Second, did that, but also I have hands up from Marco and cause okay, Marco yeah I think that okay, great this thing I see we were supposed to respond by March.
Yes, I'd like to know what the vote was on that one that was disputed.
So on that one, there was three abstentions: one no, which means there was one two, three, four five, six, yes, one, two three four that will go down as know what effectively Arno's abstained and oh great, well any other hands.
