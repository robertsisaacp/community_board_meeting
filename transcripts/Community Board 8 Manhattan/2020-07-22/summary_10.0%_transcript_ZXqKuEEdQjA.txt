This is barbara sharkey, I'm co-chair of the housing committee and won't be introduced any board members who are on say who they are?
Please sure do you want to wait a couple of minutes, barbara we have oh, we can wait a couple of minutes: okay, hi, sam, it's him muted!
Barrero is here, along with a lot of familiar faces, happy to see everybody welcome to the july housing committee meeting and to our first I think barbara.
Sam is going to update us on all things that are going on, including and beyond the rent assistance program that I believe and sam I'll leave it to you to correct me if I'm wrong, which is still available for application until july 30., and we have the eviction moratorium.
I think to talk about, and sam has told me that he has lots and lots of updates from albany on pending legislation regarding rent housing and all things related to that.
So ed asked me to talk a little bit about the state of of housing evictions, the state of the rental assistance program and other things going on in albany.
As you know, you have, you know until people start dropping off, but you know use your discretion, but I mean you know we want you to cover, what's important to know everything's important right now so go ahead.
The latest statistics showed about a quarter of tenants, did not pay full rent last month, which is kind of high, given a 20 unemployment rate, since there is usually a number of tenants who don't pay, but a lot of people who are unemployed are relying on those unemployment, expanded checks, including the extra 600 which are set to expire.
It also doesn't cover people who became unemployed in phase four which we're in right now in new york city.
There's also a federal eviction moratorium on tenants whose landlords receive federal funding and the clearest case of that is nycha residents whose landlord is the public authority, but also section 8, tenants, tenants in program in buildings that were built with a low-income housing tax credit which is most affordable, housing and then most affordable housing.
So if it's not clear just please let me know, but it covers the increase in tenant's, rent burden for march april may and june.
Okay, that is correct, especially if they're in private housing, without section 8 subsidies or something like that group was already the most rent burden, whereas somebody who had a small rent burden would still be qualified for this program.
So it also doesn't cover anybody who was immediately affected by this pandemic in mid-march, which you know certain areas pretty hard pretty fast, so people who are ineligible, like I said people who are low income now but weren't, then people who were not rentward and then but are now people who are rent burdened before and are still rent burdened but haven't lost income, undocumented households without a single citizen, who's or a person who's a legal resident.
This doesn't include public housing, section, 8 or other voucher recipients, because they can reapply for their programs at their new lower income, and it doesn't cover people whose rent is over 125 percent of what hud considers the fair market rent standards.
So if your rent was already pretty high higher than hud thinks it should be, you don't get covered, which I imagine could include some members in community board eight, even though they might be under 80 ami.
There are three big and fairly comprehensive bills that are being introduced right now in albany, as well, which the coalition of groups that coalesced around the rent reforms last year are supporting.
Let me go back so: housing access, voucher, senate, seven, six, two, eight, a seven six, two, eight, a the assembly bill is a 9657a, so those are the numbers for housing access, voucher program on the extended eviction and foreclosure moratorium.
That's s-8667, though this would protect commercial and residential tenants from eviction during the state of emergency, plus give them an extra year to recover, given that the economic fallout is going to be much longer than the epidemiological fallout and it prevents filings of and executions of, both evictions and foreclosures, and this, like I said it covers commercial and residential homeowners and renters.
So this is a fairly comprehensive deal that would just keep people in place if businesses close, of course, the landlords can bring in a new tenant, but as long as they're operational, they can't be evicted final and perhaps most expansive and even controversial bill is a cancel rent bill that is sponsored in the senate by julia salazar and in the assembly by you lean new.
So it includes a landlord hardship fund which is designed to prioritize small operators, non-profits and public housing authorities before all other potential landlords and landlords can basically get their rent payments covered in, but in exchange they have to open their books and demonstrate that they actually have a hardship that other programs work.
The old rent control system similarly require that landlords show that they were reinvesting their rents into their buildings, so this would bring back that system for landlords that operate that take that hardship fund, and it also requires that landlords who take the hardship fund, freeze their rents to pre-covered rates for five years and abide by what they call good cause eviction standards, which means tenants, can be evicted for non-payment once this cancel rent program ends, but they can't be evicted simply because the landlord would rather bring in somebody else who can pay higher rent.
Nothing about your own situation, right, yeah and just a reminder for everybody to raise your hand so that barbara and ed can call on you go to the participants menu at the bottom of your screen.
There's the question of at what rents and given the recent you know, departure of a larger number of people from the city.
There might even be a higher vacancy rate right now than the last time the city checked, there's a larger question, also about hotel rooms that whose operators don't believe that tourism is going to return anytime, soon enough to make them economically viable and whether it makes sense to convert those into permanent housing.
That's a question that I'm looking into that a lot of groups are thinking about and if so, how to do it in the safest way for residents and for the communities and what it would take economically to you know: convert hotel rooms into class, a apartments with kitchens and the rest, and also what kind of what kind of regulations are going to be for them for rent regulations.
There are a lot of homeless people and there's a lot of rooms right now that are available, so it makes sense sac soon, on the other hand, is probably a very expensive proposition, and so we're going to need either new revenue streams or, in my opinion, a federal recovery package that would cover something like that, and we may need some supported services to go with those rooms.
Can you either elaborate on that or talk a little bit more about some of the other qualifications and requirements of the hdr program that you think would make it difficult for people who should otherwise qualify or seem to be in need in our particular district in community board aid that might make it challenging for them to end up actually qualifying for these, for these benefits right, so the rule is that it doesn't cover people whose rent is over 125 percent of the federal housing and urban development agencies, fair market rent standards and I'm not an expert in hud, fair market rent standards.
If anyone on this call is or if rita wants to look up the numbers, maybe we could get more specific, but I imagine that might be more of a burden in higher rent parts of the city than in lower rent parts of the city, because I don't think that it's targeted by anything quite as specific as a community district.
So I can't see everybody, but I just dialed that up on google, so sam correct me if you think this is way off, but it looks like what I'm reading is for fiscal year.
I guess I leave it to the experts in cb8 whether you think that's going to be an issue in your community, but it seems worth looking into okay, any you have a follow-up or you're good.
This was terrific and I'm very much looking forward to reading your book, which I've been putting off for too long apologies, if any of the background thunder distracts but I'll try to keep it quick, I'm not sure if, if any of these bills touch on commercial rent, specifically a lot of our beleaguered mom and pop small businesses.
Let us know thanks sure, and thanks for getting my book, the eviction moratorium extension bill does cover commercial as well as residential tenants.
The second point that I would like to raise is the good news which basically is it covers the michelangelo and section 8 program.
The values is, our community approximately have, if I know wrong, 141 000 households from which 49 000 are households that have serious problems such as the 52 percent of the 141 000 they're, paying more than 20 30 of the rental income and 23.
I don't know if that was so much as a question, but if you have any thoughts on any of that, I leave it up to the board to decide whether either the actions that have been taken by the state and city federal governments live up to your needs.
I I've definitely heard concern that very little will be passed in this emergency session because there's so much uncertainty at the federal level, but I think there's also going to be a major push from all those groups that mobilized in the summer of 2019 around the rent, and so I wouldn't write any of them out, and I also we really don't know what the federal timeline is for the next round of stimulus or for extending the expanded unemployment insurance, and so that could happen sooner, in which case some of these bills might become more possible.
The investment of millions of dollars that put the city in the affordable, housing after 30 years is gone, so we're going back to zero in 20 years and while the city paid millions of dollars to the developers just only to the developer, to become millionaires, and I suppose strongly support the developers by the way I would like- and I think they deserve to have some income.
Okay, barbara hello, yeah, you're, muted, still, oh rita, has her hand up.
The scope of the problem is what it will take, and I know that you don't yourself, as the housing committee of a community board, have the legislative power at the state level, but it does matter if you know, especially if you can organize with your colleagues in other community boards, if there can be a program of what you think needs to happen at the state, I think that's an important voice to get out there, whether that means revenue, whether that means extended tenant protections, thinking, commercial thinking, residential, whether it means you know demanding a federal intervention because they have the power of debt spending whatever it is, that you decide is necessary.
I don't, I think, you're also right in terms of you know, you know that marco was saying we need to look out for the obviously the residents of community district.
Eight, that's our job, we're community board aid, but I think a lot of us.
I mean I know that there are it's a dire emergency and something needs to be done right away, but could this become an opportunity to rethink how the city functions and how people should live together and to have a city that works economically for the people who want to be here and the people who work here?
I have a question in all the years in the state, senate and housing has been a very hard topic to get any passage on, because so much of this state, new york city is so different than the rest of the state than buffalo, then rochester, then albany and those people, don't the people in the suburbs.
I think that, as after 2008 there's going to be a significant amount of pressure on the single-family home stock as well in the past, we've sometimes seen those housing issues get a lot more money in terms of stemming foreclosure of single-family homeowners, rather than multi-family homeowners or the evictions of tenants.
We put a lot of meat density, I mean it doesn't have no sense and another point right: there is the quality of housing that they offer to the nycha residents.
I just I'm thinking a person like our fellow community member, which I admire a lot wilma, she's, a wheelchair and she has to take the elevator down and one or one of the elevators doesn't work.
I don't think the board will slowly we're not well there's no board meeting until september, but I really I would like to definitely go back and I've done this before with the budget to talk about a millionaire income tax, how he could pay for some of these things, because I think that's what it's down to is: redistribution of wealth and we're not going to help any affordable housing if we don't start doing that, but right now this bill they're in orbiting they're in session.
That was going to be my comment, which is I'm happy to propose a resolution that we support all the legislation that sam has sort of reviewed and explained to us, but I want to first make sure, there's interest in the committee.
Unfortunately, I know I meant in terms of getting some kind of uniform response from all of the community boards, but in the meantime I think I think a letter is a is a really good start, but the committee needs to and that helps them, because then they can use the letters.
Okay, is that everybody yes billy, and I think we also have to have next meeting you really have to discuss marco.
What's the how we're going to get a real, affordable housing in this community and that's something we have to talk about, and I mean I don't know if the board will do it and we have to certainly you can't do it by letter, but I really want to talk about ray how we raise money, which I seem to think it should be: income tax and capital gains taxes or whatever you want to do it to pay for affordable housing.
I think august 20th, the third thursday okay, but you can get it to the other board chairs before that right, yeah I'll, send it by email.
