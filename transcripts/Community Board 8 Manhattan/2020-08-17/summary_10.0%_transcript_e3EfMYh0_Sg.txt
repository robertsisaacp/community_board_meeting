I hope neither well I'm sure elizabeth will want to discuss the zoom meeting with sarah carroll.
Well, let's hope it's just apparently, okay, it looks like a gigantic set of drawings for just a parapet.
Here I don't know elizabeth is here: okay, oh yes, you're right, oh and russell squire is here, that's interesting!
Do you want to sort of tell people how to vote or that use your little yeah I'll, give my normal spiel so for anyone, that's who it's their first time at one of our virtual board meetings or committee meetings.
So it's a little easier for everybody to see you'll see at the bottom of your screen, a button that says participants and it looks like two little people standing next to each other and has the number 20 next to it.
There was a an issue with the rear wall, rear parapet and we had an approved design approved set of drawings, and there was some disagreement with landmarks when we went to get final sign-offs about the detail of that paradigm.
So that's what we're here to talk about today, so we have to go back to to a public hearing, because it's the staff is not able to approve the as well condition as it's constructed and it's the rear power up, rear, paraben yeah.
At the second floor and a modest rooftop edition set back from 64th street and not visible from the street, the project was filed with the department of buildings, with several structural and architectural amendments to keep pace with the changes in the school of work.
We are here this evening because, although all the required permits were issued and approved all, but the final cne was signed off, the lpc at their final site visit took exception to the rear parapet wall that conformed to our submission.
He wants the rear of his building to remain as it was initially designed and initially approved by lpc.
We called out the height of the fourth floor, the height of the terrace and the height of the railing, showing that intent of the proper wall going to the top and meeting with the railing, because we cannot have a floating railing in the rear facade.
In section you see more of the structure, so you can see how the water was meant to run underneath the addition and run out the back to maintain the existing drainage system in the back for that section of the roof, and these enhanced edition, enlarged elevations you can see on the bottom- is the rear elevation that we're talking about, and you can see the height of the terrace, the height of the railing.
The gutter moved up, so we never intended to put back any corvolene because it would just be alien to the structure floating in the middle of the rear wall, because assuming it would need to line up with the adjacent and will not support the gutter anymore.
In order to support the fourth floor above and the deck and the roof deck, a steel beam had to be installed and, in addition to tie in the existing roof and the drainage and the whole entire new waterproofing membrane had to be wrapped around the inside and installed within the structure and the reappraisal wall.
They want us to do analysis of the real facades just to show them how amazing the side of the roof will not be chewed or unheard of in this location, and, as you can see what we did, we mapped out the rear elevation of every building on this block and none of the rear character walls line up at all, including you can see.
I think a lot of these buildings are compromised in some of the structures of the top walls where all the roofs have been mended and so on.
You know a few times and never kind of mentioned this before, but in talking about putting back a cordling in a situation like this in a property that has no rear access, so you have to go through the house in order to get to the backyard and we're talking about erecting scaffolds, sidewalk bridges covering the neighbors and our own properties, just to put a coiling back that, like gustavo just said, is not exactly the same as any other one.
So I just want to add that we discovered that the whole rear wall and the parapet have been compromised and it had to be taken down to the level of the existing roof and we were to be rebuilt and also well the roof structure in the.
If you see here, the roof structure has to be reinforced and we basically built another structure on top of that for the little rear terrace and to allow like paige was saying to allow for drainage to go.
So we put a steel beam and to support the new railing and the new terrace and in order to take down the parapet to the original level or even to try to build it the core but have to deal with it with a steel beam, it's more complicated than it meets the eye.
Well, I don't think we want to get too technical right as a landmarks committee.
The fourth one was never fully approved, but she went ahead, got dob approval on all the work did all the work and landmarks came back at the end on the basis that the took the fourth certificate of no effect, which applies to this condition, was never fully approved and therefore they have the right to clarify it was.
That they had misunderstood what you were intending that's right and therefore they wanted you to do a major reworking of what they had actually approved that yes and therefore you now have to get a certificate of appropriateness for what's built.
Okay, it was all built, but landmarks decided that they had misunderstood your drawings and therefore they want you to redo it right with corbin correct okay, so I think I don't know if there's anybody from the public there who wants to talk?
The work was submitted, it was approved and it was constructed exactly the way we showed it through christians, structural drawings and our our architectural set.
The actual, odd type of thing that you're discussing tonight is to, as it says, the application is to keep existing condition of the built parapet while in place without modification, so I've never I've never been in this position before and I believe we've now satisfied all of the preservation requirements and that, frankly, of the owner end of story for me thanks.
Yes, okay, so again I'll ask if there's anybody in the public who would like to comment?
Hopefully elizabeth you're unmuted, oh okay, do you have a drawing of what was originally approved and what they now want you to do side by side so that I can compare it.
I have a great deal of sympathy for the applicant in this situation, but I think, in order to do what we're supposed to do, I would like to see what the actual issue is.
I can't really point to one that's perfect: while I'm driving towards paige is, if I go to the left hand, side- and I go to the second picture on the top on the right, where you have gutters with cordling under it, one is white was red.
So so I'm just trying to find a way a middle ground and there's a lot of stuff that I've seen put up that you know on the fourth floor or something or other looks fine.
Can we make it look the way landmarks might want it to look with a lesser material that would in effect, be an application and not an integral use of the material, and I think that's really that that's really the decision do we want something which is visually one thing or something which is an integrated design, yeah.
So let me just understand something that I'm just unfamiliar with this, and I want to understand something the gutters are running there, because of course you need the drainage and in order to put in the cordless, reconstructed or, however, it has to go under the gutter, and so it will look like it's floating nowhere.
Okay, I understand that so basically, there was no way to make the gutter on top of the addition adequate for drainage down the side and bypassing a gutter on the original construction.
Next, please next, is our board chair, lita all right first, I just want to say that I know paige and have tremendous respect for her work so high paige.
This is the rear, facade the landmarks approved it as built and is now coming back for what could be described as the second bite of the apple, and it seems to me that there that gluing, a plastic facade, putting a plastic core ball to the to the existing masonry wall is just silly and that's all I have to say after anthony is marco.
Yes, okay, my first impression is, and the last permit is the issue that you cannot sign off and you say: don't look at that.
The gutter you can address in the I would like to discuss if you wanted construction, but this is not the issue right here.
So the point is that for that part, probably that trigger the issue that they, that landmark, doesn't want to approve you, the rooftop edition, so going back to the to the parapet that you want one us to discuss- and I think I consider is wrong because we have to see as they met they.
I'm still confused that landmarks in theory approved and then, as anthony said, took a second bite of the apple and then decided it wasn't correct, but I would hate to set a precedent where owners felt that they could go ahead with construction when every duck wasn't lined up.
That's a ridiculous idea in all deference to my colleagues that president is there already many times and I think the name of the game is we look at this from point of view of appropriateness, it's the appropriateness with the respect to each individual situation, and sometimes you want to maintain the cornice line, and sometimes you don't.
So I think we should go with that judgment call on landmarks bar, except the fact that the building is higher, except the fact that there are many precedents for doing that, and then it comes down to accept a simple, integrated design, that's appropriate in terms of front and rear, or do we want to?
But I think the fact that the applicant basically relied on you know in good faith on the original commission finding in doing what they did.
I do think the fact that it's in the back means that you know that sort of ways in favor of approval.
For me also as anthony noted- and I do it sounded like there was a point made during the presentation that the the rear of the structure wasn't part of the landmarks designation.
This is not the right to say that but yeah, but I'm going to vote no, but I think we have to start discussing about parliament procedure because, according with parliament procedure, the chairs are completely impartials in this process and it has to allow the applicant to speak whatever they want and as we supposed to debate and whatever direction we want, and obviously the chair has the opportunity to say whatever he wants to, but this is a parliament procedure a leader.
Yes, thank you all right on to the second one.
Okay, thank you can proceed all right good evening.
We have an open application with landmarks for minor work or a minor amendment to be bulkhead materials and rear facade, but they wanted to have us present the entry door replacement as they deemed it, couldn't be reviewed at a staff level.
If not we'll go to the committee and follow david's point that will start at the end of the alphabet instead of at the beginning of the alphabet for the committee members and just to confirm, you want to go committee members, public members, other board, members right jane, that's correct!
That could be an issue, probably in this case, but you know what, if we apply what we did in last application you shouldn't be here because, while doing construction, you modify these the scope of work and therefore the landmark should follow the same procedure with you.
That is the one we discussed before and I think you are doing the right thing by the way, and I appreciate that you come in and yes, you improve the when you remove the slot for the mail.
I think this is much better and I like that, and I don't want to continue, but I'm going to say thank you so much and I will support this application.
Is that correct, right, we're replacing these with brand new doors brand new and it'll be exactly this design, it's exactly what we're looking at, with the exception of the glass which will be semi-transparent, correct, okay, yeah!
I don't particularly like the lever, but on balance, I think you did a fine job, so I can certainly support the application elizabeth.
You guys can hear me right, yes, yeah, so I actually, I really like the design of the doors and I think they'll look great and greg.
I just felt the presentation by the applicant could have been clear and I don't think it should have been left to elizabeth to sort of clarify the language on what we were exactly voting on.
So if anyone has any particular topics, they would like to raise to just email all of us, elizabeth, jane david and me, and I think if, if this is an appropriate time to say so, I think that we should just have a conference call beforehand a day or a couple days before just to cover what we want to talk about.
If that's all right- and I believe, I'm speaking for will- I know I'm speaking for myself- that we'll just be in the background and leave the bulk of the discussion to jane david and elizabeth in more than competent heads.
Oh my gosh, I don't know okay, yes, thank you, elizabeth just so it's out there six o'clock.
