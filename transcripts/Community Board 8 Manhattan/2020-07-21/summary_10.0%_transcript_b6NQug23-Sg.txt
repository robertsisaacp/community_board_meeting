Do you think so just to and then, if somebody gets a phone call, we can mute them just because there's not many people and we can get a different type of interchange, yeah I'll switch it up rebecca.
Yes, hi ellen, sorry, all right so in when anybody wants to know we have another minute to go, is wilma on.
Oh billy, you're, here, oh great, all right then I know his time is limited, so I want to make sure he gets the chance to speak early.
One is there should be an overall committee anthony, I know you're going to be co-chair of it, so you could explain it if you would like a little bit more, but I think if that is more of a general discussion and then the committee meetings would be a much more specific thing.
I think that there's a kind of let's say overarching quality to the to the to I'll call it my committee, I apologize yeah, but I think each of the other committees have their own responsibilities to pay attention to all these issues, and obviously health, seniors and social services is a real, is a real logical place and criminal justice and criminal justice.
I did speak to people and write to people and people contacted us and sent information, so I think we'll start with the last part of it, which is criminal justice, because I know that's what billy is interested in well.
You know, I think, a lot of people here defund.
I think a lot of people, don't even you know, start from that point.
We could have a whole event on the new york city, police department budget and I don't have a problem with doing those things, but what my email says- and I think this is the larger point that I want to underscore it's.
So I'd like to see us do that, and I think, given that we have the word health in our committee and that we have a public safety component.
Yeah I mean what we hear now is that health equity is public safety, equity and we know that everything is connected.
Also- and I don't know I don't- I don't have an answer for it: do you billy or anybody else, that's why I wanted to mute people if anybody wants to come in and say something about it: nope, okay, really, yes anthony!
I know people through my son who work who worked at rikers on issues with worked at rikers on with rather sort of the most at-risk mentally at-risk prisoners, probably the wrong word but prisoners, and I think that getting a sort of perspective on what that what the criminal justice system means to the accused is, I think, very important, and I think that that's part of what we ought to be looking at.
That's, I think, of a committee with overarching ideas within the particular parts and I'm afraid when we get into the other areas besides criminal justice, that we can, I mean, maybe we'll create 15 months in a year rather than just 12, because right, but maybe we would think of combining two things.
I agree and I think the only downside to taking it in small bites is you know it's just more meetings and if we're only planning to do it through this committee and have one meeting a month, it's going to take a long time to get to whatever the end goal is.
If we want to treat it almost like the contact tracing series, where we have several events in more rapid fashion, then I think it makes more sense, but I'm open to dragging it out a little bit longer and I think small bites is probably the way to go, and I do agree barbara that you could combine some of these issues.
Why don't we figure out like the logistics after rebecca and your faces yeah I was just going to say I thought the contact tracing series went really well, especially because you know each meeting was focused kind of on a different issue and then the one where we wanted resolution we made sure to keep it very focused on what we wanted to address.
I think we could actually get a lot done and maybe work with the other committee too, which I see has an overlap and maybe see what role they have and I almost see like one could be a feeder to the other.
Yes, I think there's a kind of- and I don't know I mean I haven't thought about this very much.
I admit yet these fascinating people that go to bed thinking about things like this yeah.
I haven't spoken at all yet really we're gonna have to schedule a meeting, but I think that they, the you're right, there's a kind of role for the overarching committee, and maybe the issues that were sort of sort of we've immediately zoomed in on which have to do with criminal justice, essentially might not be the most important for this particular committee that this particular committee might be able to focus more or should focus more can focus more.
I don't know what the right word is on something like health equity, that the problems that rich people have better access to healthcare, and so how do we?
Absolutely get health care in the same way that the housing committee has to really dedicate themselves to thinking about housing, equity well, and but this is all part of it and we started with this because of billy's time.
I think pretty much what we discussed before the question that we're talking about all these issues about bail reform and all that, whether it should be an overarching committee or a small committee- and things like you know- and I think that it should be a smaller committee, because if you put bell reform- and you put issues like criminal justice and other things together under that that those issues it's too much, it's got to be broken down smaller and smaller, a smaller part, because this is such a wide range of problems right that can be worked on right.
So we have something to work with that's right, so I think that the three main areas, and not that little things don't come off.
I think you put it very well billy, the other public safety, things that are not necessarily police and what else can be done, and I does anybody not agree with me.
I agree barbara and I'm getting a little nervous here, because, knowing that we may be playing for 12 months here, but we have 24 months worth of issues, and so I think we need to be realistic and I think perhaps the idea of having like a big forum where we could get a lot of people to talk about criminal, the criminal justice system.
I know you want to come up with that with a resolution on this, but it may be that we need to plan for a big event to bring in a lot of people all right.
Tell me if you disagree, but it doesn't mean that members of the committee can't that we can't have two meetings one month where other people sort of take it over and do things with it.
I mean I agree, but I also found just based on working on the contact tracing series that having working groups that aren't as committee dependent if you're very focused and interested in one issue, could be a good use.
You know issues, okay, all right!
If I tell what she had to say she spoke to me, I don't remember if it was yesterday- or I don't remember one day from the other to say that, will we be willing to do something on preparedness- and I said yes, but I think september is going to be a little too late and she's tr she's trying to convince us to do something in august on.
I feel that, while we're waiting in september as they expected a peak to happen around then- and also there are a lot of people that are all around or even if they're, at a different part of new york, upstate or whatever, we we're doing this this virtual meeting and they will be able to be in on the meeting of whatever we are prepared to talk about.
If it does spike, we don't really know, but I think it really helps to talk and plan and that's the problem is that nobody really plans and you we have an idea what's going on now and I was rapping all over the world, so we have an idea of I mean.
Barbara could I say that it seems like if you're going to do a preparedness session that you'd want to have speakers, and would they be ready to speak in august or would some other time be more appropriate?
But as far as september is concerned, I think that the primary overarching issue is going to be what's happening with the schools, because that is an incredible incredibly large and impactful decision, because you know parents have to deal with.
You know when they come home, the teachers are going to be freaking out because they're not sure if they're, okay and then, if they're not going to do it in school, then there's the issue of home care.
Yes, it's easier to corral people into a zoom than it would be to ask them to arrive in person, but I think maybe a subcommittee could begin to take make the preparations and I'd be happy to be on the subcommittee, and I mean meryl is our new second public member with ellen palovey.
I actually think that merrill is right that you know the committee can do preparations in august and then have speakers lined up for september.
My personal thing and peggy was saying that she doesn't think august is a good time that if we get a peek, it won't be till september.
What is your feeling about timing and I think for some issues I there are a number of community boards that are actually meeting in august, even though they generally don't because of things starting up again and issues that are really crucial.
I don't want to pretend one thing that was done before I think we know we don't have any minds about that.
I think it depending on what you want to do if it has to do with covid, then I think I think, on august meeting would be worthwhile people, even if they go on vacation if they're interested they're not going very far or they're, not getting planes and going to europe or asia mostly so, and people are around and there's a lot of interest in what's going on, so I don't know if there's something that you that you think is important and relates to the virus sooner rather than later, and the virus does relate to to racial injustice, because we know it was the black and brown communities right that were worse and it could possibly be grouped with other things along the way I know, maybe that but august is not right.
This is the first thing of health by the way just to get through with seniors, I mean, I think, that one meeting really should be on a model of nursing homes, and specifically, I guess, if we're doing racial justice with the public hospitals, what went wrong?
I don't know what just what people think of that issue.
I guess what he's saying so you know what rebecca do you want to read what sarah chu wrote yeah sure?
Let me ask you this: do we think that elita will have any change of heart in the on the issue of dealing with health care?
For all I mean I know, she's been really resistant to it, but I I'm just wondering if, like I'm right here, worried yeah I've actually been on the phone.
I've encouraged the two committees to work together because you're looking at it from different points of view, and so that's if you want to work together, that's fine, but it's not a question of either everyone paying or everyone going, or only about people going on to medicaid.
I think we all know somebody who lost their job and what's happening to their health insurance.
We have to make sure that we're looking at some of the other issues involved right, and I think we can get people to do that.
You know people of the committee looking into nursing homes.
They are yes, because now I understand what you're saying, because yeah that's yeah can I just say together trying to emerge people together, medicaid and medicare, so that and then those advantage plans don't have network that you, the people need right so well would that fit in, because I would like to focus on the fact that this is a a committee for racial injustice that we're talking about today.
For me that sounds good, because I know that I can find people to talk to the idea of racial injustice in the medicaid system.
I definitely recommend that you do that, but I was just talking about people who will because I did switch to the advantage plan and I finally like many of the new york doctors, don't want to take it, which is you know, I understand, because they're not going to get not going to make money, but this conversation, this conversation underscores the issue here that there's a big problem about lack of information and it's getting to be quite urgent under the circumstances.
This idea of just what sarah chu said, the idea of committee about our health care and how it has to change and the what's the problem with employment based and certainly medicaid, would come into it, because people that are not employed are going to go on medicaid, and I think that there's a relation, I don't think we need a separate committee for.
I mean there are lots of states where you go like we're lucky that we live in new york right, because new york is a big, you know they have a good insurance department and they have, they are very.
I mean people need to know how to go on obamacare how to get you know, other kinds of insurance, absolutely that's the whole point yeah and if it comes up it could be more of a sideline and then later on to specialize.
Are you talking about it, because elita asked us to focus on issues, I think privilege and healthcare and equity, because we're a little unmuted, and I want to keep doing this.
I think that each one and I'll go over the ed and I'm not saying medicaid couldn't be part of a discussion, but I personally feel that what sarah wrote was just such an important thing and that would be sort of a big meeting forum.
They have money problems, I think they will be essential and then I can't remember which person I'm listening to but they're talking about more community health centers.
That's what you're talking about right cause yeah, okay, those emergency care centers, are actually promoted by the advantage plans and they recommend that you go to them.
You know that that's where they make their money and since the copic thing, not only are they not doing those, but people are afraid to go to a hospital now because they don't want to be exposed.
Well, you know, I think the main point of this meeting was to just kind of brainstorm, especially about issues related to racial equity and because I know we had talked about in the fall doing something on seniors and mental health during the time of quarantine.
Absolutely I don't know, I don't understand law, so I just wanted to make sure and it's all public okay.
It's like a 50-hour week of working on that not anymore so much barbara, because they're really much shorter, they're an hour, maybe an hour and a half around you don't have to look around because even if you know people can zoom in, they don't have to travel right and you're, not looking for space and you're not, but most of us are not going on vacation.
Thank you, I'm not sure if it's the front hair or the back hair that I use well, you know I'm not sure how long I'm going to keep it, but I'm seeing people in various ways all right.
You know I want to do the criminal justice part of it or that type of thing.
