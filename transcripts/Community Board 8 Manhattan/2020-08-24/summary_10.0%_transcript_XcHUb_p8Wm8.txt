So, if you're watching, if you have an idea for a slot, let us know you may have read today's new york, post and editorial in support of, if we're doing all remote learning for 400 000 students that we could actually integrate those classrooms and get gnt to any student who wanted it and another key piece that we've been hearing from.
I've asked dr long from h to speak first and do a presentation What I want to do is talk to you about our current state of what we're doing in new york city now to suppress the coronavirus and then talk a little bit about in preparation, for if there is a surge, what things will look like then, and everything we're doing to keep you safe and protected during that time as well, so, starting with the beginning, new yorkers is something to be proud of.
when we were starting this program which wasn't too far before I came and talked to you all last time we didn't even have a phone number for 15 percent of people that were the new cases of coronavirus in new york city.
You know a case of pneumonia to who and how we quickly ramped up in march with the first case in new york city, then that second case, which was our first case at new york presbyterian and by mid march, and certainly mid-april we were in you- know a true pandemic here in new york city- The picture in the left is a place where we hopefully do not want to be that's not a picture from covid time, but that's a picture before of what new york city, hospi, emergency departments used to look like right, and certainly at capacity not wearing masks.
I think I've taken you know enough time talking, but just takeaways here from the hospital perspective, we're certainly actively planning for the second wave.
Do, wear your mask and if we do open up restaurants and go into public buildings and to observe the rule and so on, and I'm wondering if even more pr as time goes on, because it worries me that the more normal we seem the more relaxed So oh barbara, I just wanna first off start off with the answer to your second to last and last question is so important and it is it's.
Setting one thing I will say in terms of this related to the issue of oxygen, as you were saying, we've become the first major city as far as I know in the country to every single new case of coronavirus.
and I think those are the things we should be focused on, and you know we can't frankly control the virulence of a second wave and dr long was saying that the the landscape will look very different if there is another surge because of the knowledge and the preparation and the public awareness and behavior.
