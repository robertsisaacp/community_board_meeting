I think the key thing is since the beginning, working with these experts and others to get testing for everyone trying to get beyond the painful swab testing, but to even saliva testing and rapid testing, so you're not even having to wait 10 days, but actually waiting a couple of minutes instead of hours, and so I think the thing I am hoping for and if we can't get a vaccine anytime we are not going to administer vaccines to people without a phase one or a phase.
We'd love you to be our building captain and if you have a building with building service workers, we'd love for you to have we'd love to give you masks and hand sanitizer that you can have your building service workers distribute to any resident who wants them I've asked dr long from h to speak first and do a presentation What I want to do is talk to you about our current state of what we're doing in new york city now to suppress the coronavirus and then talk a little bit about in preparation, for if there is a surge, what things will look like then, and everything we're doing to keep you safe and protected during that time as well, so, starting with the beginning, new yorkers is something to be proud of.
when we were starting this program which wasn't too far before I came and talked to you all last time we didn't even have a phone number for 15 percent of people that were the new cases of coronavirus in new york city.
The other thing that people then ask is well if you're completing your intake and finding contacts of which we found 30 000 contacts in new york city- But how do you know that people are actually isolating at home if you're diagnosed with the coronavirus?
The new yorkers truly are taking they're, putting the effort forth to protect other new yorkers 95 of the time people are telling us they're staying home between when we last called them The third part of our program is: do everything in our power That's the way, I think I've diagnosed many of my patients with the coronavirus and every time I ask them.
We call take care right now, more than seven 000 times we pair people up with resource navigators to give them what they need in order to stay at home, but that's how we're enabling 95 of new yorkers to be successful, staying at home and to keep staying at home everything I've told you is current state the result of all that current state, along with everything else that everybody on this call is doing wearing a mask outside proper hand.
You know a case of pneumonia to who and how we quickly ramped up in march with the first case in new york city, then that second case, which was our first case at new york presbyterian and by mid march, and certainly mid-april we were in you- know a true pandemic here in new york city- The picture in the left is a place where we hopefully do not want to be that's not a picture from Covid-19 time, but that's a picture before of what new york city, hospi, emergency departments used to look like right, and certainly at capacity not wearing masks.
10 out of 10 doctors are going to say come even if you call them, even if you call your doctor family member on the phone they're going to say, go to the emergency department, if you're having chest pain, shortness of breath, the signs of a stroke, you probably know perhaps slurred speech focal, numbness or you know, focal weakness on one arm or one leg on one side of the face, or the other like we said, really bad abdominal pain or vomiting, and certainly examples of a bad injury would be any sort of major head injury, a large laceration that needs to be repaired or is bleeding.
So the second question that people has not just when should I come, but what are you guys doing to keep me safe right and just a few pictures here, and this is pictures of our of our wild cornell emergency department there on the left, you can see all of our doctors, our nurses pped up right.
I think I've taken you know enough time talking, but just takeaways here from the hospital perspective, we're certainly actively planning for the second wave.
I guarantee you that and then certain low acuity health issues, like we kind of, went through, consider using video, consider using telemedicine and with that you know thanks for your time guys I see we have hands raised from the chairs of the hss committee and then we'll go to the public.
Do, wear your mask and if we do open up restaurants and go into public buildings and to observe the rule and so on, and I'm wondering if even more pr as time goes on, because it worries me that the more normal we seem the more relaxed I see it in restaurants, people don't wear masks in restaurants, and So oh barbara, I just wanna first off start off with the answer to your second to last and last question is so important and it is it's.
It was an interesting article, I read sure Setting one thing I will say in terms of this related to the issue of oxygen, as you were saying, we've become the first major city as far as I know in the country to every single new case of coronavirus.
So that's something that we've built out to help people to be at home safely, but that's a component of a larger piece of home care Talking about you know, and we may not have seen things like on the right, which is the oxygen concentrator.
In you know, march april may, in new york city we certainly were at the borderline of the of bed capacities in new york city, hospitals, However, we do have the experience unfortunate as it was that patients who we would have a hundred out of a hundred times admitted in march and april and the start of may who had low oxygen if it was kind of low.
Originally, we wanted to make sure, of course, that we had enough beds for the people who had oxygen levels that were 40 or 70 right, but what we quickly realized is when we followed those patients up, at least in our system.
Most of those people who went home with oxygen concentrators didn't actually need to come back to the hospital they actually did.
So, if you're going to visit family members that are potentially people that would be susceptible or higher risk, if they did contract the coronavirus couple, things number one get tested before you see them, you can come to one of our sites get tested.
I think one of the things that we want to encourage people to do more of is, if you are going to visit your family again, come in for a test ahead of time, we're happy to do it.
we need to get our testing turnaround times lower than we currently have them at new york, city, health and hospitals.
If you're going to look at one to focus on, for example, the world health organization sets a threshold to be considered at five percent for things like reopening schools, we have a more conservative, a percent positive across new york city that we have implemented in order to consider reopening our schools.
The percent of people that are being tested that come back positive is significantly higher right How much risk is there being in a closed space such as a subway with people who are not wearing masks if you're wearing your mask and a lot of people are wearing theirs, but not everybody also That said, though, and you have to remember what I'm about to say, is the most important thing- everybody should wear a mask that that's the key take home here, if you're in any scenario where you're wearing one or somebody's, not or vice versa.
I just I asked that because I work for a health insurer and we're actually, you know debating whether we're going to send you know an at-home test, all our policyholders, our medical policyholders, so I just want to see where we were as a city as far as you know, doing more at-home tests We support you know even moderately okay testing I know at you know a hospital level we're certainly trying to ramp up the amount of rapid testing and, again that's still, the nasal swabs there's been talk of doing buckle or mucosal kind of tests from the inside of your cheek, but in terms of at home stuff.
So it's not a concurrent situation and to be very careful and to practice the social distancing that I think was talked about in wearing masks anyway, because otherwise we're taking the virus into people that are more vulnerable.
and you know, people learn in different ways right, so there are zoom community kind of meetings amongst the hospital folks and among the medical college.
You know you can say why not at n95 I think if you have, you know the ability to always have n95s on well, certainly that's the best right for that individual person, but right now what we've decided as an organization as surgical masks on at all times, you don't need to wear gloves when you're going in between doing normal work.
