Okay, great so before we get started well, do we want to do a little check on this members present?
I see russell squires signing in right now so, okay, great yeah, so I'm going to lower your hand for now raise it again.
Can everyone hear me good welcome everybody to the street life committee of community board 8.?
The next full board meeting is september 16th, so all of those will go to that meeting unless there's any time sensitive applications that need to be sent out before then, in which case those will go as committee resolutions and with that there's no questions for comments.
I think I know the answer, but okay sure yeah, so we were recently purchased by rfi brands and so part of that transition has been switching over all of our permits and licenses over to the new owner, okay, understood and so there's no other change other than just to reflect the change in ownership.
Okay, so with that, I will inquire if there's any members of the public that have any questions or comments on I'm going to invite questions on items a b, c d or e, since they are all identical, if you could use the participants menu, I don't want to see people raising their hands like this and miss you.
Okay, terrific, so my name is scott greenspun, I'm an attorney with the firm of braverman greenspun and our firm represents the board of managers of the terrain condominium, and my comments are, I believe, with item number d: that's on lexington avenue and 65th street location, philippines.
Certainly the the purchase price would have reflected that and on the other hand, all of the residential unit owners purchased in the building, with the clear understanding that there would be no sale of alcoholic beverages in the retail unit.
The owner and the the applicant were well aware of that restriction for the yet additional reason that several years ago, they came to the board of managers requesting a change that would permit them to sell alcoholic beverages from the retail unit.
That request is denied, and, quite frankly, we were a little surprised and taken aback that this application would have been made to the community board when the tenant and the owner of the retail unit know full well that, whether as a as a community, it would be permissible in this particular premises.
If I may interrupt, there are a couple people from the public who want to speak on these, who don't know how to raise their hand, so I just want to really quickly tell everybody how to raise their hand.
Okay, let's continue with john and alex so john first and alex to close out any public just a time as to how long has the existing or the pre-existing restaurant been there, and for how long has it been in possession of a license to serve alcohol?
I think alex was next alex you may hi, so I live in the neighborhood near the 1133 madison location and I just wanted to speak up in favor of their application.
So peg quotation previously had organic wines on offer at the restaurant location, on madison between 84 and 85, and I think her neighborhood would like to see that again and would benefit from that opportunity.
Okay, seeing no other public hands, but if you do well, let me know otherwise.
I think russell was the first hand I saw then marco then laureen russell thanks.
I I would move to approve the you know the ones in section one other than 1d and with regard to 1d I mean my view is that I think we should respect the you know the commercial unit agreement that they have, and I you know, I'm very sympathetic to the circumstances of covid, and I know that you know we're.
Obviously, there been a lot of changes to the rules lately and things like that, and I'm generally in favor of trying to be flexible in order to keep people in business through covid and help people out, but I think in this instance it's it really wouldn't be fair to the people in that building, who, I think, have a reasonable expectation that you know the contractual provisions that they put in place would be honored, and so I think I I would say we should disapprove the 1d and approve the others.
No, no even asking is cedar one and bigger, and I think it's reasonable what they ask they and and more likely, if you, if you check the time of the operation, it looks like it's going to be very early they're, going to close so whatever problems that they have between the tenant and the building is between them.
We have john who spoke earlier in the public and then barry elita russell and cause okay.
That was not my first thought, but since the suggestion was made that we approve of all five applications, le pen cuisine has been a well regarded establishment throughout the district, and I would love to see them continue in business with the like of licenses that they're entitled to have and that they perhaps they can negotiate with the landlord or the the board of managers to amend their rules regarding legalizing.
I I would have to respectfully disagree with marco and barry and lorraine on this, because by allow by providing our support for liquor, license we're no we're not being neutral in the discussion between the building and the proposed and the tenant, we're taking a position and putting a lot of pressure on the building, which I don't think is what we should be doing since we're representing the community and that building is part of our community.
I even call it the belgian place because there's one around the corner from where I live, and I think they make fantastic bread so, and I hope you continue the recipes, but I can't support the liquor license and I think it's wrong for us to intervene in what should be a contract to speak between the building and the tenant.
I think if we approve stipulation to the sla that there is a legal binding agreement between the landlord and the establishment and let them have it out.
Okay, thanks guys russell and then judy so yeah.
I think we routinely sort of look beyond just the narrow requirements of what the zoning is or whether they fit with those I mean, obviously, when we're sort of dealing with stipulations regarding how late a place can stay, open or music or things like that.
I mean, I think, that's stuff, that's sort of getting beyond just strictly zoning requirements, and and that kind of thing- and you know there are times when we even vote to disapprove an application that may comply with the zoning regulation.
So I think we routinely sort of look beyond just what the zoning says or what have you to you know and kind of take the whole picture into account and what we're doing and then the second point I would make is you know I certainly am sympathetic to the idea that we don't want to wade into some kind of a complicated legal issue and that that's sort of beyond the scope of what we do on this committee, and I agree with that and I think that's right.
It's basically just assessing the facts as they are presented to us in an undisputed fashion and making a decision on that which I do think we're capable of doing great thanks russell just quickly.
So therefore, I I never see these displays by the way, but as long as it fits in that condition, I think this is reasonable to approve this application.
I just want to clarify cause, and mrs brown and elita are you guys raising your hand to vote against items, one a b, c and e, no great okay, so calling that good, I think, yep.
So now we're gonna speak to one d more, so we have hands for one d so cause mrs brown elita and then mr greenspun yeah.
I would like to make a motion that we approve the application, with the stipulation that there is a binding agreement between the establishment and the tenant and that the sla strictly look at it.
We would hope, sincerely hope that the that the board would respect the the wishes of the unit owners who bought in this building with the clear, concise and undisputed understanding that what the what the applicant wants to do cannot be done in the building, and I think, with all due respect to the applicant.
Until they knew whether there was an opportunity for for the the board to make a decision, whether they wanted to even attempt to change the documents, but if they want to go ahead and make some type of presentation directly to the board, then the board can consider it and the board can make it to termination, and you can come back in a month and advise the board the community board how the condo board decided to proceed well on a legal basis.
Okay, thanks all right!
So so you wanted to go to mrs brown next yeah, mrs brown, just to see what everyone has to say and then I just have one question for attorney greenspun does he know the reason why the condo board has prohibited alcohol in the restaurant?
I I think that the the unit owners who purchased units and for most people their most significant investment, was to live in a building that was not going to have any food cooked or alcohol alcohol served that there was going to be very restrictive types of retail use, and I think that there are two different issues: there's what the community might want and appreciate, but then there's also the issue of what the people who reside in that building and it's their homes and their investments.
It goes from you know, just from cider to wine to beer, to six seven to eight to nine to ten, and I think that everybody knew the le pen catinia knew the unit owners knew what could be done in these premises.
If the board goes ahead and ultimately says you can have a liquor license, it goes ahead and puts the unit owners on the defensive to a certain extent, notwithstanding that the applicant understands that they have no right to serve alcohol from that premises.
I don't really understand why the applicant would come if there's a contract that prohibits it from serving alcohol and say I'd like a license.
I am a lawyer, as you know, I don't practice, but I I just don't think it is right to say a contract is irrelevant and the applicant could come knowing it signed an agreement knowing it bought the prop the the the license or the name or the restaurant.
The managers don't know from one thing, one time to the next what's going on and we as a building, take on the responsibility of cleaning up lexington avenue, picking up trash and taking care of that area.
I tried to raise my hand but refuse bottles and mess on top of the situation for the last five years has been very, very difficult to manage and we've been kind and supportive, so it is with that both legal basis, but also understanding that is not meant to be difficult.
It's just it's a small avid revenue avenue for us, and it's just one that we just wanted to add on to to help us navigate through these difficult times, thanks, mario okay, with that we're close discussion on 1d as we're moving it over to september.
I have jacques and cynthia as the possible speakers, but I don't see either name appearing for anybody who doesn't know how to raise your hand, you go to the participant menu at the bottom of your screen or use the star nine.
You hear me yes, okay, you're, for 85 wine corporation.
The last thing I want to do is open up another restaurant because I know what it means serving alcohol dealing with the community, keeping everybody happy from your staff to staying within the code with labor law, everything to the sla law, the community, and so I'm fortunate that sometimes and most of the time that the restaurant owners they do most of the work and with the last or the least say to say, but for the last 24 years we are very happy and proud to serve the community and, like I just said, the last thing I want to do is open up another restaurant and the only reason why I'm doing this is because I'm helping out is because it's just next door to the restaurant.
You know we will have a little bit of a counter outside serving the the grab and go for good sandwiches, and you know for people that want to maybe take food at home, and you know you know that's with a bar full like a license and that's the great yeah.
I am so happy to hear this because I was worried that, after the fire of the restaurant, the diner that was there before and there's an empty store next to it, that it was going to be a raised building and we would have another monstrosity there and the idea that it would be, but I assume I I'm sure will be a well-run addition to the community.
So we only can go a step at a time if there is a need for it and if you do it, if we do put a sidewalk cafe on I, I don't know, I'm not even thinking that far all right.
We have an enclosed, cafe, we're happy with it right now, but I don't know what six months from now a year from now.
Oh second, okay, so the issue right here is next and that is correlated with the other application.
Marco okay, barry call the question on the application to approve great and if you, it was anyone's opposed to calling the question raise your hand.
Okay, now we're gonna go for our votes, so if you're voting, no abstaining or not voting for cause on this motion to approve, let us know otherwise that will go as a unanimous approval.
I hope, sir, that you are recuperative fine and I think I'm very happy to see you right here and doing business in our community.
I don't think it's likely that they're here, okay, well I'll, wait to the end, but again, given the time we're in while just likely to lay it over unless there's any strenuous objections.
I would like to propose a motion and if somebody want a second thank you, I'm assuming the motion was to approve.
Don't include me because I just came back just at the very end, and I want to give me a blanket approval, because I support businesses, which there no is no issue, but I really didn't hear enough.
Okay, great marco, thank you so much.
Thank you and I I think it's better to call somebody else, but if you want to give me a chance at the end, you might have a chance.
Thank you, okay, so all in favor anyone opposed to calling the question seeing none then we'll go forward as a approval.
Let me check the chat, real, quick, nothing, new, no okay, and if there's no other business then do I have any motion to adjourn.
So I don't think that it's, it's appropriate to be commandeering these public spaces, that not every restaurant has access to and to hand them over for commercial uses, and I've raised this issue with 3-1-1.
