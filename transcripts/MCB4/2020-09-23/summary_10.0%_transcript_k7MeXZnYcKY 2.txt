We've also asked that committees have the opportunity to identify two to three other things that you know are like revealed by Covid-19.
Just because you we should we'll get it to exactly allow ourselves to meet in late October to hopefully before exec to you know, you know, come up with the final product to then deliver or to summarize to exec and then prepare for full board sure, of course, but So with that I mean if there are any questions or any comments about what people are seeing at committee.
You know a decade of not longer's worth of work and advocacy, and that we want to continue this format, but that we really do want to see about calling out a small handful of things that we think you know either can impact the most number of people or have the greatest likelihood of getting done, or we just see as the absolute most critical and that we want to call those out in some form of a letter recognizing that.
We all know that the most pressing issue right now is homelessness in all of its forms, whether it's street homelessness or shelter, homelessness , We've had a long history of advocating for many things over the years that could have helped to reduce some of the reasons why people are actually homeless.
But I do think that we have a very clear understanding of what the needs are around homelessness and issues that create the situation where people lose their housing, and I think that we need to be very loud and very strong and really advocate, not only for the things that we have on the list, but update it to what we're seeing right now and how it's impacting the district, leslie and then allen.
So I think, just for to do's, as we always normally do, is we sort of should make sure we divvy up the statement of district needs portion of the document, which is not the budget request, but is the you know the summary of each of the ideas and issues and like last year and the years prior we just you know people take on the reviewing of that doc.
One was the survey, so we can easily send out a survey to the public, and so we can get that input that we would normally try to get at our regular full board meetings which we can attempt to do as well, You know we'll do our office We'll send it around as a draft where people can make whatever changes they want, and then the last thing is that something that jeffrey had an idea about And we're still working on, which is to make the the the co-chairs process of submitting their revised budget requests.
It wasn't sure if it was a zoning study which would be much more technical but just general land use and changes of use in terms of you, know, office, buildings, residential vacancies, and we were aware that we're only at a point in time If we thought that it would be helpful to have some kind of study of what's going on or what could go, on, how it would fit into the our budget priorities I'm.
What are the priorities perceived by the community in this time of Covid-19, which may be different from what we perceive, and it may be an focus on something different, great And I think there are obviously many ways to skin a cat in terms of getting community input, And, I, I'm curious to people's thoughts.
What are you seeing I'm, mindful that the budget task force in the past has said you know, committee has to hear things before it makes it onto a request, and so opening it up broadly and maybe getting feedback that hasn't been really pursued by the committee could still be good for our board, but not necessarily instructive for this budget.
I thought we were going to switch it up as far as what the priorities are now in the age of Covid-19 , like before, dsny was not maybe a priority, and now basket pickup or trash, at least in our district, is a huge priority for a lot of residents, or Know, arts, funding.
And I do think we have to have some space there for people to contribute themselves, because otherwise they're getting a survey, you know to our city globally and very locally and very personally, and I hear the concern that we don't want to hear.
So I, mean, I think, in my perspective, you're asking the community to give you the broad shifts right, like the general idea of like where what are the top three like the way that the document itself it runs as it runs.
What are the top three things that you support to the community board If that was not something that was ever brought to a committee, and now we've asked for that piece of information, and someone says oh well that my school or my block needs You, know We can put together something easily to sort of explain what it is and why it's important and all of that- You know response and agency kind of involvement in the community And But like sanitation and small businesses, is something that has been you know, elevated But I mean that's something we can put on the table.
Small business is a very big concern in our neighborhood I think the process will be great, but my fear would be that you get a group of people like you always do.
If we get 50 requests for one thing, that as a budget task force, we actually don't think should be highest on the priority.
And again I, don't think we've ever thought of budget task force as the most yelling and screaming Gets it to the top of the list, because we have a history of what we've, what we built, towards, asking for and also getting the temperature of what politically is feasible, and it's really like jessica, Said it's just to get people in it's just to have more people in the neighborhood know what we do be aware of what we do and hopefully join the process more than a specific budget.
We should probably say something up front that you know the ideas will be filtered through the budget task force to the appropriate committee for review.
Don't think up front that If I get 50 people to say: this, we're going to get it funded right in the instructions or something does this need to be.
I, don't even know if we do need to, but like do, people need to know that this is being collected, as we think about budget requests.
As I know what you're saying I thought we were going to put under those big categories example of what is in the budget for it, so that people get a sense of it.
Right we're going to get a response to a budget item that says this is still important, so I think we move it to cs to our knowledge, what the information we, because, first of all.
So we were just talking about the we're sort of wrapping up about looking at the statement of district needs and how traditionally the sections that are outlined, here, get divvy back up to the committee, most responsible for those areas to review and update and with christine's suggestion sound like there was agreement.
If people do have the opportunity to review as a whole document, particularly given the unique moment that Covid-19 has you know offered us, alan may I volunteer somebody from our committee to work.
I know people don't like to do it on friday, so we could do the 22nd for the budget task force to meet that'll, be after all, of the after all of the committees.
I think you know if people like hard deadline, the 15th, but sooner or better, and recognizing that the sections are quite short, okay, anything else or maybe we want to have by the next exec.
