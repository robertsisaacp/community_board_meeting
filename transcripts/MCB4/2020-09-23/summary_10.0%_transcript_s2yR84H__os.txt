So, we're back to item number one, the front facade window project at 456, West, 23Rd, street, and we, the Chelsea landers committee, reviewed this, and then we wrote a letter that was voted out at July, 31st, 2019, full board and What.
It really was is a very straightforward project and we recommended approval of the application with the recommendation that LPC the Landmarks Preservation Commission research and determine whether the original window style was different from what the applicant was proposing in this renewal project, because there was a building to the east and maybe some to the west that show possibly original arched windows shape design.
The applicant has and technically the applicant does not have to come back to the community board for Chelsea land use committee or the board landmarks is holding a public meeting not to be confused with a public hearing on this project.
So apparently, we do not honestly know if landmarks researched the original design issue or not so we're kind of in the dark about that, Then we just wanted to update you on this reduced scope on this and see if you had any comments about that, so we're open it.
They did not think it was important or something like that: It's just a public meeting on an issue that we've already approved and they technically they're, going from a combination of wood fibers to another combination to all wood, which is something that we had supported in the past.
We do not know if LPC investigated it or not, but the applicant is really in a kind of a bind because they they're going through a facade change right now, Let them.
You know let those LPC staff approve what we've previously approved and let them move on with their project Why and what's the purpose of a meeting, and why not have a hearing Do you you've, communicated with landmarks?
What I would suggest is that we do a new letter that welcomes the use of the wood, but also references, the designation report and the image in it of 462 as the indicator of what the original condition would have been and ask landmarks to call for matching the original configuration as well as material and simply stating that they should refer to It's, actually on page 32 of the designation, report , there's an image and that image has now been digitized in high resolution at the website of the New York historical society.
If you wanted to zoom in on it and really get a good sense of what you should be basing the new windows on that's now available, and we could even reference that in the letter again, there would not be any public discussion of it at landmarks, but it would still be taken under advisement.
The commission is at the hearing right, Know, tell people how this thing works.
You know it's a row house in a historic district, so it's warranted Any. Other questions comments, Thoughts committee members, fearing no I'm, good.
We should ask for it other thoughts from other committee people, so I would wrap up by saying then I think what we want to do is ask for the for LPC to request that these windows be replaced in their original format.
Okay, so the direction it looks like we're going is to say that we welcome the 100 wood instead of the 40 percent wood fiber, and that we ask that LPC require that the arched windows and all this background, with the eight or nine identical houses in the row and the photo be followed, and this is consistent with our past positions that summarize it for you guys.
Is that given Covid-19 and what we're facing for a city budget there's going to be no money, So I think for us to put in a lot of requests for funding for anything that goes beyond education.
Is hear what each committee does says about the existing priorities, but then have a secondary sort of set of kind of much more current issues that we that they think that are.
You know two to three issues which I think actually Paul described very well, so not to say that if you guys decide not to engage in a conversation about the existing priorities that were put in last year and how they're, if they need to be changed- As the committee wanting just to say, we think these are the three most important things right now and that that's fine and that's what that's.
Let me ask if anybody has, after reviewing you know going through last year's budget.
Were there any items that people on the committee were thinking they wanted to put forward this year, kid?
I wonder if we encourage some sort of a study of how could space be repurposed, whether it's vacant space or under utilized space and turned into affordable housing, because I do not think you know buildings like the one that my wework was in are getting all their tenants back.
The housing committee on that issue to have them recommend someone coming up with a plan, but I think that you're also talking about commercial space right And, so not just the hotels and the homeless situation.
If you could, if you could look into that and share it with us, that'd be great, and even if it's not department of buildings or department of planning, which we mostly would request for you know, Betty, and I can certainly bring it forward to the other committee to the budget task force and see.
I mean some of this would happen, and I hate the word, because my background was in city planning, naturally right,, I, think of all those office buildings that were converted to residences.
Condition, may not be re- inhabited The commercial space presents an interesting opportunity to ask the question: How much do we think there's going to be, and what do we want to do with it?
Think that to Jessie's point we have another month of working through this, So I'd like to suggest that we close this conversation, but that if people have ideas and thoughts that we bring, you know send them, send them along to me and Betty We just went crazy.
If you could think through that a little bit, that would be helpful and then, let's see if we can't come up with some good points in October, so thank you We're not going to produce anything now for the budget Committee tomorrow, night.
If that's something that committee could do, that would be helpful and I still do think But Paul's original point, which is that the focusing on what the whatever we want to call it, the Covid-19 issues or the I, do think the budget task force is going to want to hear that as well.
