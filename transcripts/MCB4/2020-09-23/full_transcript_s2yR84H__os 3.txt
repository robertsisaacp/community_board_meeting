I was just doing the minutes while we're going so we are recording and give me one second, with the youtube and hold on one. Second, sorry, one more second, okay, you know what so it doesn't look like we're going to be able to live stream, so we are recording. We have quorum. We do have a member of the public here. You can start okay, so we're just going to introduce ourselves. Then I'm yeah that'd be great, like just like a normal at the beginning of every committee, yeah, okay, I'm betty mcintosh, co-chair of the chelsea land use committee paul and I'm paul devlin co-chair of the chelsea landis committee, bert lazarus, member of the chelsea land use committee, david dave, helloka, hi kerry, a member of the chelsea abuse committee marty, I'm marty, decat, member of the chelsea land use committee and kit hi carrie good, to see you kit, tylerson. Also member of the chelsea land news committee and tina no tina there, you go what nina didn't, give her computer permission to use this app tina? We did. We can't hear you we can read your lips, I can see you say I don't know why you're not muted tina, so I'm not really sure what's going on well anyway, you know tina, maybe you'll figure it out mike yeah, mike noble member of the chelsea land use committee, hello and that's vera, and I can tell by the background that's pretty. Do you want to say hello to our new member carrie? Yes hi? How are you sorry, I'm just getting off one zoom meeting and jumping into the other one? So I didn't hear you buddy, I'm sorry! Oh no problem! Okay and I guess we have some representatives of our elected officials, maya. You want to introduce yourself hi folks, I'm maya, I'm from state senator brad hoyland's office, nice to see you all good to see you and matt. Do you want to introduce yourself everyone's matt tai from assembly member godfrey's office? Welcome, I think now we could now we can go start. Yes, yeah. We can definitely start make sure. We only have one member of the public, but just to make sure they understand that that if they would like to speak on any of the items on the agenda, they should raise their virtual hand, which is in the participants section, and you just press the virtual hand, raise and the hand will go up and betty or paul will call on you. If, for some reason, you are unable to do that, you can always put something in the q a tab on the bottom. That just says that you want to have it. You have a question to ask so and but that portion of the meeting will come later. Okay, I think we're got our housework done. So we're back to item number one, the front facade window project at 456, west 23rd street, and we, the chelsea landers committee, reviewed this, and then we wrote a letter that was voted out at July, 31st 2019 full board and what it really was is a very straightforward project and we recommended approval of the application with the recommendation that LPC the landmarks preservation commission research and determine whether the original window style was different from what the applicant was proposing in this renewal project, because there was a building to the east and maybe some to the west that show possibly original arched windows shape design. So we've we found out that now the LPC has approved this project, but the applicant is proposing to change the composition of the frames that from forty percent wood fiber to 100 wood all right now they portray this as a scope that has been reduced. The applicant has and technically the applicant does not have to come back to the community board for chelsea land use committee or the board landmarks is holding a public meeting not to be confused with a public hearing on this project. Okay, so apparently we don't honestly know if landmarks researched the original design issue or not so we're kind of in the dark about that, and it seems that it's the material, the wood fiber material. That is the change here and then we just wanted to update you on this reduced scope on this and see if you had any comments about that, so we're open it up. For anybody, who'd like to say something about this and on the committee one route is, we could do nothing. One route is we could send our July 31st letter 2019 letter with some kind of a brief cover letter saying you know we had recommended that the commission researched this. You know what happened you know. Are they ignoring that or they didn't think it was important or something like that so paul? Do you want to add any more to that idea? No, nothing that you were clear. It's just a public meeting on an issue that we've already approved and they technically they're going from a combination of wood fibers to another combination to all wood, which is something that we had supported in the past. There's no change to the arch of the windows above we don't know if LPC investigated it or not, but the applicant is really in a kind of a bind because they they're going through a facade change right now and they need to do these. Replacements and they've changed the composite material from a combination to natural wood and they have to go through this sort of process to get it approved. So I'm inclined just to really not do anything. Let them you know let those LPC staff approve what we've previously approved and let them move on with their project yeah. You said having a meeting and a hearing. Why and what's the purpose of a meeting and why not have a hearing or I'm just confused about that yeah jesse? Do you you've communicated with landmarks? Do they explain yeah, I mean in terms of like why one why LPC chooses to give a project a hearing over a meeting I'll? I would actually defer to david, because david's and maybe veren they've had much more experience with this. But you know, basically, you know a hearing is the you know. Usually the first time the application and project has come before the commission in terms of the pr that specific application, not a not the only not the first time the building has come before the commission, but so that technically, I think, from their perspective, at least from lpc's perspective. They've had a hearing on the overall application, which was the window replacement application. Since then, the project has changed and we're you know, and but it's still the same project. So it's not there for a another public hearing to be had they're sort of what they're sort of doing is tacking it on to a series of other agenda. You know that they've already that they've already set, so this is just going to be one of the many things that they're going to be updating the commission on. I think, and again I defer to david a little bit. I think really where this came from was that there was a big changeover for the applicant in terms of leadership of who's running who was sort of handling this project, and then the project itself changed and then so LPC said. Well, maybe you need to go back and check with what just see what the community board thinks so because it wasn't clear necessarily to any of us what exactly LPC was expecting them to be. You know requested from us yeah in the meantime. In the meantime, the co-op president died. So then there's a new person who's working on this, so it's sort of a new, a new perspective or something like that, david, hello and michael noble have their hands up just so david yeah hi. I think you know similar to the on a much smaller scale, so the again support market project which went from a public hearing and into a major change and then only into a public meeting without another public hearing. This is considered a minor enough change that it wouldn't have another public hearing with public input, I'm a little chagrined on this one. I did some more digging and I had overlooked in the historic district extension designation report from 1981 that this house it's described as having been originally identical to eight other houses in the same row, and the designation report points out that there's a 1915 photograph of number 400 462 from the collection of the new york, historical society. That shows a pretty intact original version. So we do have a good indication of what this building would have looked like and the nature of the windows, and they in fact have what are called segmental heads, they're, sort of circle sections and they actually show casement windows with transoms on the parlor floor. So it's pretty clear what the historic condition would have been. I also looked at landmarks rules about substituting materials and on in a row house in a historic district. Unless it's just a square topped one over one, double-hung window, that's being replaced, it has to be replaced in the original or historic configuration and material. So I suspect what happened was that the applicant in a meeting with probably as a result of the public hearing, was told? No, you can't do this in this composite material. It's got to be wood, so they're, coming back for that and landmarks holds primary facades to a different standard. That's why landmarks could have approved this anderson, fibrex synthetic material for the rear windows, but wouldn't allow it for the front ones. So what I would suggest is that we do a new letter that welcomes the use of the wood, but also references, the designation report and the image in it of 462 as the indicator of what the original condition would have been and ask landmarks to call for matching the original configuration as well as material and simply stating that they should refer to it's actually on page 32 of the designation report, there's an image and that image has now been digitized in high resolution at the website of the new york historical society. So if you wanted to zoom in on it and really get a good sense of what you should be basing the new windows on that's now available, and we could even reference that in the letter again, there wouldn't be any public discussion of it at landmarks, but it would still be taken under advisement by the commission. Well, thank you for digging and researching. I think you probably did more than landmarks preservation. Commission did really. Let me just be clear because in our letter we used simple words in terms of arched windows. That is the same as what you said in more technical terms. I assume yes yeah. Okay, who is the next person? Can I can I interject one? Second david: can you send over send me a copy of that really quickly? I want to take a look at it. Please and it's the destination report doesn't have a page. You said that was on the designation report, page 32. There is no page 32. well page 30. It follows page 31 which describes the houses, so you know if it had a page number on it would be page 32.. You want to be looking at the chelsea historic district extension designation report, it's from 1981 and if you just google chelsea historic district extension designation report, it should come up. I'm just looking at the regular designation report right david. If you have the ability, if you want to copy it and paste it into the chat, then everybody will be able to access it pretty quickly. Okay, I'll see! If I can yeah great thanks david, it's the yeah, that's the hp, yeah, it's the link, yeah! I wouldn't be fast enough to find it myself. Who was a kid that you had your hand out mike noble mike noble mike yeah hi? Well, david answered my question pretty well there I just wanted to you know, distinguish you know, meetings and hearings and all that business. My question is, though, the commission itself does review this right. Well, is that right david? I mean yes, the commission is at the hearing right and yes, and they will in fact see this as if it were a meeting right. Yes, okay, because then just for you know some for my edification and for the new members as well carrie, for example. At some point, we should describe what kinds of things get staff level, reviews and approvals and which don't and why this particular you answered it. Why this one did not right? Yes, so I mean but you're the guy, who, I think is best able to you know, tell people how this thing works. You know because yeah this isn't listening. If you don't, if you're not aware of it from the beginning, some of it's a mystery. You know yeah in this case it's not a matter of staff level versus you know the commission, it's a matter. What happens is landmarks? Commission has a first forum, that's called the public hearing and at that the public is allowed to speak and once they get past that if they decide to kick the can down the road and decide after the applicant has made changes that they may have requested. It usually goes into a public meeting and there may be multiple public meetings where the commission continues to discuss it, but they're different from public hearings and that the public can't speak. So you know often what will happen is that there will be a public hearing. The applicant comes back with changes based on what the commissioner said in the public hearing and the next meeting is a public meeting, meaning no public input, even if major changes have been made, which is what happened with, can support market, and you know, I think, it's up to landmarks to decide whether the changes are significant enough, that it should go back to another public hearing or into the kind of closed-door public meeting process. And you know we discovered against the work market. They were pretty considerable changes that were made and they didn't go back before a public hearing. It went into a public meeting. Nonetheless, we can submit testimony to landmarks for the public meeting, which they're all supposed to read before the meeting. So we have a voice. It's just that we can't speak publicly staff level stuff. Is it's considered minor enough that it wouldn't have a public hearing to begin with, so if you're changing the rear windows on your house, that can be done according to established rules on the staff level and doesn't go before a public hearing. So I've moved the link into the chat. I don't know if you can open it there yeah. It was very helpful. Thank you david. So can this be shown jesse? So I don't know yeah. I definitely if we want. If that's what we want to do, I mean because if I open it it'll be on top of my zoom screen you're going to give me share screen. I can do it too I'll. Do it I'll, do it I'll? Do it you're talking about the photo david right, I just added the photos should be. You know, following page numbered page 31. yeah, I got it hold on and I just entered a link to it at new york, historical society. That's the high resolution image you can zoom in on that. We might want to reference in our letter. This is what does everybody see what I just shared, so what we're looking at is what david this is it's a couple doors down. It is number 462 in the center. In a second yeah and the designation report says it was a row of nine identical row houses and this seems to be the best preserved, one from a photo of 1915.. The houses were built in 1857, so it's completely plausible that these are the original windows we're looking at, and you can see they're two over two double hung on the upper floors and you can see that the wood frame is actually curved and some of the row houses. You know that you see when you walk down the street now have the curved frames and it's not because they're 150 years old they've simply been replaced. They just with curved heads jesse. Can you scroll down a little bit there's another image that shows the squared ones so that people who aren't familiar with this can see like zoom in on that one now, so that people can see the difference of the photo? If you look at the window right next to that street lamp, so it's the wind, the glass itself is squared off at the top versus now go back to the other one and you'll see the glass at the top is rounded. So those of you who aren't familiar with that's the that's the distinction and the difference, and so that little roundness at the top of the windows is what david is saying we you know we should be respectful of the extension report, designation report and ask them to replace them in that format, whereas they currently have the squared off top, which is what you see in that picture. Right, I wouldn't just is naive, but it seems to me that it would be more expensive if you're changing the shape of the window. It is right, yes, well it's more expensive to make a window with the curved top, but you know it's the historic district. It's I don't just want to clarify. So now, if you look at the look at the building just to the left of the lamp post, okay, those windows are look like they're square yeah. What they do is they put like a flat panel. That's kind of arc shaped at the top of the window frame and it's less expensive than actually curving the part of the window frame that holds the glass or the sash. So the windows in our proposal here, four five six, their windows would be like the ones to the e to the left of the lamppost. That's great everything in this picture. Everything in this photo has the squared top glass. So this is what it would look like and then jesse. If you go up to the other picture, this is what it would look like if they replaced the glass top, so the concrete framing the molding around. It is all exactly the same. It's just the glass itself of the window, that's curved, and they do. They do still make david rounded windows like that. I mean you know it would probably be a custom window, but even mass producers of windows, like marvin windows, are set up to do you know windows made to size. You probably wouldn't find an off-the-shelf window that fit perfectly, but this is not a an excessive thing, but we're not asking for the impossible. No, not at all- and you know it's a row house in a historic district, so it's warranted okay. Other comments. Thank you. That was very helpful david. Any other questions comments, thoughts, committee, members, fearing no I'm good. I think david's covered everything and it's not an impossible task in williamsburg people make curved frames in this case. Not only the curved glass stop you're, also talking about curved frame up top, and it's not an impossible thing to achieve. We should ask for it other thoughts from other committee people, so I would wrap up by saying then I think what we want to do is ask for the for LPC to request that these windows be replaced in their original format david. I suspect, though, we're not gonna get it because it's already pretty far along in the process, but I think it's worth asking for and then if, but we should reiterate that this is a similar request to what we made in previous years. We're you know where we can cite the examples that we've given in the past. We can cite the requirements by LPC regulations. Right, I mean it's not asking for anything more than what the landmarks rules which are part of the city administrative code requires. Can we include the language where, in case they decide to deviate from it? They respond to us. I'm sorry. If you're in what did you say, can we request lan LPC in case they decide not to take a recommendation and do whatever they want to do? Will we get some? Can we just request a response from them in writing or something or they just personally? I doubt it, but david knows that yeah. It might seem like a little bit of a naive request. You know what, if, when we care about something like this, what we often do is just watch for it to appear on the calendar to see how landmarks rules- and it may even be that landmarks- has already said to them. You know you have to have the arch tops and there's a little bit of wiggle room in the language of the landmark's law. It says you have to match the original or historic window configuration so does historic, mean one that might have been there a hundred years ago, but is it original in this case? I really would hope that landmarks would go with requiring the arch shape on the sash, and even as you look at this image, you can see how much nicer it is, and the original builder of these buildings spent a lot more money to create those masonry openings with curved tops than it costs to put the windows in them, and it's just that over the years you know, different owners of the buildings have gone taking the cheap route in replacing the windows, but the whole idea of you know landmarks preservation is to honor the original. Thank you can we jesse? Can you make us back into gallery? I think we're done with the photo right. Okay, so the direction it looks like we're going is to say that we welcome the 100 wood instead of the 40 percent wood fiber, and that we ask that LPC require that the arched windows and all this background, with the eight or nine identical houses in the row and the photo be followed, and this is consistent with our past positions that summarize it for you guys. Can we take a vote if you, if you are okay, go like that teddy? What it doesn't do is repeat that the landmark that I'm repeating what david said that it's in landmark's rules already that we're just following those rules that should that should be, and yes I vote in favor right. We did say something like that in our early letter. Historically be special windows defined by commissions rules, and you know we said, and I think the people who don't have, though, there's the elected officials they're not voting. Okay, kerry, you, okay on this one, okay, clarity for the minutes, henry needs to be muted, she's. Echoing. Thank you. Sorry, gina. Our previous letter was an approval with conditions we were doing the same just so, I understand what we're what we're voting on we're writing a new letter. We can. We can attach the old letter. We can repeat the thing that we said in the 2019 letter and then say. In addition, we have researched this in more depth and found that blah that's fine. I just want to understand clarifying whether we're writing on approval with conditions rather than a denial. Unless, oh, that's what I just for them. Oh approval versus denial. Yeah I mean I'm just you. Land use has done denials unless in the past, and I've also you've also done with this pat with the 2019 letter, you did a an approval with a condition. So as everybody's it's a slight variation, but it's clearly communicating something much stronger, I'm not trying to create more problems. I don't know, can you can you right deny unless well, we could say that you haven't. You haven't followed the condition that we that we said and LPC obviously didn't research. This I'm just right, I mean. Is there a feeling among the committee about denial versus approval with another condition or something this being a continuation of the previous approval? I think I would stay with approval with the condition I was just going to say the opposite. I was going to say that we should be strong about this, especially in light of david's remarks that he doesn't think it's going to go anywhere anyway. In saying that look, this is really an important thing. It's a historical district. It's a historic front. We think the whole process should be stopped unless you do this and that might get their attention might not. Okay, any other people who have comments on that yeah, gina and michael all have their hands up. I think marty might make a good point that, since you know we have found this new information, it would signal a change in our opinion, so you know it disapproval unless right, okay! Well, we can still say we welcome the wood, what elements right denial unless I'm sorry denial yeah tonight wrong denial. Okay, so we now have more fine-tuned resolution is. Can you raise your hand? Mike has his hand up. I wasn't sure. Oh I'm sorry, michael, oh, that that's that hand is to approve, because you can't see me all right so from here on when you see that means approved. Yes, okay, so let's just try this one more time, all right, so we're going to do denial. Unless, for the arch windows we did the research. You know, landmarks didn't follow what we suggested in the letter and we welcome the all wood. I think we're all we're on we're good on that good smile wave your hand, whatever anybody is clear clarifying. No one knows no one else is voting in any other direction, but approving of the okay there's no people not voting does hector want to abstain. Since he wasn't a part of the conversation yeah hector, I think, needs to abstain at this point. What did you say? Hector will be listed as an attendee at the meeting, but he's probably going to abstain from this vote since he just joined us. Okay. Thank you very much and president, but not eligible and he's better off, just being listed as not voting at all, since he just joined abstentions, isn't something that we want to win. We don't like abstentions, yeah, okay, we'll just pretend he was really later. I usually ask at the end of the meeting, but david, can you write a first draft? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, david paul. You work on this fiddle around yeah. That was really quite something: okay on to the budget, paul, so just to give a quick overview to some of you who don't recall the process. The community board puts together a list of desires and needs for the upcoming fiscal year. This is the start of the process. Each committee presents its what the term is district needs or something like that. So each committee then reports into the full board there's a special committee that reviews them all sets the priorities to the community board and we put in a request of budget funding for district needs. Then the budget process goes through the city, council and a lot the budget gets approved in. I think July jesse is that right so we're in the very early stages of this. So this is the point in which we start to think about what our community district needs are that we want to see funding for in the next fiscal year, which is a year from now last year. What made it into our community board district needs were two department building code enforcement positions that one of them was already funded and one of them got rejected so from a land use perspective. It was you know, very little that we added last year betty- and I were talking about this earlier today and personally. I just want to add my personal input on this before we carry on the conversation too long. Is that given Covid-19 and what we're facing for a city budget there's going to be no money and we're going to have to see cuts. So I think for us to put in a lot of requests for funding for anything that goes beyond education, public safety, health and I don't see how the city can fund anything, that's extraneous. So I personally think that code enforcement officers and adding on to those is a luxury that we may not be able to afford in the next fiscal year. So I personally am feeling like we take a statement that says if it's not for education, public safety and housing that we don't really make many other additional requests this year yeah. I would like to add that I agree with paul. I don't know, did you say, security, paul, well, public safety, so fire and police safety, public safety, education, housing and then healthcare, hospitals and things like that? I think yeah. I just think it's a very realistic statement that we could make now. Maybe the full board would go with that, but so can I jump in? Can I jump in there real quickly? Just so people understand so I, the budget committee is actually task force's meeting tomorrow night. So but we have rolled out I rolled out to the exec members, which include paul and betty, and actually a couple other folks on this on this call that basically what I think the budget task force is looking to do, because, while we recognize obviously the severity of what's going on right now, but the longevity is that we don't want to necessarily because we there's long-standing goals that I think the community want to continue to advocate for so they're, not looking to rearrange the existing priority numbers. Not well. That's. Let me take that back they're, not looking to sort of clean up the entire priority, all last year's priorities and start fresh. What they would like to do is hear what each committee does says about the existing priorities, but then have a secondary sort of set of kind of much more current issues that we that they think that are. You know two to three issues which I think actually paul described very well, so not to say that if you guys decide not to engage in a conversation about the existing priorities that were put in last year and how they're, if they need to be changed- or you know, re-prioritize or not, that's completely up to your discretion. But in terms of just saying, if, as the committee wanting just to say, we think these are the three most important things right now and that that's fine and that's what that's what the budget task force is asking in addition to doing the normal work that you would be doing. So I just wanted to couch that and frame that which I think paul did. What paul saying is make makes sense. Burt did you have something you want to add? Yes, I think we all know that no one knows how much money will be available. What the revenues will be, what we can move forward, but I don't. I don't think that should deter the committee from maintaining its priorities and exactly what jesse says, because we feed to the task force and then the task force juggles it around and puts in the contingencies. But I don't think we should step back from our priorities. We may even want to phrase it. You know contingent upon revenue sources, but these they should be our priorities and we shouldn't forget them. That's what I'm saying and we asked for the hiring. Does anyone know if anyone was? Did anyone fill that budget line? The do we know that jesse? If anybody? If we asked what happened, we had two requests in last year from this committee that made it through the full cycle and made it into the budget request and from what I'm seeing we had to expand code enforcement was on both of them for additional funding for department of buildings enforcement and the first one was not recommended for funding, and the second one was that this, the other. What position had already been funded? So no additional funding was created based on our requests, but one of the one of the positions was already funded and then the other was not funded. That right, justin wouldn't even be a priority anymore right, so I mean you guys right so the the providing additional funding for department of buildings enforcement inspectors for non-compliant ADA entrances was funded, and then the special district and special district enforcement request was the agency response was not recommended to be funded, but the follow-up did say the agency agrees with this request and will accommodate in part. So if there's you know, there's is there's additional agency responses as they go further down the line into the budget. So I don't know necessarily what that means in terms of in part, but they give they give a under the additional comments. They do give a brief explanation, but it I think, at the end of the day, they're, not it's not creating a funding, a funding line for that for those two for those two dedicated inspectors all right. So let me ask if anybody has, after reviewing you know going through last year's budget. Looking at the dropbox materials that jesse center around about the budget for this year, were there any items that people on the committee were thinking they wanted to put forward this year. Kid I don't know if this is a good idea or a bad idea. I also don't know if it's inbounds or out of bounds but bear with me on this one. When I went to clean out my desk at our we work space, which is not technically in our district. It's just over the line. It was a ghost town. The only people I interacted with were the security agent and a custodian, and I was cleaning out my desk because we downsized from a space for many people to a single person space and now only have some tech assets there and don't plan to re-up in the foreseeable future. And I think that anecdote is true for a lot of companies and a lot of non-profits that had office space in our district, and I think, we've seen you know, hotels that were not doing well in large numbers, repurposed temporarily as shelters, there's other spaces like feeders that are that are sitting vacant. Knowing that affordable housing has been a top priority for a very long time, where not as much progress as any of us would have wanted has been made. I wonder if we encourage some sort of a study of how could space be repurposed, whether it's vacant space or under utilized space and turned into affordable housing, because I don't think you know buildings like the one that my wework was in are getting all their tenants back and I don't think all of those hotels are bouncing back in the short term, and I wonder about things like all of the feeders that are going to struggle to reopen, and so it seems like there might be an opportunity to push on. How do we think creatively about the next stage for our district in terms of many of these spaces, where the future is very unclear right now, so I don't know how we would word something like that. I don't know if we can ask for something like that to be studied, but it just occurred to me that it could be an opportunity to potentially do something positive coming out of this whole debacle, and I think that yeah kid, I think, that's a really great idea, and one of the things that we've talked about well betty- and I talked about today- is the issue of these hotels that are turning into homeless, shelters and how is that being planned? And how is it being forecasted HPD just doesn't do that right? They just fill the vacancies, throw people around whatever there doesn't seem to be a real planning strategy. It's the department of homeless services, so department of homeland services, right DHS, I'm sorry so many acronyms. So many alphabet, soups betty and I talked about having something come through. The housing committee on that issue to have them recommend someone coming up with a plan, but I think that you're also talking about commercial space right and so not just the hotels and the homeless situation. But what is the plan for all the commercial vacancy that's being created right? Is that what you're? So how do we get? How do we get something in place for that yeah? Definitely I think it's a good idea, and I think that the if we recommended this sort of study, that the department of city planning would be the agency most appropriate for this. There could be an issue about the permitted uses in the zone that some of these office buildings are in, but often it's a c4 zone which allows both residential and commercial. But you know, obviously the study would have to look at what this existing zoning is. But I think it's, I think it's a great idea. I just for your information, wrote to maria and joe and copied others on a proposal for a comprehensive plan for the sighting of homeless, shelters in in hotels and that there needs to be some kind of plan that DHS collaborates with city party and or a consultant, and they look at the inventories. They look at repurposing or making safe the facilities that homeless people came from. So I wrote that proposal up today and sent it off to the co-chairs of the housing committee, but I think I'm glad that you raised this kit, so I think that we can. We can do a similar kind of request for commercial use kit, and I think that's a good thing to do. David is your hand up, because you want to add to this conversation, your hand is still up from previous okay, it's from previous okay thanks very much yeah. What I want to tell you that city planning and other agencies are looking at the issue of vacancy, but mostly in residential buildings, because there is an exodus from new york city, particularly Manhattan, who can afford to keep the Manhattan apartments vacant and move to other boroughs. They actually are doing so many of them also moving out of new york city, not that they are selling anything here in new york city, but cities. Considering I'm told from someone who works at the joint commission but they're thinking about vacancy tax to sort of dissuade people from keeping their units vacant. That's number one number two. I teach at city college in columbia, university and pratt institute and number of architectural schools are looking at the possibility of retrofitting vacant commercial spaces. But those are academic studies and my students in fact are looking at hal's kitchen as one of the sort of sites which we can talk about and share city to look at commercial space and retrofitting commercial space, for their benefit is something they're not going to look at, but real estate. Industry itself is looking into that as far as what I'm hearing and what I'm reading, and it's not just about converting office buildings back into residential spaces if they were converted beforehand, even they're. Looking at vacant malls in Queens and other places where they're considering both options, one is affordable housing, but immediately now, they're, also looking at shelters similar to the hotels being converted and the city is looking into that very actively. We just have to find out which agency I don't have information, but I offer to look into that darren if you could, if you could look into that and share it with us, that'd be great, and even if it's not department of buildings or department of planning, which we mostly would request for you know betty, and I can certainly bring it forward to the other committee to the budget task force and see if we can answer it. Someplace else and bert, you had your hand up yeah, I mean some of this would happen, and I hate the word because my background was in city planning, naturally right, I think of all those office buildings that were converted to residences. Okay, all the malls around the country, though I don't know any specifically here in the city but malls around the country which are emptied half of them becoming a healthcare facility. Hospitals are taking it over some office offices moving in they're repurposing themselves. So what study are we asking for? What study are we asking for? Are we asking for a zoning study? And you know we talk about commercial vacancies at this point in time. Yes, a lot of people are not occupying their offices, but this space has not been given up yet. Okay, we're at a certain point in time where we don't really know what the hell is going on. I mean that's the reality, because, where office space is not being occupied and at the same time facebook takes 700 000 square feet. I I'm throwing this out as there's lots going on and we really don't know what's going on forget about the long term, we don't know what's even going on in the midterm. We don't because no one's experienced this before right kit had raised his hand and potentially to try to answer your question. Burt kitt was then well. I mean I think I agree with basically everything that bert said, but I think the fact that we don't know is why it should be studied, and while we can't get, you know answers with 100 confidence to the questions that I think we want to ask. You know, projections, I think, can inform decision making that will be more prudent than if we just sort of let things organically play out, and you know thinking about the type of building go back to my personal experience that we were in on wework. You know, I don't know that it can compete with the newer buildings that have been built in the last couple of decades when people are thinking about okay, we're going to bring our employees back into the office. What do we want that to look like in a world where you know there's a ton of supply, some of the supplies and buildings that are newer, better shape, better amenities? I think a lot of buildings, including buildings in our district, that are very old, weren't necessarily in perfect condition, may not be re-inhabited likely won't be re-inhabited, reinhabited anywhere near the rates that they were pre-covered, and so I think, especially, the commercial space presents an interesting opportunity to ask the question: how much do we think there's going to be, and what do we want to do with it and I think to go back to bert's issue of? Are we asking for a zoning study or whatever? I think that maybe the way we phrase it is to study how alternative or modified uses of existing buildings could occur in the future if there's more of a housing need, but we have a lot of commercially zoned property or there's more commercial need and we have housing or we need hotels. Then jesse's gonna, stop me there. No I'm sorry! I just wanted to raise my hand. I can't raise my hand because I'm the host, so all right, okay, so, but I think bert, I think your point is well taken that we asked for a study to be done on what modifications could be done within the current zoning to allow for alternative uses. Okay, baron, I think situation is very fluid. I'm a consultant to some of the other companies. I have my own practice as well as my consultancy and one of the very large firms right, but, as we speak right now is retrofitting a building downtown. Their existing workspace is being reconfigured to house from 33 to 64 of capacity, so the vaccinations are being redesigned retrofitted right. So it's a lot of a lot of little changes are happening, but at the same time, they're keeping the provision to switch back to what it used to be. On the other hand, look just the way, but things are very fluid. No one is actually giving up spaces. V. Work is a slightly different scenario. They were already in trouble before Covid-19, and the entire business model is suspect, so what's happening with them is very unique and very particular. But typically, if you look around major commercial spaces, we can see that it has. Buildings are vacant because people are not working in place, but people haven't sort of you know what you call them terminated releases yet, but that another sort of unknown that we don't know about. There are subsidies in place. People are borrowing money, paying grants and whatever have you. I think we have at least about six months, and my other question is: who will do this study? Why would they do this study and for whose benefit commercial real estate is handled by commercial real estate? They know exactly where the mouth is and they're going to put their money. Where their mouth is so they're going to be doing these studies regardless? Why would city want to go and say? Okay, you know what we're going to help you out you're, going to spend taxpayers money and do this study for you. That's not going to happen typically, but the way I'm thinking about it is what bart raises is to say to the department of planning say: look at what steps can be taken. If the commercial agents come to us and say we want to use this residential zone for commercial, what steps can be taken to accommodate future needs that are unknown? At this point we don't know what's going to happen so department planning should be prepared for addressing some of the unknown, so jesse you wanted to. I was going to say a couple things I think. We've act. We've clearly always have made studies to dcp in the past priorities. You have currently a couple. I think there already. I do think this is quite a little bit unique, more unique and it might be something more than the in the city's EDC range rather than dcp, and I sort of think maybe what you guys are. One thing is you don't just for clarity's sake in terms of process, you know it's up to paul and betty and everybody else. We have October too. You don't have to be completely. You know finding all of the answers tonight to these questions, but so you can vote on this on in October. Maybe spain spend the month to think about it a little bit more, but you know so. I think in some ways you're sort of asking for two things: one you sort of there might be something as in the budget that you want right that there's a budget request which won't really get answered until next spring when the preliminary budget gets sent out. So I think varen's point is like there's plenty of time in between and who all the private- and I think, bert's saying this too- is the private market's going to do their own thing. So who knows so? Maybe the request won't be as highly functioning at that point, but maybe it's still a valid request, whatever it may be, but then there's another thing which I think it sounds like you're making an idea of a requ, not so much a budget request, but a planning conversation to be happening. So what I think paul's saying is that, rather than just leaving it to the private market to come to the city with all of these ideas and proposals and say, here's what here, I'm going to make money on this, so here I'm going to do is that there's got to be some sort of significant collaboration, whether we call it a task force or a city working group or whatever to start thinking about what kit's talking about which is like you know, not, you know both commercial turning into residential, maybe residential, turning into something else. Health, hospital and health and hospital needs. All of that, and so that's more of a. I think just a general request that you're sending forward as an coming ahead of a letter, and I would only say if that's in any way what is what maybe happens is. I think we definitely want to loop in the other land use committee and that so it's a joint concept is that what we're saying is needed right just because the 2g, the geography of both of the district area neighborhoods in the district, are different. So we don't want to just assume something all right. So I think that to jessie's point we have another month of working through this, so I'd like to suggest that we close this conversation, but that if people have ideas and thoughts that we bring, you know send them, send them along to me and betty and we'll add them in to the next months and we'll have another discussion on this in our in our next meeting, and I see that as soon as I said: let's not do it. We just went crazy. What I had my hand raised on the raised hand function. Oh, I didn't see it I'm sorry. I apologize. I just to jesse's point his last point. I do agree with it in that, maybe that there has to be collaboration with commercial training, residential, the two studies I think we could focus on. I thought that williamsburg was converted from all a warehouse space to all residential. I remember talking to a friend of mine. She said yeah bloomberg just said: zap now, you're residential. This is all commercial space. This is commercial, water and whatever, so I don't know if that's necessarily true or what went into that, to convert it from all factories and you know buildings into residential, but I know specifically, I mean that's one question or one study that could happen in terms of looking at that versus today, but also just more recently. I think, two years ago, a courthouse downtown on broadway and worth around. There is being converted to condominium spaces to you know residential spaces. So it's you know not just necessarily commercial. It can definitely happen. It is a longer process than just somebody saying it's done, but but I appreciate that input on that tweet and then verone. No, I'm just going to clarify conversion is not difficult. The mechanism are already in place, so williamsburg didn't happen on the slide, I mean it happened through whatever process that's available to everybody, and that process is still available to convert a commercial space into condominium. You go through whatever you know, standard sort of approval process converting manufacturing is a little harder, and you know we know all about that too. So those mechanisms are already in place. Putting residential in a commercial zone is not impossible. It's done all the time right, but in the context of the budgeting is that we want to plan for what we don't know so marty you wanted to. I just want to say that you're asking wonderful questions and you're not identifying who would do the study. It's a fairly complex study that you're talking about and the people who do the study will be, as you know, that, because they have their own visions, whoever they are will in some way predetermine its end. But I think part of the question that paul wants to ask us to think about, for the next month is who the hell would do a fairly complex study like the one you're suggesting yeah and as jesse points out it could be the planning or the EDC. But okay, all right betty wants to add some more yep good. Now I just I just wanted to add that in this study I think it's even more complex, because I think that professional people may be changing the way they do their work. I guess I from a personal standpoint, rich, my husband is a psychotherapist, so he has his private office with a group of other private offices in an old office building on west 46th street between fifth and sixth, okay, no one is going to their offices physically to see patients all right. So in the field of psychotherapy and other similar professions, everybody is really scratching their heads that maybe there is going to be a permanent change in the way you see your patients online or through zoom or through another visual program. So I just, I just think it's a very complicated issue and I liked kids thrust about affordable housing and maybe low-income housing or middle-income housing, because there's such a great need in the city. For that I, like the link of that, I don't. I don't want us to lose that thrust, because you know you might be able to have some program that encouraged certain kind of housing, not just high income housing in conversions. But you know a subsidy program or something that could encourage that kind of housing. The building that rich has its office in is quite old, and I just not sure it's going to come back so right and that echoes a important distinction and what I'd like to ask everybody to think about for our for the next meeting is to think about. How do we put this in the context of land use right? So these old buildings, individual buildings whatnot? But this is more of a zoning and usage conversation. So if you could think through that a little bit, that would be helpful and then let's see if we can't come up with some good points in October, so thank you so paul we're not going to produce anything now for the budget committee tomorrow night, I don't it doesn't sound like we need to, and I didn't I don't know, the budget task force is meeting tomorrow. Their first meeting for this process and I'll give them bert will be there. I believe so he can definitely give them an update as to where you guys are heading, but I do think I understood clarity's sake. I just want to. I do think going through the existing priorities still as a as a as a need should be done, and so obviously things that have been funded. Should you know if you guys are comfortable with that and removing it from the list and re-prioritizing them in any way to give the budget task force in when they meet in October to finalize the budget priorities, some guidance that would be helpful as well. So, if that's something that committee could do, that would be helpful and I still do think but paul's original point, which is that the focusing on what the whatever we want to call it, the Covid-19 19 issues or the you know the you know the right now problems. I do think the budget task force is going to want to hear that as well. So you know that doesn't make it more complicated but yeah. So are you saying that we should produce something for tomorrow night or not? No, I'm sorry! You do not need to produce anything for tomorrow night. I think you would aim for October. Okay, all right and everybody should send things to paul and betty and bert. You can give the flavor of our discussion tonight to the budget group right great. All right thanks. Everybody appreciate that I'm under old new business- we didn't have anything. I just do want to report that and tina. I don't know if you've responded yet or not, but the we've discussed in the past the expansion of the flat iron business improvement district. There is another meeting coming up that I will be attending. I think tina's going to plan to attend tina. Can you not if you're, yes good, so we'll have more to report out on that? I don't. I don't suspect, there's going to be any change from the previous discussions, so we'll just update after we hear from them. Anybody else have anything else to bring up bert just took just clarification information. What was the final resolution at landmarks about the gansenport or wasn't there a final resolution? Yeah there was, they approved a six story. They did approve it: okay, that's all yeah building and they approved a six-story building and they required more preservation measures for the row house. Historically, okay, I just wasn't sure if it was approved enough. I remember they came back with the new plan and everything like that was that david yeah, they didn't approve six stories. They approved actually an eight-story building, yeah, oh okay, sorry I misspoke yeah, the applicant lowered the the parapet and reduced the floor-to-floor height and only removed one story, and the commissioners really changed their tune quite a bit from the first meeting. Where you know a lot of them objected to any construction at all in the backyards of the row houses. So I don't know I felt like it was a little bit of a rope-a-dope where in the public hearing they sounded like they were going to do the right thing and then contradicted themselves in accepting it and even in the public meeting the second meeting on the revised scheme. You know a lot of them said this would be still better if it were a story shorter and it just leaves open the question of well. Why did you allow it? Why vote for it? If it's still a story too tall? And you know I that might go to political influence or who knows you know? But I do. I do want to say that the input that we had was very powerful. If you look at the original plan and the restoration of those townhouses and then what is the end result because the rear walls and sidewalls and interior walls, there was so much more restoration of those townhouses, because I think because of the work that, like david and pam and the rest of us did to really push for that and in terms of the height of the infill building, they did reduce it by over 30 feet. So it's a significant and they change the cladding, so it blends in a little bit better. So I mean you know it. May not. It may not be perfect, but it's significantly improved based on the work that we did. I think yeah. I think we did very well. I think the biggest thing we learned, I think the biggest thing we learned is that they played us a little bit in terms of actually having much taller ceiling to floor height initially and then squeezing in exactly the same number of floors that they wanted right from the start. So we got played a little bit, but I think the fact that they reduced the height significantly is the win. I think yeah. So thanks for asking bird next time, someone comes 14 feet ceiling height, be careful yeah. It's a good lesson, reduce the height by reducing the floor to ceiling height. So all right. Well, thank you, everybody. I have one more thing, jesse very quickly. I mentioned this at housing, so I just wanted to mention it a clue, and I don't know if everybody saw the press release from brad hoyleman's office. If you remember last year, brad hoyman's office provided gave basically hit the community boards that he covers the ability to advocates directly for state funding for a number of projects that were on our budget list long term long time, projects on our budget priority list, and so the one was an education project, a science labs that we've been advocating for a while, but the other one was infrastructure for the fulton houses. And so I just wanted to highlight that for folks that the fulton houses have been asking for some pumps for their for the ta. The tenants associate president on the leadership have been asking for that for many years and that's moving ahead. It's not completely done yet and we don't know exactly if the funding will be in yet, but it it's moving ahead and then so brad will sent out a press release on that. I just wanted to highlight that for everybody here that you know, I could also say that the working group, the chelsea working group, is starting up again and hector knows that and joe and hector and elzora- and I are involved in that- and I don't know how it's going to work because you're forgetting another member again. Why do you like doing that? Oh I'm, sorry again, oh slap, my wrist, not just you not just you anyway, maybe because your window is smaller michael anyway, so I don't know how it's going to work on zoom. We used to have these gigantic meetings with the tenants and other organizations and the citizens committee and the housing authority. Folks- and I it's hard for me to envision how zoom is going to work, so I don't know, do you want to say anything about that michael negative hector? What do you think? Actually, I'm kind of excited about the whole prospect of starting this up again, a lot of challenges to overcome. As you said, betty zoom has its limitations, but at least it's better than nothing at this point, so I'm sure we'll figure something out. I mean, obviously it's going to take a lot of work, but I think we'll get it done one way or the other. I like your optimism anyway. Is it a public meeting or is going to be just a private group meeting? Well, the plan is we were having these meetings among the members that were originally part of the work group and we're going have public workshops developing in development, hopefully, in a couple of weeks, if everything goes according to plan normally, we would have that to the general public. Obviously, there's going to be some limitations, obviously, because of social distancing restrictions, we're still trying to figure it out how we can how we can do decimate all this information out to the public, safe in a safe manner and have proper feedback as well. That's this seems to be one of the biggest obstacles we're running into right now, so, but we'll get it done one way or the other awesome. Thank you all right. Everybody! Thank you, carrie thanks. So much for your first did you want to say something before we left carrie, you raised your. Were you raising your hand to say something? No, I just wanted to say. Thank you. Sorry, I feel quiet, but I'm a little bit. You know no, it's good! It's all new learning about learning the acronyms have a good night. Thank you. Thank you all right, I'm gonna get off now. I guess. Marty and tina are really the rest of us now. You know all right goodbye, guys.
