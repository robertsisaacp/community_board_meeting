Our issue with our district is at one point: We hit 2200 temporary shelter beds over a number of sites they and they were the watson on West 57Th Street, the skyline motoring, the Cashier hotel, the Washington Jefferson on West 51st, caches on 42nd west to 10Th avenue the hotel on 44th street.
We have had ongoing issues of public safety at every location and we've been working with DHS on a one by one basis, trying to come up with a solution.
That is simply not being managed well, while the initial thing had to happen in order to protect people and our most vulnerable new yorkers, we're now at a point where it's not being managed, and it's created a lot of difficulty and a lack of public safety on the streets.
They vote on writing a letter of support or to make recommendations, and if you need to comment or ask questions whether you're on the committee or you're part of the public.
The city began to act in a very expeditious fashion, moving almost a thousand people a week out of our permanent shelters, which they have been where they were located into hotels and with very little notice.
I do not have the numbers as of yet, but I was informed that there will actually be additional security coming to the three sites on 36th street in the form of individuals whose job will solely be would be community engagement.
You know a host of other issues that we can get into as well in terms of within that within you know, within the city that we're all trying to deal with in a very difficult time, but ultimately I think that that's the That's, the 35,000 elevate site from a bird's eye, Oh in terms of I, think this is actually really important.
Obviously we're just waiting for the health guidelines to do so, but no one, no one, that's engaged in this work would like us to see it be in hotels for a second longer than we have to be just given the given the nature of these existing shelters.
I think it's a little over 100 on a 52nd, street, okay, And, then the for the three hotels used for family with children.
Think one of the things we need to understand as a community, then we're going to really ask open it up to the to the committee.
So the other issue we bring to is we've gotten many reports back the issue that the ability of these of these operators to provide social services is highly compromised, because the nature of the buildings are literally budget hotels ,, there's, no congregate, space , there's no ability to do things and we've got lots of reports back from people who are in the shelters that they just can't get the same kind of service, and in fact I was on one call.
We know that you did it for the right reason: we're now interested as a neighborhood to maintain public safety and get people services.
And I have I, have two small children at home, The job that I have is going acrosss, New, York, City talking to individuals and communities regarding shelter.
I would always whenever I can want to give as much time, because the one thing that I've heard again and again and before I started this job and for previous administrations, it was exactly what happened during Covid-19 was sort of the normal process for normal shelters It did not work, I dare I, say this was a once in a lifetime pandemic, especially at the beginning, as we were trying to scramble to do it, and so I understand that there's nothing that I can say.
These are situations in which clients are coming from and generally around sites that are, you know, usually around between 150 and 200 number that are dorm like settings that have shared meal space that were created to serve individuals in a temporary basis, as they find their way to permanent housing, and they were not created at all, as this is how we're going to be able to live while there's a highly contagious pandemic, and the city you know is obviously now in deep conversation trying to figure out Does that have to look like to actually move folks back into these settings in a safe way and it and the and the answer is a very vague answer, and so I share.
I think we all are hoping and praying that these numbers remain low as we go through this next cold and flu season, and hopefully, as we can, you know, seeing as we can continue to take precautions as a city and continue to stay low as a state that will be able to figure out how to you know, transition people back from these hotels into appropriate shelters.
What I like the fact that you want to have more conversation, every month, but what is happening on the ground day- To- day is affecting everybody every single moment that they're on the streets.
Is there any possibility to look acrosss that entire list of contracts or can't the city leverage the fact that hotels have absolutely zero occupancy to find the right spaces that may have conference rooms that may have areas that are large enough for full staff to be able to spend that time during the time that they're supposed to be working with their clients to provide what is needed for our at- risk, population, even just more room to use as program space?
In fact, people are connected with something, as opposed to just ending up on the street decompensating And I think it's a very I'm- going to interrupt you because I'm not asking about the providers, I'm asking about leadership at DHS to actually manage the process for where folks are put where their sighting is for, where they're put so that it is appropriate for the population.
In that there's a lot of different ways that folks were trying to be creative in the beginning, with the pandemic, with the need to social distance, engaging clients, it was a challenge, but we're now at a place where you know lots of communities have been gracious and donated community space in the summer.
I'm going to keep on moving through the committee members and be mindful another 10 minutes Max on committee members, because we have a lot of public who wants to be heard and DHS needs to hear them go to leslie.
What happened to those people who were in family shelters who were whose lives were disrupted sure?
Issues, and I want to again bring you back to when we bring in people from West 36Th Street, These community residents are out of their minds.
I did not know until I started working for the agency that there was a unit solely dedicated to be dispatched to cater and support and offer resources and beds to our most vulnerable new yorkers betting down outside in the streets.
Outreach support do not know if you're coming from a shelter or from the street and that's an ongoing issue.
So you already know the questions that I ask and what my thoughts are and the only thing I want to add Matt to something that you said something that katie said something that katie said when we talk about this situation, particularly I'm talking about 36 and 37th street.
Really it's an untenable, situation, and I, hear you saying sorry, but sorry does not suffice and what I know that the community is looking for is going to be action.
That's great, but really you know that what we were looking for, because we put it in our letter- was looking for a reduction on 36th street or removing one of the one of the shelter sites, because 800 people on one block is really is really too much, and I.
I worked in a homeless shelter, so I understand a lot of it and there was a New York Times article that recently came out really interesting.
That people shared with me It's about families, but the thing I wanted to say is that I am understanding of the situation as we all shared why this needed to happen.
16 are raising their hands, I'm, going to call on people from West 36Th Street first, because those are the ones who are absolutely out of their minds and then Nellie will bring you in and bring you out.
On, West, 36Th street alone, no less the entire community promises of monthly committee meetings.
I can't express how suddenly the street state changed when the residents moved in at the end of May. Dhs has said that the safety of the of the shelter clients are their top priority with little no regard to the residents.
What I do want to know is what is DHS going to do to ensure that such a glitch does not happen when the people that are staying at the hotels in our district are eventually moved back to either a more traditional shelter setup or to other hotels, so that we do not continue doing this shuffling around and just shuffling the problem from one place to the other, because otherwise this is not going to end, and Thank, you so much, I'm on West, 37Th Street and my biggest question about security.
So I want to note that we're taking down the questions because we're going to ask DHS this in a follow- up letter , it's Joanne, Violante, I'm, a resident of West 37Th Street as well.
I, would like to know the number of the total population that's been placed south of 42Nd Street.
We need a comprehensive plan that is going to address all of this, because we've I've seen published reports, I'm in the industry, I'm an event planner These, the homeless pro could be in the could be in these hotels through October.
Everybody is at danger, as the last person said, not just the individuals that have been relocated onto the block, but the people as well that live there.
We discussed the relocation from the Jack Ryan and just the dispersal of those people, I'm like question Really Is there a plan for bringing some of that population Say half of them back to the shelter.
We need to have a working relationship with where, if people, whether they are homeless or not, they have 10 seconds.
I walk from my office on Fifth Avenue, up multiple times, I'm in a nice way, I'm, actually meeting a number of different single females, and things like that because they are cl.
For people who are now most likely permanent fixtures of the neighborhood, the Genie's out of the bottle, so I think if this is direct to the DHS, the best thing you could do for us right now is give us details of a security plan that includes the fringe areas of the nucleus, which is 36th and 37th street, so that plan within a few blocks, I think, is your first step.
So I live on 54th street, I'm, A former social worker, I'm, an HR consultant and I have worked with a number of organizations, doing homeless, Outreach, supportive housing, etc.
Thank, you first time at this kind of community meeting, I'm a little nervous to speak, but I live on West, 44Th, Street and really speaking about my experience near the skyline, I.
The person who spoke before me think it's important that DHS and this community board hear from viewpoints of people Sometimes.
The loudest voices are people who are experiencing immediate dangers and need help and want to figure out how to deal with bad situations, so I have walked by the Skyline hotel, daily.
We are a practical on the ground, solve problems community you needed to hear from a lot of the people in the worst affected area, which is right now 36th and 37th, streets, and I hope.
And I want to say this to the committee members and for all the people in the public.
We have no choice, but you know, let's get them off the street, so people have to witness them but put them somewhere, even if it's in the hotel.
You facilitate this problem with DHS and the and the mayor or whatever we can do to petition this west side got a shelter out of their community.
You know one of the things that we have been really pushing for and advocating for which I think was actually communicated quite well through some of the members of the public.
You know that DHS takes a much more of a leadership role in recognizing they put this many folks into our district and how to manage them and how to coordinate that response on handling the quality of life and the public safety issues that arise, because, as folks on this committee know folks that sit on other community advisory boards for other shelters that are in existing shelters that are in our district and and also supportive housing facilities in our district.
It sounds like DHS is finally coming to the table and saying yes they're, going to start those meetings, and I think.
That does not solve the main issue here, tonight, which I think was clearly communicated, which is just you can not have that many folks put implanted into a community into a block like that and and expect nothing to happen, and so, as you guys already know, you've written a letter and they've written back.
Therefore, DHS has to come up with a plan in general on how this process gets managed both to benefit the shelter residents and to provide ongoing public safety for the community, because it has created problems where none existed.
Anecdotal issue, So Our requests in a letter are here Well come up with a plan, and you must reduce the density on 36 and 37 streets, because it's just not working, and it's not tenable.
What's helped 47:48 and 49:54, and 44th street and 46th Let's get people in the Block.
Your point before, which is very accurate, is that we need to make sure that DHS takes charge and does not leave it to the hotels to decide where people go.
Unfortunately, a homeless person was killed, and so what I wanted to ask DHS earlier You know they talked about the extra security, but we actually need to know asap.
I am concerned about the number of schools that we have in this community and how the opening of schools is going to be affected by the number of homeless people out in the streets, especially those that are persons that have committed crimes in the past.
Since we've received a great number of people in this community that are homeless, how is this considered?
We also had another email from catherine who actually spoke about her and her husband, who've lived in the community, 40 years, they're, 71 and 84., and what else was I going to say the thing that I just wanted to share with everyone.
The thing that stands out to me right now is that you know this is not about putting homeless people onto the streets right thinking about the letter that I just saw it's about what's occurring on 36 and 37, and for the people who have to live there and the density and the way that they are in fear of stepping out of their home even during the day to do normal kinds of things like go to the store And How they're being impacted and how they're being impacted in relation to their safety, their physical and their emotional and mental well- being, You know, DHS has impact here, but it is about our electives and about the administration.
When I found out, I heard that people on 79th street were going to be relocating.
I'm, the chair of Community Board, for I first want to thank Joe and Maria for running a great meeting tonight and for all of their efforts on all of this Gail brewer's office Has been working on a letter to DHS as well, and that letter has not come out yet because I'm going to be quite frank here, Right now of the press to send a letter saying people need to be relocated.
What I was going to ask is that each committee member send myself Joe and nelly an email indicating I need you guys to look at the budget.
