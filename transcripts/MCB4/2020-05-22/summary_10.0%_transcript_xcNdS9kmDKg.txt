I still have a few things that I'm, like so got to work through Noreen Doyle,, HRPT: We were very stressed when we did our first board.
Rashid can talk about the historic vessel side of it and to Noreen Doyle, HRPT, Me and David Sharpe I'm, so pleased to be back here received before to give an update on our peer 97 project.
We feel that the historic ship location is much better located, kind of on the South East corner of the plan which people will be looking at when I say: this, Kevin, Quinn,, HRPT, Your side of it is the architectural and design side.
And people were sort of like even Jeffrey LeFrancois- WPE This is Evan William from Hudson River, Park.
How, many people right your full board meeting last week or the Noreen Doyle, The public session had Noreen Doyle, HRPT: 26 speakers.
Jeffrey LeFrancois, WPE, Co, Chair: Everybody, besides the speaker or presenter, should and will stay muted throughout the meeting, members of the public who have joined through the online link will be asked..
Everybody will move to the first item on our agenda with a presentation from the Hudson River Park trust regarding the progress of peer 97, Kevin, Quinn,, HRPT, Okay, pleased to be back here with see before to give an update on our pure 97 project.
Since then, we've been to the public design Commission received it positively,, but to give us some minor comments that I think made the project, a little better.
Just wanted to point out that the actual project boundary includes the frontage is in front of pure 98 and 99 here, 98, being Con Edison and pure 99 being DS, and why the Department of sanitation and we're doing improvements, alone, Going from east to West,, which means on this picture going from right to left.
If you're walking, you know down south work from here 98 and you Ian, Hampson!, A, splash pad and water feature for children, young children, toddlers and older children.
This- is what we presented last time as being that the choice that we offer the public, Ian Hampson!, melk, You can decide to go directly west, towards the end of the pier or go right and find yourself in a more immersive botanical zone that shady lots of visual interest places to sit and read, and quiet.
Then what you have is either a sunlight choose from to lay in through relaxin or you could sit and read and Sunday, you know, via Ian Hampson!, Melk, lounge chairs, that we have designed along the, the northern edge there, a suitable for tandem, seating Then.
11 foot overlook down to the lower portion of the park inside this wooded zone and You're able to, you know, come back up to the top of the stairs here.
One important thing: I wanted the community board to be aware of is that we analyze every square foot of this building to make sure that it was really needed.
Moving from the cafe bathroom plumbing Broomfield, office, maintenance, shop and service yard that there's a change in heights here, so David, Jaubert, The function of the building is reflected in the way that it's organized,, which allows it to have a very individual quality and the facade of the building will be David Jaubert, wrapped with aluminum panels, which have a very macro reflective, quality., David, Jaubert: That provides some capacity and some transparency and these movers will be surface with a very interesting color..
The North elevation, and just to the right of that, looking at the edge of the service yard and then the primary East elevation,, which is what most people will see from the city and the prominent and the drive.
And wanted to be sure that Community board saw that before we see the renderings, because the still renderings will seem a little silver to, but actually it's a very dynamic kind of subtle, color.
So, to hear today we're going to speak a little bit briefly about the signage as a standard with the other Hudson River Park projects.
That can be seen from the prominent as well as driving south along the highway, and this building really acts as a beacon, and a way to introduce not only this project, but the overall park system.
This is a view from the highway as we drive South sinker 97 for the first time with the signage of Hudson River Park.
David Jaubert: Not only for our building and the pier,, but also for the overall park system.
We have various flood and point lights that are going to be applied to David Jaubert, The underside of the building and along the very top edge of the river running continuously around all four facades.
We actually think a better location is on a south side to the east and Kevin Quinn, HRPT: Create, some water disturbance with awakes, but also puts our historic muscle on a pretty vulnerable spot.
But I can give you the starting point,, which is that the park was designed with the concept of kind of vegans at major entrances and pure 97 being the northernmost kind of public pier in the park.
That is the official kind of look of the park and the intent was to try as Noreen Doyle, HRPT: To 13 feet wide for the Hudson River Park sign.
It's a very tough with area and JDâ€”, MCB4: We're, very good Kevin, Quinn, HRPT: Not in these renderings, but we are looking at, at different material where the service yard is Kevin.
What we're calling the Overlook, which was that area that gives you the view over Ian Hampson!, melk, The, far west side of the pier and under the Hudson River in the distance.
It is the good and the bad about having seating right over there,, but I'm Kevin Quinn, HRPT: A place for the weary parents sit while the kid goes up and down a slide for Jeffrey LeFrancois- Or, as the parent wants to join them, because Noreen Doyle, HRPT, Thank you.
Noreen, Doyle,, HRPT, Which, people, Sally, Greenspan, Think of that right : We go to the image right at the end of the pier next to the Like, a blank space that might be an opportunity.
I, hear JD his comment that it feels corporate, but I think this is actually a very subtle design and Visitor Center at Frank, like rights, Darwin Martin house in Buffalo.
Aspect of our team, looks at any design before the community obviously sees anything or before we send anything out because of things like you're.
All asking Noreen, Doyle, I would say that we are still looking at the Noreen, Doyle,, HRPT, Western side of the building and the louvers on that to make sure that our team can get access to the louvers from the water.
So working with operations in the plan, is to basically wash it from the, from the roof and it's accessible from David Holowka David, Holowka: Panels, coming right down to the sidewalk level, And I'm kind of concerned about maintenance vehicles bumping into them, and you know, Madelyn, Wils,, HRPT, Um,, so you're not seeing a final absolute design.
I, think you mentioned FDNY access to the roof, but the maintenance needs been taken into account as well for the Kevin Quinn, HRPT : I agree that the playground for at least the toddler part needs to be fenced in Lowell Kern, Chair, MCB4, specifically talking about the kids playground.
Area, they've, been in the design for quite a bit now You look at the place, scape here, you'll notice that the North, we, we actually use them at the threshold for with a toddler play area.
Okay, I did not get a chance to read it because we ran through the slides to quickly I'm fine with the Hudson River Park and The pier 97 sides.
Now I'm heading out of the park on the bike,, the bike, path, itself, um,, Lowell, Kern, Chair,, MCB4, It looks like there's a nice separation between the boardwalk area and the bike.
Think that we looked at the whole south side for the historic ship and Noreen Doyle, HRPT: We're sensitive to not wanting to block us from Milan, among other things,, and it's also.
If it's,, you know, a more active zone that the overall periods, design with more activity towards the east and more relaxing towards the west,, so Noreen Doyle, HRPT: If, there is a water taxi or a ferry or whatever.
Only thing that will block is the boathouse that 96 Lowell Kern- Chair, MCB4: You have a water taxi or a ferry, stop at the far end, I want to make sure that those ships coming in are not going to.
It looks like there's a different fencing on the north and south side of the pier.
It's, been a pleasure to watch this develop into a really,, really lovely project and Maarten deKadt, WPE, Co, Chair , Other people have said that,, but I felt I needed to echo.
I, understand your, your Maarten deKadt, WPE, Co, Chair: Strategy of not using batteries,, because that adds a lot of expense to the building and kind of have to be the buffer, and that actually makes sense to me.
But what the design of the building and Madelyn Wils, HRPT: We are looking at this everywhere in the park.
When you come up with Lowell Kern- Chair,, MCB4: Marty,, you say: solar, panels, enough, eventually, they're going to listen.
Other thing I was going to say is that I know the park need asked for a I'm like a restroom there, And I know the part that needs a maintenance facility, there.
I want to applaud the perforated canopy, I think,, letting a little bit of sunlight through Jeffrey LeFrancois, WPE, Co, Chair, Is, really important in places like this and not full shade.
I know that Madeline but I rarely Jeffrey, LeFrancois, WPE, Co, Chair: I still be in line actress and cherry trees.
We have the money in the state budget to bill the park, a Huge, amount, Madelyn, Wils,, HRPT, Of pain,, those being referred by government right now.
Thank you for your patience from the men from the boathouse Jeffrey LeFrancois- I'm, on the board of directors from Manhattan Community boathouse, which operates out of pure 96, which is directly south of your 97 or 97, is actually our northern Catie MCBH/ Pier 96: Anything that happens on the south side and the water is effectively in our environment and puts our kayakers at risk.
Just start with the point that the park overall was designed for boathouses and historic.
We do environmental education that involves fishing and other activities in the water and again Noreen Doyle, HRPT: We have that three other boat houses in the park as well.
We just need to make sure everything is in place with our funding,, given the current state of the city's budget,, but something that we're going to work out.
Have it open, Jeffrey, LeFrancois, WPE, Co, Chair, Great., Thank, you.
Moving to city parks to present on the temporary public art exhibition coming to Bella Abzug park in the summer of 2020 Jeffrey LeFrancois, WPE, Co, Chair: Also referred to as Hudson Boulevard area around Hudson Yards,, and we have 1212****414, I'm, Elizabeth, masella, I'm, the senior public art coordinator and YC parks.
Or I'm on to the next item on our agenda from the Department of sanitation regarding the compost, collection, program, suspension for I'm sure they're going to get into this,, but Jeffrey LeFrancois, WPE, Co, Chair, The city stopped,, not just curbside composting.
I'm in light of the Kobe outbreak,, but it's also been put on halt at Jeffrey, LeFrancois- WPE, Co, Chair, Green markets and Hudson River Park has also suspended their compost.
Before committee and for March 12 Andrew, Hoyles(, DSNY): We are going to present to that meeting to talk about all of the various options,, both the curbside composting program and the drop off programs that were available to all residents and see before.
Andrew Hoyles( DSNY): Quite, a different reality, given the global pandemic,, given the Andrew Hoyles( DSNY): You, know,, loss of life and the,, the loss of revenue to the city and the emergency Andrew Hoyles( DSNY): Status at the city's in which was actually declared on the 12th of March,, so Andrew Hoyles(, DSNY): I work specifically on the curbside program.
He had an opt in program where you Andrew Hoyles( DSNY): Signed up online, and you received a site visit from staff, You know, your building maintenance and then provide bins and service.
Andrew Hoyles( DSNY): Our program partners,, the New York City compost project actually lost its funding in this, and also our education with garden when I see, which the department also funds.
My frustration is extreme on this matter, because it seems you know where the waterfront parks and Environment Committee, and we do not often have a lot of environmental issues that we can advocate around other than Jeffrey LeFrancois- And, so that this was the first item.
Marguerite, Manela, DSNY, Hudson, River Park trust is running.
Marguerite Manela- DSNY, were actually able to run public food, scrap drop off sites because they were enrolled in curbside, composting, service.
I would like a letter on this out of the committee of people would be okay with that Marty To, the administration, with a CC to the Speaker and the sanitation, Commissioner.
Guess I just want to register an objection that there are many other things that the representation is responsible for Jeffrey LeFrancois, WPE, Co, Chair, Including, streets, weeping, and that seems to have no problem roaring back to life and then turn back off, um, you know, Um,, so I listen, Be writing the letter.
Keeping it on the toe pound on NYPD radar, and we are continuing to expect updates from them accordingly,, given the fact that the Governor has, as part of the budget, has deadlines in place for relocating the operations of the pier as they relate to Jeffrey LeFrancois- Which, is regarding another of our peers in the Hudson River Park access to pure 86, which of course is inherently hot tied to the intrepid, and we all know the museum and pier in Hell's Kitchen.
You know, the state of being put on pause by the governor,, given the fact that we are clamoring for public space and how crowded Hudson River Park is Jeffrey.
Which was in the Dropbox that explained their position, reasoning for closing the pier and likewise with what they're responsible for as it relates to Jeffrey LeFrancois- WPE, Co, Chair: Any questions from the committee, I want to pass it over,, Susan.
As, you probably all know, Susan Zausner: We operate the pier we maintain it.
We provide bike, paths, crossing Susan, Zausner: All of the all of those elements that allowed the peer to be active and open to the public and to our visitors.
We are using the security for both the pier and for the ship and Susan Zausner: Unlike other areas of the park.
It does not Hudson River Park does not provide any kind of staffing, Susan, Zausner, For, us.
The other people who do not pay rent for the pier or the community, boathouse Lowell, Kern, Chair,, MCB4, And I-.
I know the intrepid is a not for profit, but Lowell Kern- Chair, MCB4: You're dealing in a lot bigger dollars than the community boathouses every other peer, even not for profits.
Susan Zausner: That is what transpires between us in Hudson, River, Park, trust.
I. Do not think what Susan Zausner: What is recognized is that we pay over$ 400,000 a year out of our operational budget, and that is strictly for maintenance of the up land.
Repairs, now of the pier And we're going to be paying for a part of the Hudson River park that we do not even have any rights to for repairs to that and maintenance, and so that is I.
I do not think that's been Susan, Zausner, Known or recognized, and I just want, I guess, to be able to say that in lieu of friend, it is an expense that Hudson River Park does not have to pay Susan Zausner: And, so they may not receive direct dollars for it,, but instead they're not paying for it, and we are up keeping this peer in its own right.
I do not know any other peer publicly in the Hudson River park.
The fact that the intrepid could not exist without the pier and our Hudson River Park could not exist without its peers.
Our focus has always been about public access to the pier and so Jeffrey LeFrancois- WPE, Co, Chair, JD, Your point is important..
And I also think just recognizing that, as the Intrepid is continuing conversations and looking at least with the Hudson River Park.
That, Hudson, River Park, is responsible for ensuring or doing the best we can to think about people.
You know it's a different periods,, not a landscaped Park pier.
I. Think that is a valid concern for Susan and the park to suggest needs to be considered..
I mean they're, they're the expectations when you get on to appear that has lots of stair towers and other things like that were designed to be able to get people on to the intrepid From.
Do people hide where you know sightlines all those things we talked about for peer 97, Noreen, Doyle,, HRPT, So I am not the business person at all.
I do now,, having worked once for Community Board for a long time ago before the park, that this is a long standing, issue.
Do we get public access to the park, so You know it.
Is people want and need more open space.
The Trust has to be sure that Allen Oster: They're securing the public and the Intrepid But, I think the money thing we maybe, I get it.
I suggest we write a letter to the Hudson River, Park and Susan to JDâ€” MCB4, express our JDâ€” MCB4: Appreciation of the intrepid and Susan's theory of the intrepid, and that we are concerned about the closing of the public part of the pier and we'd like to sit down and talk about it and discuss JDâ€” How to reopen it without JDâ€” MCB4, Harm.
To the intrepid JDâ€”, MCB4: Something, like that,, mainly a discussion and also perhaps involving the Hudson River, Park least I.
Is, it general Park maintenance, you know,, Jeffrey, LeFrancois, WPE, Co, Chair: tree limb, pruning garden, maintenance, sports, fields.
Before, I started, I want to give a shout out to the staff of Hudson River park.
With the park in terms of what the protocol is going to be to safeguard people on the walkway of the bicycle paths and securing security, some of the issues in that site.
Noreen, Doyle, HRPT, Once or,, you know, once or twice every two weeks, and the park does look great.
