They aren't very transparent, So we reached out to social mores office, who decided to take this project on with us We had to building located on the northwest corner at the pier We feel that the historic ship location is much better located kind of on the south east corner of the plan which people will be looking at when I say: So your side of it is the architectural and design side.
The part that was the whole thing and then come across can support Street and really And people were sort of like even construction That way, people know who we are Usually I, wear a suit to a community board: presentation, How many people right your full board meeting last week or the Week before Hundreds The public session had 26 speakers well, Um I'm.
If, the committee wants to unmute, so you can say hello is I'm going to go down our list: Now Everybody will move to the first item on our agenda with a presentation from the Hudson River Park trust regarding the progress of peer, 97, Right Okay pleased to be back here with see before to give an update on our pure 97 project.
Prime go over the changes that we've made to the landscape area in response to the public design, Commission comments, and today we're going to just do a brief recap for the benefit of some of you for the project Just.
You know topographic manipulation that we've introduced in the design Okay- and this may be is what we presented last time as being that the choice that we offer the public Whether or not, you can decide to go directly west towards the end of the pier or go right and find yourself in a more immersive botanical zone that shady lots of visual interest places to sit and read and quiet, We call this.
The open space in the park comes first, And I also wanted to let you know that there's real challenges with this piece of the project We want to have as much flow pedestrian flow in front of the building on the Esplanade.
The panel's themselves are configured in a way to power lighting and are skeptical loads for approximately a 707,600 square foot office And the event that the panels provide more power than is used due to the net metering That power as then funneled back to economy In that case, HR PT is only built by content for the power used or the net power Essentially, that is, net power is building usage, minus PV power production, The South elevation on the top left, looking at a cafe Looking at the edge of the service yard and then the primary East elevation, which is what most people will see from the city and the prominent and the drive their Through, that skyline effect that we've talked about On the west facade of the building, because it's not accessible to the public Looking back from the pier onto the building and really accentuates to the effect of the rotational louvers and that iridescent finish up supplied to them.
This is what viewers would see as they're driving along down the highway As you were at the very head of the pure 97 park itself, We have various flood and point lights that are going to be applied to The underside of the building and along the very top edge of the river running continuously around all four facades When last we presented in November, we had the idea that the historic festival would be located in on the north west corner of the pier You can open up the next slide, Create some water disturbance with awakes, but also puts our historic muscle on a pretty vulnerable spot.
That is the official kind of look of the park and the intent was to try as We described it, to have it match the building instead of overwhelming the building, but just sticking on the regular sign panel But anyway, I'll leave that I'll leave that and no disrespect to the architect and the wonderful, a thoughtful design of that building, but , It's beautiful design up just As It's, very minimum And I- think that's our concern, It's, always reflecting activities on my site and also reflects back the trees in front of it.
So having some chairs at that point might be difficult because it will slow down traffic for people that want to come Down to the end of it It's, just such a lovely spot that people will also want to linger So. It is the good and the bad about having seating right over there, but I'm A place for the weary parents sit while the kid goes up and down a slide for Or as the parent wants to join them because Thank you Which people, Think of that right, Good We, go to the image right at the end of the pier next to the It feels a little bit Like a blank space that might be an opportunity.
I also just want to say, because I haven't had a chance to speak, but No toshiko has said what a complicated site It's going to be A, just a great addition to our park and I as a cyclist My major point is just to echo JD that toddler space has to be lined off from the rest of the playground.
Than Than, what's being used like I, mentioned that supplemental power as then fed back to the grid And, it's actually deducted from HRP to power bill Washington, Square Park has a net metering arrangement and push working with park in Brooklyn has the same thing: So Kevin, then what is because I see there are lights that are going up and down the whole length of the pier We get it that we do incorporate a totally 100% green space You know the power on a sunny Would be enough to power those lights except the lights by definition or on at night.
I Think, you mentioned FDNY access to the roof, but the maintenance needs been taken into account as well for the Solar panel How much space is there at the bottom of the slide to Norman and Madeline that'll sound like another park to them.
Boys are attracted to something which emits lights are transparent, but this is Still has a slight iridescent, but it's not reflective The, cafe signage There's, a limit on the size of the cafe signage, Okay I didn't get a chance to read it because we ran through the slides to quickly I'm fine with the Hudson River Park and the pier 97 sides signs I disagree with JD on that I'm worried about the you know: commercial signage, not so much the park, signage What, we're trying to do by showing the words cafe signage, exactly aware, is kind of like design Well now I'm heading out of the park on the bike.
How narrow is the bike path, because you're going to have the jogger versus bike conflict that we have in the rest of the park of it I'm going to steal one from the committee chair, waterborne transportation component that could work at the site and We're sensitive to not wanting to block us from Milan, among other things, and it's also, if it's you know a more active zone, that the overall periods, design with more activity towards the east and more relaxing towards the west If there is a water taxi or a ferry or whatever, and for the moment there seems to be space for something in the future.
Only thing that will block is the boathouse that 96 If, you have a water taxi or a ferry stop at the far end, I want to make sure that those ships coming in are not going to There's some people from the community boathouse on They have that question when just Jeffrey gets to the public.
This is a great design It looks like there's a different fencing on the north and south side of the pier Kind of fence in the activity area where balls might get thrown into the water.
I understand your your Strategy of not using batteries, because that adds a lot of expense to the building and kind of have to be the buffer, and that actually makes sense to me First of all I worked on the starlight river House Also in my eye before this job I was a chief architect for New York city parks , We're, actually changing the lights on the promenade on the pier to be solar, powered lights Prominent.
The other thing I was going to say is that I know the park need asked for a I'm like a restroom there It may not work really well, but it's something we asked for previously.
I want to applaud the perforated, canopy I think letting a little bit of sunlight through Is, really important in places like this and not full shade Have, we chosen a wood material, I noticed quite a bit of wood and the benching and a particular in the northern sections of the pier, and is that a standard Park?
As you know, we have the money in the state budget to bill the park, a those being referred by government right now and we're part of government We hope that so we are completing the design and we are working with the state to figure out how we can move forward on this project.
That may be something we want to look into in a future meeting with etc, I believe they're, the ones that manage them: here, I think that the Cruise terminals, different than the peers that are in the rest of the park there are DC and environmental regulations around dredging in these areas.
You know finding a way to maybe use the north side of the pier she'll stay put at the pier I mean I'll just start with the point that the park overall was designed for boathouses and historic ships, Obviously at Pier, 96 And throughout the park and throughout the harbor kayaking and Russell's work, You're not open every day a week every hour, the historic vessel might not be either depending on what it is and whether it has to move or not is one of the things that can be considered as that planning continues, With whether we can even bring it to the pier that programmatically It's, very narrow defenders that you can kind of see.
He knows the design of the pier on the north side, how the corners, rounded off- We, are a park of many colors and we We work with the vote, houses and the historic ships, and we somehow managed to incorporate boating and historic ships We would not put a ship there without considering the needs of the boathouse, so This is going to be an ongoing conversation.
We want to bring local school kids near pure 97 out to the fear to discover what lives in the river Your concerns are not unique to this spot and we've basically manage well with all of the other build houses that we have Um I, don't know if we need a letter.
You know it's careful, we're and specialized So, it's being taken off site Have it open Anybody else on the committee Any members of the public The idea of a letter to Korean held on this I moved that we write the letter thanking Corey and Helen for For the funds for the funds to Restore Thank.
You know If, you have anything you wanted to add on that note: Sure I'm in some of our early conversations about the peace and the artists expressed interest in into a raising awareness about the gorilla and using sort of the status of the parks location as a as a way to do so and then engage encourage rather conversation, About about the species and the animal and then basically trying to tie it into by way of how it looks and encouraging people to sit on it and engage with it tying in this sort of sense of community and unity.
The company doesn't want to write a letter, Or I'm on to the next item on our agenda from the Department of sanitation regarding the compost, collection program, River Park has also suspended their compost, collection, So, I, didn't local community gardens a review of access, Lori said, ecology center in Manhattan, There's, really nowhere to compost, Hi, I'm mercy, yanni and then Hadley's on for on community outreach.
I would like a letter on this out of the committee of people would be okay with that Marty To, the administration, with a CC to the Speaker and the sanitation Commissioner Does the funding come from and how much does it?
Hoping to have discussion on that, Which is regarding another of our peers in the Hudson River Park access to pure 86, which of course is inherently hot tied to the intrepid, and we all know the museum and pier in Hell's Kitchen Here was closed as a part of you know the state of being put on pause by the governor, given the fact that we are clamoring for public space and how crowded Hudson River Park is With the park and I believe the President of museum is joining us tonight and the intrepid also submitted a letter to the committee.
Don't think what What is recognized is that we pay over $400,000 a year out of our operational budget, and that is strictly for maintenance of the up land, For security, not to mention a million dollars of insurance that we have to pay ourselves, that we do pay the bike path, folks, that we do pay for the utilities, pier Now of the pier and we're going to be paying for a part of the Hudson River park that we don't even have any rights to for repairs to that and maintenance.
So So we're raising money, That's designated strictly restricted monies for the capital projects to open up space We're trying to protect the visitors, both those who want to come on to the intrepid and just onto the pier We offer free amenities on the pier We have a cafe.
The intrepid apparently says they cannot have maintenance to open up I, don't know any other peer publicly in the Hudson River park.
You know it's a different periods, not a landscaped Park, pier You know basically for lots of people to come on to it, Principal a for the purpose of the museum, but also for views and other things like that.
Do people hide where you know sightlines all those things we talked about for peer 97, So I am not the business person at all Please I do now having worked once for Community Board for a long time ago before the park that this is a long standing issue.
You know it is people want and need more open space right now.
The Trust has to be sure that They're securing the public and the intrepid, But I think the money thing we it Is that a burden in this in this time for somebody in accounting to come up with something Um we have the ranch information relatively readily accessible, but, as Susan said, there are other, you know, who's responsible for maintaining appears who's responsible for other aspects of security or whatever that vary from place to place.
