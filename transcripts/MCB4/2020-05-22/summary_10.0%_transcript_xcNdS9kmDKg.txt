So I think actually made the project better We've added to shoot for Maureen architect to the team to help develop the building.
So we reached out to social mores office, who decided to take this project on with us We had to building located on the northwest corner at the pier.
We feel that the historic ship location is much better located, kind of on the south east corner of the plan which people will be looking at when I say: So your side of it is the architectural and design side.
The committee has had an opportunity to ask clarifying questions, much like we run our regular practice when we're all next to each other in person.
A member of the public, wants to ask a question or make a brief statement on an agenda.
Everybody will move to the first item on our agenda with a presentation from the Hudson River Park trust.
Since then, we've been to the public design Commission received it positively,, but to give us some minor comments that I think made the project, a little better.
Prime go over the changes that we've made to the landscape area in response to the public design, Commission comments.
So we've had a good amount of Time spent with the community So far, everybody's received this project with open, arms.
Just wanted to point out that the actual project boundary includes the frontage is in front of pure 98 and 99 here, 98, being Con, Edison and pure 99 being DS, and why the Department of sanitation and we're doing improvements, alone, matzoh A quarter as well.
This is what we presented last time as being that the choice that we offer the public, Whether or not, you can decide to go directly west, towards the end of the pier or go right and find yourself in a more immersive botanical zone that shady lots of visual interest places to sit and read and quiet.
11 foot overlook down to the lower portion of the park inside this wooded zone and You're able to, you know, come back up to the top of the stairs.
I wanted the community board to be aware of is that we analyze every square foot of this building to make sure that it was really needed.
The open space in the park comes first.
Our aspiration for this site is to come up with An elegant building which, in our mind, conceptually exists between sky, a water, and it will have a mutable quality,, which means that, instead of having something solid, And, something a heavy on the site to have a light, quality materiality is important in so that we choose the material in design in which reacts with different condition of light.
The North elevation, and just to the right of that, looking at the edge of the service yard and then the primary East elevation,, which is what most people will see from the city and the prominent and the drive their.
That skyline effect that we've talked about On the west facade of the building, because it's not accessible to the public.
And wanted to be sure that community board saw that before we see the renderings, because the still renderings will seem a little silver to, but actually it's a very dynamic kind of subtle, color, so sorry.
That can be seen from the prominent as well as driving south along the highway, and this building really acts as a beacon, and a way to introduce not only this project, but the overall park system.
This is a view from the highway as we drive South sinker 97 for the first time with the signage of Hudson River Park.
We have various flood and point lights that are going to be applied to The underside of the building and along the very top edge of the river running continuously around all four facades.
Looking, project, and So it'll allow people to slide quite quickly down at the bottom.
But I can give you the starting point,, which is that the park was designed with the concept of kind of vegans at major entrances and pure 97 being the northernmost kind of public pier in the park.
So we're avoiding dense, conifers and plants that obscure Your line of sight from around three feet to about five feet,, which is where most people can, you know, perceive a you know a person in the distance, so that you're able to, you know,, Survey your room as you as you travel across the pier and for the area that you're, referring to with regard to seating.
What we're calling the Overlook, which was that area that gives you the view over The, far west side of the pier and under the Hudson River in the distance.
So having some chairs at that point might be difficult because it will slow down traffic for people that want to come Down to the end of it.
Which people, Think of that right, We, go to the image right at the end of the pier next to the It feels a little bit Like a blank space that might be an opportunity.
You can't see in this particular view, is a door that allows O and M staff to access that for rakes and rooms and Carts Oh, also, I'm by mental programming staff would dearly love the spot where they don't have to carry their fishing rods and pop up tents and everything else that they use for education programs up and down the park.
You know, I, hear JD his comment that it feels corporate, but I think this is actually a very subtle design and Full disclosure, I'm.
Aspect of our team, looks at any design before the community obviously sees anything or before we send anything out because of things like you're all asking The surface, and we have asked that question.
So working with operations in the plan, is to basically wash it from the, from the roof, and it's accessible from I Panels, coming right down to the sidewalk level, Um,, so you're not seeing a final absolute design.
We have to leave some space for FDNY access and things like that nature for us,, you know, we're early in the design phase,, but our studies show Like I, mentioned, the.
I've, now heard two things that the roof is going to be used toward they're, going to be solar panels up there,, but the maintenance staff needs access to clean the building.
How much space is there at the bottom of the slide to Norman and Madeline that'll sound like another park to them.
Okay, I didn't get a chance to read it because we ran through the slides to quickly I'm fine with the Hudson River Park and The, pier 97 sides.
Now I'm heading out of the park on the bike, It looks like there's a nice separation between the boardwalk area and the bike.
Only thing that will block is the boathouse that 96 If, you have a water taxi or a ferry, stop at the far end, I want to make sure that those ships coming in are not going to.
It looks like there's a different fencing on the north and south side of the pier.
My second question is about the Building and it looked In. You know, in that area.
Other thing I was going to say is that I know the park need asked for a I'm like a restroom there So it may not work really well,, but it's something we asked for previously.
I want to applaud the perforated canopy, I think,, letting a little bit of sunlight through Is, really important in places like this and not full shade.
Mr will be brief and we have the money to build this and when will it starts, and my third point: is,: Well, as you know, we have the money in the state budget to bill the park, A As, you also know, there's a Huge amount, Of pain,, those being referred by government right now And we're part of government And We're suffering it.
I, don't know how deep they went,, but that is another option for water taxis on the Hudson River Park.
I think that the Cruise terminals, different than the peers that are in the rest of the park there are DC and environmental regulations around dredging in these areas.
No, I mean, I'll just start with the point that the park overall was designed for boathouses and historic ships.
Obviously at Pier, 96 And throughout the park and throughout the harbor, kayaking and Russell's work.
He knows the design of the pier on the north side, how the corners rounded off- That's, really where we wanted it,, but it just wasn't going to work with the content.
We just need to make sure everything is in place with our funding,, given the current state of the city's budget,, but something that we're going to work out.
I hope we can write a letter thanking Corey and Helen for the funds for this, because this is a wonderful piece of public art.
Moving to city parks to present on the temporary public, art exhibition coming to Bella Abzug park in the summer of 2020 Also referred to as Hudson Boulevard area around Hudson Yards,, and we have A brief presentation on that.
And I'm, here also with Nicole from the Hudson Yards Hell's Kitchen alliance, to share just a brief informational Presentation with you about a temporary public art project that will be coming to Bella.
You like to issue a letter of support, if you so need,, but we don't require it.
Or I'm on to the next item on our agenda from the Department of sanitation regarding the compost, collection, program, suspension for I'm sure they're going to get into this,, but The city stopped,, not just curbside composting.
I would like a letter on this out of the committee of people would be okay with that Marty To, the administration, with a CC to the Speaker and the sanitation, Commissioner.
I guess I just want to register an objection that there are many other things that the representation is responsible for Including streets weeping and that seems to have no problem roaring back to life and then turn back off, um, you know, Um,, so I listen, I'd, be writing the letter.
Which, is regarding another of our peers in the Hudson River Park access to pure 86, which of course is inherently hot tied to the intrepid, and we all know the museum and pier in Hell's Kitchen..
You know, the state of being put on pause by the governor,, given the fact that we are clamoring for public space and how crowded Hudson River Park is With, the park.
Think you have that this slide to have the slide accessible from the working group,, the other people who don't pay rent for the pier or the community, boathouse Who else was.
Now of the pier And we're going to be paying for a part of the Hudson River park that we don't even have any rights to for repairs to that and maintenance, and so that is I, don't.
I, don't think that's been Known or recognized, and I just want, I guess, to be able to say that in lieu of friend, it is an expense that Hudson River Park does not have to pay And, so they may not receive direct dollars for it , I understand what you're saying,, but take, for example, pure 57, which are XR, has a master lease for they are responsible for the entire upkeep of the pier.
Both those who want to come on to the intrepid and just onto the pier.
I, don't know any other peer publicly in the Hudson River park.
The fact that the intrepid couldn't exist without the pier and our Hudson River Park couldn't exist without its peers.
Our focus, has always been about public access to the pier and Your point is important.
Um, You, know, I think that the fact That Hudson River Park is responsible for ensuring or doing the best we can to think about people.
You know it's a different periods,, not a landscaped, Park, pier.
You know, basically for lots of people to come on to it.
The expectations when you get on to appear that has lots of stair towers and other things like that were designed to be able to get people on to the intrepid are different and From our Perspective running security.
Please I do now,, having worked once for Community Board for a long time ago, before the park, that this is a long standing, issue.
Do we get public access to the park , You know it is people want and need more open space.
You know, The security, issues, I think is very important.
I. Think with the intrepid in terms of Getting access for the public.
The Trust has to be sure that They're securing the public and the intrepid, But, I think the money thing we maybe, I get it.
All that I think the parks department's budget is about.
We can have With the park in terms of what the protocol is going to be to safeguard people on the walkway of the bicycle paths and securing security, some of the issues in that site.
Once or, you know, once or twice every two weeks, and the park does look great.
