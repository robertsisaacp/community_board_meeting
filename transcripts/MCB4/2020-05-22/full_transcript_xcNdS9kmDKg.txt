Hello. Hi there. Hi,. How are you Man Thanks. How are you, I'm, Good,, thanks., Hi., Janine. You must be an expert during this. Are you I'm? Not entirely.. I still have a few things that I'm, like so got to work through We were very stressed when we did our first board meeting. Yeah., No,, yeah,, full board meeting was pretty.. We had a lot of participants and it was very stressful. Yeah, we're getting the hang of it. Yeah. Good. Maybe. It will call you before the next one to get some tips. Okay. So. Do you want to run through One of the icy most of our team? Here. So, Evan. Do. You want Evans connecting Janine. I, think you've met Kevin Yes,, that's not coming Out. All Kevin and Evan are doing 97, principally and Rashid can talk about the historic vessel side of it and to Me and David Sharpe Ratio bear Okay. Dinner you Are from the architecture side of your 97, so we've tried to script. This Kevin,. You want to search For. Let me just get the lighting just right. Marvelous. I'm, so pleased to be back here received before to give an update on our peer 97 project. I'm, assuming you can hear me: okay, Yeah,, I, can., Yeah., Yes. Welcome to my home office, bedroom. When. We last work together on this project. In November, we presented a schematic level, design. Sense., Since then,, we've been to the public design Commission, who received positively give some minor, comments. So I think actually made the project better We've added to shoot for Maureen architect to the team to help develop the building. And. We also have some new information regarding the historic ship. Location. So. What we're going to do is begin by having melt per design prime go over the changes that we've made to the landscape and response to the PTC comments, so that even for milk taken away., Yep. Do, you want to do a dry run. Now. I was just planning on telling Janine to next.. And I see ready to see the presentation. Yeah, I've reviewed it already. I'm comfortable with the pace of it. So I'll just indicate next Okay,. Let me just put it up to see,, make sure it works. You, don't want to work out some elaborate hand. Signal., No,, I. Think it's easier. Just Everyone can see if I'm Yes. And, then you say you want to run through the first couple of slides, quickly. We're, probably going to run through the whole design recap rather quickly., So You, know 10 minutes or less. Okay. Okay,, so not work, so we're good with that. There's. Someone on that says that has my name. On the screen. If you could just rename yourself. So I'm going to do the segway between the afternoon. Talk about the entry mount and then it will say conference station and then I'll give my few words about the building. Before I introduce the architect,, which toshiko are you presenting and is it David The plan for now? Is that to she goes gonna have a few opening remarks on the first slide and then we'll transition to me and I will present the rest of the bulk of the comfort station. Okay. Just, since we have a little bit of time, I'll. Tell you what I'm going to say. First, real quick, reminder,, the program, aggressors, walk up, concession, etc. Want you to be sure that we analyze every square foot to make sure the building as small as it could be. Once. You know the challenges with this piece of the project. Number 100, floodplain. We want to have as much flow for pedestrians in front of the building on the Esplanade And. The uses like a bathroom utility, space. They aren't very transparent. So all this could add up to, you know,. We were concerned about the building. ending up being very heavy, very opaque. In. This example, aren't. We wanted a building that has a presence,, but it's light something noticeable, but doesn't dominate. Something that recognizes the industrial context, but kind of rises. Above it not an easy task. So we reached out to social mores office, who decided to take this project on with us and she's, going to walk you through how she answers the challenge. And. That's what she could say: Here it is. Yeah, so, so to speak, or, like I, mentioned, that our plan at that point is for you to give a brief introduction. Yes, I think what we Introduction and David is going to carry so all the details. Okay. I'm upon the end of the building renderings, that we switch to historic, vessel. See,, which I'm basically going to say, you know, one last you saw this in the schematically schematic level,. We had to building located on the northwest corner at the pier. We've since found out that, because of the Con Edison barges that frequently go in there and the view is not very nice at all. We feel that the historic ship location is much better located, kind of on the south east corner of the plan which people will be looking at when I say: this, And, then, I, don't know, I, guess, flashy,, you can Talk. I, don't know.. I would just end it like that and say,. Do you have any questions about that. I? Think Kevin? Maybe your intro is,, you know,. So your side of it is the architectural and design side. And. We have rushy Puri here from our office who has been running. The RFP is for the historic muscles and she can update you on that. Hey, Jeff. Hi everybody. How. Are you guys doing, how Are you Hello here. I, see if I made me chuckle. When I came on. That was great. Right. And, then I was just going to give an overview of the RFP process and where we are in it. And. That's brief and then.. Yeah. Yes. Mm, hmm. I biked down to me packing this morning. This is not my apartment. This is my very large I moved to my office to the conference room today., Yeah,, right. It was really nice. Um, and we launched open streets here and the district today. Um,. We did. Three streets. We did 17th STREET, FROM, eighth to 10th, Avenue. Okay, then little West, 12 from nine to Washington and 13th night to Washington. So small blocks. But, it's kind of a pilot to see what else will work. That's great, and to 12 seven years us right So. We wanted to see what connections we could make. The part that was the whole thing and then come across can support Street and really. So. That's what the city knows. My goal is around it. And people were sort of like even construction. Crews were like,. Oh, is this. For the thing. And I was like, yeah. I'm like, wow. So I'm going, it'll be,, you know, every day, we'll see what happens. So, yeah. Technology. Wonderful. Hi everybody. Janine. This is Evan William from Hudson River Park. How are you, I'm Good,. How are you All, right. Um,? Do you have the video clip that I sent you. Yes,? Let me Um,. Did you try opening and I just want to make sure that it works. Yeah, it's a it's a video of like a square Yeah yeah Great., Thank, you. That's, intended to intrigue you all the video of the square. Data when you're giving when you're presenting you can just say, you know,. Whenever you're ready, showed a video clip. That sounds good. Hello. Check, your email. Hi, Judy., Hi,, Leslie. Nice to see you guys., If I'm! If you wouldn't mind, if you have the ability If, you take your mouse over your name. Other little dots up there and just keep your name,, but then add, maybe dash MC before or CV for member,. So that way, people know who we are.. Usually I, wear a suit to a community board: presentation. Always Kevin, you're, forgiven. They, don't work. I, see multiple new CP for members. Hi,, everybody. If. You could just talk to your mouse over your picture and you'll see the little dots at the top just rename yourself with your name and then perhaps Phoebe Foreman number MC before That. We folks know who we are. Welcome Jenny, pretend Everybody's. Come on, as Janine this evening. She's, very popular. Like Hollywood, Squares, But,, huh. How many people right your full board meeting last week or the Week before Hundreds. We had a session. The public session had 26 speakers well, Um, And! Then we had, we had A photo. Almost, almost call attendance. But we, it was,. It was a popular one. No one has anywhere else to go. Environment Committee meeting. My name is Jeffrey. Look friend, spa. I'm, the co chair, proud, co, chair of this committee, and it's our first meeting of this committee in two months. Will, be taking the agenda item by item as its laid out, and I'm going to open the meeting with some guidelines that we, as a board, have taken up based on the governor's executive order and also based on the practices, we've undertaken since we've gone virtual As per the governor's executive order,. We are running this community board meeting remotely and it's being recorded and transcribed. A recording of this meeting is being posted on our boards. Youtube page, as we present will run this meeting generally as follows. Everybody. Besides the speaker or presenter, should and will stay muted throughout the meeting, members of the public who have joined through the online link will be asked. Will, be able to ask questions and or make a brief statement on an item after the presentation and after the committee has had an opportunity to ask clarifying questions, much like we run our regular practice when we're all next to each other in person. After. The presentation is over. I'll inquire. If the committee has any clarifying questions, I'm committee members will signify,, they have a good question by pressing the raised hand, key. Which you can find when you click on the participants tab next to your Section. Next to your name. See here. We could also you can request to speak through the chat button as well. That actually no correction only use the raise hand feature. We're on zoom not go to meeting. Section It's okay, thank you. Um,. After all, committee questions have been answered,, I will take. Questions is taken from the public. As. A member of the committee will report on any testimony or correspondence that MC before meeting has received. Beforehand. I will note that stuff this evening. If, a member of the public, wants to ask a question or make a brief statement on an agenda. Item. They will also need to press the raise hand button on zoom Or requests, or is it star nine for those of us who don't have it? Video Exactly. That would be star nine on the phone when correct. Thank you. Right. Will allow each Member to speak of each member of the public to speak, unmuted and put them back on mute. I'm Following. The public comment portion. That committee will begin their discussion and we'll conclude the discussion with the votes. On. The recommendation. My goal for this to simplify the boat will be to ask if there's any objections or if there's any abstentions or President eligible and hearing likely expecting us to be few it'll make the boat,, hopefully more efficient. When the agenda is finished,. We will adjourn, and we'll close out this Meeting accordingly. Janine level. Did I miss anything on the overall there. I, don't think so. Nothing. So with that, I'm, going to Introduce the committee first to my co, chair. I'm, who I can't find in my Hollywood Squares right: now., Um,, but, Marty to cats. Thank you,, Marty. Um,. If the committee wants to unmute, so you can say, hello, is I'm going to go down our list: now. Waving. That's good., That's, fine., I'm, Leslie, Murphy., Hi, guys., Thank, you,, Gwen, billick, Here. Marty,. We've got you. I'm Tina DC Not that hard differently, San Antonio. It stopped. As. Soon, as I said: it. I'm, Brett., Yeah., It's, 45, 32nd, Sally, Greenspan, Hi, everyone., Hi, Sally., David., Hello., Hi, everyone., Thank, you., Crystal., Crystal brought us here., Hi, I'm, just correcting. My name is that we ever see me again. Thank, you., I, AM, HERE,, JOHN, Danielle., Hello, everybody., Thank, you,, Alan., Really nice to see everyone, Thank you,, Brad. Are, you here., Good, evening,, present., Oh,, good., Um, and that is Rhonda is not here. So with that,. Thank you. Everybody will move to the first item on our agenda with a presentation from the Hudson River Park trust regarding the progress of peer, 97, Right. Okay, pleased to be back here with see before to give an update on our pure 97 project. Welcome to my home office, bedroom. When. We were last together on this project. In November, we presented a schematic level, design. Since then, we've been to the public design Commission received it positively,, but to give us some minor comments that I think made the project, a little better. And we've added toshiko morning, architects to the team to develop the building component. And we've also have some new information regarding the historic ship, location. So. What we're going to do is we'll begin by having melt card design. Prime go over the changes that we've made to the landscape area in response to the public design, Commission comments. And. So with that, Ian. If. You could turn your bit Right. Hello everyone. Nice, to see you all again hope everyone is well. Last time we met with, you was back in November and today we're going to just do a brief recap for the benefit of some of you for the project. Next slide please. Just, to give you some context, again, of where this project is. This is more for the benefit of the Republic tuning and now this project is in the northern most extent of the Hudson River Park. nestled between Clinton Cove and the southern side of Riverside Park South, pretty much in alignment with West 57th Street., Next, slide. It's, also proximate to Central Park of 15 minutes, walk uphill. And, it's also near other community amenities, such as with Clinton Park, Gertrude, elderly recreation center and thinking center., Next, slide., Next, slide. So. This is the running tally of the public engagement that we've done with the community. To date, may 14 is today.. So we've had a good amount of Time spent with the community and we Feel, like you know. We know all of you, well. And, so far, everybody's received this project with open arms. And, we're thrilled about that. Excellent. So. Just to give you a recap of the schematic, design. That, you saw last time we were together in November. Next slide. This was the instill, is the most recent design scheme. You can see here. 97 highlighted at the bottom. Peers 9899 to the north. Just wanted to point out that the actual project boundary includes the frontage is in front of pure 98 and 99 here, 98 being Con, Edison and pure 99 being DS, and why the Department of sanitation and we're doing improvements alone, matzoh A quarter as well. Excellent., Some components,, just to zoom in here. Going from east to west,, which means on this picture going from right to left,. We have an entry Plaza, a place scape for children. And activity field size for you, seven activities, flexible gathering area salon, sunset deck Belvedere, and an overlook programmatically. The park is designed to have all of the Sports and activity, a program justified to the east,. With more of the park and immersive program to the west. Next slide. This is a bird's eye view. Looking towards the Northeast from the Hudson River. You can see all the,. You know, topographic manipulation that we've introduced in the design. Next slide. And. This is showing the entry to the children's play escape from the upland. So if you're walking, you know down south work from here 98 and you You know, coming towards the entrance of pure 97,, this will be one of the possible addresses that you could take, you know,. If you have children, for instance. Next slide. This is a bird's eye view of that place, scape showing in the foreground. A, splash pad and water feature for children, young children, toddlers and older children. Next slide. This is another bird's eye view. As we start to walk, west. This is showing the activity field size for you., Seven., Next, slide. In can interrupt you for one. Second, on that color scheme, which you're going to be using as you're going to be a Bluefield. Yes Thank you. Okay, and this may be some of you remember. This is what we presented last time as being that the choice that we offer the public Whether or not, you can decide to go directly west, towards the end of the pier or go right and find yourself in a more immersive botanical zone that shady lots of visual interest places to sit and read and quiet. Next slide. So. If you move into that, more secluded, zone. We call this the flexible gathering, space, you'll, see the canopy structures that we introduced to you last time.. You're able to you know either continue your journey,, you know, to the left,. You could go walk up the stairs to the Belvedere. Next slide. This is showing you know. One way to get up to the Belvedere.. This is a seating area. That's about seven feet higher than the base of the stairs. Excellent. You're, also able to get up to that Belvedere through a slope to walkway. That goes around the backside of the flexible gathering, space. Next, slide. And. That takes you to the exact same location. So. We have an intentional convergence of circulation at the top of the stair and at the top of the slope walkway to get you the exact location. And, then what you have is either a sunlight choose from to lay in through relaxin or you could sit and read and Sunday, you know, via lounge chairs that we have designed along the, the northern edge there a suitable for tandem seating, and you know, groups and children and whatnot. And. Then, if you continue walking down towards the west. Next slide, please. We have the Overlook and the Overlook is another elevated area. That's about 11 feet higher than the than the surface down below. And. This gives you a beautiful panoramic view of the Hudson River to the north west and south. Next slide. And. Then here we have another bird's eye view. Looking towards the northeast of the project. Again,. You can see the Midtown skyline in the background and tip of the belt and typically overlooked in the foreground. Next And. If you recall, we designed that adult slide, which is we imagine, is going to be quite popular for children and grownups like. Next slide. Showing, you how,, you know,. You could get down quickly from that. 11 foot overlook down to the lower portion of the park inside this wooded zone and you're able to, you know, come back up to the top of the stairs here. Excellent. Some, more of us looking towards the Northwest. Next slide. Next slide. And. Then this is the sunset deck,, which has movable tables and chairs. It's, also elevated about two feet above the surrounding landscape. It has a rack to get to it,, which is Ada, accessible and also seating, edges integrated into our planters. Next slide. Canopy designs. So. Part of the reason why we're back with you today is because we've had to make an adjustment to our canopies. As we mentioned before,, we were still under PTC review. Last time, we've since been to PTC they've, given us some of their comments for the canopies. Next slide. And. As you recall, We were showing last time. Next slide. Can it be designed that was basically a undulating Undulating faceted form. Next slide. Next slide. Excellent. Okay, next slide. And. Essentially what PVC. PVC came back to us with comments was really about the structure and about maintenance. So. We took those considerations to our next slide. And. We developed a new structural system based on a tetrapod. This tetrapod is much more efficient. Next slide. What it allows us to do is depending on what's necessary for the particular condition,, whether that be Christian of heights. Manipulation of shade were able to manipulate these tetrapods, in order to efficiently create that desired. Effect. Next slide. And, then here you can see on the top of the structural support the tetrapods, and on the bottom. The same with the canopy on top of the skin. The perforated, a perforated roof. If you'd like to think of it like that., Next, slide. In. Here you see the results. So it's different than you saw last time, but similar in vain. Where,. It still keeps the same, the same notion of angularity and articulation,, perhaps even more articulated now. And. We're pleased with it. So. We hope the community also likes it as well. Excellent. This is a view in the flex gathering space, looking back towards the stair. Next slide. This is a view. If you're sitting beneath it and effective, you know, the dappled light that would be created by the perforated canopy overhead. Next line. This is at the top of the stairs looking towards the this integrated seating with half of it covered by Shane by these objects. Excellent. And. If you again looking towards the Northeast, showing the effects of the canopy over the seating, area. Next slide. Looking towards the south. Another reason why we're showing this to you today is an update to the country. Mountain. Excellent. If, you recall,. We had an idea for a sculptural entry mount that was planted colloquially BE CALLED, IT, THE, TREE, base., Next, slide. And. You can see why we called it. The tree, base. Next, slide. This was intended to anchor and be an identifiable marker. As. You enter the project. This also went under PVC review. They had some comments to us. And we've made some revisions. Next slide., primarily related to maintenance. So. We went back spoke with a Sharpie and we now have another option. That's still serves as a as an anchor,, but in a different way. Next slide. Please. You can see here. This is the new configuration. It's, an almost exactly the same location. Next, slide. The difference now is that, rather than having a an arc, mound, we,, you know, took the Vocabulary of boulders that are found throughout the place scape and we brought them out, you know, into this elements into the entry mount feature that creates a bit of a continuity between these, these two areas, which works quite well., Next, slide. And. In terms of components. We have the sculptural boulders that sit on the inside, right,, surrounded by planting low shrubs and also over story trees, and now we even have a seat. Wall. So. It's a place, also for people to sit upon entry to the park. Next line. And. You can see here that it's still has, you know, the same. The same you know presence at the entry,, although a bit different. Right. But, nevertheless, it,, it fits within the vocabulary of the park and still suitably serves as a as an entrance to peer 97., Next slide. And. Here you can see a little preview of the comfort station that you'll see next. Next slide. This is looking towards, towards the Northwest,. That's the route, nine A in the background and via 57. Next slide. And. They have it. Okay., It's, Kevin,, again, I just want to say a few words about the building. Before. We introduce toshiko morning, who's, the architect for the building. First,. Just a quick reminder of what the program is program is a public restrooms, a lock up concession, meaning no interior, seating, area., Maintenance and office maintenance office in yard and a utility room for the various pumps meters and things that we need to drive the pier and the buildings. So,. One important thing I wanted the community board to be aware of is that we analyze every square foot of this building to make sure that it was really needed. For us. The open space in the park comes first. So. We really struggled to make this As efficient to plan as possible. So I wanted to be sure. You knew that we did. And I also wanted to let you know that there's real challenges with this piece of the project. It's, not an easy task to put a building. Here. Number one,, it's in a floodplain. And number two,. We want to have as much flow pedestrian flow in front of the building on the Esplanade, so we have a pretty narrow, long building And the uses of the building, building like the bathroom, and they told the space. They. Don't lend themselves to a lot of windows. It's. A pretty. It could be a pretty opaque, building. So. We were concerned about ending up with a heavy opaque building between all the windows rooms and the flood proofing. So. This is not what we want. What we want is a building that has a presence,, but it's pretty light something noticeable,, but it doesn't dominate the park. And, something that recognizes the kind of industrial context, but kind of rises above it. So. This is not an easy task. So. What we did was we reached out to social mores office, who is pretty well known for making really elegant buildings out of challenging circumstances. And. She agreed to take on the task so toshiko mores, offices,, a new member to the team for you guys but she's been on board. Since January, and she will walk you through her solution to our building problem. Thank, you. Thank, you very much, and I. Thank you very much for meeting us tonight. In this difficult circumstances. I have everybody's staying healthy and safe. So. When we receive this assignment and to be invited to be part of a team., We were actually I. Delighted To see that the other conference station, which is probably in one of the most prominent location in the world or waterfront on 57th Street sandwich bi triangle, is amazing: vs, 57 West and then also the conference station. The conference station next to a Con Ed. Institutions, going to conduct facilities and also next to the West Side Highway. So. It's very challenging site. And also,. This is where had some Park starts. So. It has to Be a marker. But. At the same time, it needs to have a transition quality between all these elements,. It has to have a presence, but also be a background to amazing activities that milk has produced for the park next slides. Please This is okay, so it really shows us location as it is now. A white, Rectangle and I think we can go through with you in detail how we arrived at the scheme, but just to show you. Our aspiration for this site is to come up with An elegant building which, in our mind, conceptually exists between sky, a water, and it will have a mutable quality,, which means that, instead of having something solid, And something a heavy on the site to have a light, quality materiality is important in so that we choose the material in design in which reacts with different condition of light different climate,. It will have a different Profile, meaning features, expressions on cloudy day. It will look very different on sunny day and I. Wish. Is that the building,, which might look a little bit like a mirage in sometimes On, Hudson River? In a foggy day, you have a little bit of mirage.. It looks like a presence, but disappears. It comes up. So. We were really helping to achieve some more phenomenal, like building To come so it will actually command attention,, but in a sense it's background and expression of features is more fleeting and then you will experience and see it fresh,, as it goes through different time or day in different seasons. Next slide. Please. So, the building programs. We have a public restrooms walk up. Cafe climbing room for Park infrastructure conference station maintenance, shop and service backyard and field office. So. It is a utilitarian building. And I think our challenge is to how to make it arrogant and attractive,, but it's incredibly functional and robust ability in a floodplain., And, David you're barred from our office associate now offices, project architect,. He will take you through the building in detail to show you how we plan to achieve this. Effect. Next slide. Please. Hi everyone., I'm David with to she goes office actually mentioned and after the overview from Chico. I can take us through the details of the conference station for the The next group of slides, here. So. What we're looking at here is a brief plan and elevation view of the project on the east, facade of the building. And to speak to, to chicos point little bit. The concept for the building was to allow each of the different program. Areas of the building. Tap be reflected in their own volumes for the project, rather than having one large box. This allows the building to be broken down to a smaller scale that relates to humans, a little bit more, and also allows the building to reflect the quality of the skyline, and the city. So. You can see looking from left to right on the building elevation. Moving from the cafe bathroom plumbing Broomfield office, maintenance, shop and service yard that there's a change in heights here, so The function of the building is reflected in the way that it's organized,, which allows it to have a very individual quality and the facade of the building. Will be wrapped with aluminum panels, which have a very macro reflective quality. Which allows it to pick up different lighting. Qualities. So like to shoot, was mentioning on a cloudy day. It might be a little bit more subtle and on a sunny day,, it can pick up different lighting qualities, The reflectivity,, as Matt. So. We don't anticipate any overly right reflections or anything of the like. And. In addition to the building envelope itself,, there is liver system that wraps around all four facades of the building. Which ties those individual volumes together into a cohesive, whole. And. These louvers are rotated in a way that change their angles. Which allow a bit of visibility through some of the volumes that are lowered and some arrays. So. It's a bit of a scrim That provides some capacity and some transparency and these movers will be surface with a very interesting color.. That is iridescent so from certain angles, they will appear slightly more grayish and from certain angles, they will appear more bluish and we'll be able to show you some of that and images, a little bit further into the presentation. So. If we can go to the next slide. Now we're all staring at you., Janine., Little, bit. Give me one moment., Okay. Great,, that's perfect., So to change gears a little bit from the design over the project and to jump straight into the details. One of the more unique Aspects of the project is the fact that it is in a flood zone very close to the edge of Manhattan on the edge of fact. So as a result,. The building doesn't need to be dry, flood proofs. And. That's a flood proofing strategy. That means we keep all the water out of the building. Next slide, please. And. The way we're achieving that are these individual flood barriers shown in green here on the slide that are installed in front of each of the openings of the building. Those are doors and windows. And in order to Get out of the building and the event of a flood. There's, also a temporary stare, that is stored in the building. That is installed that you can use to essentially walk over and down one of the Flood barriers there fairly high to account for the flood elevation,, which is six feet. So. That is a unique aspect of the project and they're intended to be employed in a fairly quick time when a flood is anticipated or comes on., Next slide. Please. One of the other aspects of the project that we're very happy about is the inclusion of solar panels that are installed in a net metering. Configuration. The panel's themselves are configured in a way to power lighting and are skeptical loads for approximately a 707,600 square foot office. Space. And the event that the panels provide more power than is used due to the net metering. That power as then funneled back to economy. And back into the grid and no batteries or additional equipment are needed for this. So in that case, HR PT is only built by content for the power used or the net power. So essentially,, that is, net power, is building usage, minus PV power, production. Next slide. Please. This is just a brief overview of the elevations of the building. The South elevation on the top left, looking at a cafe, and I will be on the south side of the building. The North elevation, and just to the right of that, looking at the edge of the service yard and then the primary East elevation,, which is what most people will see from the city and the prominent and the drive their. Next slide. Please. And. Here's a little bit more detail about the configuration of the louvers on the north east and south facades. The louvers start at 12 feet above grade., The, louvers start at the very bottom in a flat configuration. And as you move up through the louvers. They each rotate incrementally to an angle of about 60 degrees. This provides a really nice balance of transparency and opacity, and it does allow you to see through the louvers beyond to the envelope of the building. As well as through the building and the locations where the roof is lowered. Through that skyline effect that we've talked about On the west facade of the building, because it's not accessible to the public. We've decided to carry the louvers all the way down to the base of the building,, which we think provides a very Nice view. Looking back from the pier onto the building and really accentuates to the effect of the rotational louvers and that iridescent finish up supplied to them. Next slide please. Here's a little detail about the facade panels, themselves. It's, aluminum cloud, material., It's, essentially aluminum composite that has aluminum on two sides and a composite insulating material on the inside. It's. A very durable and security material. The panelists are flexible, so we're able to design those in a way that are able to wrap in a very consistent manner across the different volumes of the project. Next slide. Please. These are a couple of different angles. Looking at the materials for the aluminum composite material. Similar to what she could was speaking about with the building changing its appearance,, depending on your point of view and the time of day. The angle that you're looking at the aluminum just due to the very Matt reflective quality, allows the building to take on some of the color of the environment as well as your point of view. Next slide please. And. This is a rough mock up from the Louvre manufacturer Just, showing a typical configuration of how they are applied to the building envelope and their rotational effects. And. These are all unfinished,, but just looking for the basic geometric qualities and on the left. We also have a brief swatch of the hairdresser color,, which I think we can look at a little bit more detail. Next, next slide. Please. And here are a couple of photographs of the iridescent material. So, again,. Depending on your point of view,, the material can look a little bit. Gray. When, you rotate the material,, which also happens just inherently due to the rotation of the louvers and their curved surfaces,. You get a very different color., depending on your point of view. And I think we also have a video that we can pull up to show the changing effect of this year. Lesson: material. Yeah,, maybe one second., So I, think the idea is to have it has a blue tint to it,, but it also has a gray is in has a little bit of both. So some. It really works with the coloration of a Skype. For, some reason, Maybe. We have to verbally explain it. So one reason. The. Second louvers is more front door. Open. You can see into the building it closes download it,, but which actually allows you to see through into the sky. So that the color of a louvers and kind of a sky can be blended in that point. So. It's. How it turns is that it actually creates the illusion that you're really looking at And, not frankly,, but when you're looking up- and we hope that the Louvre is somehow is going to blend into the sky. And somewhat disappear and gives a very soft horizontal edge on top of the building. Maybe I can help explain what this poker is What. This is magic paint. Basically,. It changes color depending on how you look at That's, great. I, think that goes a great overview of the changing color of the lower panels. Thanks for loading that video. And wanted to be sure that community board saw that before we see the renderings, because the still renderings will seem a little silver to, but actually it's a very dynamic kind of subtle, color, so sorry. Toshi, Yeah, I, think if we can get the presentation back,, we can proceed. So. You can move on to the next slide,, which sits in full screen. So to hear today we're going to speak a little bit briefly about the signage as a standard with the other Hudson River Park projects. We identified a building. What the standard typographic and language has seen throughout the rest of the park. On, the south facade, we identify the specific pure, pure 97 and on the north side of the building. We have the overall Hudson River Park signage. That can be seen from the prominent as well as driving south along the highway, and this building really acts as a beacon, and a way to introduce not only this project, but the overall park system. Due to the Louvre configuration on this project and the way that it wraps around the facade,. We had the opportunity to basically create some unique signage. Rather than applying, you know, standard sign over the louvers we've integrated the signage directly into the louvers With, a basically a colored material that slips around the geometry of them. So. It's a very integrated approach that blends in with the specific building, rather than just something that's applied to the facade. Next slide please. And. Here we also have signage for the cafe itself,. This will be something that will be determined by the tenant who ultimately comes on board to upgrade the cafe. There'll, be signage on the glass on both the south and east facade of the building at the corner of the cafe. Next slide please. And. Here we also have a couple of amenities that the building provides. One is a standard drinking fountain that also has a bottle filler for all the cyclist and joggers along the path there. In addition to that,. We also have a bicycle service station, which is comprised of a rack for bicycles,, as well as a filling station and various tools for people to provide basic maintenance on their bicycles as needed. Next slide. Please. So, the next group of slides, will be looking at her a few different images of the project from several different vantage points. Are, starting here from the south. Looking north,, and you can see the sign of we were discussing earlier here, 97 located on the top corner of the louvers. So we have here 97 to the left and the highway to the right, and this image. Next slide. Please. And here we're from the path jogging path, looking west towards building. So, we're seeing that East facade. Again,. You have the aluminum candles on the base of the building. Of, the very Matt reflection, and we have the angled louvers above that kind of create creating some transparency and opacity for the top half of the building and some views looking through and the areas where the building is has a lower. The roof. Next slide please. And here we're next to the building looking south. So you can see some of the material qualities of the building,, as well as the entrance to the restroom and the bicycle maintenance station and water from there with the jogging path and bicycle path to the left.. Next slide please. And. This is a view from the highway as we drive South sinker 97 for the first time with the signage of Hudson River Park. Again,, acting as a deacon. Not only for our building and the pier,, but also for the overall park system. So. This is what viewers would see as they're driving along down the highway. Next slide. Please. And. This view shows a view. The south side of the building, as you were at the very head of the pure 97 park, itself. Next, slide please. And. Our last slide is just showing a selection of lighting products that we're looking at. So. We have various flood and point lights that are going to be applied to The underside of the building and along the very top edge of the river running continuously around all four facades. We have down lights that are situated just behind the liver,, which will cast light down in a backlit fashion and create a really nice luminous effect. That also creates a halo at the base of the building. So with that,. That's the last slide for the conference. Station. And I think we can proceed with the historic vessel section of the presentation. Okay. Um,. So when last we presented in November,, we had the idea that the historic festival would be located in on the north west corner of the pier. You can open up the next slide. Please. As time has gone on and, as we've looked at, things. We actually think a better location is on a south side to the east and because the view is, is much better. Number one. And number two,, the activity of the economy, barges going in and out. Create some water disturbance with awakes, but also puts our historic muscle on a pretty vulnerable spot. It's, not a good parking spot for your historic vessel. So, we're thinking you could to the next slide. Please. Locating it basically across from synthetic turf field about 115 feet away from the bulkhead. We. Don't know what ship is going. Here. So I'm, going to turn it over to rushy, who is managing the RFP process for finding a historic ship for this location. Good evening, everyone. So. Here's an update on the RFP, I trust had issued a request for expressions of interest for historic vessels in late 2019 Offering, a total of four boats for long term historic lesson docking do at their 20 526 and one actor. 97 So the pure 25 birds have already been awarded,, but we are still in the open procurement process for years. 26 and 97 The users proposed in the RFP responses generally range from museum excursions, environmental and educational programs,, depending on your location. Additionally,, a food and beverage concession is permitted at your 97, so the selected vessel is required to also do free, educational and cultural programming,. It's likely that the vessel that comes in at 97 has a concession, which is similar to Grand Banks at 25 in the park. But, given the shallow water depth and DC permit standards, finding the right vessel has been challenging for the 97. So where we are now is that we have one vessel that might be able to come in,, but we are still in the due diligence process with them. Thanks. Back to Kevin Well. That concludes our presentation. So. Now, if you happy to answer any questions., Thank you,, Kevin. Thank, you everybody from all teams on board for that presentation. Across, multiple topics. Alan,, you were the first person I saw on the committee with their hand, up. I'm, going to reserve some of my comments. Do. You want to kick us off this evening. Thank, you., Jeffrey, Absolutely, beautiful project, really in every sense, 21st. Century. Project,, you hit all the all the points that I would have thought of in what I think was discussed in our previous meeting. So really,, really great. Looking project, and I'm sure it's going to be a big hit. Once. It opens up awfully so Quick question. Why does the material on the Slide It's a polished, stone. He, wise., There's a,, there's a whole day to reflect, you know, how,? How hard can you get it out there and listen. That's a good question. We've taken that into account. There's, a decent amount of shape and that location. Where when we do material mockups we're going to be doing a final test of the material. But. Our anticipation right now is that it doesn't get too hot as a surface similar to other types of stone. Surfaces that are found around the city. This will have a very,, very Very, high polish to it. So it'll allow people to slide quite quickly down at the bottom. So, it's a pretty good sized chunk of material to, and we take a lot of A lot of heat to heat that up. Okay. Cool. Well. Thank you again. Marvelous job really was. Thank you., Thank, you,, Alan, JD, Yes, I, echo Allen's comments very thoughtful, well thought out. Design. I have one or two questions in a comment or two,, and please forgive me if I'm not happy with everything. It's, probably just me. My. First question,, everything is open to view. It looks like,, which is very important.. So no activity can go on without being viewed, sort of a safety measure. It looks like you've taken that into consideration, Kevin. Yes,. Yes, we have we've Effects right what this thermostat in our operations, people to make sure it's all visible and then we'll also be cameras. That's wonderful. The other thing that toddlers little area. Sometimes the parents like to have that sort of enclose, so the kids can't run out is that to be considered or not. Um, I'll give you the general, and maybe you can give you the specific in particularly the spray shower area. We worked it so that the little kids are kind of in an enclosed, area. And we are. Our Kids are more likely to play more in the periphery of it. And. There's a cut through for the larger kids who want to run around more But the spray shower. It does need to be one spot for both age, groups. Working, then, on the children's play area, which is on the north west end of the playground,, you kind of isn't a separate little area. It's kind of zoned, but it's not walled off. Okay., Thanks,, Kevin., I guess. My next question is for norene that signage. How big is that sign that says: Hudson River, Park. Is it going to be flashing lights or what is that all about I? It looks. I, mean, Is, this I don't see this and other peers. Yesterday,, So I, think Madeline's on the phone or on here as well. But I can give you the starting point,, which is that the park was designed with the concept of kind of vegans at major entrances and pure 97 being the northernmost kind of public pier in the park. One of the things that we are trying to do is let people know where they are. And, so the The,, the logo, that is there, went through the public, design, commission,, etc. Along with the peers and the orange that you saw on the other side of the building. That. That is the official kind of look of the park and the intent was to try as We described it, to have it match the building instead of overwhelming the building, but just sticking on the regular sign, panel., I'm, Kevin or an island you,. What do you want to say anything further about considerations. But? What's nice is it,? How big is it? Is I can speak to the dimensions. Just very quickly,, so for the pure 97 sign, the height is about three foot: nine To 13 feet wide for the Hudson River Park sign. It's a little bit larger due to the logo. That's four foot nine tall and it's 26 feet: wide. Well, I, I, don't like it. I, don't want to in Central Park big sign, Central, Park. We know it's there. But anyway, I'll leave that I'll leave that and no disrespect to the architect and the wonderful, a thoughtful design of that building, but it,, it just seems so corporate and so on, like convince me that it's not that it's really not a corporate building. That's just all Linear It's, going to be softened with some plantings are A. Guy can speak to that,, which is Respect. It's beautiful design up just As. It's actually very tough building, because footprint is there., It's, very minimum. So in a way,, yo. Opinion, just absolutely right., And I, think that's our concern. Also. And I think what we did is to not to make it a big box. Corporate box. It has different heights, so that they actually break down into smaller boxes and then also it has a slight SIP back in and out. So. You will never be one straight thing. And. Also the material itself has a matte finish. So. It's always reflecting activities on my site and also reflects back the trees in front of it. Because of materials,. It has a really softening effect. If, you think of other mega materials,, which is just very static and cold. This particular material. We chose Has soft, diffusing reflective thing, so you never see the material,. But what you see what's in front of it. So, you see the people's figures,. You can actually see there's trees and even cause. It has this much more softer effect,, although it's a very tough with area and We're, very good Okay, I, just one thing. Not in these renderings, but we are looking at, at different material where the service yard is To, make that more porous. So there will be a change in texture.. It won't be It's,, it's basically the last northern 25 feet, or so the building will be porous instead of solid. And I think that change in texture will stop and I know what you're talking about. And I think that texture will help a lot. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Let's, see,, Sally., Hi. Thank you. That was a beautiful presentation. Um, I, just wanted to ask, I might have missed it in the presentation. Question about the canopies I. Remember that one of the Questions was about the height,, where they too tall to protect us from the sun. You might have mentioned it,, but I didn't catch it. And. Another question that had been raised was the density of the trees and the ability to see children from various parts of the park are, while they were playing. The parents had concerns about that and The slide about that showed the raised elevated area,, which looks beautiful. Is there, any seating up there,, even for a couple of people or it's all standing room., Did I, think even Get into those Sure. I can begin with The canopy,. The canopy was designed, in fact, with a solar analysis, shaped study, That's, something that was calibrated based on optimizing, the prevalence of shade on sites throughout the year. Also height,, the lowest. It comes to any point if you were to stand on top of the bleacher stand on top of the upper level,. The lowest. It comes, as is nine feet in any one point, but on average it's a bit a bit higher than that. With regard to trees. Yes,. We kept in mind a visibility. So we're avoiding dense, conifers and plants that obscure Your line of sight from around three feet to about five feet,, which is where most people can, you know, perceive a you know a person in the distance, so that you're able to, you know,, Survey your room as you as you travel across the pier and for the area that you're, referring to with regard to seating. The Belvedere. We do have integrated Built in benches of various configurations at various angles, up in that location at the far end,. What we're calling the Overlook, which was that area that gives you the view over The, far west side of the pier and under the Hudson River in the distance there currently are no seats there at the moment. Doesn't mean that we couldn't put a movable table and chair the feature, PT decided,, but at the moment there's it tended to be an open area with free circulation,, considering the fact that we have the slide also connecting to that to that location. It's, not a bad idea,, though. Yeah. Well, when I looked at it., I mean,, it's very lovely,, but it's also narrow, so having some chairs at that point might be difficult because it will slow down traffic for people that want to come Down to the end of it. But. It's just such a lovely spot that people will also want to linger. Um,. So it is the good and the bad about having seating right over there,, but I'm A place for the weary parents sit while the kid goes up and down a slide for Or, as the parent wants to join them, because Thank you. You're right that we do need to look at the narrowness and also I mean it's such a prime spot. It's, very easy for me to imagine someone taking that spot and wanting to stay all day: long. Which people, Think of that right, Good., Thank, you., Thank, you,, Sally., I'm, David,, you're, next., And, Alan and Sally and folks, don't forget to put your hand down, please. So. It moves us up on the list, David. Okay. Could. We go to the image right at the end of the pier next to the,, I. Think it's an 11 or 12 foot, rise. David. This is an 80 slide. Presentation. Do. We know how far back that was Probably in the 20th Okay. Thanks again. Let me know. If You know the number one, I see it. Okay. Yeah,. It's probably slide 20, actually on it. Yeah. Is this. What you mean 1819, Yes., The part under the deck. Can, you tell us about the material. There. It feels a little bit Like a blank space that might be an opportunity. What. Can you say about it at this point. Sure? It's a cancel, Weaver, of course, beneath the deck that volume. That's a black stucco in our design. Faceted black stucco is a storage closet for HRP. So you can't see in this particular view, is a door that allows O and M staff to access that for rakes and rooms and Carts Oh, also, I'm by mental programming staff would dearly love the spot where they don't have to carry their fishing rods and pop up tents and everything else that they use for education programs up and down the park. Right. And. This furniture is a movable. So, it's in some ways, nice to have a kind of a wall behind you. So. If we were to have a class event. We can rearrange the furniture and have that be the backdrop Okay. If we switch over to the building. You know, I, hear JD his comment that it feels corporate, but I think this is actually a very subtle design and Full disclosure I'm. A big toshiko Maury fan ever Since visiting her Hello again to an elegant is the word for it. Visitor Center at Frank, like rights, Darwin, Martin house in Buffalo. Just, because a very accomplished architect and educator at nature, design, schools in this country and the wife of Jamie carpenter, who is another architect, who's very well known for Inventive use of materials that really exploit light in inventive, ways., So I think we're getting a little bit of two for one In. This design. And I think it's very hard to judge it without seeing maybe better samples or even like a night, rendering But. It's very much about things that I think are hard to convey in two dimensional rendering qualities of light. Like that. I think the building will tend to dematerialize. It will look different in different lights. And,. You know, could be quite fantastic,. I would have one question for norene, which has to do with maintenance and things like cleaning. You know,. It almost looks like the dilemma of how are you going to clean those Venetian blinds. You, know, Do? You feel that you're going to be able to maintain this on a regular basis. Next to the highway,, where there's a lot of sewage without it's starting to look grimy. Yeah. Well,, that is the maintenance. Aspect of our team, looks at any design before the community obviously sees anything or before we send anything out because of things like you're all asking The surface, and we have asked that question. That seems fine,. I would say that we are still looking at the Western side of the building and the louvers on that to make sure that our team can get access to the louvers from the water. Side. I think that thus far has been the area that we've we're still trying to figure out exactly how we would do that and Kevin,. You may have a more detailed update from as well. Well,. The one main thing helping us here is that the roof is accessible to staff. So. The louvers are pretty reachable actually from the stuff. The. Only one area that we do have some concern is Like. Maureen, said on the western side towards the bottom of the building and it'll be tricky to clean that unless we can reach it from the water on the On, the happy side of it, though. That's the area of the building, least likely to get dirty. I'm really mostly concerned about the road grid. As you as you, as you brought up. So working with operations in the plan, is to basically wash it from the, from the roof, and it's accessible from I was also a little concerned about wear and tear. There's one view that showed the panels. Panels coming right down to the sidewalk level and I'm kind of concerned about maintenance vehicles bumping into them, and you know, Sure. Hi., Um,, so you're not seeing a final absolute design. We will protect those panels with rocks plantings and other types of landscape. We're. Very cognizant that we don't want the vehicles to bang into So,. You know, you're, really not seeing a full picture of how it will be finished. But we are, it's a it's a great concern to us and we'll be watching that very carefully and making sure that we take care of that.. I also just want to say, because I haven't had a chance to speak,, but No toshiko has said what a complicated site. This is and in terms of the building. We wanted a building that would be elegant, but would not fight with a very strong architecture that was across in the via building, nor the strong landscape architecture on pure 97 and I think that what she has achieved. She and her team is just a really great balance, because It is a building and I, I'm sorry. We could not do this in person. But. If you actually saw the materials. You would see this very intricate way that the light changes and the reflection changes on these materials and the loo the louvers, because they are slanted That at any time of the day. I know she said this, but I have to say it myself,, because the subtlety of this elegance is going to create such different types of It's, going to look so different at every moment of the day and every type of weather. That. It's going to give you a very subtle, but beautiful experience and you're going to think that you're looking at a different landscape, all the time. So I think what this building has achieved for us is A, beautiful,, elegant. Look that will almost feel like it's part of the sky and yet be able to have its own identity.. And I. Think it's going to be A, just a great addition to our park. Or to finish, I, just say, I! Think it's a fantastic building and I as a cyclist.. I really appreciate the like minded station. Thank, you., Thank, you, David. And thank you,, Madeline. Um,, let's see, Leslie. Hi guys, um, I have to admit,. Whenever milk is presenting., I know it's going to be awesome. And, aesthetically, pleasing., So I was really looking forward to you guys just it's just wonderful. Um, one little minor point before I get to my major point is just to echo JD that toddler space has to be lined off from the rest of the playground. And I know you guys said you were going to talk about that later. But. My point was David,. Thank you for your presentation. To. It was wonderful., I missed the part or the solar panel part Where. Obviously, the Environment Committee as well. And I, was wondering how much of this park is going to be energy self sufficient. Um,, and how can we get to 100% or if that's virtually impossible. How close? Can we get and the solar panels, you mentioned, what were they powering and what's the percentage Yeah, I can. I can speak briefly to the solar panels on our building. So they're, covering up approximately you know, 75% of our roof. We have to leave some space for FDNY access and things like that nature for us,, you know, we're early in the design phase,, but our studies show Like I, mentioned, the,. The power can accommodate. You know lighting and receptacle loads for what would be equivalent of a 7600 square foot office. Space. Our office spaces, much smaller than that,. It's obviously won't power. The whole building,, but it will provide A nice supplement to what's coming from the grid. And. Then the event where some of those lows are not being used and the TVs are generating more power., Than, Than, what's being used, like I mentioned that supplemental power as then fed back to the grid. And, it's actually deducted from HRP to power bill. That's the case. So it only monitors. Are, basically only accounts for net metering. So they're, basically only charged for what they're used minus what the PV panels produce. Will be setting that in more detail in terms of the specific percentages and everything,, but that's specifically for the conference. Station. This is the same system that I worked on in Washington. Washington Square Park has a net metering arrangement and push working with park in Brooklyn has the same thing. And. It's really satisfying to go on a sunny, day. You can watch the meter, go the other way. So Kevin,, then what is because I see there are lights that are going up and down the whole length of the pier, um,. Those I'm guessing are not going to be energy self sufficient. Since. We do have, I mean,. It's pretty much a clear, a blank slate here. I mean, we're, you know, you're, building from nothing up How. Can we get it that we do incorporate a totally 100% green space. You have to do the math,, those lights are fed out of the building and the building solar panels feed the building. So, you know, the power on a sunny. Day. Would be enough to power those lights, except the lights, by definition, or on at night. So. That's the beauty of the net metering is that we Put excess energy into the grid during the day and we draw from it at night,. So I can't say that the light poles are powered directly by the solar panels,, because we have no energy storage in this building. But we'd have to do the math. In fact,. You should do the math to see what the total energy load is with this project and see how much the solar panels put out. I actually haven't done. That. That's, a good That's, a good, good thing to do. I will do that. All the lights are led there they're fairly low draw. So I'll, look into that. All right. Thank you. I'd be interested. Thank, you so much, guys, that was great.. Thank you. Leveling up Mr. Chair, low Thanks,, Jeffrey. Um, I've got a bunch. Um,, let's stay with the roof for a second. Since we're talking about that. I've, now heard two things that the roof is going to be used toward they're, going to be solar panels up there,, but the maintenance staff needs access to clean the building. So it, you know,, Kevin. I. Think you mentioned FDNY access to the roof, but the maintenance needs been taken into account as well for the Solar panel. It's. Basically, the same path, FDNY and That just occurred to me as You were explaining answering Leslie's question. Um,. Let's go back to the I agree that the playground for at least the toddler part needs to be fenced. In specifically talking about the kids playground. Um,. How high is the slide? How quick is the slide. And? Where does the slide lead off,? How much space is there at the bottom of the slide to Norman and Madeline that'll sound like another park to them. But? That's where the question is From Kevin Please read those battles. Yeah. For the record, I wrote that slide. Today, I went to Chelsea Waterside to check on our maintenance for it. There night I took that slide for right and it was fine. I'm Fine. No,, it's fine,, but I'm worried about the complaints. We're going to get. If there's not enough room at the bottom of the slide. So, how much room is there and how high is it now fast? Is it A height and in the zone at the bottom. And I think you can answer that. We're talking about the adult slider, the slide. Is within the Hell, with the adults that they break their neck? That's Janine,! Could you go to the site? Plan,? Maybe click back a few, a few please Well, they're, pulling that up. Law. And one thing I will tell you is that this slide only accommodates one Person being a kid or an adult. So, the one of the issues that I have a Chelsea Waterside. Is it's really wide, so multiple kids were going down at the same time that creates humbling and stuff. This is a one A one kid,. She said. Right,, because this one looks pretty high court. He's, gonna love, it. It is pretty high. Score. But I'm really looking at is the complete flip of this in where the slide, not the back of the slide,, but where you get off this slide. If, you go to fly a Zone. Yeah. Thank you,, Nora. That's, the phrase, I'm, looking for And. If a bunch of kids like gonna quickly and like you know how,, how will they will my backup on each other. Yeah,? So we designed this with the default zone criteria and also with the manufacturers, criteria. It's a little hard to see in the screen here,, but And I'm also unable to point to it,, but we have the slide positioned to the path of least resistance right, now. So. It's aiming at the most open portion in the southern part of this of this place. Gate. I would just ask that you look into that and make sure To the manufacturers. Specs is great.. It gives an answer. When, the parents start complaining. But. If we can exceed the manufacturers specs, so much the better. related issue. Yes,. Well, we exceed the this, I agree with you. When. This is not another Chelsea Waterside park where it seems like it's close to a wall,. There's plenty of room at the bottom of this slide its position, so that there's plenty of room and Chelsea Waterside made us very conscious about this. In planning this piece of equipment. Your know Madeline. That's where my question came from. As well. Yes,, yeah., Can I, just one other point, just little for you. Guys is also an off the rack. It's, an off the rack system. It's, not a custom. Creation. Okay,, which is important. It, meets all the manufacturers, standards. Okay. Similarly, with the boulder design and the entry Plaza,, and it looked like you added some of those boulders to the kids. Player. That was also a concern at Chelsea waterside., In fact,. It was the first thing. I ever pointed out. The Madeline was some stonework,. There is fabulous. But, for right, kids running around. It's also becomes a hazard. So. Can you did you,? You said it looked to me when you were discussing the boulder and in the entry that they were. There were some in the place: scape areas. Well,, Are those,, you know, for the kids to play on. Are. They a border of the player. And, more of a border of the play. Area, they've been in the design for quite a bit now and we're, again,. If you look at the place, scape here, you'll notice that the North, we, we actually use them at the threshold. For with a toddler play area, so that could be an opportunity to Create a fence anchor point. If the intention is to now further close off the toddler. Area. We also use them,, but we also use them as an anchor point at the main entrance to the place escape from the upland and then also they're used as a seating for adults in the South Bay. Right. Like I get the anchoring argument. And I'm just worried that you get kids,, you know,, climbing on them a jumping off them and getting their heads and whatever I become very sensitive.. This is, as Madalyn, Murray and Kevin know went through this and other pork, so Now, I think this specific boulders right, I mean like jumping off of the right. Folder might be okay. If there's the right landing zone again around it. If, you can climb up too high, and it's toddlers, or whatever,. Then we have to look at that. So, Understand,. Can you can use zoom into the place gate that might help. Right. I also wanted to just I'm Interested. The toddler area is basically the top left piece of this playground. So. It's an app called the sack. That's, where the sand is in that situation,. It's worked really well for us. It's Done in other parts, but also pure 25 has kind of areas for different ages and they're, not fenced off from one another,, but the kids fall into little compartments kind of by themselves. And. That's what we were shooting for here when we have fences between the age groups,, it ends up cutting the park up into too many pieces. And I can tell you my own daughter,. They only injury,. She got in a playground, so far as crashing into a fence. Gate. So I'm a little hesitant to Be, given the fact that it's the furthest area from the road gives me some level of comfort,. There's also that row of trees between the walking the boardwalk, and the bike, path. Right. So, there's not an attractive nuisance of running out into the highway. Right. And and maybe I missed your point,. But the playground itself is entirely fenced. In you., There are gates to get into the playground. Okay, okay, that probably solves my problem. Okay, I'm. On the overlook. It looks like the Overlook there's just one way in or out, are we worried about a bottleneck up there,, since it is such an attractive, site. Can, you encourage him., Just scroll left and he should be able to see it. Yeah. So. It looks to me like there's only one way in a route: that's through the Belvedere. Is there another way out of the Overlook that's going to help alleviate traffic., There and Well,, the slide. Yeah,, but I'm worried about people who get up there. And, you know, realize the slides. The only way: out. There's a fair, also nice,, yeah. Okay, um, Let's go back to the building. I'm. The concept is great.. I love, it. I'm concerned about the louvers, either being an attractive nuisance to birds.. If They can't tell that it's a building. If, because of the iridescence I'm worried about it, retaining heat and creating,, you know, an uncomfortable feeling in the restrooms and in the cafe and delivers themselves. Who's controlling them. And where's that controlled for them. I'm, a loser are fixed and So. They don't move up and down. No,. It's fixed, So numbers themselves. Has this kind of earphones, sheep. And? It wouldn't have insulation in it. So, it's actually not going to produce heat We also dealt with a project in Cambridge, with the louvers in the birds. And. What we discovered is that bros hate And go to rivers. In slight angle, because they are a little feet if they don't like to poach in an angle.. This was with a pharmaceutical company.. We did a lot of studies. And, so I think it's even a quarter inch. They hated. So, that's actually something we have. We have worked with and Yes. And also,. At the same time, boys are attracted to something which emits lights are transparent,, but this is Still has a slight iridescent, but it's not reflective Okay, they,, they would know not to go in there.. Sorry, I was worried so much about them purchasing to shake up, but on the western side on the water as we're in the flying into the back of the building. Yeah. Um,, but you're a distance isn't going to take that and on while we're on the building. The cafe signage. I was trying to see it, but you're, going through the slides to quickly. There's a limit on the size of the cafe signage. Right, right. That's. What we're showing you is the limit, Okay, I didn't get a chance to read it because we ran through the slides to quickly I'm fine with the Hudson River Park and the pier 97 sides signs I disagree with JD on that I'm worried about the, you know, commercial signage,, not so much the park, signage. So. What we're trying to do by showing the words cafe signage, exactly aware, is kind of like design, Commission approval up front for the exact place. Okay and scale. So. What you saw is kind of true to the sizing standard that we would have Okay, um, Well, now I'm heading out of the park on the bike,, the bike path, itself, um,, There's, a nice. It looks like there's a nice separation between the boardwalk area and the bike path,. But how narrow is the bike path because you're going to have the jogger versus bike conflict that we have in the rest of the park of it's very narrow? You know, I think I need you for the dimensions there. With the bike, path. Is it as wide as we can possibly make yeah Sorry, I was muted. It's about 16 feet with two feet of gutters on either side. Okay,, so there's at least some room for someone to jump out of the way of the illegally bike. On the bike. Best Part of our bike: path. Yeah. All, right. And, my last question. I'm, going to steal one from the committee chair. Is there, a spot at the west end for lending for a water taxi. Yes,. So we are not building it. But, one of the things that by shifting the historic location, further east If, there were a feature. waterborne transportation component that could work at the site.. We've talked about that. You can't see it here,, but the. As. You can see,, there's no trees,, there's now anything that kind of goes right to the edge at the,, the South. Southwest corner.. Last corner. So,, you know,. If you wanted to have something at some future, point. I think that there is room for that. There Right. And it when the location of the historic ship prohibit that Location with his Side, or the east and should not prohibited. It actually,. We think that we looked at the whole south side for the historic ship and We're sensitive to not wanting to block us from Milan, among other things,, and it's also, if it's,, you know, a more active zone, that the overall periods, design with more activity towards the east and more relaxing towards the west,. So I think there are things to think about. If there is a water taxi or a ferry or whatever. But we're not there yet and for the moment, there seems to be space for something in the future. Okay, I just wanted to make sure that we would. I mean, I understand,, putting the historic vessel further east,, so not blocked views. The. Only thing that will block is the boathouse that 96 But. If you have a water taxi or a ferry, stop at the far end, I want to make sure that those ships coming in are not going to,. You know, generate awake or anything that's going to affect the historic vessel., Right. Well, I think that bringing the water taxi further east would actually affects the non motorized voters. The kayakers, and everything else like that. More. So, that's another reason to think about keeping them further west,. If that ever happens, All right,, I'll, leave, I'll leave that I know there's some people from the community boathouse on. If they have that question, when just Jeffrey gets to the public. Thank you all very much., This is a great design,. It keeps getting better every time we see it, yes., Hello,, Blake. Yes,. Thank you for the presentation, I'm really excited about this. Two, quick, questions., One, and I might have missed this at the last meeting,. But it looks like there's a different fencing on the north and south side of the pier. And. You know, I understand the need For a more chain, link. Kind of fence in the activity area where balls might get thrown into the water. But I'm wondering about the rationale of continuing With More chain link, look all the way to the west side of the year. And. My second question is about the Building and it looked In. One of the pictures like there is a vehicle in there.. So I just want to learn a little more about the interaction. Between The vehicle entrance and the Bike Path. You know, in that area. Mm hmm. Sure, I could speak to the to the fence. It's Good that you pointed out,, or rather identified that we do have,, you know, quite a significant fence along the north side. That's done primarily to keep you know, Aaron's, balls or Frisbees or whatever may happen in the activity field, from going in the water. Saying for the children's play escape. The reason why we've extended that fence topology farther to the west was for the efficiency of the detailing, because we have a great change along the north side along the Belvedere in the Overlook. We actually have A disconnection from what's currently installed a long, pier 97, which is the HR PT standard guardrail, a guardrail is being maintained everywhere, except for the northern portion between the tip of the Overlook all the way to the entrance of the activity. Field. And. We did that approach, not only for the efficiency of the detail,, but also for its size. The HRP standard guardrail is quite heavy and takes up a Lot of with dimensionally. Right. So by using a thinner detail, we're able to actually make them more efficient use of the space as well. And. We're able to join specific elements together without taking up too much room. Okay. And, the building, vehicle. But. What you're talking about it. That's, the yard for maintenance, forces., So I know it looks like a pickup truck, is in that rendering. But. That's actually unlikely to happen. It's, really, electric golf carts mo tracks. It's, our stuff you've seen the park generally So we'll have a few of those. And they're charging up and that's where they transfer materials. In size, so that if we needed to bring a pickup truck with a bunch of plants or whatever it is. That would work and not be blocking the Esplanade or everything else. Like that. But, but,, as Kevin said, the Guatemalan Park vehicle is a lot smaller. Thank you. Thank you, Marty. Thank you. Thank. You for this presentation. It's, been a pleasure to watch this develop into a really,, really lovely project and Other people have said that,, but I felt I needed to echo. It. Thank you so much. It will be. It will be an asset to the community. I. Believe I am correct. That this is one of the first projects on community has examine that actually is incorporating solar panels. On, the roof. And. We have several others in the community has often requested it, and I can't help, but Say, hooray., Thank, you. This is a wonderful moment for us to see it actually included in the design. So I have Two questions. One is,. Why aren't there more solar panels on the canopy, structure. Another logical place for solar, panels. And? The second question: I have is,. We haven't. You haven't talked much about the overall energy efficiency of the building. Itself. The Bronx River alliances,, just a river house up in In start starlight park. It is 100% off is connected to the grid that is 100% often use batteries. I understand your, your Strategy of not using batteries,, because that adds a lot of expense to the building and kind of have to be the buffer, and that actually makes sense to me. But,. But you haven't talked about the overall energy efficiency of the building. The,, the boathouse, using vines and other accessories on the outside of the building to prevent the game. That. The sun, with rain. I have the feeling that I heard the louvers would accomplish some of that. So. The question really is the word: what the overall energy efficiency of Solar panels on that cannot be? Energy efficient, feel good., Thank, you. First of all, I. Just to let you know, I worked on the starlight river House. Also, in my eye before this job. I was a chief architect for New York city parks. So as I know that building inside now. It's a great feeling. Yeah. And, then There were a few geothermal wells,, which we can do here. Actually for a lot of their energy savings. That's right. But, with that said, we're not really far enough along with this building to ascertain what its energy use is going to be, we're really at this Late schematic, stage. So. We need to really get into sizing the equipment and the pomson, and all that to really tell you specifically what it is. But as I was talking, I remembered. We're, actually changing the lights on the promenade on the pier to be solar powered lights. So I don't know I should mention that before,, but these are the lights on that staff. Prominent those will also be solar power bias and, aside from the lights. There, isn't a whole lot of energy draw on this, on this project. We're doing pretty good. But. We still need to do the math. So. The building has very little windows and except on cafe, as actually shaded by there cannot be above. So in a way,. It's incredibly well insulated, yawning. So, there's very little heat loss or he gained because of it. And I. Think we try to compensate the lack of Windows by appearance of movers,, but I. Think Our intuition is that it's going to be incredibly energy efficient, building, Your own Kind of minimum, be LEED silver. By, the way,, we're not going to certify it necessarily,, but it will be designed to LEED silver Marty.. We are very cognizant about making our Park. When. We can energy efficient. So. It really is a top priority. So we're going to model it, and but what the design of the building and Of the all the mechanicals We always are. Looking at that and we'll get back to all of you about when we do model it and how we're doing. But it's a very key component for us. We are looking at this everywhere in the park. Now, and Everything. We do right now is about energy efficiency. So. We appreciate that and we'll get back to you. On. This Thank you. When I, thank you for that. Oh,, sorry., Sorry,, I didn't realize you had another. Follow up. Just to comment. Now, stop at the fact that you're doing, energy efficiency on that building the model- and it's not going to come back to us about it- is A, really wonderful. Thing, and you should be proud of yourself. For. Thank you so much. Anyway,, we're channeling! You Let me know. We figured out that solar would work. Here. We were channeling. You Well,! Thank you very much for that. And I'm. Looking forward to hearing about the energy efficiency of the building,. When you, when you come up with Marty,, you say solar panels, enough, eventually they're going to listen. Thank you everybody on when on the phone. They are more When. We just lie,, I'm I was just wanted to stand up for windmills. They're small windmills would get you more. That's a comment., Thank you. Know. The comment, was, actually, I agree with JD about the building and I. Just don't think it fits there.. It just doesn't look right. Especially the signs, but the rest of it. Too. It looks like a commercial building, an office building. It doesn't., It's, jarring. What's, the part to me. Okay, and that's it. Thank you for that. Jeffrey. Can I respond to go in Sure. I was going to go ahead. Wine. If you go north of this park. You've got the kind of peer and the sanitation peer. So, there's absolutely nothing there. That feels like a park at all.. I know the trust. Whoa. Yeah. This is not a debate. I'm not debating I was Drunk And,, you know, the,. The other thing I was going to say is that I know the park need asked for a I'm like a restroom there and I know the part that needs a maintenance facility there. So it may not work really well,, but it's something we asked for previously. Well I, don't say that it doesn't need the functions.. It has I'm just saying that to me it's, it looks very commercial in the middle of a park. Thank you., When, I'm, gonna I'm gonna make a couple comments and then we're going to go to Katie and the public. For this so Gina,. If we want to tee up Katie and move for into the panelists,, so she can ask her question. I'm, starting on the building. I, found it. I liked the contrast that particular elegance,, especially when you saw the view from the highway of the content, piping. And, then the sort of very linear element of the building up against what seems to be a marrying of circular and geometric designs throughout the park. I rather liked,, even though at first, it felt a little cold to me, but it grew on me. I want to applaud the perforated canopy, I think,, letting a little bit of sunlight through Is, really important in places like this and not full shade. My two questions are around,. Have we chosen a wood, material, I noticed quite a bit of wood and the benching, and a particular in the northern sections of the pier, and is that a standard, Park. Um,? What are we Are there, specific ones being considered for this year. We have chosen with material. It's called Kemeny. It's an engineer would fabric fabricated from Pine and it has the same performance almost as an EP HR PT Their mandate is to not use any tropical hardwoods, and milk also agrees with that. By practice he pay is also utilised elsewhere in the city of New York. So. We we've seen it so it's your ability and if you're curious about Jeffrey, Jeffrey, we've done an enormous amount of research on this, and we're using it on pier 26 And we'd like the way it looks. You'll like the way it looks when it opens, and we think that this is the best word that's available.. That can substitute for hard would like a pay and one that actually look. We'll look good as it ages., So I think you're going to like it. When you see it. Thank you. It's gonna get started. And, then Ian you're planting scheme is gorgeous. But. It looks like you were, showing all three seasons of bloom, a various things. At one time through out there. And I just want to make Climate change, Jeffrey I know that Madeline, but I rarely I still be in line actress and cherry trees. All the same time. That's a little bit specific, but I couldn't resist the comments. As. It looks gorgeous. But, I, hope we're planning, as the park does for three seasons of color and then winter structure. Of course, as well. We have, we have and rendering programs, of course, have limitations. That I gotcha. In general,. We tried to communicate the prevalence of where we're bloom density would be,, but there will be definitely seasonal interest and change over time. Great., Thank, you., I'm, gonna, So, Brad and Chris I see your hands. Just went up and I your last two members of the committee, I guess implore you to be brief., It's 809 and we have five more items on the agenda. So Brad, please., Yes. Two questions will put. Mr will be brief and we have the money to build this and when will it starts and my third point is,: can we get the kind of transfer station to take down their neon colors. So? The sign will look better. Hey. Well, as you know, we have the money in the state budget to bill the park a it is a and, as you also know, there's a Huge amount, Of pain,, those being referred by government right now and we're part of government and We're suffering it too. So. We hope that so we are completing the design and we are working with the state to figure out how we can move forward on this project. Our intention is to move forward on the project.. No money was cut From this Project. So. That's a good thing. We know that the governor wants to get it done. But, there's a lot of noise. As. You can imagine, right now on Colbert and We need to get through that a little bit before we can figure out what exactly our schedule of construction will be. Thank you, is that it Yeah, I wasn't joking about taking that color down on the contents. So, yeah. Um,, that's interesting., Let's. Take a look at that., And,, Mr., Chair., Yes, I know we always talk about water taxis. But. Would it be possible to actually put it on the drawing and say water taxi landing, site., Well,, I, suppose. That? Is that appropriate thing? I? Don't consider the trust to be the appropriate mechanism to be doing the, the development and planning for it. Um,, so Yeah, an ideal world, they're showing it and you're right. I? Guess we could have a considered. I was heartened by this plan that it actually gives what I see is a little bit more flexibility to a potential landing long term. If we can convince the city to bring service here., And, Madeline. Thank you so much. We've been waiting for solar and green for years, and we really appreciate it. Thank you. Oh,, it's our pleasure,, because it's really important. Thank, you., Christopher, Thank, you. Everybody, I just wanted to say to HR PT to shoot on milk really making green space out of nothing,. And it's heartening to see the hard work coming: in. During, this time,, that raw fish right now, and secondly, to comments made about water, taxis. I'm, aware that peer 90 was dredge to host The US naval ship comfort was done and record timing. I, don't know how deep they went,, but that is another option for water taxis on the Hudson River Park. So. That may be something we want to look into in a future meeting with etc. I believe they're, the ones that manage them: here., That's all,. Thank you. Everybody. I think that the Cruise terminals different than the peers that are in the rest of the park there are DC and environmental regulations around dredging in these areas,. If I'm, not mistaken,, Madeline that we'd, obviously much deeper conversations, rather than he is, and that type of thing., Well,, I, mean, I'm sure nori would like to chime in. But I'll just say,, so the comfort got an emergency permit to dredge because it was truly an emergency. Dredging is really complicated and difficult under the best circumstances, meaning The passenger ship terminal, which is not in the park,, but in the Hudson River Park act. It actually says that no dredging is allowed.. So That is a big issue.. I will say that As time goes, on. Much of the park is being silted in When I, say much of the park. I mean, in waterpark. It's just The, the cycle and the way that the That's happening and If that's not an area that I think is Going to be very well received. If. We start opening that up, but You know,. It's just the way. It is that The,, the depths of the water around the park are just very shallow and And I. Think just as time goes, on. We have to accommodate to that. Thank you, darling. Thank you for raising Chris I'm Katie,. Thank you for your patience from the men from the boathouse Yeah, either. Yes. Hi. I'm Katie Savage. I'm on the board of directors from Manhattan Community boathouse, which operates out of pure 96, which is directly south of your 97 or 97, is actually our northern Border. For our environment. So, anything that happens on the south side and the water is effectively in our environment and puts our kayakers at risk. So. The historic vessel will then, if that were to leave for excursions that interferes with our free public program, water taxis would effectively kill our public program,, which serves 17,000 people on average per season. It's. Currently the main draw to the north side of the park. So that,. That's a huge issue for us. So. How can we address keeping our programming and,? You know, finding a way to maybe use the north side of the pier. So. It doesn't interfere with our investment. Thank you for that. Katie,, Russia,, you're, battling. Can. You speak to whether or not this historic ship is planned to do excursions or she'll stay put at the pier. No, I mean, I'll just start with the point that the park overall was designed for boathouses and historic ships. And. It was designed for historic ship location at Pier 97 specifically and for the boathouse that we built. Obviously at Pier, 96 And throughout the park and throughout the harbor, kayaking and Russell's work. Together. It's. Not always ideal,, but with operational planning,. You can think about it. You're, not open every day a week every hour the historic vessel might not be either depending on what it is and whether it has to move or not is one of the things that can be considered as that planning continues. With, whether we can even bring it to the pier that programmatically,. The Community Board has been on record as wanting a historic vessel., The North side does not work. It's, very narrow defenders that you can kind of see sticking out of the pier on the far left at the top of the page,. There are there because Vessels coming. I mean,, it's kind of,, it's a fuel transfer facility, so vessels working vessels come in and out of that, location. And in the past have basically bumped those vendors that you see, sticking out there. So putting any kind of vessel. On the north side. There really doesn't work. And. It really also doesn't work with the design. Of, the Belvedere, and the Overlook for other reasons. And. So the south side is the spot that would work for a historic vessel and I think you're, raising operational questions that are important questions that I don't think it's either or Either. I just want to point out,. He knows the design of the pier on the north side, how the corners rounded off- and it was done that, specifically because of the Content barges having a difficult time maneuvering around that and that just made. I mean we really studied putting a boat on the north side. And. That's really where we wanted it,, but it just wasn't going to work with the content. Operation. But. We are a park of many colors and we,. You know,. We work with the vote, houses and the historic ships, and we somehow managed to incorporate boating and historic ships and I. Think We would do the same. Here, we're not we're not,, we would,. We would not put a ship there without considering the needs of the boathouse, so This is going to be an ongoing conversation.. This is not where it ends. It's, just where it starts. And. You know the stork. Both is not a done deal. Either. So it's a process and you'll be part of the process. Thank you, beyond the historic boat. There's. Also the water taxi, that would be moving frequently and causing week, which would also pose a big issue for our kayakers, Definitely have a big effect. It's true. Is, not our current proposal is Just to be clear,. That is, the trust is never put forward that the board has been long, been advocating for lateral, Westside ferry service and had identified Peer 97 as sort of key element of that plan. I'm recognizing,. There may be conflict with that along the way. I did you just want to ask about the South Side appear 96 with regards to your use and access, and there is additional abilities for you on the south side of 96 right. You Know the way 96. I mean,, it's not on your map. 96 does not stick out very far. It's, very short., So 94 is our southern boundary and 97 is our northern boundary got that space and the imaginary line that connects the end of those peers? Is our space for kayaking. So? It would be very difficult to keep it's already difficult to keep people away from those peers. You. Everybody wants to investigate,, especially when the concerts were happening on 97, so having other attractions, there. Will be difficult. The. Other major thing beyond the boats is fishing.. Fishing is a big issue. When we're kayaking up by pure I and looking out for fishing lines, will people be fishing off of the south side of 97, potentially Interfering with our kayakers,. You can't see the fishing line you throw your Pole out and you hook somebody that's a big safety issue as well,, especially on the weekends. We, are very, very busy on the weekends. So anything that I understand. During the week, you know, things can happen when we're closed, but Saturdays and Sundays from May through October, always busy. So. Anything that's moving around within our environment poses a huge issue., So Katie. We do environmental education that involves fishing and other activities in the water and again The issues that you're addressing here. We have that three other boat houses in the park as well. We do environmental programming. We do other things in other places.. And we basically work with people to try to figure it out. So That is the best answer that we can give you at this point, you know,, we intend,. We want to bring local school kids near pure 97 out to the fear to discover what lives in the river. So, whether that is through fishing or through other things. We don't exactly know yet,, but I, mean, your,. Your concerns are not unique to this spot, and we've basically manage well with all of the other build houses that we have. So,. You know,, that's the best thing that I can say right: now., Okay., Thank, you very much. And thank you,, Katie. Appreciate, you raising those issues., Um, I, don't know if we need a letter. Here. My inclination is that we are continuing to applaud the design. All of the concerns that were raised regarding the playground,, the louvers on the building, FDNY and maintenance access to the building. Access to the Belvedere, up and down. Seem to have all been addressed. If somebody on the committee feels. Otherwise,, please let me know. Because. If not, I, I don't know that there's a need for a letter, here. I, agree that there shouldn't be a letter or we don't need a letter and I look forward to the next presentation. Can I. Just ask you Kevin, do,: do we need one for PTC That's, true PPC may need you may require one They haven't asked we you were nice enough. To give us one to begin with, for the overall schematic, plan. So I think we're good. As far as PVC is concerned. Okay. Well,. Thank you all for that very much.. This is big and,. You know, Madeline hold on to that money from the governor please and get this built. Believe me, I'm working on it. Okay,, good. Our next item. scope of work for the plan, restoration of private passage., The sculpture in Clinton Cove,, which is actually just south of where we were doing this evening. Bye, everyone. Bye., Madeline., Thank, you., Man, Thank, you to shake. Oh, thank you., Thank, you., Jeffrey and low Low In everybody's teams. Thank you for that on 97, we're very excited. URI by Glad to hear it. Oh, good evening., You, too., So who's, doing I'm Private passage, update, I am hi, I'm Kate., From, atrocity., Hi., Janine. Do. We have a screen share: here. Okay., Okay,, great., So I'm, going to do a brief overview of the scope of work for the conservation of private passage by Malcolm, Cochrane well., Next slide please. Thanks, so private passage is the formal name of the large sculpture that we more commonly referred to as the bottle. It's, a piece by Malcolm Cochrane, that's located As Jeffrey mentioned and Glen cove adjacent to the pier 96 boathouse. It was installed on April 2005, so it's been in the park for about 15 years. Now. And, as you can see, from the image on the right. It's starting to show with age, a bit, and so thanks to grants from council members, Corey Johnson and Helen Rosenthal, we've been able to start this project to conserve this sculpture. Next page, please. So. We started this project by hiring Wilson conservation or a well known art conservator based in Brooklyn. And, so we've been collaborating with them and with Malcolm Cochran, the artist to develop a set of specific recommendations for how to restore the sculpture. So. The primary scopes of work are the application of a new Exeter, you're finished,. You can see an image on the bottom right, that The pieces, starting to rust. It's, been exposed to whether Members of the public interact with the piece. It also went through Hurricane Sandy. And. So it's starting to need some work., The, sculpture itself is made out of steel, and there was an applied coating that made it resemble each bronze. And. So for this project, we're going to remove that applied coding, make any repairs necessary to the steel.. Then apply a new system, that's going to be more resilient and something that we're going to be able to maintain our own moving forward. So. We think that will really be an improvement that will allow this to sort of stand up to time. While we're at it, we're also going to replace the glazing and all the portholes. You know some of them have become scratched. If. You look at broken over the years. We've replaced them,, but we're looking to use more resilient materials and then also on the interior, You know, the,. The piece was flooded during Hurricane Sandy. And. While we did the best that we could. We tried on multiple occasions. You can see on the interior and the image on the upper right,. You know,, there's some rusting. There are some dirt that and, you know,. So there's going to be a thorough, cleaning, they're going to take care of the rest. And. It's going to be returned to us. Looking brand new. So, next slide, please. In terms of schedule and logistics. The piece is going to need to be removed from the site so that this specialized work can be done in a Metal working facility. So the pieces going to be off site for about three months on the disruption to the parks should be minimal.. There will be perhaps a day or two of partial closures, and this immediate area just to get the piece in and out. That will be coordinated as necessary. And, our overall timeframe as a little bit. Tbd. We need to get final approvals from the public design. Commission, we'd have some contracting to work. Out. And. We just need to make sure everything is in place with our funding,, given the current state of the city's budget,, but something that we're going to work out and we're really excited to be able to do. This. That's,, that's basically, it. So take any questions. That's great, Kate. Thank, you. Um. Any questions from the committee JD Yes. Are. You think this is just terrific.. This is a wonderful piece of public art. It children, love it and I love it. Too. I, thank you for doing this. I hope we can write a letter thanking Corey and Helen for the funds for this, because this is a wonderful piece of public art. Work,. Where does it take three months. Um, they're going to have to sort of blast the exterior start surface off, it's going to be done. Basically in a foundry. And, then it's going to go to a specialized coding, space. And! So there's just a bit of you know it's careful, we're and specialized. So it's being taken off site. And, the interior. The furniture inside is that Going to be polished up, Yes, they're, going to clean everything, they're going to do an assessment. Once. They have it open and they can get in it and they'll do whatever it needs to happen to make it look as it did when it arrives. That's great., Thank, you. Does, that mean will lose that patina finished as well as the rest Know. What's going to be replicated, the rusty will remain,, but the effect that when each bronze is what's going to happen., Great., Thank, you. Anybody else on the committee. Any members of the public. JD,, are you formalizing? The idea of a letter to Korean held on this. Yes, I am. I moved that we write the letter thanking Corey and Helen for For the funds for the funds to Restore Thank you. Is there, a second on the motion. Thank you, Sally. I'm, seems like a pretty straightforward. Letter K. Did, you receive. Was, that a recent was this fiscal years this years in the making,. Just so I can note. And I think that the funding from Corey may have been last year,. We can Get you that actually Said, Okay, that'd be great. If just so I can include us So, we can get you that Thank you. Okay, great to hear that we love in new public art improvements to our existing public art. So. Thank you for that. Um, next item on our agenda. Moving to city parks to present on the temporary public, art exhibition coming to Bella Abzug park in the summer of 2020 Also referred to as Hudson Boulevard area around Hudson Yards,, and we have A brief presentation on that. And Have. We moved over that present person presenting I, believe it's Nicole's presenting,, but she will. She can be promoted.. Let me see., Let's, see. Nicole, are you planning. On it. They'll actually be Elizabeth masella from Parks. Who will Be leading the presentation. Thank you. Sure thing. Yep. There. She is. She raised her hand and everything. Oh, great. Can, you Hear me: Yes. I'm, Hi, I'm, Elizabeth, masella, I'm, the senior public art coordinator and YC parks. And I'm, here also with Nicole from the Hudson Yards Hell's Kitchen alliance, to share just a brief informational Presentation with you about a temporary public art project that will be coming to Bella, Abzug Park,. Hopefully later this summer. And for I think it's been a while, since we've been to district for with public art. Just. To give you a brief overview,, our parks program permits temporary public artwork in parks and all five boroughs were. A small team of two Temporary are, is considered anything on view for up to one year and all projects are funded by the artist or the exhibitor They're required to maintain and cover all custom installation for the artwork. Um,. But right now our entire program is kind of on hold for the time being. And, you know, we're aiming for August for this project, ultimately,. If there's still a lot of restrictions in place at that time. We can postpone it. We Nicole's been into the artists, they're, aware kind of the situation and we're going to continue to monitor to monitor that safety is of utmost importance. So. The artwork is going to be a bronze sculpture. I'll show you. Some slides in a moment. And, it's quite large. It's, going to be the world's biggest bronze gorilla sculpture and by the Australian artists. Do Jillian mark. It's called King, mcara and MacArthur has a real gorilla, who lives in Uganda,. The artists are proponents of wildlife. Conservation. They met the gorilla on a travel to Uganda and are creating the sculpture to honor him and girl populations around the world. And you'll, see on the first slide and area marked out where the sculpture will go. The, Alliance gone out and measured to make sure it will fit. There will be plenty of space to in keeping with ADA accessibility and it'll be 4000. Pounds will be quite heavy and be held in place by its weight and won't require any anchoring It'll be moved into place by a crane, which can be done in a few hours from the roadway that you see there,, and it should take a few hours, and we'll find a time to do that when there's not so many pedestrians. Next slide. And. That shows you in the larger scheme of the park. Where will be. Next slide. This is an earlier rendering. It's not going to be quite that large, I think there. It looks like it's about 20 feet, tall. So, next, slide. This is an earlier model of the gorilla.. That will be in the park. So. That's essentially it so august tentatively 2022, July, 2021, And I'm happy to answer any questions. You might have. Thank you Elizabeth Any questions from members of the committee., Right. Nicole or Bob,. Did you want to add anything? No, I'm, good, I must say. Thank you, Blake, I saw your hand go up. Sorry about that. Yeah, I was just wondering if we could get a little more context on how this particular Sculptra was chosen,. You know, I'm just curious about how it fits in,. You know, either with The time during or with the setting, you know, to me, to be honest,. It feels a little out of place, and particularly in the current environment,, it might feel a little more out of place. You know,, given that we would be coming out of this endemic, hopefully the time that this would be shown. So the artists approached on the Alliance, I, don't know, I'm Nicole. If, you wanted to say anything about kind of the. Why of the sculpture in your park. I mean generally our program. We look at site. Suitability in terms of How an artwork might impact the use of this regular use of the space, you know,, art is kind of in the eye of the beholder. You know,, our partners. You know, may feel a certain connection between this and the site, you know,. We do try to be thoughtful about why a piece and where things like that., So, Nicole. I, don't know. If you have anything, you wanted to add on that note, Sure, I'm in some of our early conversations about the peace and the artists expressed interest in into a raising awareness about the gorilla and using sort of the status of the parks location as a as a way to do so and then engage encourage rather conversation. About, about the species and the animal, and then basically trying to tie it into by way of how it looks and encouraging people to sit on it and engage with it, tying in this sort of sense of community and unity. And ultimately, um,. No, it is temporary. So, we'll go away after some time. Thank you. Thanks,, like Well, can I at least say it. The gorilla in the room. Let me,, let me say, Jeffrey you're, muted. We, can't hear you. Somebody To myself all day, long. Again, Does, the parks department or the alliance require any correspondence on this. Um, no. Since. It's temporary. We don't require any Resolution or anything. If you feel that, like some keyboards. Do, you like to issue a letter of support, if you so need,, but we don't require it. Says. The committee feels strongly about issuing a letter of support. I'm in different.. I think that it's allowed to happen. Um, I think it's okay. And, given that Marty and I are the letter. Writers. If. The company doesn't want to write a letter. I'm, okay, with that. The Alliance, isn't asking for a Lot of them. Okay, thank you., Okay, great. Elizabeth, I'm Nicole. Bob,. Thank you very much., Thank you. Thank you for having Thank you everyone. Or I'm on to the next item on our agenda from the Department of sanitation regarding the compost, collection program, suspension for I'm sure they're going to get into this,, but The city stopped,, not just curbside composting. I'm in light of the Kobe outbreak,. But it's also been put on halt at Green markets and Hudson. River Park has also suspended their compost, collection. So I, didn't local community gardens,, a review of access. Lori said: ecology center in Manhattan., There's, really nowhere to compost. So. We asked for a brief update, On the Y and with what we might be able to do to request getting some of it back online, not curbside, pickup. But. What locations around the city and in our neighborhood. In particular,? We can request. So departments, invitation. Who. Do we have this evening. Oh Risa, Versa., Yeah., Sorry, about that., That's, okay., Hi,, I'm, mercy, yanni and then Hadley's on for on community outreach.. I also have on here with me and you and Marguerite from our Bureau of recycling, sustainability. So they're, going to be getting into the composting suspension, as well as answering all of your questions. I'm, just here to say, hi and make sure everyone. You know, make sure you see the who I am as your liaison and just give a quick update just from Department of sanitation., So I think everyone knows about our streets, ripping rules that are in effect.. And do know that the they will be in effect, rules will be, in effect again from May 18 to the 24th. And, then alternate side parking is suspended again for another two weeks from May 25 of June seven, Just want to flag that on May, 21 and may 24 are already scheduled, alternate star parking suspension days for two holidays. So just want to keep that in mind. For folks. Just in case, you didn't see that. But I'm, going to turn it over to Andrew and Margaret. Thank you, Andrew, Marguerite, Well,, everyone., It's, me, and Royals I'm, the senior manager or organics outreach with the Department of sanitation and You know,. We really want to start just it believe it was. We were invited earlier by Manhattan. See, before committee and for March 12 And. We are going to present to that meeting to talk about all of the various options,, both the curbside composting program and the drop off programs that were available to all residents and see before. And, you know, two months later,. We are in quite a different location. Quite, a different reality,, given the global pandemic,, given the You know, loss of life and the,, the loss of revenue to the city and the emergency Status at the city's in which was actually declared on the 12th of March,. So You know I I'm. I work specifically on the curbside program. The brown, Ben program,, but not great news. We had to be suspended. The program. As of March 4 Or may 4. Excuse me. As of May 4. Essentially the city needed to free up funds for code, response. And in doing so,. That was one of the hard choices that the Commissioner had to do. When the mayor asked for program, cuts. When service, so residents in Manhattan for,, you know,, you had to actually opt into the program. He had an opt in program where you Signed up online and you received a site visit from staff, and then they would talk to your building super or your,. You know, your building maintenance and then provide bins and service. The alternative where the drop offs,, which there were a handful of Dropbox around the city,, particularly in see before and We, actually suspended those drop offs to stay in the Recommendations and Requirements really of social distancing that were put out By the governor by the mayor by the various health departments, New, York, City, Health CDC, so on so forth. So. At this stage there are supports for composting, are actually compost in your home. If. You have access to a worm bin or if there's any backyard, space. Jeff, even I did here, you know, with gardens,, but the even the gardens,. The green thumb gardens are close to non garden members right, now. So, even that Is a Not, an option at this immediate moment and I know that as a response. The,, the city wants to reevaluate one social distancing, measures. Are, take a step back then, you know,, we'll be able to re, evaluate some of the options for drop. Offs. However, part of the cuts that were part of you know the scaling back of these programs. Our program. Partners,, the New York City compost project actually lost its funding in this, and also our education with garden when I see, which the department also funds. They, were also, unfortunately, defunded for emergency coded response. And. So even with the fact of You know some of the people who are staffing, these drop off some of the people who were processing the material that was collected at the drop offs. You know those were the sites that were also lost as well. Mark Marguerite, I want to ask you have elements you want to add to this. I think I covered all the aspects of the real, the drastic, you know, Shift,, you know,. We had the largest program for composting in the world. In March, we've been in the margin. Now,. We actually have quite a small program,, given the reality of Covid-19 and then the response. But I want to see. If Marguerite has anything she wants to add. As far as that. Yeah, sure. Can, everyone hear me. Yes., Great., Hi, everyone. My name is Margaret Manila and I'm. The Senior Manager of Community composting and compost, distribution. At, the at the Department of sanitation. So. In my role as manager of Community composting I, my main role there was to oversee the NYC compost project, which introduced mentioned That. We will. So, we are going to,, I'll, just be a little more specific about what that program is. It was a it is this there are,, there's a skeleton crew still employed and funded by us through the end of this fiscal year, but starting on July 1 We will be suspending the program for The. Suspension is intended to be temporary, with funding return to the partners,, but those. The program was made up of seven. Teams based at seven different partner organizations, big reuse, Brooklyn, Botanic, Garden earth, matter., Lower, East, Side, ecology, center,, the New York Botanical, Garden, Queens, botanical garden and snow Carver, Cultural, Center and Botanical Garden. So I just wanted to be clear about what that means. And as Andrew said, While the. While the compost project was no longer operating, many food scraps drop off sites. They were processing composting, a majority large quantity of the food scraps that are collected at many different drop off sites throughout the city. And. They were also in a technical assistance role, supporting A lot of what we call the community hosted. Food scrap, drop off, sites. There are a handful in Manhattan for, and So we,. You know,. We still have a small team at sanitation and will hopefully be able to continue focusing on composting in the coming year,. But The reality is that we, you know,. We will be the ones Supporting, the composters and residents that those seven partners,, along with grown YC, have been supporting to date. But yes,, as Andrew said,. We do have We do have resources at the Department of Education,, you know,. We still have the online. tip sheets and other educational materials and we're looking into how we're going to make sure those are. Let's continue to be available and widely promoted throughout the year,, but it surely it's the class. Thank you. Um,. My frustration is extreme on this matter, because it seems you know where the waterfront parks and Environment Committee, and we don't often have a lot of environmental issues that we can advocate around other than Asking for things. And, so that this was the first item. The first item across the board on the chopping block was rather alarming,, given the fact that we're still lining up at farmer's markets to buy produce, and yet at the very place we would drop off that compost. You can't do it anymore. So. Is there any potential for drop off? Sites. I'm, not the curve there at all, or that's completely been eliminated. Um, well. As of now, Much of the funding seems to be eliminated. Out of the draft. Budget. What I will say is that over the past two years, we expanded the we expanded the number of bootstrap drop off sites that are listed on our map. It's annotation. Hudson, River Park trust is running some of those drop offs. And. The way we did that. We did. We didn't have funding,, but we had a goal to add about 60, more sites. And. We had been funding at that time in the beginning, the beginning of 2018. We started doing this 97 sites that we were funding through our partners,, the ones I just mentioned, and also grow. My see and So we opened up. The community hosted bootstrap Java, program. So. If you seen those orange those big orange square. Signs that say public bootstrap drop off site created those as part of that program for volunteer run sites to open up to the public.. And accept food scraps drop off sites, and if they were open, regularly. Like six consecutive months of the year with a minimum and then once at least once a week at the same time, every week,, then we would list them on our map. So. There should have it in front of me, but I'm That makes those sites. It's approximately 60 I believe 60 sites. Right. Now I will double check that if you'd like. Those sites can test it. You know,, we were not funding them were happy.. I know that we would be happy to list them on a map. When. You know when we're out of the emergency response: mode. And, when we make that map active again on our website. However, You, want acknowledge that there are major concerns about those sites being very overwhelmed,, especially given this ascension of the curbside composting program and also another key factor, is that Many of those sites. were actually able to run public food scrap drop off sites because they were enrolled in curbside composting, service. And. So a lot of those sites. I think especially men. They also were not They weren't, making their own compost,. They were. They were running the drop off site,, but then sanitation with collecting and so really realistically It will be all of the sites. Opening back up. Again. Right. Any comments from the committee.. And I, don't see anything in the public, place. You know,, one thing I just wanted to mention is that,. You know,, under Alan's leadership on aces. We, came up with a survey that we surface to block associations about the Department of sanitation, cuts,. You know, specifically looking at for data around the priorities in our neighborhood. For, these costs and they giving us some other data points and verbatim quotes help to advocate for this. So, you know,. Maybe that might be something you know obviously I defer to The chairs here as well as Alan, but you know might be something that we can incorporate some of that invoice. Our support for these programs that you know. Totally agree are completely on vital.. I certainly would entertain that and I was going to ask them to be okay with a letter formalizing. Our concerns that this composted, the citywide composting effort, was so aggressively cut, As a whole,, and perhaps we can incorporate some of what he has put together as well. And, our letter. Leslie Was, going to ask you, Jeffrey, um,. This is going to be coming up in the budget. Task Force meetings, I guess,, like where the priority is and I Wonder. If that's the appropriate thing, we can just fold this into our budget. Our budget question because that's certainly going to be coming. Up. But we've also never sort of formally This was a part of, like, the as they appropriately pointed out, a part of the emergency action around Covid-19 response. So,, you know, it's sort of like when something's there, probably stays. But, once it gets taken, away. You, know,, so,, um,, so I'm have the inclination,. I would like a letter on this out of the committee of people would be okay with that Marty, I think it should go. To the administration with a CC to the Speaker and the sanitation, Commissioner. So, the question is,, where did. Where does the funding come from and how much does it need? We have to be talking to people who are involved.. I guess I just want to register an objection that there are many other things that the representation is responsible for Including streets weeping and that seems to have no problem roaring back to life and then turn back off, um, you know, I, will ad hoc. Um,, so I listen, I'd be writing the letter. So. We don't want to do it., That's fine,. We folded into our budget, asks that I'd like direction accordingly, salad. Yeah,. So So I, sorry Okay., Okay, I, agree with the letter. Writing.- I think we should do it because you're right,, once it's gone,, it's gone., And I, think that we should propose some sort of a compromise. I mean I know it's expensive, and I know about Cobra and roll the budget cuts. But if we could just salvage a semblance of it where we have pickups at certain locations versus just wiping the whole slate. That's meaningful,, because then it's easier to revive in person instead of just killing the whole program. Once it's killed. So let's keep it alive, where we can as economically as we can. Until we get through this time. And, then we can restore it to where we'd like to see it restored,, but that it's not dead. That's. What I would like to see in the letter. That sounds good to me. Alan, something to add. Yeah, just to follow up. With me,. We have A survey going out. Hopefully. We can find out already to Black associations and some other community groups. Perhaps. If we get some quick response, we can fold in some of that information that we get from the community in terms of the letter that we send to the administration to the Speaker's office. I'm, fine, with that. I, don't know how soon. You want to get the letter out. But I think This was to be through our normal process. Right, of, like,. Let's do this. Now, let's bring this up at You know and have the letter voted on it, the full board meetings. So. Maybe the survey wouldn't incorporate, but I really liked Sally's a suggestion that I think I'd like to package into emotion. If. You guys would entertain it the idea of a compromise that, while we recognize the need for budget cuts across the board at all agencies- and this was an aggressive first tack on a very green important initiative that has seen really great growth over the years. And that we'd like to see some of the funding restored to provide some greater access for compost, drop, off. Okay,, so we'll just throw you the information, and if it's no in time for your letter, we can add on to it. Okay, great. And, like just posted the survey in the chat. So. Thank you for that Blake, Sal,, you're. Okay with that emotion, is there is there? Is there a second on that. Thank, you,, Leslie. Um,, any objection, I would Learn to Sorry. Is a possibility on this letter to acknowledge Sorry,. Is there any possibility to acknowledge that we would like funding for composting be done,, but that whatever plan comes into place, keeps into mind. The seriousness of code right like have a mess density at a drop off area is incredibly Decatur. So like if he isn't why in the marriage? To revive this, to add money in the plan also include Opportunity to speak, like sufficiency. Sure. I'm, fine, with that. JD. Did. You have a question. I'm opposed to this letter, I like Leslie suggestion of wrapping it into the budget. Task Force. I really think given so much. We all have to deal with,, including sanitation., That I. Don't think this letter will be perceived received with quite The import that we take it. So I'd rather be incorporated into the budget task. Force. I think that's more effective. So I'm not I'm against a letter. Thank you know, um,, any other objections, Sally. No, I'm, not object., I'm,, I'm, fine, with,, I, don't care where we put it. It just has to be Yeah, exactly., He, fine., It's, okay in the budget lead,, we should put it in the most appropriate place where it's going to get the attention it deserves. I'm, not looking to necessarily make a separate letter,, but I just don't want to see us kill. The program. There was a time when the program was first Implemented before it was rolled out when we could just go to the green mark and we could just go to a few places and then As as it became more and more popular was rolled out. So, let's go back to phase one, or as minimal as possible to keep it alive. Where. The letter goes is to me secondary if it's a suggestion to make it go in the most appropriate place where it's going to get the most attention. That's what we should be doing. Well,. If the committee would indulge me as the former second vice chair of the board. I recognize that Issues, like this get pretty low on our list, quite frankly, in the budget. So I would ask that we do write this letter, separately, and likewise requested to be included in our budget request. As well. So I'd like to move forward on the motion. I have one objection. Any other objections to the letter., Any abstentions or President, not eligible JD, I appreciate the grand and likewise. The objection. But the letter, passes. Thank, you., Well, Our next item, and thank you to the proper sanitation. I know. This, did my impression was that at us,, obviously you're spearheading a program. That's getting taken out from under your feet. A, very fast updates on So. Thank you, guys. Thank, you., Thank you,. Thank you, john Thank you. Absolutely. I'm on pier 76 you'll recall earlier this year, it became a flashpoint for the governor. That's. A report very quickly put together a task. Force, unfortunately, right as the task force was coming up with recommendations. A pandemic hit. The task force has since been put on hold,, but the board myself and level have certainly been Keeping it on the toe pound on NYPD radar, and we are continuing to expect updates from them accordingly,, given the fact that the Governor has, as part of the budget, has deadlines in place for relocating the operations of the pier as they relate to To, pound Wasn't, hoping to have discussion on that. So. If everybody's okay, with that update. I'd like to move to the next item. Which, is regarding another of our peers in the Hudson River Park access to pure 86, which of course is inherently hot tied to the intrepid, and we all know the museum and pier in Hell's Kitchen.. That. Here was closed as a part of,, you know, the state of being put on pause by the governor,, given the fact that we are clamoring for public space and how crowded Hudson River Park is We were alarmed and upset by the fact that this year was closed. And. While we recognize that it's, in a sense, tied to the operations of the intrepid, we were no less., Please buy that. It's. Also been our long understanding, You know the The intrepid, at least with the city, long before the Hudson River Park existed,, and they have long been renegotiating a new lease. With, the park. And. So we thought it was appropriate to sort of bring this issue up this evening and I believe the President of museum is joining us tonight and the intrepid also submitted a letter to the committee.. Which was in the Dropbox that explained their position, reasoning for closing the pier and likewise with what they're responsible for as it relates to Here at six before I took. Any questions from the committee, I want to pass it over,, Susan., You're, on. Thank you for joining us this evening and for your patience so wanted to give you an opportunity to address our some of our concerns. And. Your unmute It was very profound how I started now. I appreciate it, and I just first and foremost hope everybody in Yours around you are all healthy and safe and I have to start out by saying,. You know, I, totally understand this conundrum. You know, I, don't come at this, as you know, where this big steel, ship and there's anything That we should have over anybody else. The intrepid has been impacted in our family has been impact. Our intrepid family has been impacted, just like everybody else. Has. And as part of the executive order. We, had to close the museum. And. Along with that comes the pier,. As you probably all know, We operate the pier we maintain it. We, ensure it we staff it. We provide security. We provide bike paths crossing All of the all of those elements that allowed the peer to be active and open to the public and to our visitors. So. Under this executive, order, though. We also had a follow allowing only essential staff and the most minimum amount possible in order to secure the premises. So,. As you may or may not have seen, the parking lot across the street is locked, up. Nobody can enter., Nobody can exit. We don't have security over there.. We are using the security for both the pier and for the ship and And unlike,. Unlike other areas of the park. Unlike other peers, HRP,, it does not Hudson River Park does not provide any kind of staffing, For us. And. So in order for us to protect both visitors,, whether it is just to appear or to the ship and protect our staff. We have that minimal amount and we cannot maintain it. Now,. We cannot do what we need to do to make sure that it's safe and secure for anybody to come on. So that,, that's the impetus for it being closed and we are working towards reopening like everybody, else's. As, you know, I, am sure we're in Phase four of four phases. Once. The pause is unpause in our area and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that we can bring it back and open up all areas as soon as possible. Thank you for that. Susan,. Thank you for the letter,, a couple of hands going: up. Lowell Hi, thank you. Jeffrey part of my concern about this. Is that you know more and more. I mean, we've been trying to work with each other for a long time to make. This seem less. Like a private peer But, this really hit home for me that it really is a private peer. It's open when the intrepid says it's open., It's, closed. When, the intrepid says it's closed. Admission is through the intrepid metal, detectors. Um,. We did finally get the exit moved, so you can go on to the pier for nothing without having exit through the gift shop,. But this really is a private peer, and at this point I'm You know what bothers me about. That is not that the intrepid has a private peer,, but the that the intrepid does not pay rent for their private peer Um,. The other Jeffrey, I think you have that this slide to have the slide accessible from the working group,, the other people who don't pay rent for the pier or the community, boathouse And I think that's, I, don't even remember. Who else was,, but it was it's people who are not making money. Doing this and I know the intrepid is a not for profit,, but You're Susan you're dealing in a lot bigger dollars than the community boathouses every other peer, even not for profits. Bob tallies group downtown Manhattan. Youth pays rent for the pier and, you know,, I, understand, that. You, know, Visitors have dropped off to the intrepid, and you know your revenue is not going to be what it's like, but you know Frankly, between the intrepid and the trust. I'm more concerned about the trust's finances than the intrepid finances and I'd really like to see the intrepid, since you basically have a private, pure paying for a private peer Will. You allow me to address a couple of those points, because it's actually an elephant. I feel like in the room that is so long overdue to address and I appreciate your bringing all of that up and That's up to Jeffrey I'm fine. With the response. There. I appreciate, that., A, couple. Just a couple of points, and you know we have felt that has been the perception. Right. Yes. You pay $1 a year,. There's no doubt that in the typical sense of rent., That is what transpires between us in Hudson River Park, trust. But, unlike other peers. I, don't think what What is recognized is that we pay over $400,000 a year out of our operational budget, and that is strictly for maintenance of the up land. For security,, not to mention a million dollars of insurance that we have to pay ourselves, that we do pay the bike path, folks, that we do pay for the utilities. And. All of that comes out of our own pocket. And. So that's about a million dollars a year to maintain what is that hundred thousand square foot. pier. So? It is all it's all. On us. Part of that whole deal of building appear for the for the morning of the intrepid was that we would operate, maintain and pay for those costs going forward., And I know. You know that there is a new Lease you'll shortly be seeing there are additional expenses were paying for. We're going to be paying for what it's going to be marine Repairs. Now of the pier and we're going to be paying for a part of the Hudson River park that we don't even have any rights to for repairs to that and maintenance, and so that is I, don't, I, don't think that's been Known or recognized, and I just want, I guess, to be able to say that in lieu of friend, it is an expense that Hudson River Park does not have to pay And, so they may not receive direct dollars for it,, but instead they're not paying for it, and we are up keeping this peer in its own right. Jeffrey, Mann., Sure,, um,, Whoa., JD Jeffrey recognized me to get On it. You know, part of it, Susan. I understand what you're saying,, but take, for example, pure 57, which are XR, has a master lease for they are responsible for the entire upkeep of the pier. Now, I'm, not saying the intrepid should pay. What r XR is paying in rent. For. The pier. But I think there's probably somewhere between $1 and whatever it is R XR pays or Chelsea piers pays where they're responsible for those peers that would be, you know, would help the trust's finances immensely. Low, but we are, we're not for profit,. They are a multi billion dollar companies, I mean not Chelsea piers, but Chelsea piers is a for profit. Company. We are, and you can look on all of our all of our financials of $35 million company now. We're, also a zero base,, not for profit. So, any monies that we make, over and above the red. Over and above the expenses that we have goes right back into serving the community. With programming and just I want to paint a picture. But. We had over a million visitors. Last year. We just cleared a million visitors. Last year, 10 years in a row. And, we had 150,000 140 6000, to be exact visitors who came on the pier for free. And. Now we also,, we also have to, and I know. The magazine has been a big challenge and a big issue. But I just want to quote something because I wanted to bring this up. If I had the chance, and that is The New York City Police Department did a security and vulnerability assessment of our peer of our of our property in 2016 And I quote an active shooter, hostile takeover or detonation of an improvised explosive device at the museum would cause heavy casualties and collateral. Damage. Because of the museum's location and number of visitors on any single day. The perceived affiliation with the military and indirect relationship with veteran communities and other at risk. Groups. further increases the risk of a hate crime incident or an act of terror,. The volume and density of visitors, combined with the physical constraints of the facility, also adds to the risk. That is why we want everybody to go through the mags, and we work together, you and I, and Dan when we walked to the pier and we walked to the Welcome Center. To try to make it as seamless. We said that whatever is the shortest possible line that is out. There is where people who want to go for free can enter the signage is there. Will move. We move the signage according to what is the shortest line and they get a ticket that says free access, because that is also for insurance purposes, and it gives the disclaimer that they're going on to the pier. And so,. So everything is done with a purpose of safety and caution,, but that we spend a huge amount of our budget,, a large portion of our budget, maintaining and operating back here, and we also I mean it. You know,. We have also spent so much time fundraising to build that year. So we spent we raised $60 million in 2006 to eight. We spent 10 million of our own money to redo that peer We've raised $8 million to build a cogent plants so that we can take down that growth structure of a heating and cooling tower on our, on our Peer we already implemented that. And. Now we've raised 4.6 million to take down that cooling, tower. So. We can open up 4000 square feet more of parkland. Which is under that and rebuild. What is still wouldn't piles under that and make it the concrete. The concrete piles and more open space. So So we're raising money. That's designated strictly restricted monies for the capital projects to open up space. We're trying to protect the visitors, both those who want to come on to the intrepid and just onto the pier. We offer free amenities on the pier Wi Fi. We have a cafe. We have all we have free exhibit on the pier. So we're doing rethink, and this is said with humility. We think we're doing everything we possibly can to try to engage And bring in the community. On top of the fact that we have in the community that we offer free programs out to the public. And, we asked the public. Come on. You know, to us free Fridays, astronomy, nights, movie nights, festivals., Come on, and have a plethora of activity and content for free. So,. So this is killing us at the pier is closed. Today. I mean we all want to go back there and I understand. If the summer is coming along and rolling along and we need open, space. I mean, We're gonna have to try to figure something out for everyone's mental health. We get that, but I just I hope, there's a better understanding, Of the significance of the dollars we spend to make the pure better to keep the pure safe to open it up and to protect all of the people that are coming. Our way. I'm Thank, you,, Susan., JD You're on mute., Sorry., I, understand your concerns. I'm sure we all do., But I, have to ask Since the intrepid came. In. It has been a dispute with the intrepid and the community about the public access. It's gotten a lot better. Now,, but you still have to go through to get onto the pier. I. Go there now and then to see how it works and it works. Well. You've made improvement, but I don't understand. This. This is a public peer. The side is a public peer And. Are you saying you cannot. It's? How can you close a public peer It's? Not your peer., So I'm. Just helped me out. Here. It's. It is the way that our agreement is with the Hudson River park that we have to maintain it,. We have to ensure it. We have to do all of that. And during this I'm asking who Who CLOSE THE PUBLIC peer We're under the guy side. Just talking about the north side. It's, a public peer who closed it. Where we under the guidelines of the executive order, consistent with closing the intrepid had to close the pier. Because. We can only allow As., Excuse me,, wait one second, as a byproduct as a byproduct of who we are allowed to have as a central workers. There. We cannot protect the public and we would be liable if you tripped and fell Because it hadn't been swept and there had been gravel or there was a puddle,, and in this crazy weather there was ice under that puddle. You'd be suing us for that, and we have nobody there to take care of that ice for that moment., Okay, that's,. That's not my issue. I understand where you're saying, I would suggest to Jeffrey and Marty that we raised the concern that a public peer has been closed. Because. The intrepid apparently says they cannot have maintenance to open up. I, don't know any other peer publicly in the Hudson River park. That has been closed without rationale: I, don't know! If there is a and I don't know this at all. So I claim ignorance,. If there's another entity. That relies on their day to day operational business, revenues. So, while we have fundraise to do all the capital improvements, we rely on our operational revenue to pay for that and we are at zero right now. Zero And Susan, I understand,, but it was part of the original agreement with the community. That would be an accessible. Here. You have to maintain it, whether or not It's open or closed so I just am asking Jeffrey and Marty that we examine this. A little further. It's been a I understand, Susan's, a lot of pressure and a lot of concerns. I understand that at the same time, I think the board should Insist. That is public peer, not be closed. Out of concern that suddenly they can't maintain it as they did. Before. Not maintain not protected. We can't protect people on there right, now. And, as soon as we can start bringing our team back. That is when it can be opened up again with the appropriate protocols. I understand. Susan, for that JD, and thank you, Susan, a lot for walking us through that and giving a painting. Quite frankly, a very full picture. To, to your point that hadn't been aired in a long time. One of the things that is I, think distinct about the situation. Is. The fact that the intrepid couldn't exist without the pier and our Hudson River Park couldn't exist without its peers. And. The Hudson River park it whether it's the way that it was created or not needs revenue to exist, and we have long been advocates of our park and it always seems to come across as us,. You know, disliking the intrepid I. Actually, don't think. That's the sentiment that the committee has ever wanted to express. It's unfortunate. The way that this tends to play itself out because we recognize, you know,. We've had presentation with you guys in the past, around your cost of school programming,, the number of folks in the district that memberships. And we totally Recognize the arts and cultural value of the institution. Not, just in New York City. But, as the country as a whole. Our focus, has always been about public access to the pier and so JD I think memorializing. Your point is important.. And I also think just recognizing that, as the intrepid is continuing conversations and looking at least with the Hudson River Park. We can air what we think might be an appropriate thing to consider. In the confines of Elise around access. So Chris, I saw your hand just go up,, but I think I want to steer clear of any. You know: Dislike. I'm, not sure the right word. I'll find it when we're writing the letter,, but to really clarify on this, what are,, what our trustees, here. Chris, To, piggyback on Jeff JD and on Most importantly,. We understand what the intrepid means, what it means, as a living memorial to the British iteration or victory over fascism. Right. Now we're in an incredible space. I took A bite for the first time today. After, like two months. With 11 Memorial, this open door, there is a public space. I understand wanting to protect one of our nation's, like Identifying markers of greatness. But. At the same time,. We really need Park, space., And I've always said we can leave our space and whether or not it's been northern portion that fear or the Chinese appear. I. Think our resident here in Hell's, Kitchen from overcrowding and potentially starting as a way of Infections, is a priority, just,. You know, for this community for the for the city. So. It would be nice to have here at for open,, especially as we get greener and lower days while we're locked out- and it doesn't seem like a lot of Times, too., So, you're, right. I- think we should memorialize something a letter or make effort to ensure that their next release doesn't make them feel as if they're, the onus is on me. Cases emerging like this ever again. To shut down something that we desperately, ain't. We know we need to see it on your social media,, but even calling for open streets,. We need more open spaces. Yes, thank you., Yes,, I, believe, Nora is still here., She can comment, and then we have the electives on the line. So Wonder. What their thoughts are. Hey., Hi., Yeah, I am still here.. I'm sorry. You see me. Hi. I am still here.. Um, You know, I think that the fact That Hudson River Park is responsible for ensuring or doing the best we can to think about people. Safety does matter. You know,. This point. Susan is making about How. Do you lead people onto the pier when there is no staff to facilitate that there? You know it's a different periods,, not a landscaped, Park, pier. It's appear that was landscaped. You know, basically for lots of people to come on to it. Principal a for the purpose of the museum,, but also for views and other things like that. So. I do think that is a not that needs to be solved,. No matter. What. And I think that is a valid concern for Susan and the park to suggest needs to be considered.. Everything exists within the context of a history. I mean, I've, been to many meetings. Susan has to You know where I know. We know that community board for has before my time before Time you know the when the internet came to the to the community. The promises that were made about public access were inherited,, at least by the trust. And. We want as much public access as we can have. That is our goal. I mean, before everything else we're a park,. We want that to happen. The circumstances of the closure and everything else like that are not easy and like interpreting what is essential. You know, I, mean,, JD,, I totally,, totally hear your question really. Do. But I also think that the physical configuration of the intrepid and everything else like that isn't The same as, like,. If we had closed. I don't know period before right, I mean they're, they're. The expectations when you get on to appear that has lots of stair towers and other things like that were designed to be able to get people on to the intrepid are different and From our Perspective running security,. We would have to look at things like that,. Where do people hide where you know sightlines all those things we talked about for peer 97, So I am not the business person at all.. Susan can vouch for me on that on anything to do with the renegotiations for the intrepid. Please I do now,, having worked once for Community Board for a long time ago before the park, that this is a long standing, issue. How. Do we get public access to the park, so My only comment at the moment is that I understand kind of what you're all saying you know it is people want and need more open space right, now. The park is under enormous pressure. For that you all know the crowding problems that were the poster child of excess crowding for the for, you know, in the cove area. And you know, I,. We can talk with interrupted, for sure. To, see what's involved in this. But I, don't have an answer for you, Brad, or anyone else here, right, now, other than to say that I think you know we're We're hearing both perspectives, discussed, I, can say Thank you for that boring. Low I get all The issues about access. I, understand that, you know,, Homeland Security says the intrepid is a potential target and that you need certain security there I'm at the point now where You know, we've done everything we can see, Susan. I know: we've worked with you before I think we've done everything we can. To make this as public as we can, it to me.. It comes back down to the money if there are other not for profits, paying rent for their use of the parts of parts of the park. And, you know,. Let's just talk about the not for profits: Manhattan, youth., The, boathouse, they're, all paying some kind of rent. I. Don't understand why the intrepid is A desire. Is your did your hand intentionally go back, up. Very,, very briefly, just her address no rain. All I'm suggesting is that the board, get involved in these discussions about that peer that it does not become a set completely where we have not really discussed the access to the public. Peer. This is a long standing. Issue. I appreciate what citizens going through. I think we all do., But I, think we need to be involved., Jeffrey and Marty in the discussions about how to resolve this. Thanks, Judy. Thank, you all for this. Any other comments from the committee, Alan. Thank you ever So. The two issues is access which is security. And, then there's the money, situation. Maybe would help. To understand what Susan was pointing out in terms of what they pay out and what other sections of the park don't pay out. If it isn't a burden on the trust, they can do an analysis for us. What people are paying and what they're not paying for. Instead of someone saying, well,, we pay this. We pay this. They, don't pay to freaky, get maybe a spreadsheet,, maybe something simple, just to point out what Other sections of the pocket paying in rent and getting back from the trust in terms of Maintenance or whatever and see how that compares to the traffic there. And. Then this way you can see where money isn't going or should be going or isn't going in, you know, highlight what the real numbers are. The security issues, I think is very important., And I think it's something that may be untold things: straight. Now, maybe folks have to loop without having access for a while,. We all have to make sacrifices. Again, that's,, that's something the trust has to work. Out. I think with the intrepid in terms of Getting access for the public. I mean, they have to be. The Trust has to be sure that They're securing the public and the intrepid has to, you know, before right in saying in terms of what they can do, what they can't do. So we've got two issues: here. But, I think the money thing we maybe, I get it. Is that a burden in this in this time for somebody in accounting to come up with something. So we can see how it lays down on paper in terms of who's, paying what night. Thank you. Nora. And. Is there anything On that Um, we have the ranch information relatively readily accessible, but, as Susan said, there are other, you know, who's responsible for maintaining appears who's responsible for other aspects of security or whatever that vary from place to place. That is not quite as readily accessible, so I will say: that, yeah,, that,, that information will all be public.. It probably will take us a bit of time to assemble the full picture instead of just yeah the ranch part of it. Okay. Um I we're not seeing any comments or questions from the public. Um. Any. Other questions from the committee or comments from the committee. So. Some of this seems to like it needs to be memorialized. Certainly JD had A suggestion around that. I am interested in hearing what you'd like to have be a part of a motion. JD I'm sorry,, asking me, Jennifer. Yes. Do. You have something Yes,, I, would. I suggest we write a letter to the Hudson River, Park and Susan to express our Appreciation of the intrepid and Susan's theory of the intrepid and that we are concerned about the closing of the public part of the pier and we'd like to sit down and talk about it and discuss How to reopen it without Harm to the intrepid Something like that,, mainly a discussion and also perhaps involving the Hudson River, Park least I. Think lol is concerned about that as well. But I'm just suggesting we thank the intrepid. We say how much we appreciate them, but we'd like to talk about the public peer Okay., Like, I, see you nodding. Anybody else on that. In that regarding that as a whole,, we are interested in not just the short term reopening of the pier but figuring out Ways to both make it I think both Doreen and Susan's point a safer peer generally, not just the hard scape than it is today. And. How that can be incorporated in any consideration given and then negotiations ongoing, At, the intrepid and the trust. Jeffrey,, and we are. We are cognizant. Where of the difficulties the intrepid is facing, providing security. We were aware of that. Okay. Anything else on that, folks. Is there, a second on the motion. Thank, you,, Chris. Um,, any objections., abstention, abstentions or present not eligible Okay emotion carries Susan,. Thank you for duking it out this evening and staying with us until 930., We really appreciate it., And I think like you. We, just as much want phase for to happen just as quickly as phase one can so best of luck and thank you very much., Thank you. Goodnight, everyone, Take care, um, final moment of the item on the agenda. There. Did. The Allen did ask to bring up a point of old business. That I think we all hope is short.. With regards to the budget,. The mayor has already made considerable cuts to this year's we're operating under the current fiscal year. Which ends at the end of June,. We have a new budget,, the beginning of July, those discussions,. The budget hearings are actually ongoing right. Now. I think it's important for the committee to think. Through a number of things. I know, we raised the compost thing. But. There have been multiple articles around in the New York Times,, the journey. The journey. The Wall, Street Journal,, as well as others around the devastating cuts that the parks department is going to be facing just in the time of what we will most desperately be needing. Our, parks. We all know what that means,, whether it's a reduction in pruning of weeding of,, you know, security,, all that kind of stuff. So. Besides those two items and recognize it., I, know. I, don't know if we want to prioritize what type of parks asked, we want to do based on our other asks. But is there anything else that The committee would like in our sort of more urgent budget, items. And I see what raised your hand. I'm. Sorry about that. Do I have mine up to Your hand, is up.. Yes., Comments. I just wanted to say: I hit the wrong button last time and you didn't get to vote,, but I'm voting for both of them. Okay. Thank, you. Any other You know,. We always ask for our comfort stations and we asked for, you know,. We put Hell's Kitchen Park back on the map in terms of a renovation. We. I'm, trying to think, off the top of my head. I've, been taking through all that I think the parks department's budget is about., I, think I read 590 million and there's already an $84 million cut on the table,, which is massive.. Everybody's got that. Now, you know, I mean,, it's All But. What is our Is our priority? Park safety.? And security? Is it general Park maintenance, you know, tree limb, pruning garden, maintenance, sports, fields., I, welcome thoughts on that. Otherwise,. We will I think repackage what we've done in the past,, based on the priorities that we've done in the past. And, and, sort. Of, you know, keep those as they are. Yeah, sounds good.. Any I don't see any other hands. Yes. Briefly,. What I'm, having a hard time hearing you. You're Very, far away. Even, though I'm in meat packing and you're in Hell's, Kitchen. I'm, still not getting that throw in the chat. Box. I will Thank you. I heard you'll, throw it in the chat, box. Um,. So with that everybody will I, guess repackage and you know just highlight our long held priorities. Around, our parks and environmental asks in the budget and the budget Task Force, I'm, Alan I said you at all business. Good. Thank you. Coach, here. I'll make this brief,, but I did want to say. I hadn't been to the park in quite a while, since this whole Crisis. I was there for that big weekend in May,, which everybody heard about. And I just wanted to give a shout out to the Before I started, I want to give a shout out to the staff of Hudson River park for the condition that the park is in. It is an absolutely beautiful, shape. Or, given the circumstances that they're working on the now with the limited schedule and everything else. The guys are doing a wonderful,, wonderful, job. And. If we can write a letter. thanking them. I, think we should. But, if not, I'm, sure, Noreen can pass it along. But there was one thing I had missed when I was out there on that beautiful day, it was the sound of the helicopters. So. By think we don't want to take our eye off the ball on this. Yes,, Mr., Kern The last time I was there was about a month and a half ago, so So right, Alan. You are so right. I haven't heard The head, it was limited. Activity there. But there was still chop is on the ground idling for considerable amount of time. They were still coming in very close to the to the walkway at the southern end. I think there are still safety and security issues. Due to some prodding earlier. This year,, the A company, did start to implement some safety features, where they would have somebody watching the cars coming in over the walkways and the bicycle. Paths. We did a letter back in November, about our concerns. We haven't heard anything back on that yet. Maybe. We should follow up. But, perhaps going forward. Since things are going to start getting busier, hopefully in a positive, way., I'm sure a blade will start activating again with their helicopter runs,. Perhaps we can have With the park in terms of what the protocol is going to be to safeguard people on the walkway of the bicycle paths and securing security, some of the issues in that site. So I won't take up any more your time, but I. Think, let's not forget about those birds. Thank you. And, please nori. Until the guys that are doing a wonderful, job. Thank you very much., I mean, I will say that we, I have been in the park a few times. I'm going in. Once or, you know, once or twice every two weeks, and the park does look great. And. Thank you for noticing. Our,. Our horde staff is so proud of it there so protective of it still When. They couldn't come back. When we were on our most skeletal staff,. They were like itching to come back. Every single one of them is worried about their particular area and the weeds growing and everything growing and they really want to be there.. We do have more people Field staff, starting to come back now, and we appreciate you noticing. Thank, you., Thank, you. I'll, be the voluntary soon.. Safely though. We got to make sure it's safe. Thank you. Um,. Thank you for that. Level. And Alan. Sorry,, I'm, Alan, lol, Lot of l's I'm Chris,, the point on, do it. That was just returned. Last year, I can tell you, it looks beautiful. And, I'm, really happy. Even, though I complained about it being done over Memorial Day weekend. Last year. That lawn is in stellar condition and it's been a pretty remarkable to watch that part transition from an active play field to a picnic., And and sort of very passive massive field,. Given the ban on active sports, um, with regards to cruise ship measures. I, don't know that other committees per view is to say, Tell shouldn't be soliciting Sales for tickets right, now., Um, Does. Anybody feel that is in the purview of the committee,. You know,, we had talked to Martin I, had conversations, etc. Around shore power and specifics to cruise ships. But obviously,. That was Marty,. I think it was three and a half, three, four months ago or 25 years ago, is what it feels. Like. Don't listen. It was 20 years ago. That I did start it that Fair, when totally fair on that point, um,, So, Chris,, I, definitely Recognize, The, concern. I think it speaks to the lack of education around the issue,, not necessarily the cruise ships desire. To to You know,, make money. With that it was more about the state of health and safety measures, they're taking when they eat grass and Ingress on the ship. Yes, it just Yeah.. I, don't know that it's Jermaine If people,, the majority feel strongly Obviously,. It's a committee,. We can do that. Um,, but It's, it's, I. Guess we could write a letter on that the, you know, airlines, I guess,, too. So, it's It sucks,, quite frankly, Well,, it does., I, mean,. First of all, we're the Environmental Committee. What we ought to be doing is commanding everyone for the less pollution we have so much less than we had before. They see how all of this happened. I mean,. We had much, much more. And,, and now we have incredibly less. If you've looked at the maps of the pollution, it's,, it's amazing., Absolutely. He wasn't gonna bring this up. I'll just started out there cuz it's gonna, it's gonna come up in a few months. Anyway, I've been talking with Brad's office and then some members of some local block associations about getting the cruise ship. I'm getting into the electric power. To plug in,. Don't let that that's what I was referring to with regards to show to Our right. Yeah,, exactly., So, Party, and I? Had a GM, Go, ahead., Sorry., Marty and I. Had a conversation. I think it was back in December, January that the Sunday Times to the big Expo say yeah at the terminal. When brought it to the committee's attention. Many of us for on it. I'm, Marty and I had a discussion with etc around it and the specifics of developing a short power plan at the Manhattan cruise terminal, um, of course,. This was all pre pandemic., Yep., And I think that it would be appropriate to bring this up in and in the next month. Um agenda. As a formal item. And, we can ask,, etc. To come forth. Accordingly. Well, I'll email, you separately, because there has been some behind the scenes: movement on that. As. Far as Legislation on the topic as Well, so. Okay, awesome. Great, thanks., Okay,, Alan, I, see you grinning. So I'm, going to take that as a motion to close out this meeting. I want to thank everybody for their patience for their diligence for their willingness to look us all like Hollywood Squares and try to find the camera at the same time. So, Let me the gorilla. And the gorilla. With that everybody as they say. Thank you and good night. Good night. Bye guys. Thank you. Take care., Thank, you., Everybody., Thank, you.
