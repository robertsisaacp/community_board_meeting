By way of background back in June, I created a social justice working group to deal with the issues that arose in our district, specifically following the murder in Minneapolis and the subsequent protests here in new york and the rise of the black lives.
It was thought that, aside from just creating the social justice task force as an ongoing entity, subject to open meeting laws, we should put some guard rails in place as to what is within their scope and what is not within their scope, since it's not very clear as it is for something like waterfront parks and environment, so they met.
The bylaws require only require that the chair consult with the executive committee before creating a task force, but I'd like to put this to a vote tonight based upon what viren and katie present so everyone.
We made up about a dozen or 15 recommendations that people reviewed and then voted on and approved, and one of them was to continue the work that had been started by the group, in whatever format you will deem reasonable, and one of the recommendations also was that we include, in the name of whatever format, goes forward sort of anti-racism or racial equity or something We really are addressing the issue of race as well.
It was important to our group in our proposal for all of you that it be focused that the efforts be focused on our district, What we've written in this mission statement is that the mission would be to engage the community to understand their concerns regarding racism and discrimination and to take a proactive role in facilitating measurable progress towards social and racial equity and equality in our district.
It would be called something like social and racial equity task force or whatever format you guys want to approve us and again, it's really.
You may recall, the things that we've already said that we're interested in focusing on in those recommendations, included, sort of police, accountability, issues and figuring out ways to facilitate more community outreach and involvement and intersectionality between the police and some of the youth groups, and also seeing how we might be able to help some of the young people get access to sort of mentoring and job training and things.
You know we are not interested in being an end run around any other committee and that if an issue is brought to us and it falls clearly within the purview of some pre-existing cb4 committee- that we would forward it on to them or if it seems like.
And, I think, like I, think you covered most of it, but exploring the overlaps with standing committees and the issues that might come up to those standing committees that may sort of be referred to the social justice task force or whatever name.
It's not like this group, is going to sort of start policing every agency in the city or everything that happens in the district.
It's about addressing whatever comes up there, two social justice group within the sort of this task force or two other committees.
Think those are the sort of generally speaking, the kind of issues that people have brought up and last, but not least, is education, and that is sort of right.
Certainly don't think that we are going to be solving racism anytime soon or that we are doing it at all and that we didn't want it to just be like a committee that makes sort of grandiose, lovely sounding statements and doesn't do anything.
We are not actually and we can propose solutions and sort of ideas towards solutions, but we can't implement any of those directly and just like any other community facilitates people to come and talk to us to the community and get communities, input and then sort of propose thoughts about whether it translates into a letter that gets written to a particular agency through the board process or similar to what we did with derek ingram situation or in many cases it might not even be something that the task force does.
It might be an issue that actually gets referred back to the land, use committee or the housing committee, or you know any of the other committees which is where it has a sort of you know So, that's the kind of a background with which the task force is going to it kind of becomes the kind of platform where people come and you know find their sort of frustrations their opinions and their right.
If this, if the sort of the group collectively thinks that needs to be referred back to either the committee or there's something that we can directly engage with in terms of okay,, let's just think about drafting a letter to such and such agency.
If you want to open up economic issues- I appreciate the work that you know to put into this with the rest of the folks on the task.
When we talk about new projects being proposed, and we say make sure that there is a sort of some sort of employment component to it and then make sure that you know people of color, the minorities, X, y and z, issues are addressed in terms of you know: their stake in the activity of whatever you know, whatever the sort of financial or economic activity that takes place in our district, so the equity is a little more than equality.
Meetings, I mean you know when it comes to community board, for I might be totally wrong, I'm, actually relatively new, compared to everybody else, here, but define community.
The social justice task force, right, which is sort of a really big umbrella, but we were formed in response to some very specific events that were racially motivated, and so.
You know racial violence and murder, and so it was very important to us to use those words and to be explicit about it, And so, in fact, for a while, we were just saying: okay, we're going to focus on anti-racism and then others, said.
We have a charge that everyone who kind of comes by is our constituent boards are parochial by their nature and that's a good thing, because it gives the community voice right and people are not shy when they go to a facility or something like that.
Is people come with ideas or concerns and then refer it out, but don't reinvent the wheel, because certain committees are actually engaged with various organizations that can help what's going on so really academic, down, discussion about words, less just clear thoughtful as a forum for people to come and speak, that's good, and then we, but let's not promise the world when they come and speak.
These are very personal to people They're hard to talk about, and you just need to say, and I think the community itself needs a safe place for it to come and talk about these issues and it'll grow into something Or It may not.
If and it's local That's what we want a place for people from our neighborhoods, give them some kind of focus and structure to express something N't at this point, think.
Perhaps maybe we should look at that, so it doesn't have that implication that we're going to be solving something or or giving people some sort of implying that we're going to take care of something which, probably you know Maybe their own personal need to speak and to express themselves.
Perhaps, it's not a specific task force that coordinates with the committee, but perhaps it's a group, A working group that liaises with issues we're already dealing with that are on agendas of committees.
We made 15 recommendations, the so-called proposals, and they actually been sent back to the working group members for them to sort of pick on one or two items that they want to pursue further and further define and in terms of actionable items.
Let I'm not going to get too passionate about it, but there is racism and, let's acknowledge it, and just to clarify- When I said people coming in our community- The, the point I was trying to actually make people who live here and people who work here.
Think it's really important that our community board publicly make that statement that we have a group whatever we're called that is committed to having that space, an interest in dialogue on these topics.
You know you think it's really important, That, that we just wait and only respond to issues that are brought to us by the community, and I would just point out.
We heard through multiple press reports about something that had happened to a member of our community We did not wait to see if he would reach out to us, but instead we reached out to him, like frankly, to his lawyer first and then to him, but to say that you know we were very concerned as a community board about the way that community member had been treated, and we think that this raises bigger issues for everyone in our community, about accountability and sort of a variety of issues.
Whatever committee meeting that we wanted to raise with, because I think, frankly, that doesn't allow us to be as sort of proactive and current with concerns raised by our community as we would hope to be all right.
10 Midtown, north Midtown, south all have new cos now But I wanted to let this group know that we signed on to a letter from gail brewer's office that was joined by dick godfried and robert jackson, basically reiterating everything we have been saying about the homeless situation on 36th street.
I've been working and speaking with some of these providers on for a number of different reasons, some of them quality of life, some of them just finding ways to collaborate and partner with other folks who are looking to help, and one of the things I would like to do is think about is doing a drive.
A kimber board members drive for one, Then there I thought it would be also to include one of the other providers, one of the newer providers, who has has two different shelters in our district, who I think I've found to be extremely responsive and really actually a really fantastic provider, which is black vets for social justice, and they have two shelters, one on 36th street and one on 57th.
You know, a clothing store or something like that, wants to sort of be the main place where you members can go and purchase it, whether online or in person.
If we want to try to do local businesses, I'm completely open to that, once I get it or even presented as alternatives, If people know, stores that would be lo- would love to sell all their socks and their underwear and toothbrushes or something like that, then I think that would be lovely I.
You know they're working at in our district, While I think we have many people on our board.
But will allow us to better take the temperature of our constituents to understand the issues that they view as most concerning during this time, and particularly since we're getting new items, we've asked committees to come up with two to three items that are new and sort of covered again, recognizing that these are not things that are going to be acted on.
And I know they've shared over a draft which we'll work through and hope to get out before next week's board, meeting, and We're, I'm, looking to put together a way of for the co-chairs of the co-chairs and chairs of the committees to submit their revised budget requests online, so it A way of putting in additional ones new ones for this year, including Covid-19, specific in an edition and then Covid-19 specific.
My other two thoughts were who enforces and could this letter go to the hospitality organization either sent directly or copied and if there's any other restaurant organization, I think that should be involved It's I've seen some things where it's not exactly proper and on the outdoor, dining, and I was wondering who enforces this: it's enforced by D.O.T, so you're supposed to file a 3-1-1 You know the board office, and there is a follow-up, Good job burt.
The letter was coming at coming at it from and it was going to go to the full board, but because the city council is meeting tomorrow, we want you to come to exec first, so we would send it out with an exact vote.
