The committee members vote to write a letter of support or to make recommendations, and the most important thing for you to know.
We have asked Gotham to produce a great number of documents, because the board wants to make an independent evaluation of what it presented to us.
Gotham is committed to providing documentation to help you guys kind of sort through the problem on your own and is looking forward to working with the board to forge a path.
I work at Kasir, so we do community and government relations for Gotham anybody, any anyone else from Gotham in the meeting to just want to say anything before we go to the tenants.
I. Just find it very fascinating that there is even a question about whether or not to ensure that those residents still don't have the ability to have what was originally signed upon honored going forward, because their understanding was that was the type of rebate that or break that they were getting in their rent.
We, don't know enough to say it was or wasn't, but we do know enough that when this was found out instead of coming to the community board or elected officials and having a broad open discussion about some issue, they began to then litigate it or have questions with tenants and that's not the way to go.
That kind of thing, I mean, but we're all here to try to work it out and figure.
The utility credit comes from the state from the feds as a standard, but the oversight is at more than one location, because some of the projects were financed through state funded mortgages other through city funded mortgages, and we raised to Gotham.
It's clear that it's going to be state city agencies, the owner, Community Board elected officials and tenants, so.
It's for expectations is going to be quite a complex thing to unravel other questions from the committee before we go to tenants.
I. Just want to state at the outset that I'm, a tier three tenant in Gotham West, which means that I am in the moderate middle income group and I, was informed that I was not entitled to utility credit because of that status and that it was given to me in my original lease and in subsequent leases, as an error as a mistake.
I did not dispute that or have any issue with that, because it was such a small amount, but it was only at the time that I signed the lease that I learned that my 1623 dollars per month, rent included a utility allowance, but I was not even informed at that particular moment that was removable or temporary.
So I'm going to go ahead and state my case as follows: I'm here to speak about the issue of the utility credit that has been taken away.
Okay, I'm, going to thank you, and so that has been taken away to my understanding for more than a hundred several households under the affordable housing tendency at several properties owned by the Gotham property.
This issue has grown in scope and as per the tenants, we have continue and will continue to solicit and involve multiple resources, local officials, community groups and the community board, as we are this evening in hopes that you could put and help put some pressure on Gotham to reinstate this credit.
If I may I'd like to take you guys through several facts of my personal experience with this utility credit, issue.
I am talking about the ora and or the dhrc which I found out through my own research as listening to different other tenants, namely Gotham West as to what these offices were about, and why I should make a complaint to them.
Another fact is that Gotham stated in response to a letter written and sent to them by this community board that they assured everyone every tenant that was inquiring about the utility credit that they would be informed.
Gotham in that same letter also stated that they would definitely not take into consideration the reinstatement of the utility credit to the tenants of the Nicole that we needed to contact these alleged offices, the Ora and the Dhr, and make a complaint to them.
There was no real, solid indication as to a reason why this was being taken away, and it's just ridiculous when it comes to an issue that is very black and white on paper and for the Gotham to go ahead and do this without any information going out to the tenants that it's going to affect it's just unacceptable, especially in these times that we're living in you know with everything that we have up against us.
I'm, going to make this pretty brief, as I feel like a lot of the facts of the communication and the issues they're in have really been hit on by the tenants already.
It's really important to note that you know, as Gotham, was already dealing with complaints from tenants in Gotham West and already reinstating those credits based on Ora complaints or based on Hcr complaints.
It's also worth us noting that Gotham is continuing to develop in this area with the development and Covid-19 house and being involved in that in things that are related to nonprofits and to affordable housing and at the same time, is nickel and diming.
You know you have folks in the Nicole and in the Atlas discovering that their credits have been revoked in March of 2020 and the complaints and the organizing in Gotham West is starting in the fall of 2019.
Okay, I live in Gotham West, I'm a cure to low-income tenant.
We have located a dhcr decision from 2017, in which the agency took on the subject of the calculation of low income, tenants, rents at Gotham West and concluded with certainty that the utility allowance was properly deducted from the preferential rent pursuant to the regulatory agreement.
Gotham is a professional property management company, as is Rose associates, and both companies know how to write a temporary rent, concession.
Low-Income tenants at Gotham West get the lower of either the Li HTC calculated.
Gotham blames rose associates for a systemic error spanning nearly 20 years at the Atlas, the Nicole and now Gotham West, that cost them millions of dollars, and yet Gotham is not suing rose for all the utility allowances it claims were properly credited Gotham's desire to avoid a confrontation with Rose can only mean one thing that they believe that they would lose and thus lose any and all opportunity to ever take away the utility allowances from tenants, but by bypassing rows and simply going directly after the tenants utility allowances.
We need to gather as much information as possible in order to come back to the committee in December to say: here's what we've found so far, because I don't even know how to proceed.
I. Think one of our goals tonight is maybe just to formally ask Gotham to keep the status quo right now until we can go through this Katie thanks.
Joe, I'm, worried I think we need to be really clear about when we say that we want Gotham to keep the status.
I mean I, know right if they happen, to.
This is something that means that's important to a lot of people in those buildings and as opposed to just people who happen to be savvy enough to know about us.
This is clearly something that I think there would be a lot of people who would I'm not sure if they all know about it.
Yes, just yeah on that point, because I agree, I think unless you're tapped into the community board, you don't know about the community board in is.
You know collectively, but the committee will roll up the sleeves to deal with this, but like this really is a huge issue.
Hcc has been dealing with the issue, I'm, just a little concerned about us doing the work of literally trying to find every single tenant the work that we're doing when we write a letter when we make a recommendation, will impact all of those tenants.
Let's keep going around the committee Joe Josephine, Thoughts, James, yes, I, guess it's kind of a combination of a couple of the concerns that have been expressed, but the first thing for me is I'm.
Part of the agreement with Gotham- is that they would work with the community board to come to a resolution that is as satisfying as we can make.
So I think we can be a partner in finding a solution with Gotham for the tenants.
I agree with James, in a sense that we don't have all the facts on why the error happened and how many people have been affected when we know that I'm, not even on the error I'm just talking about.
Those are things that I think that we can address right now, because we have people who sound, very distressed and rightfully so.
We, can't ask them to fix it in a way that does not hurt people, because this is not a small thing to happen to a lot of people, especially in this moment whether you're, low moderate middle income and that's the broad range of bands involved here that everyone's hurting.
So I think we still need to reach out to those tenants, inform them, educate them in regards to this agreement or allowance.
We also need to be concerned about Gotham in the community in other buildings and how their this may impact.
Think, that I, like Dolores approach, that we have a lot of troubled people over a troubling issue and the community board is going to form a subcommittee or something and look into.
Is it's not something that's going to be resolved, quickly, I, don't think, but I like the idea of the letter.
That's not the way to deal business at all, so we would also want to copy the appropriate people that that's what I was wondering about, like who's going to be copied and too.
There's some rules and regulation that they're allowed to go back and work on the building, but we don't know what they're doing.
And I think it's a 48 units of rent, stabilized building and when our city is struggling so much for affordable, housing.
But, it's a really big concern, as we talked about from the last tenant, is like the community should know what's going on, and this is a really important.
We have some members of the block association who are texting me who are on the call, and we just need to know where people can live, what are affordable in our building in our block on 24th street.
The tenants had to be relocated, out, not evicted because of that vacate, and then the city of New York at the council, members urging went to HPD and court and the owner was forced to actually repair the building, but he didn't do anything for quite some time.
It's, Jane, De, Arc and Jackie will tell us a little bit about it, but I just can't believe it on 24th street four buildings are being of affordable buildings and Chelsea are just being are being you know, raised and sold, and it's just a really big concern.
I spoke to Eric basher about this, and it's just crazy that the that residence that has gotten tax, breaks, tax benefits as a religious organization for all these years would be able to give back to the community and continue this building as affordable housing for women.
It's, a group of nuns in Kentucky who can make decisions on the building that jean-dark would be closing and the building has been a form of short-term single-occupancy residents for women, either starting out in New, York or students, or it's supposed to be for five years, and we have leases that are ending December, 31st and those won't be renewed.
I looked into it with a tenants rights lawyer, and we don't because the building is owned by like a religious, non-profit.
There's, an administrator who you know who manages the building and any issues that tenants that residents might have with each other or in terms of housekeeping and maintenance.
They have left the tenants, know, they're selling the building and as of and their leases will end as of they're not going to be removed after December 31st month.
But if an organization that you claim to be affiliated with is no longer going to be listed as part of your core partners as a leadership like an organization like catholic charities may want to know about that and how to say, be informed.
Now that we have been alerted, we can all go into action, mode, which is just bringing everyone together and alerting, and once someone can actually get this board of directors in conversation, I think that there are a lot of potential solutions that collectively we can offer because clearly, as we found out with Hartley House, without consulting with the community, but consulting with, perhaps financial advisors or other folks made a decision.
These are people that are far away and not and removed from our community and do not understand the impact I think that, even if they say that their mission here in New York is done.
They are mission, oriented people and hearing from tenants like Jacqueline and how important this type of housing is for newer folks coming into New York that are doing important.
I, think that we have a blueprint with having found solutions by working collectively and bringing everyone together like with Hartley House to at least present to them once we can get them to the table to say hey.
Maybe this is the kind of thing that works for supportive housing at this location.
They know about how to access affordable housing in the city.
The all support of every supportive housing building in the city is 60 social service to indie, tenants and forty percent community tenants or low income.
Oh okay, good I just wanted to bring up three things: get a nice update, update committee on Stardom Hall and the public about Stardom, Hall and a question that has come up a couple of times to me.
Settings, and if you wanted them to be, you know safe, like a hotel, in other words everybody being able to have their own room and their own bathroom.
You would be able to have far fewer people, and you know it would be a huge cost, and indeed you know on a board of a different organization that is women, a women's residence, and it is like a dormitory right in the sense that everybody has their own room.
Mean one of the points is that sometimes people really need not to be alone in a room right, especially if they're having a variety of mental health issues or whatever else.
We can certainly ask because part of this issue is the city's taking a short-sighted point of view, but I think what Katie's point is you know.
Okay, I want to say that we're in a mess here, we've taken people who shelter residents, who need to be in a broader setting with a lot of connection engagement, Supervision, Mental, Health physical health stuff and put them in little rooms and they're, all among themselves, and so they're not being engaged with, in the same way that they would be in a congregate setting, and you can catch things.
Did it and then retroactively going back and trying to find dollars to pay for everything, so I, don't even think I mean Carl, or maybe someone else who has access to city conversations.
I know you guys have worked with Lantern community services for years long before my time on the board, but.
I got ta, say, and now it's going to really working with tenants to understand the complexity of a very major plan.
Second, it's going to have to find out first right, but the thing that I'm very happy with is that we started out with something that people really hated demolition and privatization.
They didn't like what we were saying at all, but we just kept bringing them down a road on it, and the last thing is for any of the new housing that gets built.
So: there is a lot of good coming from this work, group, not just for Lhlc and Fulton, but it looks like they made they're adapting it in little pieces here and there to their other projects, which is I, think is wonderful.
