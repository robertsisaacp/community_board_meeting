Oh you're recording already good evening everyone. My name is Marie Ortiz Co-Chair of housing, health and human services. So this is our November monthly meeting and tonight the agenda is public. It's on the website, just some housekeeping things, the meeting's recorded and it's accessible on YouTube. It's live streaming right now, everyone's going to stay muted throughout the meeting, except for whoever is speaking we're going to have. As you can look you'll see on the agenda, we have three items that we're going to be talking about. After whoever is speaking what happens? Is the presenter speaks? The committee members will speak by asking questions or comment, then the members of the public or the attendees will have the opportunity to do the same. The discussion goes back to the committee on some items. The committee members vote to write a letter of support or to make recommendations, and the most important thing for you to know is: if you want to comment or ask questions to, please raise your hand. You'll see a button to do that and if you're calling in you have to press star nine to raise your hand and it's star 6 to unmute I see we have 17 attendees. Does anybody have any questions right now about process? It looks like Daniel has a question you unmuted him or okay. I just want to know, should I be visible on the screen at this moment, because I'm not seeing that at all, as well as other people. That I know should be at this meeting. So I'm sorry Joe. We can't hear you on mute. Sorry, no we'll bring you in as we start taking questions from the public. That's fine! Thank you. That was a good question. I will clarify that next time, thanks Daniel, okay. So since we have no other questions, we can jump right into the agenda. The first thing on the agenda is the utility Gotham utility credit issue and I should share with everyone that I am a resident who lives in a Gotham building, so I am not able to really to participate in the conversation, a whole lot I. If we do write a letter, I would be present and not eligible. So in a normal conflict, yeah in a normal media circumstance Maria having a conflict of interest, she'd be she'd, get up from the main table. She would sit in the audience she could listen. She could ask questions and then participate as part of the discussion, but not actually be leave the discussion at all so because we don't have a table and we're all in the same room. Maria noted her conflict of interest for the public. Thank you very much Mariah. So we're going to start with this matter and I'm first going to just frame the I frame. The item here excuse me from some reps from Gotham and then here from the public on it and want to note the following issues. This matter was brought to us a while ago. It has definitely not been attended to in the normal way we would because of Covid-19. There was a confusion about a letter that Gotham responded to the board. Everyone's public should know that the community board has relocated from 330 West 42Nd street to 424 West 33Rd street. In the middle of the pandemic and there's lots of issues with the mail and communication and we've had a lot of letters, not reach the board that were sent in a timely fashion, besides the fact of the problems of the mail in general in the country, so we are, we are behind the eight ball a little bit on this, and the board had its first opportunity today to get some briefing by Gotham about the issue and out of it, we have asked Gotham to produce a great number of documents, because the board wants to make an independent evaluation of what it presented to us. Regarding this question of utility credit I'll, just frame it in general. This concerns three buildings: the Atlas, the Nicole and Gotham West. All those buildings received tenants, signed leases and on those leases there was a utility credit. It is very unclear because we need to have this information directly. All buildings are subject to regulatory agreements. Those regulatory agreements are written by either state or city agencies that explicitly say what the rent is and what the rent includes. We've asked for copies of all that information in order to review and evaluate it and also work with HCC on this matter. Housing conservation coordinator has represented some of the tenants who have brought actions. The last piece I want to know in Gotham will speak to this. We were quite surprised today, given that it affects so many tenants that this was not discussed in a public manner, transparent and broad. So, just from my notes, let me just note for everybody that this affects 200 and 650 tenants at Gotham, West, 75 of the Atlas and 30th in the coal. That's a significant a number of people affected by this that you should have had a public discussion, and we should have worked this through entirely in a public manner. Jd did I miss anything from our report from this morning, you're mute all right, Joe did you say 600 at Gotham, West at 650 I thought it was 250. No, it's 249 in the low income and 433 in the middle income 75 at Atlas and 30th in the cult. Thank you, Joe Jd, you were on our earlier discussion, did I miss anything in terms of characterizing. What we learned this morning. No, you did not the only thing there was a concern. At least I raised that we were all so concerned about the effect it would have on some residents. I think that's something that we at some point we'd like to know about, and also the other thing Joe. Maybe you said it. We wanted to know when they found the error right. So there's a whole question about. Is it an error? Is it not an error? That's the matter in dispute. We really do not feel at this point qualified to make a determination without having all this original documentation, and then we'd like to take this up again in our in the coming months, but we'd like to tonight hear first from Gotham and then we'd like to hear from tenants who are involved in this. So we get everyone's perspective. So could we first hear Nelly from the reps from Gotham? Are they on I, see Melissa hold on a second and Varun or just Melissa hi? I'm not really sure what additional out updates I can provide other than what you just went over. That was pretty thorough. Gotham is committed to providing documentation to help you guys kind of sort through the problem on your own and is looking forward to working with the board to forge a path forward, that's more transparent and considers impact on the tenants. Yes, our main concern is that we get it. We get documents, so we understand what they said. We get documents understand what happened and then with Gotham jointly and the elected officials. We need to work with the various regulatory agencies to understand how this gets settled. Joe, I'm sorry can we be introduced to who Melissa is and who she is. I'm sorry about that hi! I'm Melissa Rosenberg I work at Kasir, so we do community and government relations for Gotham anybody, any anyone else from Gotham in the meeting to just want to say anything before we go to the tenants. I don't know if Chris is on I, don't think he is, but you know they're happy to continue to work with you guys, I think it just didn't work out for this evening. So sorry about that Joe. Another question we're going to tenants first before any comments, because I already have a comment based on that response. Yes, let's do comments, then, from the Committee Dolores Melissa, with all due respect. I really don't understand the response of we want to work with you, so you can work it out. There's sorry, let me take that because this is a basically a response that the board gave to Gotham. Today we as a board don't have the documents and information we need to even begin to understand this no I understand I, have a different point: Joe I have a different point and as a person as a zoo, renter there's a lease and it's signed every year and it has information when there have been mistakes by whoever is the rental agent or the owner, etc. Those mistakes are usually eaten by the owner because you sign on a yearly basis, a contract with all of that information. I just find it very fascinating that there is even a question about whether or not to ensure that those residents still don't have the ability to have what was originally signed upon honored going forward, because their understanding was that was the type of rebate that or break that they were getting in their rent. That's because you live in a building that is strictly governed by rent stabilization. These buildings have an additional layer of regulation through regulatory agreements that are part of the financing that created the subsidy for the units. Those regulatory agreements are very specific about rents. How things get charged and that's the question we have to understand. It's not just when we started to unpack this today. If it was just that. Yes, that's the answer, unfortunately, there's a couple of layers here and we want to understand those layers before the board even opines on it. That's why we want to hear from the tenants all right, Joe I would just add, I, think correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that Gotham is going to continue those agreements until this is all sorted out. Yes, that was the discussion we had today that in fact, the status quo would remain in place until we as a board with the elected officials and the various tenants go through this understand it and then can opine on it. Katie I recall when this was first raised a couple of months ago, but I could be wrong here, but it seemed like it that it applied to some tenants, but not other tenants. In other words, like maybe some were getting a re, you know it sounds like some were paying or receiving the benefit and others weren't. Is that still our impression or is it that we think all tenants are in the same boat, whatever the boat is? The issue is that when leases were renewed in some cases, this credit was withdrawn, and that became a matter of dispute, so some tenants were receiving it. Some were not and because we have such a large body of tenants here, we really want to understand the full picture on it. So everyone gets no matter what the goal is. We understand it, we open on it and everyone gets treated in the exact same manner. That's the important thing here: okay, that's helpful! Thank you Jessica, maybe I'm being dense, but is the suggestion that Gotham themselves doesn't know if there's a rationale for how this has been applied, no gotham's claim is that in fact, their prior managing agent, who had the building for many years no longer manages, and in some cases prior to that, just applied this utility credit in the wrong manner. That's their claim. So that's why we have to understand what that means. We really can't this is such a unique circumstance here we have to get information about it. That presumably Gotham should also want Gotham has information, and their claim is in fact that this credit was applied twice. We don't know enough to say it was or wasn't, but we do know enough that when this was found out instead of coming to the community board or elected officials and having a broad open discussion about some issue, they began to then litigate it or have questions with tenants and that's not the way to go. When you have this many tenants involved in it all in projects that receive community support one way or the other. Okay. Thank you from the committee. Other questions, Hector I think I kind of shared the same sentiment that the Laura's had, but I don't get too much into it, I kind of get it. What you've already established that we need more information, it just sounded a little lit. It sounded a little standoffish. The way she presented that we need to figure it out. That kind of thing I mean, but we're all here to try to work it out and figure this all out. Okay. So let's try to get this done well, you're on yeah, just a quick question right or wrong. What are the dollar amounts we're talking about? What's the size of the credit, it varies by household because it affects both low income affects majority low income, housing tax credit, tenants, yeah. Those amounts are set by a standard from the federal government. So- and this is over a period of years now, Gotham represented today and no matter what they're not seeking to reclaim any of this. It's about everything going forward, but even so it's going to vary by apartment, size or household size, I'm just in the broadest possible. You know guesstimate range. What kind of percentage are we talking about? It's not really percentage. It's you know it's like I would say between 40 and 90 or more per month, depending yeah. Thank you Leslie. Is there federal or state oversight on this? Yes, and that's one of the things we raised today, there is not federal oversight. The utility credit comes from the state from the feds as a standard, but the oversight is at more than one location, because some of the projects were financed through state funded mortgages other through city funded mortgages, and we raised to Gotham. If there's an issue, why didn't the state or the city and its reporting find this? That's so that's an open question we have so we really want to bring those agencies into this discussion too. It's clear that it's going to be state city agencies, the owner, Community Board elected officials and tenants, so it's for expectations is going to be quite a complex thing to unravel other questions from the committee before we go to tenants. Okay, then, let's go to tenants if you can raise your hand and then Nelly, let you in one by one: okay: I have Daniel, okay, hello, everybody, and thank you very much for your time. I just want to state at the outset that I'm a tier three tenant in Gotham West, which means that I am in the moderate middle income group and I, was informed that I was not entitled to utility credit because of that status and that it was given to me in my original lease and in subsequent leases, as an error as a mistake. So I would just like to point out some things. If I can succinctly in correcting the mistake, Gotham is reneging on the stated rents in our original applications in our original lottery. Applications that we filled out signed in return from 2011 to 2013. in correcting the mistake. Gotham is ignoring the terms and conditions of our original lease, which includes a utility allowance, sometimes called the utility credit, and that in that original lease there was no mention that the utility credit was temporary. The utility allowance was temporary in correcting the mistake. Gotham is jumping up our rents significantly past the Rent Guidelines Board approved increases and that increase above the approval from the Rent Guidelines board varies at least in Gotham west, from 57 to 70 dollars per month. Every tenant has received. Excuse me a utility allowance, and lastly, if Gotham West is permitted to do this, what will prevent Gotham from locating? Excuse me another mistake and offering it as an excuse to jump up our rents yet again in the future and I. Don't have anything else to add beyond that Daniel. Just a quick question. You mentioned that the rents, your first lease was, of course, the rent from the lottery for this building right, that's right and the, and that lottery notice included the utility allowance in it did without mention that it included a utility loan. So, for example, my initial rent in 2013 was sixteen hundred and twenty three dollars for a studio apartment in tier three I did not know until the point that I signed the lease and went in to speak with the Rose Associates Leasing agency, that included a 57 per month. Utility credit yeah I was yes so that 16 that number. When you signed your when you signed your lease, did you sign your lease for a lesser amount or that number stayed in there and then the I signed the lease it stated. 1680, legal, rent and I might add not pro not preferential rate. It is a legal rent right, 1680, legal, rent, minus 57 for a utility allowance and I was informed at that point or shortly. Afterward. Excuse me that amount would be extracted from our rent amount when it came time to compute the Rent Guidelines Board approved increase. So, in other words, when I got my first increase two years later, it was based on 1680 and not based on 1623 I did not dispute that or have any issue with that, because it was such a small amount, but it was only at the time that I signed the lease that I learned that my 1623 dollars per month, rent included a utility allowance, but I was not even informed at that particular moment that was removable or temporary. There was nothing in the original lease, no temporary rent concession writer in the original lease that informed me that this was a temporary component of my rent. So we're going to need Nelly just take some notes, we're going to get the original notice on the lottery it's going far to the documents we have. We need here, so we can verify all this, because that just sets the stage as to what this thing means Daniel. Thank you very much really appreciate it. You're very welcome who's. Next Nelly next I have Jesus Cortez Jesus unmute yep, yes, hi good evening. Everybody I feel as though as we're in the mock trials. So I'm going to go ahead and state my case as follows: I'm here to speak about the issue of the utility credit that has been taken away from. Can you first tell us where you live yeah, I'm a tenant at the Nicole? Okay, I'm going to thank you, and so that has been taken away to my understanding for more than a hundred several households under the affordable housing tendency at several properties owned by the Gotham property. This issue has grown in scope and as per the tenants, we have continue and will continue to solicit and involve multiple resources, local officials, community groups and the community board, as we are this evening in hopes that you could put and help put some pressure on Gotham to reinstate this credit. As of today, Thursday November, 19, 2020, no resolution or reinstatement of the credit has actually happened. I am also here, on behalf of the tenants from the Nicole I, believe that the Nicole was one of Gotham's last acquisitions, and so were the last group to be able to chime in on this issue, and so, if I may I'd like to take you guys through several facts of my personal experience with this utility credit issue, if that's okay with everyone, when did you move in so the first fact is: I am a tenant of the Nicole since February 2004 fact. Since my tenancy, there has always been a utility credit attached to my lease fact. Since my tenancy, the management of the Nicole has passed through three different hands: first Prc Rose associates and now Gotham fact throughout the different managements. I have received the utility credit every month of every year until this past January of 2020. When, to my surprise, the utility credit was not stated on my monthly statement, as it always had been since February of 2004. was this upon lease renewal? Yes fact, when I reached out to the Nicole management inquiring as to the missing utility credit, I was told by Ms Benson, who was the property manager, that this was a courtesy credit and that it was no longer being offered by Nicole's management. But she assured me that I was receiving the correct utility allowance. That is an attachment to my current lease and that you know, and that was it, and so that I was supposed to just sit there and accept that. Another fact is that Miss Benson, never ever in the course of that conversation explained to me that I had the opportunities to seek other offices to bring this grievance to and offices. I am talking about the ora and or the dhrc which I found out through my own research as listening to different other tenants, namely Gotham West as to what these offices were about, and why I should make a complaint to them. So she never mentioned that. She never gave me the opportunity of that information Gotham. Another fact is that Gotham stated in response to a letter written and sent to them by this community board that they assured everyone every tenant that was inquiring about the utility credit that they would be informed as to what they should do next and who they needed to contact to further the inquiry and, as I stated before, this was not the case fact. Gotham in that same letter also stated that they would definitely not take into consideration the reinstatement of the utility credit to the tenants of the Nicole that we needed to contact these alleged offices, the Ora and the Dhr, and make a complaint to them. And as of today that has proven you know nil. Nothing has come from anybody making a complaint as far as I understand the issues as they stand now, so in finishing I came here tonight to state these facts on behalf of myself and my fellow tenants here at the Nicole and all the other tenants that are involved in this issue and in hopes that we can continue to fight this injustice that has befallen us, because, whether it's fifty dollars to ninety dollars, that's money, that's being taken out of each household's pocket and it's something that was instilled from the beginning of the tenancy and just as the other gentleman stated before. There was no letter that was sent out to give us any forewarning. There was no real, solid indication as to a reason why this was being taken away, and it's just ridiculous when it comes to an issue that is very black and white on paper and for the Gotham to go ahead and do this without any information going out to the tenants that it's going to affect it's just unacceptable, especially in these times that we're living in you know with everything that we have up against us. You know they have the nerve to come and take this utility credit and as far as I know, this began for me in January of 2020, as I stated before. So thank you so much for the opportunity and I look forward to keep the fight going. So I just want to note that it is clear- and the board made this clear today, that the communication and how this is handled is absolutely horrific and that's one of our concerns that we don't want. We want this to get figured out in a comprehensive way and not have people getting different information or not understanding, but I also want to note this committee very rarely deals with black and white, even when it seems very black and white. So that's why we want to get all the information to be able to take the right position to assist everybody. Thank you. The next person is Elise Levy hi, everyone, I'm Elise Levy and I'm a tenant organizer at housing conservation coordinators. I'm going to make this pretty brief, as I feel like a lot of the facts of the communication and the issues they're in have really been hit on by the tenants already, but I just do want to mention I. Think it's really important to note that you know, as Gotham was already dealing with complaints from tenants in Gotham West and already reinstating those credits based on Ora complaints or based on Hcr complaints. They were still revoking that credit from tenants in other buildings, and that just indicates to us and to the tenants some. You know real poor judgment and disrespect for the tenants and disrespect for you know for the community. If this is an issue, that's affecting hundreds of tenants and they're not being consistent and they're, not you know, sharing that information widely and being transparent, that's really troubling and I. Think it's also worth us noting that Gotham is continuing to develop in this area with the development and Covid-19 house and being involved in that in things that are related to nonprofits and to affordable housing and at the same time, is nickel and diming. The affordable housing tenants in buildings that they already own, and so that's really troubling and I think is worth you know just stating for the record. Could you tell us, oh in which building they revoked and reinstated in Gotham West? Some of the tenants had their credits reinstated as Gotham was I guess deliberate as the complaints were being deliberated on so was that across the board or just certain tenants, I believe it was certain tests. It was not across the board and then, where did they revoke at this at the same time? So they were reinstating, I, believe and I know. Gotham West hens could speak to this better than I could. But you know you have folks in the Nicole and in the Atlas discovering that their credits have been revoked in March of 2020 and the complaints and the organizing in Gotham West is starting in the fall of 2019. So the reinstatement, though, what's the time frame for that in Gotham, West I, believe it's pre-coveted so like maybe January February, approximately yeah and then even if January February, there was now revoking the credits in the colony Atlas. Subsequently, okay, thank you so much who's. Our next speaker is someone who's called in with the 646 number hello, caller hi. This is this is Patricia Tarkington from Gotham West, I'm the one who called in perfect go right ahead: okay, I live in Gotham West, I'm a cure to low-income tenant. There are many complaints about this matter before the dhcr and the Office of Attorney General State of New York, and it is far from settled. We have located a dhcr decision from 2017, in which the agency took on the subject of the calculation of low income, tenants, rents at Gotham West and concluded with certainty that the utility allowance was properly deducted from the preferential rent pursuant to the regulatory agreement. Now we have recently reminded dhcr of that 2017 decision and whether it sways the agency only time or will tell but we're confident that it will sway. Whoever must ultimately decide this case. Gotham's claimed that the utility allowances always communicated as temporary, is simply a lie. They have pointed to no specific words anywhere in the lease or the rider which convey that the utility allowance was meant to be temporary. Gotham is a professional property management company, as is Rose associates, and both companies know how to write a temporary rent concession. The word temporary appears nowhere on the lease nowhere in the riders. There is no expiration date cited and no suggestion whatsoever that this utility allowance is temporary. The low-income tenants at Gotham West have permanent riders that were meant to be administered with a variable rate in accordance with annual HUD declarations. That is how it was explained. That is how it was administered for six years, including four years after Gotham terminated rose, associates as its property manager and began administering these leases. Low-Income tenants at Gotham West get the lower of either the Li HTC calculated, rent or the rent stabilized rent Gotham keeps gassing on and on about Li HTC calculations when that has nothing to do with the instant matter, because we're not being charged Lihtc rents, we're being charged rent stabilized rents under the rent stabilized lease that has a permanent rider fixed to it. That calls for a utility allowance to be deducted from preferential rent. We are not talking about an lihgc rent and the only reason that Gotham is gaffing on and on about. It is to try to confuse the matter. The utility allowance that Gotham West, low-income tenants are receiving is not duplicative, because the tenants haven't been receiving any other utility allowance at all. Gotham blames rose associates for a systemic error spanning nearly 20 years at the Atlas, the Nicole and now Gotham West, that cost them millions of dollars, and yet Gotham is not suing rose for all the utility allowances it claims were properly credited Gotham's desire to avoid a confrontation with Rose can only mean one thing that they believe that they would lose and thus lose any and all opportunity to ever take away the utility allowances from tenants, but by bypassing rows and simply going directly after the tenants utility allowances they think they can score a half win, which is better than no win at all. There is no way that rose associates is not going to be drawn into this dispute. If we continue on, the current course rose associates will be summoned to be responsive to Gotham's claim that rose fouled up on the utility allowances for nearly two decades, while Gotham snoozed away. Thank you very much for your time. Patricia you refer to this 2017 decision. Can you provide a copy of that to the community board? Yes, I can perfect, and then the you took about 20 years, you're dealing with Nicole going back to 20 to 2004, that's the earliest right and the Atlas I think the Atlas was 2001 or so. Okay, so yeah right anything else that you can do to help us gather information. We'd, really appreciate it. Well, yeah! Well, we we've been at this for a year Joe and we've been reaching out to everybody, and there is a lot of correspondence and Gotham has offered a lot of explanations that has changed over the years and I will tell you that they have just destroyed whatever goodwill they had in this building, especially during the initial Covid-19 outbreak in April and may, when two of my dear friends in this building, who were also low-income, tenants, were struggling with their last breaths. While Gotham was trying to rip the utility allowances out of their leases, I mean it is just despicable. The way they have behaved well, I think we're very clear that the timing of all this is ridiculous and the communication is pissed poor. We noted that this morning, for them is there anything that he made one more note. You said that the low income housing tax, credit rents don't apply. Did you talk about that? A little bit more right as I'm referring to the tier one tier two tenants in Gotham West, who are have their leases through under an Hfa agreement and lihtc? We get they calculate the Lihtc rent, which is 30 of 50 of the area. Media income? Yes, okay! So that's what the Li HTC is now, if that increase during the year is greater than what the rent Rent Guidelines board increases, then we get the Rent Guidelines board increase, and we have always gotten that, because that has always been less than the the Li HTC calculated rent. So the Lahtc calculated rent has a utility allowance, that's deducted from the maximum rent and the rent stabilized, and that was a starting right. Yes right and then the rent stabilized lease has a utility allowance. That also has a yeah has a rider that also has a utility allowance that runs parallel and it has always been administered the same way using the HUD annual utility allowance credits, and this is the way it was done. Yes, and this is the way it was done in Gotham West, and this is the way rose. Rose associates handled the Lihtc tenants in their Durst building the Helena, so this has been- and this is that goes back to like almost 2000. so this has been rose's business practice for 20 years, at least really. Thank you for a lot of information. So if you can get that to Nelly, the that decision would be very helpful. Okay, thank you. Next person nelly I have no other hands raised. Okay, then, let's go back to the committee and just talk about this a little bit as you can see. This is a an item that has a lot of information needed and that's why we felt a little bit concerned about not putting all together, but let's do thoughts about this and how we want to proceed on it. Let's start out with Jd it is, it is confusing Joe, the last speaker was a tenant in Gotham I. Think we need. First of all, we need some answers to some of those questions that we asked. When did it start a lot of information we got tonight, I think you should get that and Maria, and then we can proceed with that. Yeah I think part of it is. We need to gather as much information as possible in order to come back to the committee in December to say: here's what we've found so far, because I don't even know how to proceed. Make a recommendation until we have information yes and Joe. I want to keep emphasizing it. Concerns me that some tenants who were acting in good faith all along may face a lot of hardship with this and I think we need to keep that in mind. I think one of our goals tonight is maybe just to formally ask Gotham to keep the status quo right now until we can go through this Katie thanks Joe, I'm worried I think we need to be really clear about when we say that we want Gotham to keep the status quo. It sounds like they've already removed it from some people, so we don't want that status quo. I meant status quo, of maintaining the credit. Yes, but I guess for those people who lost the credit in January, I'm not quite sure what we I mean. Maybe we just have to keep that status quo too. Until we can unscramble this all right, I think there's a lot of different dates. We don't even know yet. This may have been different dates for different people. The last speaker, Patricia said it was back in 2019. So that's the problem. We don't even have the yeah. We don't even know that's our problem yeah, but I guess. The other thought that I just had is that I'm not sure how tonight's speakers heard about us having this discussion but I think it's clear. It's really on our agenda. No I mean I, know right if they happen to. If they happen, to live there and happen to see our agenda, that's great, but I, guess what I mean is I, think it's. It would I wonder what we can do, whether we post a bunch of signs we normally post our I mean people inquire. This is on our agenda because people from these buildings estimate to be put on our right. I guess my only thought is clearly. This is something that means that's important to a lot of people in those buildings and as opposed to just people who happen to be savvy enough to know about us. I'm just wondering like. Can we also post some extra signs to say like hey? This has been looked at by community board 4 and we really want to hear from you I think we should have Nelly do posting well. How are we doing posting on Ellie anyway? I, don't know I mean our letter to the entire community is posting that we are talking about. This is how we communicate no, but I meant for the meeting notice how we doing posting now with Covid-19 I, don't even know it's posted in the same way, an email blast. We have over 3000 people on our listserv, okay I just this is clearly something that I think there would be a lot of people who would I'm not sure if they all know about it and I'm sure we'd like to hear from more talents. Yes, just yeah on that point, because I agree, I think unless you're tapped into the community board, you don't know about the community board in is: is there a tenants association that we're working with or organizing body I mean? This is impact, as you noted, this is impacting so many people and you've already rolled up your sleeves. We, you know collectively, but the committee will roll up the sleeves to deal with this, but like this really is a huge issue impacting people living on site. It would just seem a tenants association having a contact to represent the tenants, as I've heard us do. In other cases, where there are issues that are pervasive in a building would seem appropriate Maria. Is there a tenant association in your building a loosely formed one, not me I would say, but Elise spoke she's from HCC, so she's been dealing. Hcc has been dealing with the issue, I'm just a little concerned about us doing the work of literally trying to find every single tenant the work that we're doing when we write a letter when we make a recommendation will impact all of those tenants. The information that we're going to uncover are going to come from official sources going to come from getting those copies of those leases. I think that it actually lengthens our process of being effective. If we're literally knocking on every single door and saying, did you have this problem? Did you see this issue? I? Think Katie is aware of our meetings right yeah I mean that that's something we can ask HCC to post our notice around the locations of these buildings nelly. How about if we do that yeah? That would be great yeah, because HTC is working with them so and understand everyone's right. The numbers- it's 787 households involved in this, so we really have to think also I want to say for everybody expectations we're not going to be able to solve this or figure this out. In a day. This is going to be compiling trying to figure out meetings. You know, I expectations are not it's. These are regulatory agreements that to be read, you know it's like carefully and stuff. So let's keep going around the committee Joe Josephine, Thoughts, James, yes, I, guess it's kind of a combination of a couple of the concerns that have been expressed, but the first thing for me is I'm a little confused. This seems very cryptic. Very you know, because it's regulatory and because they're there are private agreements involved like it seems pretty involved and, to be honest, these agreements are public, though James so I all I met was all I meant was their individual agreements between one party and an organization. That's all I'm at. But the point is that you know for each of these agreements again we would have to figure out who are all the parties involved, and it seems that the implication is that this could like this problem, could extend to other properties that we haven't even discovered yet so I guess. My question is like what is the end game and what is our desired outcome and what role can we play as the community board, because we have limited resources limited time and we want to do good for the community but at the same time we're not like a legislative body. We don't have investigative reasons. Oh, we don't have the power to put anything into effect. That is legal. We are an advisory body and we all know that. So I'm just saying like what is the end game here? What is the desired outcome? How can we I think help we, as a community board, don't have enough information to figure out what an endgame is. We have to first assemble information to understand what is this about? You know I mean like, in other words, you have to no, I'm sorry I, don't accept that answer. We don't just do things without knowing where it's leading. So what I'm saying is, let's assume for a moment that there are violations taking place, I'm just asking: what is it? What are the possibilities that we could do like? What? How do we effectuate a positive change? That's what I'm asking so we first have to find out whether or not utility credit allowance should or should not have been applied period. That's just determined that and that's what I understand that you're talking to me about process again. I just want to know, then what that's all I'm asking Joe, hi Jamie, all right part of the process and part of the agreement with Gotham- is that they would work with the community board to come to a resolution that is as satisfying as we can make it so I think we can be a partner in finding a solution with Gotham for the tenants right but again James it's hard to come up with a solution until we know the facts, so Joe I agree with James in a sense that we don't have all the facts on why the error happened and how many people have been affected when we know that I'm not even on the error I'm just talking about. But what should what we do know right. What we do know is there's a community response and I think we can speak to be extremely alarmed that this is happening highlight again, the lack of communication and the real impact that lack of communication is having upon the entire community. Those are things that I think that we can address right now, because we have people who sound, very distressed and rightfully so and I think that's something that we can address in the immediate so that one we're letting the rest of the community know that we hear that we are responding to that, while we're still getting as many facts as possible so that it can be worked out to the right resolution. Let me rephrase my question because I honestly and Dolores I do appreciate that, because and Joe I appreciate what you're saying about the process I respect. All of that all makes sense to me what I'm asking is without committing to an outcome, because I'm not saying that this is what's going to happen. I'm just saying what are some of the things that could possibly happen depending on the facts that we discover, for example, are these people in their minds owed money? So is one possibility that there's a class action lawsuit and they try to get their money back or there is wait before you. I just want to walk through some possibilities, and then you can tell me they're all stupid, but I'm just trying to give you examples of what my question actually is. I would prefer, though you don't give concrete examples that create expectations, I'm not creating any expectations. I'm just trying to explain my question. I haven't even gotten my question out. My question is: are these people do they think they're owed money or are they saying we want to be? We want these things corrected going forward or is it after a factual determination that no there was no error made like I'm just trying to figure out like what is? What are we trying to do here, and what can we do like? Is this something where they can get relief from HPD or NYCHA, or do they have to go to courts? Like I'm, just saying like what are the outcomes? That's all, I'm asking so I think the issue is there are so many agencies involved. We don't even know the correct route in these buildings. New York, City, Housing, Development Corporation had the financing and regulatory agreements. Hpd has a part and New York City New, York, State Hfa has a part and it's different for different buildings. Once we get that either there was either they're in compliance with their agreements or they're. Not that's going to be a pretty simple thing, either or but then the next question is, let's say for a moment they're in compliance, and there was an error, even though we have no information about that, it doesn't mean that they don't have that. We can't ask them to fix it in a way that does not hurt people, because this is not a small thing to happen to a lot of people, especially in this moment whether you're, low moderate middle income and that's the broad range of bands involved here that everyone's hurting. So that's a big issue. How it's handled am I Dolores. Is that a good way to phrase it? You think yes, but again, I think that it is important that we express the reaction and I think that's at this juncture. Right, I think that's something we can do now, memorialize what we're hearing from the community and also the concerns that we have about whatever the potential outcomes are highlighting of how that may impact. Thank you both that's very helpful. Katie. As James said you know it's it's a thicket and it's complex, and I'm just wondering you know you had said like what are some possible next steps or what are some suggestions and I? Just wonder like? Should we have a little subcommittee? Should a couple of people like volunteer and say we'd be happy to once? The information is you know sent in I'm smiling. I was going to recommend. We have a subcommittee to read the documents just to spread this work out a bit, because this is like a lot of documents to look at yeah. So anyway, you are definitely volunteering. Yes, wait I see what you did there, but yes, I would be happy to okay, Paul Fox you're on mute, Paul Yo. My first thought was that we need subpoena power, but no seriously. This is exactly that's a thicket and I. You know maybe it'll be simpler than we think. Once this committee to be chaired by Katie sits, we should be able to thread our way through the documents God. It sounds like it's awfully complicated, but it also sounds like it's just complicated enough, so that if, if any developer wanted to, they might take advantage of individual folks as opposed to airing it out in a public forum or with our assistants and I. Guess that's what we're here for so we've got to think it Pete this low-income housing credit seems to be a little confusing and I think we need to have some more information on that background on this, I tend to believe that many of the tenants are so confused, they're not and that's why they not participating now so I think we still need to reach out to those tenants, inform them, educate them in regards to this agreement or allowance and I think we can get a better response and I think we need to be more informed about the agreement itself. Leslie I think we need to work with HCC, because they've worked on this for at least a year and they do good work and I'm sure they have a lot of history on this project and I think that's important and going forward. We also need to be concerned about Gotham in the community in other buildings and how their this may impact other buildings. Well, so far they have three. So that's why we're focusing on those yeah but I mean for future. If they come up with others, we need to also monitor. What's going on with those and then Judith you're, the last speaker, I, think you're just frozen no almost frozen yeah I! Don't have any comment. Thank you, I think. It's all been said. So good luck, okay, Betty! Are we intending to have a letter from the committee today, I mean okay. That was a yes I. Think that I, like Dolores approach, that we have a lot of troubled people over a troubling issue and the community board is going to form a subcommittee or something and look into I do feel it's a little daunting and to unscramble it all. So I'm not volunteering for that subcommittee, but I think it has. You need to have a couple of people who have the time to look at these documents and ask people who know more about these documents. So is it's not something that's going to be resolved quickly, I, don't think, but I like the idea of the letter. I want to echo what Leslie had said that HCC has been working on this and they have lawyers and they actually understand these complications, and we may not need to duplicate that work. We may need to just tap into what they already have and documented and then figure out if there are any holes based on some of the testimony we've received from the tenants tonight and any other tenants that reach out, we have requests from Gotham all the proper regulatory agreements. We need to make sure we have them, so everything is current and up to date. So you know we're on the same page, but I. Think Hc's heavy HCC assist us is a major help here. Well, I make a motion for us to write such a letter, as Betty has outlined. That describes this is troubling issue that is troubling our neighbors and that we need to go ahead and get more facts to understand how to come to a resolution, but we need to at least in this letter outline our concern at the lack of communication and the impact that it's had on our community members. You have thought second, all right, I, well, I guess. I was just hearing, though, that maybe I agree with that letter. I like that, but I think I was hearing, though, that like we should be supporting HCC like they. Should it sound, that's what I felt like I was hearing, no dolores, that's not what you're saying what I meant was. Is they they've been doing this work already for a year with Tet with people who have reached out to them, so they may already have documentation. They may already have some resources explaining the legal thicket great word Katie Thicket that has been created in this process. All I'm saying is that not to assist them, but we shouldn't necessarily recreate the entire wheel. If someone has already done this work, we may be able to adopt some of the information from them. That was my thought. Okay, I just want to say. We also need to keep an open mind and consider that in the future we will be working with Gotham to get a solution. So we need to be careful here right. We're not litigants we're problem solvers here right, that's the main thing: yeah can I just ask a question about the letter, I'm not clear to whom would it be addressed? Oh to Gotham, we're saying you've handled this terribly bad communication. Many people affect it here. Are the buildings, here's what it is and we look forward to working with you. Please keep the status quo and we'll define that properly and we figure out how to deal with this I mean listen, it's going to be. Yes, it's correct, or it's not correct period, and then, even if it's even if there's an error, it doesn't mean that you just say turn on a faucet. Everybody pays more, that's not the way to deal business at all, so we would also want to copy the appropriate people that that's what I was wondering about, like who's going to be copied and too yeah. Well so far we know it's two city agencies and one state agency. So all those in favor of that letter, please raise your hand all those opposed all those present not eligible Maria. Okay, it passes. Let me tell you: okay, Joe one more thing: Emily from Linda Rosenfeld's office had her hand up. Oh I'm sorry go ahead, nelly bring her in apologize, Emily hi! This is Emily from Assemblymember Rosenthal's office. I was trying to let the tenants speak first and then I didn't hit the button in time before committee. Discussion, I just wanted to share an update. What our office has been working on this I know we had a tenant meeting earlier in January February and we submitted several lease overcharge applications to dhcr. We started to receive facts and rejection and there was a lot of confusion because Dhcr said. The reason we were rejected was because it needed to be submitted to the Hfa, which is a division of dhcr, and so we were talking to the rent administrator's office, and even they were confused about why there might have been a denial, so we're just continuing to work with them, while they kind of internally figure out what happened there and we also are meeting with Gotham tomorrow. They asked to meet with us to give a briefing similar to what I'm sure they gave the board today. So it was great to hear from the tenants and thank you all so much. What Emily's referring to is a process called a par petitioner for administrative review, where you can claim an overcharge or other service reduction, and there is this definite issue that it's a jurisdiction. Hfa is a is not actually part of Hcr, but it's a separate agency supervised by Hdr. So that's why another example of the multiple levels of things here that we got to really sort out. Thank you all very much for listening to this complicated thing and I'm pretty sure we're going to be hearing about it. For the months to come, Maria I'll turn over the committee to you now for the next item for West 24Th street. The other thing I just wanted to shout out. Maya Burlo from Brad Hoyleman's office is on also I saw Carl Wilson from the speaker of Course Johnson's office. I'm not sure I'm not familiar with any of the other names. The next item do you want to take the first item, 219 23. so I? Don't we're supposed to have someone here speaking about it, I believe her name is I might be mixing up the buildings Jaclyn? No, that's the next one. Wait. Let me just look on the agenda, I'm sorry. So the next item on the agenda is 219,223. West, 24Th street okay. I could take over that and tell the committee about what's going on? Yes, please Judith! Yes, thank you, okay, so many of you know that I live on 24th street and in I think it was, may 8th an article, the daily News that documented what was happening on the building right next to the high school fashion and right before whole food, that the tenants were being evicted because the landlord did not repair the building and the rent-stabilized tenants were evicted as a regular person who walks down the street and sees all this going on. I couldn't help but find out what's going on with the tenants and they were just sent to live somewhere else, then the whole place was boarded up and it was just a big disaster filthy dirty. So we had them put a board up in front of it and then recently, which is why I brought it to the committee because I don't know what to do about this thing. There was a work order, stop work, order on the building and I walked by it just the other day, and there were people working on it. So I called Jessie and I put in a call through 311 and I. Think there's some rules and regulation that they're allowed to go back and work on the building, but we don't know what they're doing and we don't know if they're putting the rent-stabilized tenants back and I just don't know how to find out that information and I think it's a 48 units of rent, stabilized building and when our city is struggling so much for affordable housing. This is three buildings that are just disappearing and the articles in the daily news and in the real estate googling it you know says that the person who bought it was taken into a lawsuit. I know Dick Godfrey's Matt till he told me that they sued them and they're supposed to be repairing the buildings. I, don't know why a stock stop work order would go up, I, don't know why! All of a sudden, it's allowed I, don't really know what to do about this. But it's a really big concern, as we talked about from the last tenant is like the community should know what's going on, and this is a really important thing. We have some members of the block association who are texting me who are on the call, and we just need to know where people can live, what are affordable in our building in our block on 24th street. It's a big concern and I just don't know what the first steps are that as a community boy, we need to do so. The community board has been involved in this. If you remember back a couple of years back the new owner bought the building. They created a situation where the building was declared structurally unsound by the department of buildings leading to a vacate. The tenants had to be relocated out, not evicted because of that vacate, and then the city of New York at the council, members urging went to HPD and court and the owner was forced to actually repair the building, but he didn't do anything for quite some time. Those repairs started just recently. This is the report. I got from Jesse. There was a stop work order, however. Jesse our district manager reported that, in fact, the they are. The work that is being performed is consistent with the order that the agencies ordered them to do to repair the building, so it doesn't mean that they're going to comply or do it in the proper fashion or deal with it properly. But that's where we are, as opposed to saying this is an affordable housing building. This is a rent-stabilized building that was affordable, that somebody bought in order to vacate and get rid of people, and they were stopped from doing that. But, as usual, this is like the Chelsea hotel. You know, there's a litigation back and forth in agencies, so I'm going to ask: can we bring Kara Wilson in? Maybe he knows a little more about this to give us a report from Corey Johnson's office. You there nelly. I'm sorry repeat that again: Joe. Can you bring Carl Wilson in? Yes, of course, I'm sorry, I'm having a difficult time my voice today, Carl! Yes, I'm here. Can everyone hear me? Yes, yeah so Joe I, that's accurate, your summary of what happened. There was, you know, a joint lawsuit between DOB and HPD, where they were ordered to make repairs to the building, and they were supposed to have that completed that by November 6th. So it you know it appeared that you know those permits had not been filed and the the city's law department is. You know, watching this very closely and I mean Joe I. Think you summed it up pretty well I mean we have a lot of great interest in this. You know being followed through on Judith you're right, you know to lose this number of affordable units is, it would be very problematic and it you know that was our con concern for the from the outset. So we were very happy with the ruling and you know intend to continue to work with DOB and HPD to make sure that the you know they are. You know carefully watching what the owner is doing here. So really housing court gave an order at the urging of HPD and DOB and now it's being carried out, but, as we know, Judith, you must be vigilant because owners do things to make sure that buildings go away. You have that all over the place, so please keep Jesse in the loop of information, so we know what's happening at this location yeah, and it was very clear that you know that these owners wanted to demo the they wanted to knock the building down, and you know that is unacceptable to us, and you know, thankfully, the courts agreed to that and so but we're following this very closely Judith and we have a you know a lot of interest in seeing this restored as well. Thank you, Carl. Let's move on to it and thank you very much Judith for bringing to the committee too. Let's move on to our next item, which is 253 West 34Th street. I'm sorry I brought that one up, so I would like to give a little background on that one. Yes, please! So a lovely lady was teaching at my school and she's teaching math to graduate Cornell and we got to be friendly and then I found out recently that Jackie who's on the call said that her building was being sold and she had really reached out to the powers that being community to try and get some action. This is I, don't know the rules and regulations again and Joe. I hope that we can follow your leadership in this, but it's a historic building from 1898 and it's a non-profit, women's residence and I, of course, googling it looking around many residents that are, it was started for the french girls in the historical times, so they would have a place to live. It's Jane, De, Arc and Jackie will tell us a little bit about it, but I just can't believe it on 24th street four buildings are being of affordable buildings and Chelsea are just being are being you know, raised and sold, and it's just a really big concern and I'm glad to bring it to the community. So we can all pay attention to this I. Don't know. I spoke to Eric basher about this, and it's just crazy that the that residence that has gotten tax breaks, tax benefits as a religious organization for all these years would be able to give back to the community and continue this building as affordable housing for women. I, don't know exactly how many women fit in there, but it's a single room, a double room, and then they have like a dormitory space and it's been there since 1890 and it's it's like it's run by the sisters and there and Jackie will tell us about it. Can we bring her in I mean? Should we bring her napkins yeah Nellie's, her newest hello? Yes, so on August 10th we received the news that we received a letter from the kind of like the directors who is a it's a group of nuns in Kentucky who can make decisions on the building that jean-dark would be closing and the building has been a form of short-term single-occupancy residents for women, either starting out in New, York or students, or it's supposed to be for five years, and we have leases that are ending December, 31st and those won't be renewed, and then afterwards it will be month-to-month tenancy until June, 30th 2021. When we'll we must leave the building. I looked into it with a tenants rights lawyer and we don't because the building is owned by like a religious non-profit and it's a single like it's a single room, occupancy room. We don't have the rights that would otherwise protect people. Other tenants in rent stabilized apartments. So there really isn't I'm really stuck as to what to do other than reaching out and seeing if there are other non-profits who could hopefully acquire the building and keep up the mission to have it for affordable housing in the community, as it would just be a shame for it to close and become you know, a condominium and be sold at market value. Tell us how many apartments or rooms in the building. Yes, there are 140 rooms and when it is specifically in the least that it is short-term occupancy yes up to five years and has the building been managed directly by the nuns or is it arm's length, it's arm's length. So there's from what I understand there, the I didn't even know who the landlord was until I had to like investigate it. There's an administrator who you know who manages the building and any issues that tenants that residents might have with each other or in terms of housekeeping and maintenance and there's a board of I, believe five nuns and this administrator who can make decisions on the building and those the so the landlord is technically the congregation of Divine Providence and they are in Melbourne Kentucky and they have never indicated before they were selling the building. This just came out of the blue, some I think they made you know they. There were signs that it was. It would happen to people who were in the building before me that they made an update on the lease. The nuns who are kind of the nuns who are the landlords of the building are becoming older and there aren't there isn't a younger population to replace them and they didn't want to hand it down to a non-religious administration, so they wanted to sell it. Isn't that non-religious yeah but I mean they're it's no longer under their it's no longer going to be considered their mission once it's no longer jean-dark essentially got it Katie. Sorry, I'm just a little confused. So has the building been sold? No, they are. They have left the tenants know, they're selling the building and as of and their leases will end as of they're not going to be removed after December 31st month to June of next year, so Jacqueline, because I know you had said that your hope is that maybe a buyer could be found who might continue this approach, for you know women's residence, but just but to confirm so as far as you know nobody's it is still on the market as far as I know yeah, they actually didn't even come out and say that they were selling the building. In the letter they just said that that they're going to bring the Ministry of Jean-dark to completion. This is a simple phrase. We've had this in two cases before we've had religious residences or women's residences, Leo House and Central Maria on 54Th street Leo House on 23rd, where the Congress, the group of nuns became elderly and they just basically were dissipating and people were evicted. I'm going to be honest with you, it was horrific. We watched a lot of people be evicted, so it's not an uncommon thing and because there's a specific way that these things are set up under the law. Tenants do not have a lot of rights. Jessica yeah. It appears that this residence is affiliated with catholic charities of New York and I'm wondering they're. You know the church obviously is a very big organization, but it's also a very significant player in the health and human services arena providing core services throughout the city. I wonder if there might be an opportunity to connect with them and try to get a better understanding, it lists them actually as an agency, and so they may have a better sense of what the intention or the opportunity around this is I want to go to Carl, because I believe Carl you're on the call this morning neither Maria I could attend. That was the discussion about this. Is that correct? Yes, so this this morning we had a call with we gathered. You know our other, our elected colleagues and Larry Wood from Goddard, who has I. Think some of you may know him on the call here who has extensive experience with SRO and tenant organizing and, as Jacqueline said, you know these were these units do not appear to be under the same rent protections that you know you or I might have, but he said that there might be a it's possible that they may have received a J, what's called a j51 tax credit which could apply some protections to to the ladies living there, but we have to do a little bit more research to find out. If that is the case, we you know because they are allowed to stay till June. You know, given the way the court system is right. Now, too, you know, I think that it's you know, holdover proceedings wouldn't be able to proceed until at least until June, probably not later, given the Covid-19 scenario that we're in so I. Think in this you know. Our goal here is to try to fight to alert the affordable, affordable housing network. To try to find some kind of buyer to take this over I think that's the most ideal situation that we would like to see happen and but, if not to try to buy the women as much time as possible to relocate so we're all working together and intense and pursue that avenue with them. We've tried to reach out to the nuns we haven't had a lot of success yet, but we're going to continue to try Carl I have two quick questions for clarity. I think Carl can answer, because it would be from the call this morning just to be clear: it's not all women any longer I mean Jaclyn could answer that. It still is. Oh, it is okay and then I was unclear about whether or not they are connected to catholic charities. As Jessica said, I'm not sure Jessica did you say that they were affiliated with them. I mean I, I'm not here with the organization, but I did just google it and it comes listed as one of their agencies yeah. So Jessica. We had this circumstance before Leo House was affiliated with catholic charities, but they have this independent board of governors. So, even though we can use the political pressure on catholic charities, they it's in the end, it's going to be the nuns in Kentucky. What and I worked for basically the jewish catholic charities, so I'm familiar with like the affiliated organizations and how they're independent and all of that, but if an organization that you claim to be affiliated with is no longer going to be listed as part of your core partners as a leadership like an organization like catholic charities may want to know about that and how to say, be informed, have the inside track, and so I was just thinking. It may be another way, for example, they may be able to get the nuns on the phone. If they're not answering, you know the elected's calls got it so I think the what are people's thoughts about this yeah Dolores, sorry, so not the same type of organization, but the same situation with Hartley, House and I. Think now that we have been alerted, we can all go into action mode, which is just bringing everyone together and alerting, and once someone can actually get this board of directors in conversation, I think that there are a lot of potential solutions that collectively we can offer because clearly, as we found out with Hartley House, without consulting with the community, but consulting with, perhaps financial advisors or other folks made a decision. That makes the most sense. But these are people that are far away and not and removed from our community and do not understand the impact I think that, even if they say that their mission here in New York is done. They are mission, oriented people and hearing from tenants like Jacqueline and how important this type of housing is for newer folks coming into New York that are doing important. Work like being teachers and still being able to afford to live here may be enough. An appeal to give us some time. I think that I don't know what avenues to go to connect with them, except for sending Jd back down to Kentucky and having him find them. But talk to those nuns, I'll go talk to them. Okay, you know what Melbourne is yeah it's right over the hill over there, but either way. I think that we have a blueprint with having found solutions by working collectively and bringing everyone together like with Hartley House to at least present to them once we can get them to the table to say hey. This is not your only option. There's a community here that that's been that's counting on still being able to have this type of housing and I, don't know they define them so I would say we should not probably write a letter this week, I mean this month but see if, through Corey's office, we can convene folks Carl specifically I, think this is the kind of project that works very well for breaking ground. It's a scale that they're used to and the city we know the city is still has money in its budget for supportive housing. So maybe this is the kind of thing that works for supportive housing at this location. Yeah. That's a good idea, we're very interested in exploring that and I just want to say the nuns of Kentucky sounds like Jd's new play. Is that right? Yes, you, you have your mother superior costume, handy I, hope you I do. Let's just hope. It's not that case cause our last two religious orders. We're not easy to work with. Okay, Betty has her hand up yes, Betty you're on YouTube I was actually just scratching, but I immediately thought of Harley House when this was coming up and how it was. Almost a miracle turned around and I guess I wanted to ask Carl or the other speaker or somebody else or maybe Judith knows, is this building in good shape? It's in good shape, okay, because I think that could make it a little easier that it's not falling down beautiful shape. You should take a walk. It really is very it's attractive. They've done renovations over the years they've you know donated furniture to the school they've really taken very good care of the building and I know the porter very well so Jack I, don't know. If Jackie did you do you think that the building's in good shape did Jackie Lee? Where did she go both of these sites? I haven't been aware of them, but I just really like it. This could turn around to be some kind of a non-profit, affordable housing situation. Right. More of all, our hearts is the building overall good condition. It's in good condition. It's an older building, I would I it's in need of renovations on the inside I'd say for it to be more comfortable, it's not a very comfortable place to live. To be honest, it probably requires major mechanical stuff, Judith and updating to me. Today's codes, I'm pretty sure the building being built when it is, even though it was renovated, probably doesn't meet today's codes, so it doesn't make any difference. Let's give it a go Carl can we ask your office to spearhead this? Yes, okay, dd. Yes, I'm more concerned about the tenants who are there, what happens to them now and what would happen to them if it did become an affordable housing site? So I'm cons concerned about those we have that we have the examples of the. Why and time square hotel anybody who was there is grandfathered in and they are part of the project that happens and that's the only way we've ever the board's ever sponsored these kind of things to help these things happen. Okay, thanks. Thank you for asking Jd, because a lot of residents are moving out and they're they had anticipated being able to stay for their remaining years that they had left and yeah. If we leave, then we might not be able to see how this goes through and then, if it does work out, maybe we can stay well. Do they know about how to access affordable housing in the city? How to go about that? If not I put them in touch with the community, Board or Maria or Joe to advise them. Certainly, Jesse can help them out. There's a lot of affordable housing around that they can apply for so all the resources we can help with might be useful right. Thank you. Jose I just wanted to clarify I, wasn't sure if Carl had said that he was interested in this as supportive housing or affordable housing. I just wanted to clarify. You are talking about turning these possibly into affordable housing. The supportive housing to me means something different. Supportive housing is a type of affordable housing and this is an SRO. So therefore, it lends itself toward that supportive housing model smaller spaces that there are no programs to finance SRO renovation without it being supportive housing. So that's how the city's set up right now, I guess to me. So then grandfathering the people who are already there. The tenant. The current tenants into this supportive housing model is in that I mean we're talking about two different populations: correct. No, the all support of every supportive housing building in the city is 60 social service to indie, tenants and forty percent community tenants or low income. Okay, they're never done 100 social service. Needy Judith I just had a one more comment because I don't know, I just found out recently that there is a breaking ground in the Old Ymca. That's there on 24th street, which is right across the street from home, yeah I, don't know for many years. Yes, so some people might not have known about that. So I guess two supportive housings on 24th street. That seems like a lot but affordable housing would be useful. Well, if you didn't know about it, Judith and they're doing a really good job right. Well, they are hanging out front and there is a little bit of problems, but I did have to go and investigate like what was going on there. We had a tour with the Black Association with Omar Patel and when we created the black association that gave us the right to go in and find out what was going on in the neighborhood, because before that they wouldn't let us in the door. Thank you. So let's go Paul. Yes, a quick question I I'd like to, if there's any point to it, I'm curious Joe as to what our experience has been over the longer period of time with religious housing like this, but the other question, my real question is: are there any? Are there any actors involved like those helpful folks who were advising Hartley House because they specialized in their concern for not-for-profits and religious? There were those folks who that was their little niche and they advise them for a surprise, sell get a lot of money, I'm just wondering if there's anyone in this transaction so far I have to say there are the miracle. Workers are in short supply, there's just so many to go around I know they're, so helpful, I know, but the scale of this at 140 rooms really seems to be more suitable toward the breaking ground model yeah, where they know how to scale these things like the Mcburney Y. That was a historic tax, credit project, low-income housing, tax credits, a major restoration, the same thing with the Times square hotel or the Prince George that it occurred to me when I looked at this carefully. That seems to be the model that has worked in other difficult structures like this yeah. So well, it's a huge problem for orders that are just naturally evaporating they're dying. I'm just wondering: do we have a playbook about cases where that has happened and with or without the help in parentheses of outside actors? That's right! Yes, we have three locations in our district. Where that has happened, one was a good result. Good shepherd on 22Nd street Leo House became a hotel for catholic tourists and Central Maria is being vacated as we speak, yeah. If I was running the church, I'd say you know we could use some good pr. This sounds like an opportunity. I think they want to use money to pay off claims Paul, so I think we have. This Carl can I. Ask you to report back to us in the December meeting about any of these discussions. Oh I'm sorry, oh, go ahead. Maria I mean Nelly, bring him in I apologize, I'm not watching all right, I didn't see the name hold on it's Brian Matlin. There you go Brian, yes, am I unmuted. Now, yes, fantastic hi everybody, so I just want to bring in a little bit of an external context. To this and I have to admit, my information is not up to date to the day, but as of maybe a year or two ago, the large corner lot immediately to the west of this building, which is the one story, rite aid store, was or I believe, still is owned by the real estate developer, John Katzmatitis, who not that long ago, also purchased the Midtown lumber building on the 200 block of West 25Th street, which is where I live, which is a one-story building. That goes all the way through from 25th street, back to the property line, with the rite aid building, the presumption being that he bought that law to perhaps transfer air rights to the corner lot on 8th, Avenue and 24th street. Maybe to use it for an access point for a garage who knows the prospect of the Jean Dark, building being put on the market and potentially being combined, would create an astonishingly, huge and out of scale potential development lot. So that is just a concern that I mean, even without the Jean Dark building the notion of what could potentially go up on the corner of 25th and 24th and 8th is concerning even to me over here on 25th street in terms of light and air. If there's any possibility that somebody could get wind of this and say hey, let's combine the Jean Dark loud, which is equally huge with the corner lot in conjunction with the air rights from the 25th street lot could lead to potentially a huge overdevelopment situation. Thank you very much for that information. Sure anyone else from the public wanting to begin this issue, Joe I, just wanted to clarify some of the black associations, were on the call, and they said for me to confirm that I made a mistake bringing ground it's the Christopher's, the name of the building. Yes, that was the one I don't know if that was mentioned, but they asked me to clarify sorry about that. So Joe I think you were asking me to report back next month. We obvious. We, of course, will keep the board up to speed on developments here, and you know, happy to you know, come back. You know come back next month. Thank you! So much Carl, and definitely can you try to reach out to breaking ground as a possible partner here. Got it okay, everybody thank you so much Jaclyn for attending and just come back to our community. So you get updates on this. Okay, thank you so much and for new and old items, new and old business. Can you hear me? Can everyone hear me? Oh okay, good I just wanted to bring up three things: get a nice update, update committee on Stardom Hall and the public about Stardom, Hall and a question that has come up a couple of times to me and I just wanted to bring it here to inquire, I'm going to ask the question first I! Think that's! The easiest is so a couple of people have asked me about the space for those who live in congregate, shelter and the unused space. That's in the community! Well, let's just say everywhere in the city, but can the space be retrofitted so that it's more individualized? Does that make sense? Joe my question to you? Yes: well, there can be some degree of retrofit, but that requires a plan and to mark knowledge, the city of New York is not doing anything to plan on how to bring people back to this type of shelter. So far we haven't heard anything like that at all. Eddie yeah, I, Paul and I have talked about this idea and he couldn't be at the meeting tonight, but we we're very keen on the city or someone looking at the spaces that the homeless people now who are in the temporary shelter hotels that perhaps if the places they came from could be retrofitted so that they were safe enough from coronavirus than some of the hotel residents could be. You know, moved back into those retrofitted buildings. Obviously it would take a huge effort because you need money to retrofit those buildings. I even had the idea that maybe the city could launch a contest among architects as to how to cleverly reconfigure these buildings, but it seems a shame, I assume, they're sitting around empty and I. You know. I've said before I think that the city needs to make a plan for this. So I'm glad that you brought it up. Maria Well. One of our problems, though Betty, is that none of those shelters are in our district and we have to think about a bit. To what degree are we getting to? Should we be engaging with city policy and other districts also I know it's connected, but is it going to be effective Joe? We do have some relocated. Some of our normal shelter residents have been relocated away from us, and so they have not returned back. You know, 52Nd street I, don't know about BRC, but I'm assuming that they also had been relocated. Jessica just noted that there are some tenants at BRC on site, right, Jessica and then, of course, you know, we already had shelter residents that were more permanent in hotels like the skyline, the families that were there so I do think that asking that question makes sense, because we have permanent shelter residents that have been moved away and their spaces are empty and their spaces have been or are fitted for the services that they're needed I think it's something not to ignore, just because our density problem on 36th street is about reducing that density and sending you know some folks away from there, but it's more about. We have these buildings that already are homes for our shelter residents and they are not being used at all. How do we think about being able to use the space that already is intended for those homes in a way that keeps them covered safe, is? Are those spaces in district? Four? Well, I have one down the block on 52nd street the ladies. There have been moved away, I don't even know where they went. No give me the well so Betty, it's a little hard to hear you Joe. Okay, sorry so, first and foremost, they're not homes. These are shelters. Let's make that clear, because shelter is a temporary circumstance and that's why there's all this compromise in a shelter? That's either dormitory shared rooms or open rooms for people to sleep in think about it for a moment physically? How do you make that Covid-19 safe? You don't because inherently a shelter is a shared space and they have lots of program spaces and also for activities and counseling, and things I think the problem is when we, if we discuss this, we're actually talking about undoing that which is purposely purposefully built and the city is using FEMA money to rent these temporary rooms. That's why it's able to do it. So it's not as if there's a huge city budget to say: let's go back now and take a congregate, shelter and re. Imagine the whole thing when the city of New York isn't even managing the circumstance we're in so I just am very reluctant to get us into I'm afraid it gives us them a way out to say: oh we're going to study this for you whatever, and then nothing will happen. So Katie I see you're shaking your head. You heading on this. Please yeah a couple things so I think Joe you're, absolutely right and, as many of you know, I am on the board of BRC. But there are lots of details. I don't know about BRC, so I'm not speaking at all, specifically about Vrc right now, but but absolutely congregate. Settings are designed specifically to be congregate. Settings and if you wanted them to be, you know safe, like a hotel, in other words everybody being able to have their own room and their own bathroom. Then, just by definition, the space alone. You would be able to have far fewer people, and you know it would be a huge cost, and indeed you know on a board of a different organization that is women, a women's residence, and it is like a dormitory right in the sense that everybody has their own room. And then there are group bathrooms at the end of the hall, your bathrooms right and the idea of like oh, why don't we see if we can like reconfigure things and do all the cost of putting a bathroom an individual bathroom for each person? I mean those are massive costs so and then also to Joe. To your point about, like you need I mean one of the points is that sometimes people really need not to be alone in a room right, especially if they're having a variety of mental health issues or whatever else so the idea that we would say to them. Listen, we really want you to design it in a way. You know to incur these massive costs so that then they can be alone in a room is ignoring the entire point of why it was designed in a congregate way to begin with and I think the costs are so massive that it would just it's like saying: I, don't know I mean it is so pie in the sky in a way like hey. Do you have millions and millions of dollars to design it in a way that wouldn't even be structured towards your goal, tens of millions of dollars, exactly so just seems like? Is it isn't the city spending millions of dollars, they're spending federal money for a disaster purpose? That's why they can do it so Joe? When does the female money run out? Well, ready? We don't know. We can certainly ask because part of this issue is the city's taking a short-sighted point of view, but I think what Katie's point is you know? Let me give you the example. In some of the Clinton housing supported buildings, we have studios. We also have shared apartments, because certain people actually react better when they're sharing a space, because they have lots of issues and loneliness and stuff going on and that helps socialization and people like watch after each other right. That's a deliberate choice. We've had this issue now people sharing bathrooms and kitchens with Covid-19. So now we have quarantine apartments at the same time since, if God forbid, somebody gets to get sick, but it doesn't remove the underlying issue that in the congregate, shelter or share a department, that's a choice. You're making on purpose in order to help people better themselves, move ahead in their lives and work through their issues right, so we're really in a mess. Okay, I want to say that we're in a mess here, we've taken people who shelter residents, who need to be in a broader setting with a lot of connection engagement, Supervision, Mental, Health physical health stuff and put them in little rooms and they're all among themselves, and so they're not being engaged with in the same way that they would be in a congregate setting, and you can catch things earlier, this health issue or something going on or addiction issues. You know whatever, so we're exact. Basically, this model is exacerbating the social service needs. I felt that for a while right, Katie, I'm not making this up. True, though, I also want to be really clear that you're, absolutely right, I, think I think the providers themselves didn't want people to be alone. You know in all these different rooms, but at the same time they are contractually obligated to be providing the services, so they are figuring out ways to provide the services, but it is definitely depends upon the provider say it again depends upon the provider and they're. Confident and again, absolutely I can't speak to all sorts of things, but but yeah. So absolutely it's trickier in when everybody's in individual rooms and I. Think of suggesting it would to be honest with you, I think it would sound naive because I think it's. It ignores the whole point of why they're congregate to begin with. I'm glad we heard this out, though, because this became a discussion during the budget discussion or whatever it was, and I was like I, don't know how to deal with this. So thank you for my education, my free education about congregate, living I, guess, we'll see what happens on 36th street and 37th street I mean I I'll. Give you an example: Betty like the Jean, Dark, Residence and Leo House. All these things were a cheaper, easier way for people to afford, and they also socialized and create all kinds of relationships that these women's residences were all over. The city they've been closed one after the other. So that's a very common thing that there's a reason these things are done, and you know we're now in a mess because of the congregate, shelter stuff. It's really a mess. Thank you, Maria do we have any I'm sorry, Jessica I was just going to comment on the FEMA stuff, and my experience on a bunch of contracts right now that are FEMA being FEMA funded, is that the city was really. You know for forced or needed to act, didn't know how it was going to pay for things. Just did it and then retroactively going back and trying to find dollars to pay for everything, so I, don't even think I mean Carl, or maybe someone else who has access to city conversations around. This may have better insight, but my sense is that even the city doesn't really know what's ultimately going to be funded from or from city dollars that this is just like. This is true emergency, hoping it all works out, but there's definitely not like a lane or a line to have a conversation about like. Oh what, if we did this differently like people are scrambling just to get it done. Yeah I can support that in the contracts Clinton housing has for homeless services and mental health services during Covid-19. We literally, they just said, apply for funds for all the PPE, the additional, the transport all the things you had to do that were not part of your normal operation. We just got paid for things that were done and complete back in June I mean like you have to advance all kinds of money because of course you, when the trains weren't running, had to get people back and forth to work that kind of stuff. So there's a lot of making it up as we're going along here and the city is in a deep hole and we're going to keep on working through it. I guess: that's all you can do Ria. Do you have any other items on the agenda for tonight? I just wanted to mention some good news about Stardom Hall and then just get a NYCHA update, so the Good News about Stardom Hall, just I'm going to just go back to I know you guys have worked with Lantern community services for years long before my time on the board, but I'm just going to go back to October. 2019 lantern community services came to our committee because they wanted to be part of the budget priorities for additional security. There were tenants and some community members who yeah there were a couple of tenants and some community members who actually did not want that to happen. They felt like there was more issues than additional security could actually resolve. So what happened? Was we started? Having actually I should say, Lantern started holding cab meetings. Once again, they also came back in January to our committee. They were supposed to discuss how they were addressing the concerns that the tenants brought up and community members. That's not what really went down. That's not what really happened, and so we continued engaging them in the cab meetings and our committee wrote a letter which is on the website and they responded and wrote a letter stating which I shared with you guys. I, don't think it's on the website, but I shared it with you all so I hope you read it. If not take a look at it indicating the changes they were going to make to security. For example, the having you know, cameras outside of the building decreasing outsourced security, hiring within their own team resident managers, who you can train them like, for example, with the escalation techniques, how to better, engage the clients. They talked about collaborating with Wynn, which is the shelter across the street, the women's shelter when they return. They talked about the, which is also helpful with the disruptive tenants that they had at their site. They talked about offering housing alternatives to their disruptive tenants, utilizing housing court also HRA agreeing to give more appropriate referrals for their location and, as you can see in their letter, they indicated a date by when they were going to make some of these changes. Everything that they have indicated in their letter has occurred. In addition, they reported on the number of complaints they had received in the past I believe it was one or two months and there were none, so things were going well and even the tenants who were in the cab meeting, you know shared that things were going well, so much so that our next meeting is going to be in January and they'll. Give us an email update for December no progress. Maria can I, make a comment. I must say, since I've been personally involved with this, I can speak to the fact that it has calmed down. The building does not have that number of people in front who create a problem. So from the outward side, as a community member I see a difference, which is a good thing. I just continue to hope that the intake process is properly used so that they use their. You know to choose selectively the people who come to this particular location. Well, not even selectively. They just choose people appropriate for independent living right. Yes, could you also note Maria why there are some people not there and what happened why they were not there. Two of the most disruptive tenants are currently incarcerated and it seems like they might be there for some time. They have upcoming court dates, but it just seems like they will be there for some time. So I think that that's helped bring some calm. Yes, but they're. You know and in addition to the changes that they're making. Thank you for sharing your personal experience because I know for you. This has been really difficult on the block, so glad to hear that the letter is not just a letter but that you are actually experiencing that there's been some positive result for sure. Thank you, Maria and Joe. No Maria's handled this one because I just could not manage it anymore. After the first go. I did the first go with them. Thank you very much. So a quick update on Chelsea NYCHA, that's what you like to do. Yes, thank you. So Hector and I will speak to this Chelsea. The Chelsea knight, the Joshua Knights of working group recommenced really in the in August right Hector. We started again after a huge hiatus because of Covid-19, and the group has been meeting remotely like this ever since both the full group and the subcommittees. It of course, is much more challenging. There's there are over 60 people, 65 people in the Chelsea natural working group, so it's much harder to manage, but I'm really happy to note that the group is starting the actual tenant outreach on the whole overall plan. In the beginning of December, this has been. This was scheduled to start unbelievably, the third week of March, so it is just was of course postponed, and then we try to figure out what to do again in the summer and just figuring out the logistics of how to get 2,100 tenants involved in Elliot, Chelsea and Fulton and really engaging with them. So it's really gone into high gear. Hector can speak about in a moment, but I will note that the other thing we have achieved is that we've really come to a consensus on how to proceed both with tenant rights and protections and tenant engagement, and stated specifically that without the tenants, rights and protections and without tenant engagement actually put into whatever proposal happens that the financing part we will not support. We will support it only if those things are built in and it has been a very long ago and a combination of this rad program. With all these protections for tenants and in an infill in a mixed income way on multiple sites, the west Chelsea, affordable housing fund. We have pulled every single tool we can come up with and the most important thing to announce to the committee. Demolition is now 100 off the table. It is not going to happen, it is not being supported and NYCHA has agreed even better. The deputy mayor and the chair of the housing authority have agreed demolition's off the table, so that took quite a moment to get to I got ta, say, and now it's going to really working with tenants to understand the complexity of a very major plan, so Hector take it away and talk a bit about your thoughts on this. I'm very happy that we've gotten this far I mean it was quite a struggle trying to pull it all together after we shut down for a while there, and- and you know there was some people that we were at odds with, but we all finally came to a common consensus that we needed to get this done because it's been dragging on for a while and the the buildings and the living conditions, because still continue to be dilapidated and conditions are getting worse. Crime rates gone up every you know everything's gotten worse, obviously, so it was really important that we get this done as quickly as possible, rather than drag this on even more due to any kind of differences or any kind of wrong misinformation. That's been put out there and that's all we've been trying to do is try to get the right information into the right hands here, which is the residents and to make them understand that this is not something bad for them. This is actually something really good for the future of our homes here, and a gentleman like Joe who's taken to the helm of a lot of these committees has helped put this together along with a lot of the elected officials, and we owe them a lot so hopefully, as Joe said, we're moving pretty like quickly right now, so we're going to hopefully start getting these these zoom meetings together our sessions together in the beginning of December we're going to do a dry run and see how everything shakes out and then hopefully, we'll have some really good results by the hopefully, by the end of December and probably may drag on it a little bit of January, but we're going to go to January, yeah I. Think that's more realistic, but you I'm getting there. Are you guys? Is the working group meeting weekly? Still oh we're meeting? Oh many more than just a week two and three plenty of meetings that go around. Believe me, so it's we're meeting at least three or four times a week, most of us on top of everything else. Well, thank you for all of that work. Betty Hector Joe thanks a lot yeah Betty, I'm sorry Keith on this Betty, oh just to say, I, think it's rather miraculous because this group is made up of not only elected officials, community board people, residents, resource people from other non-profits. You know mayor's office and I. Don't can't list them all right now, but it's actually an intense effort to get a consensus among these diverse people and it's happening. It is really happening, and it's quite beautiful. I think that there was some talk that December 17th. Maybe there will be a presentation yeah. The community board is trying to schedule now with Jesse a community meeting. We felt it was important to do that. After all, this is rolled out to the tenants. We don't want tenants finding out. Second, it's going to have to find out first right, but the thing that I'm very happy with is that we started out with something that people really hated demolition and privatization, and now we've taken that the demolition's gone. The privatization will be there, but only with a not-for-profit partner, but it will not be, as the city has done it before. It will be embedded numbers and numbers of protections that the Tenants Association and the tenants demanded to be in as part of it and as we went through it, we kept saying we will not proceed on any kind of financing. Without these protections and engagement built in specifically like the tenants, are going to be involved in the design, the construction, the management going forward. How do you do that and we just kept holding out for it, and what I'm very happy to announce is that part of this is using. Let's also, the city initially proposed a need of 344 million dollars for both developments. They did not include putting new heating systems in the tenants, went ape[, _ _] for the right reason on this and from the our end we insisted that we had to increase that budget because, as you know, if you're in Elliot, Chelsea or Fulton, it's all central steam from Con, Edison, there's one main break and all the buildings go down or five buildings. With that at once, instead, there will be individual heating systems in each building and new ones that are efficient, and that was basically we struck that agreement with the chair of the housing authority in these subcommittee meetings that we had back and forth, and it's the kind of thing that they listened. They didn't I'll tell you honestly a lot of times Betty. They didn't like what we were saying at all, but we just kept bringing them down a road on it, and the last thing is for any of the new housing that gets built. Originally, the idea was 80 20 80 market 20 percent, low income; instead it'll be 50 percent market, 50, low, moderate and middle. So there's a good economic integration here, as opposed to saying we're bringing more luxury housing onto the NYCHA campuses. People really felt strongly about that, and I will tell you and after Con tested this until last week. We were still having that conversation, although we thought we settled five months ago, so just to add to that as an added bonus. What I've been seeing is that NYCHA has been taking so many a lot of the ideas from the work group and utilizing it I mean I could see some mirroring going on between the new blueprint they're trying to lay out for the rest of the nature development. So there is a lot of good coming from this work group, not just for Lhlc and Fulton, but it looks like they made they're adapting it in little pieces here and there to their other projects, which is I, think is wonderful and I think moving forward once we're all said and done, we can try to you know. Actually you know, hopefully, they'll use the ideas moving forward, a lot more, maybe even the whole proposal that we have. That's the hope here and the last part to note as one of the sites for housing in order to bring member to when they build infield housing is to bring money into the project, so that raises roughly 100 million dollars. One of the sites is the Hudson guild is going to get entirely rebuilt as part of this and expand it. So I want to give a shout out to Joe on the capital financing I, I'm in awe of him, putting together the numbers of the sites and all this is incredibly complicated thing and the sources of funding, so that I just have to say that. Thank you very much, I have to echo that too Joe I mean honestly. The number crunching crew have done is like phenomenal. I couldn't wrap my head around the whole thing in the beginning, but you've made it into such digestible information that I think it. We have a really good shot of having everybody be on board once we present everything, so I'm very happy about it. Thank you very much. Well done everybody awesome! Thank you. So we're going to hear a lot more about this there'll be a full community meeting. We expect lots of people to scream yell and say it's horrible and that we're a bunch of capitalists and that we're communists and that we're socialists I mean everyone will be called everything. So, but it's when you make big change like this, that a goal you've never forgotten is the Elliot. The Chelsea NYCHA buildings need full renovation, they need new bathrooms kitchens, mechanical systems and heating systems and windows and all kinds of stuff. It's not a minor thing and that's our goal. So it's going to be hard. It's a long-term project too. It's not going to happen today. Motion to adjourn, please wait hold on Carl. What's up, Carl Wilson has his hand raised. Oh Carl Wilson bring him back in today. Carl sorry, I don't mean to keep everybody here much longer, but I just really wanted to echo the herculean effort of Joe, Betty and Hector I mean they've, been going to multiple like at least three or four meetings at times a week on this, and they are long meetings and sometimes very contentious. So I just want to echo the kudos, but also I wanted to give some props to Maria as well for the stardom Hall work. She's been my partner in these meetings for well over a year now, and we really have come I think a very long way on that one and although the two folk, the two disruptive folks that were, are unfortunately incarcerated. As she said, there was a third that has been identified and it was just a really good story with a happy ending where this person they were able, stardom Hall was able to have this woman accept another form of housing, and we understand that she's actually much better. She you know is in it's a much better fit and she is accepting treatment and doing very well so I. It just speaks to you know what we can do when we all sit around a table together and work together. So I kudos to this committee and co-chairs, especially- and thank you, Carl I- forgot, to mention your name before this is Les. Thank you. Well, Carl. We clearly persevere in health kitchen. There's no question about that and we have no choice, amen in Charleston all right. Everybody thanks so much good night.
