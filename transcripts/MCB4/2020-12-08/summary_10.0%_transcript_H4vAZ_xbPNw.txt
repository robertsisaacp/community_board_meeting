Oh well, Now it looks like I think I have Steve hold on one second, unless you guys do want to do.
Thank you good evening, panelists and attendees, and welcome to the December regularly scheduled meeting of the arts, culture, education and Street Life Committee.
You can put that in the chat, If you're, calling in on phone star six to unmute Star nine to let us know that you want to ask a question: oh I am unmuted Alan.
We also had some small work over at 834, which was the high school of environmental science that we had concluded a little while back upcoming projects that we will have in your district currently on board.
Do there, As far as the updates on the villains, In my understanding with Jesse, he had just wanted some updates on the buildings that we're working on currently and where we stand.
We have to secure 10 properties for license agreements, we're going to kind of follow an example of that, whatever elevation that we can get West East North south, If we can get the properties along, anyone at elevation will start to work on that elevation right, now, We're kind of zeroing in on looking at 9th Avenue to get the work done there and.
Completion of November of this year, but I'd like the board to be informed, and you should be aware that we currently have a new bulletin and for work on the main roof that will we discovered that it needs work.
We are still adhering to the stop loud noise at 10:30, p.m, though, of course, There are different opinions from neighbors who call us, but Jesse I want you to know as well as Al and the committee that we are answering every complaint, either through email or phone calls, and we are working in conjunction with the councilman's office and with the Community Board district manager.
We have the stone work above and below the windows to do, and we have an accessibility project where we're going to put an ADA bathroom and a lift system in by the main entrance of the school building, so that we can have accessibility for people who are disabled.
This job, We expect to be done, we're looking at November of 2021 with the new estimate due to the Covid-19 situation, where we were shut down for about five months at that work, site also, and that's where we are with M111,834.
I saw that school was included as a subject, conversation for your board, I mean for your community, so the work we had done.
We, probably lost a year in terms of work, so we're looking at an original new date of finishing the work by April of 2022, and that's where we stand right now with the projects.
Sorry I just wanted to highlight that I brought over principle from the high school of environmental science.
It can be a mentor job that we do also, but again depends upon what kind of work is being done if there are, If there's a question of camera installation in Ps11, I'm more than happy to look it up.
Is in there for design for m33, which, by the way I neglected to, let you know is that we're actually doing two room: conversions in the building for the school, we're almost completed for the first floor, conversion.
However, If teachers are going into the school to conduct remote teaching or if there's any kind of student activity such as I, don't know clinics, sometimes from this building have clinics for the community, We are not allowed to work during the day we keep our evening.
There is a blue DOT or a red DOT on the Covid-19 map for the DOE and or the situation room reports, a Covid-19 case that calls for such a closing of a classroom or the building, We do not go on to the work site until the school classroom or the building is cleared.
So, that's the policy just so you know that if the building has that code on and I'm sure you guys look at the Covid-19 Daily map once in a while.
Then we come in the next day after the school's been reopened, so just to put that as another piece of information that you'll understand the work practices that were that part of what we're undergoing with the Covid-19 pandemic surrounding us.
Oh Michael, Allen, Brian Matlin has some follow-up questions, so I'm just gonna bring him over to speak because I think okay, more help is more effective.
So, unfortunately, It gets backed on to the end, and that brings us to November, but we currently have a work assignment request going through regarding the main roof of the building.
This is about Ps 11, and so since the work is not going to be cleated completed until 2022, is there any way that the school can have at least some use of their yard.
I'll, Let, Umberto or Steve answer whoever's appropriate when you were talking about working during the day if there are no classes in session and no teachers in the school, What I'm just trying to understand.
Okay, So we're not looking at a situation where we might have people working from 8 a.m, to midnight, for example, no, definitely not for the possible future, but you never know.
You be able to stay on because I think the high school for environmental science has a brief presentation on what's what their process.
You know looking at the programs looking at what can be done if you'd rather send me an email which should be better for me, because then I can get it to the right people to have the conversation with and get you more appropriate answers.
The silent film era, it was converted to offices and then eventually, high school, for environmental studies moved in there in 1994, They had an initial lease and then guaranteed a 10-year extension, which now expires in 2023.
So I, don't if the people who own the lease where to take it back I, don't know what they would use it for, but it would put our programming at risk and all the pictures that principal Nashville showed you all.
The main ask is, Basically you want to know whether you're getting a lease extension or not.
That's, what you're listening for and whether or not one is in the works, because that, obviously that drives the bus for all the capital projects and res away projects being done in your building since, with less than five years to go, It seems that there again there's a hesitancy to want to make this kind of investment into the building.
I might get the same response that right now, It's not a high priority that there may be other leases that are actually up within a year that they're negotiating now.
I just want you to know that it's a school maintenance issue in water, fountain repairs and things like that and the custodian, If he's not able to fix, it, should put in, what's known as a Po18 to the Ddf, the deputy director of facilities for that district in which that school is located or for that school, since they're losing guys left and right, they're reassigning schools all over the place.
However, many months since March, as you may know, One of the things that we can do is write a letter in support, so just curious.
Would something like this get on your SCA website in terms of if people are looking at their old school or you know, what's going on here, and they would they be able to go onto your site and see what construction protocols are what they need to do in terms of having some of these remarks that we put in the letter on your website.
You know as much as I can get out there in a letter that won't people won't throw away right as soon as they first.
You got to figure out the best way to explain it and just leave them with a contact information number to get a hold of me so that they can discuss it because you know there are interests in it by a lot of people and there are groups.
You know it's just so many different ways of looking at things from different parts of the city.
Steve, Happy Holidays for you and yours stay safe, So Josephine, one of the things is they did a 10-year extension, but what happens is as soon as like three years into the lease they stopped doing any work, starting.
Well, I mean we're going to have a discussion about it, but thank you for letting us know.
Okay, I think what we might want to do, Instead of just popping out a letter that you know, We support your request.
What we'll do is we'll contact you and get a separate meeting with a couple of the committee members so that we can have a you know, a discussion strictly based on what the facts and get some information, maybe on what we can ask for maybe get some feedback from Carl Wilson on this.
Here, curious that I hear from you are there other things that we should be prioritizing if the committee, either tonight or at a future, date, wants to write a letter in support of what your team wants to provide some continuity and stability in terms of your facility.
We haven't been able to request through the resulay portal for certain kinds of capital projects, because the shelf life was expiring in 2023, I mean smart boards are old now, but we're not able to replace them because they're fixed to the wall and if the building won't be there in 2023, they can't remove or install them.
I would have appreciated my bleachers four years ago, when I was given the resume funding or the elevators need to be fixed right or like all of those things.
If, there's a bad way about getting some of these things done, You know they fixed our that we had a ventilation issue where they fixed that the SCA, but when it comes to specifically asking for an additional capital project through the res away process through any result funds, we can't use them on projects that we specifically request and.
If that could be in play here at all, I, don't know who could answer that, but I think maybe we should educate ourselves on that before we send a letter.
You know what can be done now without having to worry about a lease negotiation in terms of any type of capital work, whether it be DOE, whether it be the building owner, whether it be the I mean the property owner or whoever.
Together, like Alan said, is good and I think that, but that does require a letter.
They have to sit there and negotiate this out for years, hoping that this works out right and not just go off and sell it and rent it to another space, and so you know I, don't think the process is the best it can be.
And I think we should definitely highlight that because it does, you know what might work for just negotiating office.
Think also that you know every situation is unique and so just saying, oh, we're not going to really deal with this until we're a year.
The funding and the school isn't getting the capital needs and the in the expenses, and that means parents might not be wanting to send their kids to the school.
That area, of course, will be included in this extensive letter of outreach right, but at the end of the day, we need to know who is the mayor's representative that is working along with the panel for education policy to find out.
Some reason why they wouldn't renew that's the kind of information that we need to know that we can work with before we make a demand that we want these repairs to be go ahead and do everything that is being requested there.
I think you're kind of spot on, Although I'm just concerned that, If we ask them to give us a reason as to why they won't extend the lease, then they're just put their feet in the ground and will lose the emerald gem of high schools in New York City in the country, I've known principal nozbery.
When you bring up something like that, and because the SCA has decided that it does not want to upgrade, We have to call the question how they prioritize the upgrades of those Shsat schools and their buildings.
As I, just said, Everybody knows what this school means to the city, and everyone knows how it can shape people.
Again all the work that your team is doing for students in Hell's kitchen across the city who travel to the school, we're going to shift gears, now.
You know in support of this school and extending the lease I think that Alan's right we need to do another.
So I, don't know, I can't really separate what letter needs to be written, So I think we need to do that first and then figure out how to move.
If you're asking me the contents of the letter that we need to work out on a separate call, Jesse does that fly.
I think the broad strokes would be that we are one in support of the size school being renewed police being renewed right and that it's staying here and that its capital projects be funded.
You can say that we believe that the current way of or process for, negotia negotiation, the city negotiating lease renewals with for school, property.
It seems to be in conflict with how and the way that a attribute you know a regular school would operate and it being able to fund its capital projects and broad strokes.
The details with this particular school will find from probably talking, like everybody said here with some of the elected officials getting the right people on the phone with the mayor's office, DOE.
Oh yeah, We know the importance, but we really have to say we support the lease being renewed, but in the interim work needs to be done.
I think the important thing the emphasis has to be on what they need: now, not on the lease being done.
Maybe in a couple of years, Betsy and I would actually pose questions in the letter to like to the elected officials, because I think if we say that and Katie is right, but if we say that they're just gonna say: Oh there's this provision, it's a rule, We can't do.
You know you need to, but whatever couple of things, but just to be clear, I was talking about broad strokes, for you guys voting on something.
Right is that we're, including another foundational bullet point, which is that we're all in agreeance that no matter what you know, what we're saying is the process to start negotiating that lease.
I, think that's a different meaning that we need to get S-c-a-d-o-e down and ask questions and find out what are the nuances, about.
We have students who you know are on crutches have physical disabilities when the one elevator goes out, which happens multiple times, a year, they're stuck on the first floor and they can't access their classes and we have to bring.
It's, just not you, it's just not I, don't think it's gonna work that way.
Your lease is over goodbye or is the always saying you know we don't want to do anything with this building.
We combined, two schools, so if Doa or the landlord, whoever doesn't want to renew why they're going to put capital.
I just wanted to add one last thing: If I could yes, I understand exactly what they're saying, and so when I was saying about doing starting their projects immediately, it is with a lease guarantee because they're not going to renew a lease.
So, it's all into one letter, but we're sending it to are the power brokers, the ones that are actually going to be talk about the deciders of this process, which is you know, a city hall and basically read street.
So I just want to clarify that, as you know, What we're thinking we're doing.
Well, sorry, in my mind, I was thinking about who the letter was going.
Okay, so, while Malik's renaming himself I'll, just I'll, say hello, and thank you so much for inviting us to come and present my name's Alicia Hanson, I'm, the founder and CEO of a nonprofit organization called NYC salt located on 29th and 7th, and we're a visual arts program focusing on photography and video storytelling and college preparation with kids from underserved areas of the city.
Actually, She knows any after school programs that I could join and improve my photography and she recommended Saul and a couple.
I'm missing a lot of things right now, but that's like the kind of things off topic that I could really think of right now and even now, as an alumni after four years of graduating, I'm, still pretty much very involved in the program.
It's got lots of great pictures if you want to just go through it, while people answer questions just to see the photos, I won't be redundant in repeating the information, but it's kind, of.
You know I work for the photo unit for the New York City, Fire Department, and we're always looking for interns.
Do you ever work with city agencies because I'd love to get a you know, intern photographer.
Tonight, Alicia I wanted to know a little bit more about the exhibit that you guys I, think just closed.
That's going on I, don't know if any of you have noticed, but now's a great time to buy art, because so many artists are starving and looking for a way to sell their work.
A lot of work has gone on behind the scenes, with Josephine leading the charge to figure out if we can get a Learning Bridges site in Midtown, West folks likely remember the letter that was ratified through exec and then voted on at full board.
If we get a site, maybe invite folks who are working there, students who are attending their parents, who are sending their kids there to share with us what their experience has been because one thing to flag for this group is sites like Learning Bridges are being operated in cities around the country, and many school systems are being a bit more expansive in their thinking about what these sites can.
There's a lot of potential opportunity for thinking differently about what school will be like when kids do get to go back to it.
Because I think some parents had wanted to I, don't even know if they're still on the call.
You want to take us through what street life is up to or has done, or is thinking of, doing, yeah.
If you know it's an area that you wanted to look into, further, and.
So, you know, I, think Judith brought up another imported street life.
So the process there is, you know, I, think a similar one where we could take a look around the neighborhood.
I do think there are things that we know are going to overlap with transportation planning in general in terms of just the topic, but also maybe previous policies that a committee is and therefore, and the board has put out.
Just, because I think that would be a you know, really productive dialogue, and then we can also bring up the bike issue at the same time.
You know work on some free questions that we can send over that'd.
So I, don't know if I'll be able to stay until the end of the meeting, but we're just going to hear what Jimmy and his legislative liaison wants to you.
I, don't quite know, I, don't think our letter would get out in any event anyhow.
You know when we have more time to deal with what we want to say in the future letter.
Initiatives, as it applies to some diverse theater groups and different cultural organizations in our neighborhood that we can kind of spotlight highlight get to know things like that, so excited to be working on that great.
You know I just want to say that so don't feel like you have to scuttle.
Judith I, don't know the answer, but I don't think he was I.
