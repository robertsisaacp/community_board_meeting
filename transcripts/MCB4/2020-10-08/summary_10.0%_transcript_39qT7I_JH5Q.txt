I'm, going to use that environmental discussion at the segway to officially call our community Board four's waterfront parks and Environment Committee meeting to order.
We had proposed removing one of the trees that was located in an area of the expanded dog run, and we were doing that to accommodate the water play for the dogs in a more centralized location, and you asked us to reconsider that and take a look at preserving that.
You also asked us to see if we could provide additional, photovoltaics and or other green energy solutions incorporated into particularly into the comfort station, but I believe it was just a general comment and asked us to take a look at no touch type of fixtures in the conversation as well as site locks into the restrooms also ask for us to consider what it would mean to the design to take into account our current situation, where social distancing is so important and then also asked us.
Those are the areas that we had to really focus on in terms of incorporating your comments and looking at redesign and refinement next, so that included, the dog runs the picnic area, the entrance, the comfort station, some of the plantings and the synthetic turf field.
You, also see that we're maintaining circulation along the sidewalks, maintaining the circulation from 24th street into the park along the basketball, area, The, basketball, courts- You can also, then see that we have the stills have the three entrances into the dog run.
You get to see some of the thinking in terms of how we're going to be utilizing new trees, tree canopy to start to create and emphasize spaces just like to chime in one of the things that we here at the trust really liked about this design is that we've really cut back on the hardscape in this in this design.
We, obviously were looking to preserve as many of the healthy existing mature trees as we could, both within the park, as well as the street trees.
When the plans come up, it provides flowering interest in the spring and then in the fall you may have seen it provides these little papery seed enclosures, which are a really lovely like fall interest, Then they also have the added benefit of you know a light, breeze kind of creates this sort of fluttering and noise sort of aspect to them.
Maybe to make note of, is the gladicia up in the left hand corner that's a tree that we've selected to use in the picnic area, and that is primarily because it's got a light, open, airy sort of head right.
You know, we're all we've also considered maintenance , regimens right where Hudson River Park has traditionally done a great job with maintenance.
You know all of these kinds of parks and open spaces: It's always a challenge with maintenance.
Your sight lines go straight across the park and you kind of start to get a hint of the tree grove at the picnic area and then in your mid ground.
We're looking to use granite curbing throughout the park and then just to the left of the main entrance.
You know, raised a bit we're looking at doing low fencing on top of those on top of those curves to help protect the planting.
We definitely intend to do furniture very similar to this, but the specific model we're still working through with our maintenance people making sure, like the specific model, is totally maintainable and what we want to use so movable furniture where you see it, but And, then this highlights the custom bench seating that we're proposing utilizing stainless steel for the supports and the arm What this bench really starts to do is to create you know a variety of options for seating.
They are also spaced at a distance that would deter someone from laying on them, which is you, know, an important way to help monitor usage in the park next.
We're looking to utilize, reclaimed, stone from the existing park and then seating and then.
There is planting surrounding on the outside the stone walls, and then the one thing I neglected to mention when we were at the at the plan is that we are making some minor modifications to the play area directly, opposite, particularly to the entrance to accommodate stroller parking, and we are also planning to change that fence.
You start to see what the what the Festoon lighting would look like and how the space would feel just one quick thing that the trees are far along in this image.
You know that elevated seating that we talked about previously, which gives you a really nice vantage over the entire dog, run in order to accommodate that we had to shift around some of where we were locating the granite walls, and so we have done that so that tiered seating now backs up against granite walls, which will be those repurposed granite, walls.
Number four is the new location of the water play area in the large dog, run And again we're utilizing that stone wall as a backdrop to that to one help protect from water spray from moving out onto the sidewalk there, and it also gives us the benefit of being able to kind of stack up some of the granite blocks to utilize for other water features in that area.
I may have missed something, so somebody else feel free to jump You look up on the West side, just adjacent to where number six is number six, which is the Sally port entrance that comes in from the park.
Is the small dog run, that's the going around the existing tree and it will incorporate a tree grate around the opening.
Okay, comfort station, all right, John, you're, muted, John, oh good, evening, everyone I'm, well caffeinated, so I will try to speed up my slides a little bit just the first slide is just showing the location of the comfort station, which is nestled between existing tree lines, existing paths and existing fences for the playing field.
If you could stay on this for a second, the blue area is exploration, we're doing in trying to reuse a good quality of the existing granite stone to cut it and reconfigure it to create interesting patterns that are really durable for the park.
It looked like there might be a tree or something that would prevent people from the street from seeing them, And. So you know we just want to make sure that if there is a vendor there in the future that there's you know ways for them to attract customers from outside of the park.
Thank you for putting in more of those solar panels that and that it's going to light up most of the park.
I think the amount of space that you would lose to the park by creating the site locks would be negligible.
I guess, if you can hear me, my response is, if we're looking for sustainability and we're trying to maximize solar energy to have open open, sight, locks, exiting entrances is kind of counter to that So you're, actually just throwing hot or cooled air out, But I, really in this day and age, not would not have exterior sight locks in a climate like New, York And, it does take up more space.
It needs some minor repair which we're going to include in this project, but we will be lowering so right now that overlook area is several feet higher than the field elevation.
I, think that we could take that up a little bit further down the line, but for tonight does the committee feel strongly one way or another if we need to memorialize anything in a letter, the group has been outstanding at incorporating our feedback.
I mean the parkway was made because the builder of this building, I think it was a man named Hyman, Shapiro, agreed to do the park and then the plaza in front of the sheffield in return for the added walls that was in 1977, we can't find the original plan and we can't find with a city planning.
That's what he wanted to make it a continuous park, but that fell apart and it did not work The, director of community and government affairs at wnet and that plan- So, then the park just began to fall and disrepair, and by this time I was a member of the City Council and the cat, and that was in my district, The green market moved in.
I think, reasonably continued this and when we when Balsley came in with a second part that was through well, Eric was the main thing, but so was whatever you know our speaker, but he was not the speaker than he was our local city council member anyway , Some of the chairs of the community boards in between have been more generous than others, and so it's been a struggle My mother also lived in the Sheffield before it became a condominium, and so I saw what it looked like in different phases until it got straightened.
Also, the Parc Vendome started their facade repair and they were working they're working on the 56th street side, so they have extended a shed, and I do not know if it's a whole building or What onto the park And that's closed the play area which always which has been in disrepair.
We do not Wanna really open the whole park, and since we suspect that people want the parko open or some people do, we would like to propose a compromise where we open the kiosk and the seating area for the kiosk and that we keep it somehow closed at the other end in the meantime, last week or two weeks ago, with the wind One of the old trees fell and it could have been a disaster It been open.
We've heard that people want the park open.
And she's, the one who really started the fact that the park needed repair so eric and The office was so helpful to us, because I mean Anita you're We try to work very carefully, and now we have the same managing agent that the Parc Vendome has and that we have so hopefully that's going to also help make things easier.
You know: I, live on that block as well For next year , I'm just going to make you a little louder, but you know what the trouble with the grass is not only the pigeons, but there are people who take their dogs on the grass.
It does not include money, because we have the scaffolding where the Sheffield was the first one to do the facade stuff and our scaffolding went slightly, I, think Affected Anita did it affect the parking lot went into our garden area You know it's something, that's what happens in New York, because the City, Council and I'm afraid I was on it and that local 11 was passed.
The way we feel is that okay, let's work something out with the Sheffield, but why should we have to pay for a park that took away our air rights?
We could work out a deal where the Parc Vendome maintenance people would take one power washing during the day or something like that.
But what I do see is that the problem with the pigeons is that the gate is closed and if the gate were opened, if the park were opened again, then the people would not be tossing in seed.
We should discuss it more with their our building managers and the boards right, because now what is happening is that there are people standing on the sidewalk feeding the pigeons from the sidewalk.
I agree with you, but I just wanted to say: When the park was open, people braze were brazen and just fed.
And I do not know what you do for people like that , I wish I had an answer for you, but I think it's just very sad when the people are making it bad thanks, sally two things: I'm going to go to Leslie before I go to Chris, because Leslie has not spoken yet, but I.
You might know this as well--is that it's essentially a public park, because it's on right on 9th avenue on 57th street, but It's, but it's maintained privately and the people who maintain it privately are not even really adjacent to it.
Now, because it's locked up or the maintenance is not as good as maybe you would see a regular city park because they just do not have the staff or the money or the constant, attendance, and I think that's a problem.
I'm, the person now who's back working on the park, all right, so we should pull it together and discuss it, and when they we get the bids back, and I know exactly what, where the tripping hazards are You mentioned that you were talking with your board about this, since it's such a huge cost to You know wanting ownership of this park any longer, at least among some of your share of your members.
I used that park after school in the fall and spring I know that like when you give kids ownership of something they have a tendency of taking pride in its maintenance and its look in the future.
The problem is, I guess, you know who's going to supervise it, but we could work that out.
I just feel like with only 40 of the student body at that high school now attending, and we do not know what next year is going to look.
It's the same thing and we do not even know when it's going to be open.
Is the park actually going to be open halfway in a month?
The only way to solve the pigeon problem is by opening the park.
So we did not go in to maintain it also because the Parc Vendome started their construction and they that really made us close off the playground, part and part of it, and I do not know if you want people sitting in the park when you've got scaffolding not too far away from you.
Know, maintain and open this park.
I do not know if we have to go back to the city planning department or we have to we'll definitely be coming back to you, but I do not think that's going to happen until for a while.
If anybody has new stuff to add that can be considered by when, frankly, by the time I turn around the survey, I think budget task force meets Leslie, I'm kind of looking at you or Alan.
I think you're 100 right that we're going to see some shifting in priorities of keep it clean, keep it open and the rest is sort of frosting from what we can get right.
