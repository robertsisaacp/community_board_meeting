One of the issues ongoing issues that we have is packaged stuff,, especially in residential buildings, and what one of the things we trying to encourage people is If. You can walk up to the front door, look into the building and see packages.
I think all over Manhattan and there is- has been a rise of homeless people out on the street, and that is, you know.
Think people like to see the police out on the street And it can make people feel safer..
We recognize that you know there are people that are upset with police in We Want to do as much as we can to cooperate and work with the public at the end of the day.
We are going to get through this, we're doing everything we can to come combat crime and local issues, and here at the 10% we want to continue to have good, relationships.
They brought up about the border issues, and you know people felt that They were kind of being neglected because they're close to the border and so on, which you know I, completely understand that, I work with them to put officers up there in that location.
You know, that doesn't always work because it, it's a, If you could switch shifts one shift, the precinct felt crosses over the street.
There are people that are that have substance, abuse that have Mental health issues, and it really you know, New York is not the only one with the problem.
You know I, don't want to get too much into politics, because that's not my purview for this right, but It is a complicated issue.
I was involved in one of the co Chair of housing, health and human services, and I was involved in the meeting prior to beginning me, At the end of the month, we're having a Community Council meeting at Manhattan, Plaza.
There were police officers assaulted,, including officers within the confines of the 10th present You, know what was going to take place in Manhattan or,, you know, in New York City in general.
Okay,, I'm just, you know,, I, am aware of that letter and to my understanding, the police.
Department of sanitation was a bit of a exception to that they actually laid out new sort of program and service costs that they were going to do to realize their $59 in savings.
My understanding was that it was mayoral agencies only meaning that the Community Board,, which operates under the borough president's budget, would not have been affected by the potential layoffs.
You have a question for Mr NY black So, I mean the deal we budgets, you know, in the neighborhood of $28 billion.
There were a large number of cuts that were You know, for diverse I, guess in their impact and added up to that total about $400 million What is the current Ballpark depth service for New, York City, and you know our thing when you say borrowings that include the issuing of debt bonds, things of that nature.
You can speak to what is happening with essays budget and what is likely to happen in the near term future, because this is a very urgent issue with schools reopening with students, very soon.
I'm here today to ask you to send a letter to the city, council and speaker Corey Johnson, to request that the Council's Committee on Oversight and investigations launch an investigation of the NYPD And they're in for budget transparency purposes for the NYPD concerning their actions and their attempted besieged ONE OF, MY, HOME, ON, AUGUST, 7, 2020,, I'm, open to any questions or anything about my statement.
Is Inappropriate I fear, deep down in my core that if I opened my door to those officers,, my life would be swiftly taken like that of my friend status mckerrow in 2015, He was having a mental health crisis and someone called 911 They sent an army of officers instead of social services.
We know that the facial recognition software was used,, but how and why community board for can be a partner in this work to hold the NYPD accountable for their actions on August 7 And stand up for the rights of your black neighbors, I urge you to sing your proposed letter to speaker, Johnson and the city.
We are going to move on now that the letters will be addressed that they are new business.
Part of that is going to be contingent on getting some street space,, which I know the mayor is working on with public schools.
And are over 62 and we just wanted to present ourselves to the community,, because we do have vacancies available and we know that there were folks in need and Again.
I'm, a resident of West 36, three Also, a public member on the land use and zoning committee and I'm, calling in regards to The temporary shelter situation on West, 36 and 37 street, This month,, but We've seen little to no change or progress in the situation.
Is open for those residents, students Take at Food, knowing door dining we're maintaining a full complement of public safety officers on the campus and building some grants.
I'd like to make a motion to table the two letters from the Social Justice Task Force, because we have not had Any public discussion on that.
We have not had an opportunity for the broader public to speak to these two issues that were writing on Then, on whether or not the motion is to amend the agenda.
They are a working group show they are not a committee, so they don't have to be public..
By email decided to submit these letters, I agreed to take them as new business because they would be available for public discussion and they would be available for board discussion.
Case, for the implications of your wouldn't send this back to the working group to hold a public meeting,, perhaps a hearing, and then that's the setting where this will be discussed and come back, wouldn't go to a specific committee, just curious.
I was considering also your aces letter to go ahead and take that off the agenda because there hasn't been public discourse.
If you are comfortable with this, would be working group will have a public meeting where there's an opportunity for the public to comment on the letters.
The agenda, I will ask the working group to hold a public meeting to continue with this process.
As opposed to working group.- Now, a task forces public meetings- are our budget.
So, Is there, any issue, which is taking referring this back to the working group.- They are like make a substitute motion to refer back to the working group and hold a public meeting, I think what rather than position,, but it should be air fully public Yeah, I Wanted, to suggest that maybe what we have done in other situation is let those letters to be on the agenda.
That was the thought of the chair and adding these to the agenda at this time that we would have an opportunity that would be available to the public that we would have an opportunity to discuss it as a board.
Issues raised by social justice group members and the community board members, as well as the folks in the community.
There was a response that was called for, and it was communicated via email, first amongst Katie and I, and the chair and Jesse and Some of the social justice group, members.
Explain for these letters to be on the agenda is to have community boards.
Working Group is not a committee and we were told that we could not have public sessions.
I mean obviously I'm quite new to the community board only having been on it, a few months.
There is a history of proposing letters at the full community board to be discussed when they are time.
I will amend to add both kit, originally mentioning and Joe clarifying to send back to the working group to have a public discussion.
The emotion is to remove these lead two letters from the agenda and have them referred back to the working group and ask the working group to hold a public session.
Those are some of the things we're still working on the issue of affordable housing, talking to different People, like a board for who knows everything about affordable housing,, but the rest of the world doesn't So we're trying to put together, if not for the immediate, but for the future.
She was at a press conference earlier this evening, talking about that and how important it is, think you all know, that.
You know, we're going to keep trying to do everything that we can to support the post office to make sure that elections balloting goes smoothly in November, that make sure people get their medications.
We, think it's really out of control here in the city, and The letters on the on the board, report.
I held a press conference at Farley with our great colleagues and remember Godfrey, to in the borough president and council, members, Carlene, Rivera, and Keith powers about the need for ballot drop boxes in the state of New. By voting by mail to the US post office or having to go to a polling site and drop off a balance.
We could also wanted to note that There's clearly An issue with With small businesses and their rent- It's the front door to New York City, in many respects,, and they need to cut these small businesses or break,, whether it's a complete,, you know,, rent, forbearance, or abatement.
I think, you know, There, are a number of things where the city went way too far in terms of budget cuts,, whether it be cuts to Social Service providers or Cuts to litter basket.
You, know, I think there are hundreds of millions of dollars, where we cut the city cut way too deep,, and it was one of the reasons that I voted against the budget.
Let people know I'll, be sending out an email tomorrow, actually about for parents who can afford to not have their pandemic.
You know, full time remotely we're helping people get food through the get food program.
One community issue that people reached out.
We are asking people to go online and try to find their nearest center so that they can donate blood, if they are able to they're opening up more of their centers, as things are getting a little bit Better in the city with Covid-19, and it's all over New York state.
You know what we're working on in terms of Public, Safety and street issues regarding The, temporary homeless, shelters.
Jessica is our second vice chair will be chairing the budget Task Force and we are working on ideas to streamline the process,, especially given what we heard from the comptroller's office.
And These are the new, the new business letters that are going to come up out of aces that you will hear more about,, but I want to single out the work of Leslie, because Ian Murphy and Josephine ish month, We've gone above and beyond the call in trying to solve problems that the administration hasn't even solved.
Chair of the committee, is going to present the four letters, Bert.
We have five new business letters that came out of the month of August.
Nobody chose to spoke to speak about them during the public session, with the exception of Mr Ingram on the letters concerning him.
That's what people want to Do. We sent it to aces in September, we'd, be sending letters to do we, at the beginning of October about schools that open two weeks, earlier.
Some of you have read the letter because all during the day, I was getting suggestions, modifications, friendly, amendments,, I, know,, Marty.
I, just want to say one thing, by the way, and online 31 I think the governor should be at it because we talked about this is addressed to the governor,, the state legislature.
So I'd like to ask Leslie to speak to us about the project and letter and Just.
I guess the feeling was is that they didn't want to test everyone, because I mean you could catch it on the way to school, you know, on the subway on the way: home.
I, think this letter is number eight, and I just had a procedural question on eight and I.
You know, community board for voted on the way we have all the other letters, it?
So I'll pass it over to Josephine to talk specifically about outdoor learning, letter, which I really appreciate her taking the lead, on, I know that.
I believe we had a caller on earlier from core layers, which is actually a private school,, but he Was talking about how important the outdoor learning is, and this letter is not about that at all.
This letter really is about is the fact that safety issues is It. A street crime have not been addressed by the mayor's office or the do.
We don't know in terms of what's happening with the outdoor The school safety officers are not going to be able to be outdoors.
Amendment will already be incorporated,, but I did feel that it would be nice if the letter could include some positive ideas on how to improve safety and my beef it up a little bit in terms of Security, Staff or signage, or some kind of Barriers or cones to delineate the school area, so that people would know not to be carousing in that particular area..
The first issue: is: Should we be addressing this letter at all right, now.
And, then the second issue is: If we are going to address these letters.
Now, what should they say, Are we adopting them, as is because I already know, people have comments on the letters.
The second thing is that I'd like to add a line to that letter to ask the New York Police Department.
I'm, going to ask you to hold the comments on the addition to the letter.
Think on the second letter now with facial recognition.
So, the social justice working group was formed, as we all know, in June.
We know that Gil brewers office has already written a letter requesting more information about it.
I also think it's really important to know again that this is The whole issue of accountability, about how decisions are made within the police structure.
You, know comments on the letter.
The financial I'd like to know what it costs to No matter day, but that's in the letter, David.
The part That really raises alarm bells with me, since we really are a community board, that's known for having a level headed approach to Negotiating diplomacy, and if we have letters that are going out like this, that are filled with very volatile language without getting the right kind of without getting any response.
And I, think via the community that I do know because more often than not.
So, going back to your question that the freedom walking out on the streets precisely why we should be Asking that question and sending the letter.
I requested to be on the social justice working group when it was brought up in a meeting Now. This letter comes out.
We're, not his legal representation, and we need to make sure that as a community board that they continue to take us seriously and not think that we're just reactionary I will go in favor of the letter with changes when it comes up,, but I think we need public discussion and public I, don't mind if the letter is voted on.
At the same time, they wanted to work with a police to try to solve these problems.
The social justice committee, sit down with a couple of us on the community who have been fighting these issues for many years, and who are now being alienated from the community board because of your excessive rhetoric in these letters.
Is there something that we don't know, and, and the letter.
However, on by the way you know you say you asked Derek Ingram in at the behest of the social Justice working For us to go out and pick people on the community to come.
So I would definitely recommend that the first letter goes out and maybe, you know, a second one in a different way.
That's the meeting that you were referencing, But I'm part of the social justice working group I did hear people take the officers to task.
Other thing I wanted to add is that I did see the letter beforehand and email.
The first letter is a lot of questions that we would like.
Other side, quote: unquote, whether that's giving the public a chance to weigh in on both these letters or By. So I'm, going to be personally voting, against.
If we do I think that it would be great to balance it out by having other people answer, questions and be part of the roundtable conversation and not just NYPD Just, wanted to add that, you know, I was one of the people on in the anti racist groups.
And I reach out to the school community, all the time to parents or parents who don't even know that we exist.
This was sort of like a beginning of the conversation, and the questions I think are something that needs to be Asked, and I.
You know, I'm not going to address a lot of the language in the letter.
I speaking as a community member I, I think that the second letter.
I think the both letters are important and should go out..
And I think that they need to constantly be held to account for those and to You know,, go before the public and explain themselves.
There's this dichotomy between sending the letter or having a public process.
I would hope that this wouldn't end with the letter and that we can perhaps in the latter,, ask the NYPD or members of the NYPD to come and speak with us, you know.
You know, being open to public information were starting with this process.
I want to go back to Joe for some concrete edits now about what you would suggest, and what Can the tone of what I'm hearing from the majority of the speakers is that they'd like to see this letter, revised, So, Joe, I'm, going to ask you to The first thing I would suggest is that this goes, not just to Corey Johnson, but goes to the mayor and the police commissioner and Corey Johnson.
So Let's Just jump in here real quickly, low, because I think this is important, so I think I think you've got a legal response here to We did discuss this with people in a social justice working group, but legally arrests can absolutely happen without a warrant.
There is enough record to look at about the incident,, so we can cite that I just,, you know,, so that would make me a whole lot more comfortable if we're not coming up with the opinions of what would happen, we're using public record rather than us.
You know,, we go to work with someone.
, I, mean, I, think we can, you know, give an opinion as a, as a community.
Brett was You know, trying to add that to the letter.
I'm Going to Pose emotion, that I want someone to make, but Do. We have any more comments on letter.
The letter back to the social justice working group that will take advice from the executive committee.
