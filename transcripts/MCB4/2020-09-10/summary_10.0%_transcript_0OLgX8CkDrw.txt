One of the issues ongoing issues that we have is packaged stuff, especially in residential buildings, and what one of the things we trying to encourage people is If We. Think it's a good idea to get them involved in terms of if packages are in the vestibule or just in line of sight, you can walk up to the front door, look into the building and see packages From the door so that, if someone walks in, they cannot see the packages, because a lot of that is actually crime of opportunity.
But then you know speaking of homeless, miss that is one of , you're I think all over Manhattan and there is- has been a rise of homeless people out on the street, and that is, you know : We had a hotel on 42nd street to catch hotel, and they had to evacuate everybody, and so that hotel is no longer being used as a shelter and the hundred and one people that were there I believe, were moved to Brooklyn A couple further things regarding this In about 10 weeks ago, or so there is several members of the lower kind of Hell's Kitchen area created, Their own organization, With different people, stakeholders within the command Officers out on the street It was called is the way they frame that which meant eight cups in a particular area.
It is a public health issue and DHS obviously is involved in that We recognize that you know there are people that are upset with police in We want to do as much as we can to cooperate and work with the public.
That's kind of my overview and update about things and the 10th precinct and the police department and I am You, are a member of the public and wanted to speak during the public So. Even though you have officers on duty who are visible on the street And, they stay in their precinct and they don't cross over the street, and the dealers know that you do that They may see an an officer in uniform on the corner.
Shelters that have You know the hotels that have been turned in homeless, shelters recently on the west side, and you also touched on You noticed that whether or not the city is provided any sort of Supportive Services for these, including caseworkers or perhaps medical personnel, and if they haven't Is there anything that we could do as a community to ensure that these people get the support that they need.
But I'm jumping the list for the people was involved in one of the co Chair of housing, health and human services, and I was involved in the meeting prior to beginning me, At the end of the month we're having a Community Council meeting at Manhattan Plaza and we're going to read temperatures, but just so people know as well My only really issue or problem or concern with it is resources and manpower My only really issue or concern with it.
There were police officers assaulted, including officers within the confines of the 10th present You, know what was going to take place in Manhattan or you know, in New, York City in general, You know: there's a presidential election coming up , There could be an uptick and Covid-19 The street is not closed.
There were a large number of cuts that were You, know for diverse I guess in their impact and added up to that total about $400 million What is the current Ballpark depth service for New York City, and you know our thing when you say borrowings that include the issuing of debt bonds.
You know, starting in the spring and through the summer Trying to reopen If. You can speak to what is happening with essays budget and what is likely to happen in the near term future, because this is a very urgent issue, with schools reopening with students very soon Yeah, so the SCA was not exempt from the from the shutdown of the capital program Again.
Mom I'm, a resident of Community Board for and I currently live in Hell's Kitchen I'm here today to ask you to send a letter to the city, council and speaker Corey Johnson, to request that the Council's Committee on Oversight and investigations launch an investigation of the NYPD And they're in for budget transparency purposes for the NYPD concerning their actions and their attempted besieged ONE OF, MY, HOME, ON, AUGUST, 7, 2020 , I'm, open to any questions or anything about my statement.
The police were unrelenting, while people were rallying below I was on the phone with my attorney, who was trying to figure out what was going She, sent legal observers and was an arranged I'm scared to be within my home, Is Inappropriate I fear deep down in my core that if I opened my door to those officers, my life would be swiftly taken, like that of my friend status.
We know that the facial recognition software was used, but how and why community board for can be a partner in this work to hold the NYPD accountable for their actions on August 7 And stand up for the rights of your black neighbors I urge you to sing your proposed letter to speaker, Johnson and the city Thank you for listening and thank you for your support.
Michael I'm a small business owner condo board president for the grand Chelsea ON 17th and eighth and apparent of children in school A private school on 15th Street between eighth and ninth We are desperate the parents to keep the school open and operational Part of that is going to be contingent on getting some street space which I know the mayor is working on with public schools, I'm, not exactly sure how it applies to private schools.
I want to thank the community board for allowing me the opportunity, I work for an organization called village care or non for pot health, not for profit healthcare organization based out of not just the West Village but Throughout Manhattan and the other boroughs, and we care for New York's, frail most vulnerable seniors folks are on Medicaid and require Care Earlier.
And are over 62 and we just wanted to present ourselves to the community because we do have vacancies available and we know that there were folks in need and Again I'm a resident of West 36, three Also, a public member on the land use and zoning committee and Chelsea Hell's Kitchen Clinton Hell's, Kitchen I'm, calling in regards to The temporary shelter situation on West, 36 and 37 street This month, but We've seen little to no change or progress in the situation.
As of November 24 all classes and coursework will be fully remote, There'll be no students living on West, 27th, STREET, IN, THOSE residence halls, this semester and Catherine Hall, which is in CB for on 31st Street, has a limited number of students and the dining hall and the dubinsky center on Eighth Avenue Is open for those residents, students Take at Food, knowing door dining we're maintaining a full complement of public safety officers on the campus and building some grants.
And I wanted to ask if there was a way to have more police presence to focus on that section of Eighth Avenue We wait for the process to get rid of the sidewalk shed, which is the major attractive nuisance there , I'm Pamela I've, let Brian Lewis know from Gail's office, and we will be following up on that.
I have emotion to amend the agenda, I'd like to make a motion to table the two letters from the Social Justice Task Force, because we have not had Any public discussion on that Even though the committee's and the Community Board has an opportunity to speak tonight.
The first point: These are technically new business items, So I'm, not even sure, they've been added to the agenda as yet So can we amend an agenda that they're not been added to Go ahead, though the social justice committee did They have a public meeting about these letters.
I'm, not even sure they are technically part of the agenda until they are introduced as new business When we get to the new business section you're about to adopt an agenda with them listed and I would make them on the agenda Case for the implications of your wouldn't send this back to the working group to hold a public meeting, perhaps a hearing, and then that's the setting where this will be discussed and come back, wouldn't go to a specific committee, just curious.
So I Think- and this is a concern- They- can work from the ISIS committee Now a task forces public meetings- are our budget.
They are like make a substitute motion to refer back to the working group and hold a public meeting, I think what rather than position, but it should be air fully public Yeah I Wanted to suggest that maybe what we have done in other situation is let those letters to be on the agenda And when we get to the discussion and we have a discussion which is a public discussion.
It is That is not a committee right now, but so my recommendation would be to lead it on the agenda and have the discussion and potentially at the end of that That is more appropriate, but I, don't think I think you know removing it from the agenda of front Is, not necessarily appropriate, because we are not hearing the input for the community board from all the members and that input could be very valuable.
There was a response that was called for and it was communicated via email, first amongst Katie and I, and the chair and Jesse and Some of the social justice group members What sort of initially raised the issue for the conversation became sort of more critical, especially for recognizing what it already happened.
I mean obviously I'm quite new to the community board only having been on it a few months, but my impression is that there is a history Of when issues come up that, even if they're not discussed in a committee, there is a history of proposing letters at the full community board to be discussed when they are time sensitive and especially Be. Not discussing these two letters this evening, I'm In the same way that we've discussed letters in the past and especially if we're leaving the ACEs letters on that also came up without having been discussed in committee Now. In terms of your emotion, based upon anything that you've heard, My, emotion, I will amend to add both kit, originally mentioning and Joe clarifying to send back to the working group to have a public discussion.
and Murphy This back I know, is to leave it on the agenda Was legal to make two copies of this to fill up One. Second, just mike just take a second when, if you're on by phone In the meantime because I'm up next to vote, Because we started voting This has to go to the public Run. The car Think people on the phone isn't Pete?
It says noted the twice and the third sentence, just the words noted that need to be removed, Can I, add one more thing low for a second People should remember that they back to fill out their online vote tree and submitted We chase people for three days last time and you gotta vote the same way in writing as you did by voice We're going to go next to Brian Lewis for the borough.
Presidents report Actually I'm going to defer to our borough president, who is here Ladies and gentlemen Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer Together second issue is We Did, a small business call I want to be again, people are more affordable and also from the community.
I do think that outdoor descent, The list of the outdoor possibilities in terms of streets and some lot of schools and districts to Discern for drew want outdoor, It may or may not Wire department and police department that this is a different time and if kids are going to learn and learning outdoors We'll also send a letter.
Those are some of the things we're still working on the issue of affordable housing, talking to different People, like a board for who knows everything about affordable housing, but the rest of the world doesn't So we're trying to put together, if not for the immediate, but for the future.
Mostly, you know we're going to keep trying to do everything that we can to support the post office to make sure that elections balloting goes smoothly in November that make sure people get their medications I'm going to go next to state senator bread heilmann, who I believe is logged on in person , In, first hybrid HI, VICKI I think it's very helpful to make us not make us, but to To Give us the privilege of listening to the public.
But the letters on the on the board report I held a press conference at Farley with our great colleagues and remember Godfrey, to in the borough president and council members, Carlene, Rivera and Keith powers about the need for ballot drop boxes in the state of New By voting by mail to the US post office or having to go to a polling site and drop off a balance.
To get back to the budget a little bit So our board on all community boards have took a cut in their budget of around $8,000 For the year Just so, you understand where that, where that ends up from our end is that right now, that's requiring us to reduce a part time employee from three days to two Until We, get some more clarity as to what the budget will look: like A CB for office space update , The agreement for new office space is making its final final passage through the approval process.
These are the new, the new business letters that are going to come up out of aces that you will hear more about, but I want to single out the work of Leslie, because Ian Murphy and Josephine ish month, We've gone above and beyond the call in trying to solve problems that the administration hasn't even solved.
The only committee that regularly meets during August is the business licensing and diverse community Co. Chair of the committee is going to present the four letters Bert And, so I'd like to bundle in and bring them up for a vote.
Nobody chose to spoke to speak about them during the public session, with the exception of Mr Ingram on the letters concerning him That's what people want to Do. We sent it to aces in September we'd, be sending letters to do we at the beginning of October about schools that open two weeks earlier, We decided to bring these all through as new business.
I know some of you have read the letter because all during the day, I was getting suggestions, modifications friendly amendments, I, know, Marty , I think the governor should be at it because we talked about this is addressed to the governor, the state legislature It's, also just in there and the city council, people and the borough president.
I saw Corey this afternoon came out in support of indoor dining Thank you for putting together the letter in the round table If you want, but one thing that I've heard And small business owners would like it was more of a unified front between what the city and the state sets and more certainty in finality.
First of all, Thank you for clarifying on these new business I'm, going to speak a little bit on The virtual learning and kids going to take on Outdoor Learning letter Solution to a an issue that was a great concern to parents and to teachers.
You know on the subway on the way: home From, a family member So, that's what the mayor's put into place Now and that was accepted by the UFC and that's why they're moving forward to open the schools, Just all surgeon, very Good, Awesome, already This letter one at a time when it was my first thing.
For this for this piece kit and then Betty I, think this letter is number eight It be appropriate for a little Bit of you know community board for voted on the way we have all the other letters.
Think we heard from someone earlier on the budget issues that is remaining with the NYPD We don't know in terms of what's happening with the outdoor The school safety officers are not going to be able to be outdoors They.
Yeah, I'm I may be friendly, Amendment will already be incorporated, but I did feel that it would be nice if the letter could include some positive ideas on how to improve safety and my beef it up a little bit in terms of Security, Staff or signage, or some kind of Barriers or cones to delineate the school area, so that people would know not to be carousing in that particular area.
You know some someone being very nice and volunteering to donate some material for a number of the schools in our district and Josephine was extremely helpful and finding the right schools Other comments on letter, But I'm, going to propose that we bundle 589 and just do a voice vote, because there hasn't seemed to be in a lot of opposition.
security for open streets, school program, Item number, nine in new business I see two different issues here that have been raised and may need to be discussed, The first issue: is: Should we be addressing this letter at all right now, And, then the second, these letters And, then the second issue is: If we are going to address these letters Now Are we adopting them, as is because I already know, people have comments on the letters themselves, If any again I'm open to suggestions on the best way to do this My feeling is that on the first letter Addressing the August 7 incident on That, we should move forward with the letter, It's very timely, and that incident happened on my block.
The second thing is that I'd like to add a line to that letter to ask the New York Police Department How many other VIP IOC members of our community have been arrested without warrant and have been pulled.
First So, the social justice working group was formed, as we all know, in June For, our community board, and we met multiple times this summer to address the way our black and brown community members are treated.
I also think it's really important to know again that this is The whole issue of accountability, about how decisions are made within the police structure is one of the main issues that we discussed already on the social justice.
That would be different if we have a public conversation , I think we've got to be careful In, a political Oregon's police It feels more like a soapbox Rather than an objective conversation My concern about sending the letter the way we have it Without the benefit of hearing a broader conversation and getting more opinions about what it is that we need to say, All right, Brett The letter were tone down.
The part That really raises alarm bells with me, since we really are a community board, that's known for having a level headed approach to Negotiating diplomacy, and if we have letters that are going out like this, that are filled with very volatile language without getting the right kind of without getting any response.
This is how we feel, and we haven't really brought into the conversation we just I think these are all important things It's more to make sure that what we are saying really is representative of our community board representing a diverse community, Brad I think this may be goes to what Lowell just asked, but You have a conversation The first sentence of the last paragraph was removed My quickly, Paul mentioned about the second letter being I Think.
The reason why I think it's important There's an opportunity for this to be a public conversation that the public engages in with us and Who knows where we would land after me engaged with the public But, the folks who are on the Community Board in my personal opinion, That's this high stakes and that many people have very valid, really critical perspectives.
It's the public presentation and it's not reaching out to many members of our community Please, have a couple of a sit down with some block Association president to try to talk about this We can work together, but the social justice committee is causing a great deal.
Most important thing is not a single person from the social justice working group came to Midtown North's meeting We had a good number about 40 different residents, folks that actually live on the block like Paul that express their outrage and their concerns.
So I think this letter reflects what the community board for is done in the past The most important things that I I just want to share a highlight.
Speaking, as somebody who used to work for the dean's office in Manhattan, And I think that they need to constantly be held to account for those and to You know, go before the public and explain themselves.
I want to go back to Joe for some concrete edits now about what you would suggest and what Can the tone of what I'm hearing from the majority of the speakers is that they'd like to see this letter, revised, So, Joe I'm, going to ask you to The first thing I would suggest is that this goes not just to Corey Johnson but goes to the mayor and the police commissioner and Corey Johnson There are three levels of government that we're dealing with an agency city, council and executive branch Second on line on the paragraph three I would change that to read: lie to the NYPD approach.
