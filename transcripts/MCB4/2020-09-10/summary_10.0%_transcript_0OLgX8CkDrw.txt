Welcome to the September, yet pre labor day, meeting of Manhattan community board, for my name is Lol. We are starting off tonight with two presentations, the first of which we want me back up.
Today, our index kind of the 10% is down 9.3%, obviously a lot, a lot of part that is in part to the cove it from, you know, from that Mid March through May. There, was not a lot of people out on the street, or at least through April, and that obviously impacts crying.
But then, you know, speaking of homeless, miss that is one of, I'm sure you're all familiar aware of this I think all over Manhattan and there is- has been a rise of homeless people out on the street, and that is, you know.
So there is several members of the lower kind of Hell's Kitchen area created their own organization, With different people, stakeholders within the command Officers out on the street.
For crime and quality of life, and also, I think people like to see the police out on the street And it can make people feel safer.
And so, you know, hopefully, that is the case, and we're, we're going to continue working like that in the future.
We recognize that you know there are people that are upset with police in and they have legitimate issues.
We want to do as much as we can to cooperate and work with the public at the end of the day, our neighborhood policing philosophy, which commissioner Bratton initially put into effect.
In fact, 2017 was a historic low for crime in New, York, City Then we actually be 2017 and had a second historic low two years in a row.
We are going to get through this, we're doing everything we can to come combat crime and local issues, and here at the 10% we want to continue to have good, relationships.
There are people that are that have substance, abuse that have mental health issues, It's pretty much every major city, acrosss United States, and it's an issue that you know, government officials, local government, state.
I was involved in one of the co chair of housing, health and human services One. Just before I forget the emailing me giving me the questions, I'm always happy to answer, but just so everyone knows: September 30, at the end of the month, we're having a community council meeting at Manhattan, Plaza.
So let me just talk about that for a moment as well, because when the demonstrations originally happened for floyd at the end of May and June, which is, you know, we respect everyone's right for peaceful demonstration.
Or, the press, the new black, who is our deputy controller for budget, is on and he will be leading us through this part and Like, I'm deputy controller for budget I've been with controllers office since 2016 And, I'm just going to give a brief overview of the of the 20 adopted budget that was adopted.
And, so there's not really much detail about sort of what that means in terms of services, department of sanitation, Was a bit of a exception to that they actually laid out new sort of program and service costs that they were going to do to realize their$ 59 in savings.
As, well as, again, sort of vacancy reductions with unspecified impacts on services, but there were a few cuts that I thought people would care about: vision, zero, cots, of$, 8 million, reducing the public vision, zero public awareness campaign, canceling some lane markings and bike lane protections that had been planned for this year.
Their budget is obviously going to they're going to have to act, and I think it's at this point Seems at least as unlikely as likely that the federal government will pass any kind of stimulus package by September 30 That's obviously a big concern at this point about what will happen with the state budget.
I mentioned earlier: the billion dollars in labor savings- The mayor- was planning to send to agencies, no end to the union's rather notification of agency layoffs and all the all the city agencies were tasked with coming up with a list of people.
You know, that's a step that I think there's cross pressures, here, there's obviously concerned about the impact on city services and on city workers.
My understanding was that it was mayoral agencies only meaning that the Community Board, which operates under the borough president's budget, would not have been affected by the potential layoffs.
Community boards obviously have their own budgets in the in the city.
What is the current ballpark depth service for New York, City This is an extraordinary time and At the same time, you know.
If you can speak to what is happening with essays Budget and what is likely to happen in the near term future, because this is a very urgent issue with schools reopening with students, very soon.
I'm here today to ask you to send a letter to the City, Council and Speaker Corey Johnson, to request that the council's committee on oversight and investigations launch an investigation of the NYPD And they're in for budget transparency purposes for the NYPD concerning their actions and their attempted besieged one of my home on August 7, 2020, I'm, open to any questions or anything about my statement.
I fear, deep down in my core that if I opened my door to those officers, my life would be swiftly taken like that of my friend status mckerrow in 2015 when he was having a mental health crisis and someone called 911 They sent an army of officers instead of social services.
We know that the facial recognition software was used, but how and why community board for can be a partner in this work to hold the NYPD accountable for their actions on August 7 and stand up for the rights of your black neighbors.
Part of that is going to be contingent on getting some street space, which I know the mayor is working on with public schools.
And are over 62 and we just wanted to present ourselves to the community, because we do have vacancies available and we know that there were folks in need and again.
Students take at food knowing door dining we're maintaining a full complement of public safety officers on the campus and building some grants.
I'd like to make a motion to table the two letters from the social Justice task force, because we have not had any public discussion on that.
We have not had an opportunity for the broader public to speak to these two issues that were writing on A second okay.
So if we're, if we bring up the letter to my , for the last, I guess, that does not count as having a discussion about it and then being able to emotion Is, because there has not been public discourse.
We amend an agenda that they're not been added to Go ahead, though the Social Justice Committee did they have a public meeting about these letters.
For the implications of your would not send this back to the working group to hold a public meeting, perhaps a hearing, and then that's the setting where this will be discussed and come back, would not go to a specific committee.
I was considering also your ACES letter to go ahead and take that off the agenda, because there has not been public discourse there.
If you are comfortable with this, would be working group will have a public meeting where there's an opportunity for the public to comment on the letters.
I will ask the working group to hold a public meeting to continue with this process.
Actually having public meetings when they are not a designated community meeting I think we need to be very careful.
Force is a task force that has open public meetings and presents things to the full board for consideration.
They are like make a substitute motion to refer back to the working group and hold a public meeting, I think what rather than position, but it should be air fully public I wanted to suggest that maybe what we have done in other situation is let those letters to be on the agenda.
In all honesty, that was the thought of the chair and adding these to the agenda at this time that we would have an opportunity that would be available to the public that we would have an opportunity to discuss it as a board.
There was a response that was called for, and it was communicated via email, first amongst katie, and I and the chair and Jesse, and some of the social Justice group members.
The internet law and christine both explain for these letters to be on the agenda Is to have community boards input.
Working group is not a committee and we were told that we could not have public sessions.
Of when issues come up that, even if they're not discussed in a committee, there is a history of proposing letters at the full community board to be discussed when they are time sensitive, and, especially.
I will amend to add both kit, originally mentioning and Joe, clarifying to send back to the working group to have a public discussion.
The emotion is to remove these lead two letters from the agenda and have them referred back to the working group and ask the working group to hold a public session.
I'm not going to talk about the hotels and shelters, except to say opportunity, you on board seven and 10 and 11 And, we'll just keep working on it.
The nonprofit community does so much work We got all fibro person to sign a letter.
Basically, of getting not the full payment for the work that you're doing from a city or state contract state has the same problem and the poor You know the nonprofits are really under the gun in terms of having to just take it and do it Please go see the monumental women.
Those are some of the things we're still working on the issue of affordable housing talking to different people like a board, for who knows everything about affordable housing, but the rest of the world does not so we're trying to put together, if not for the immediate, but for the future.
I know how hard your office is working on.
Mostly, you know, we're going to keep trying to do everything that we can to support the post office to make sure that elections balloting goes smoothly in November, that make sure people get their medications.
You know, any federal issues, reach out to us I'm going to go next to state Senator, Bread Heilmann, who, I believe is logged on in person.
The borough president has as well to the Nypd, commissioner, asking for a full accounting of the events, including questions like, Derek raised about the cost.
We think it's really out of control here in the city, Is the right source to oversee it, but the letters on the on the board report.
The front door to New York City, in many respects, and they need to cut these small businesses or break, whether it's a complete, you know, rent, forbearance, or abatement.
I will say, and I think Gail touched on this in terms of the indirect rate for those of you who know about the fight we had over the last two years about getting more funds to social service.
There are a number of things where the city went way too far in terms of budget cuts, whether it be cuts to social service providers or cuts to litter basket.
I think there are hundreds of millions of dollars, where we cut the city cut way too deep, and it was one of the reasons that I voted against.
I wanted to let people know I'll, be sending out an email tomorrow, actually about for parents who can afford to not have their pandemic.
And other in person mobile drives are not currently happening due to cove We are asking people to go online and try to find their nearest center so that they can donate blood, if they are able to they're opening up more of their centers, as things are getting a little bit better in the city with Covid-19 And, it's all over New York state.
You know what we're working on in terms of public safety and street issues regarding the temporary homeless, shelters, the chronic homeless on the street.
I. Think we're in for a very long and dirty year we are holding a second tenants rights information session that is going we're sort of sponsoring at HCC They're going to have a number of tenant attorneys there to answer questions to present on.
Jessica is our second vice chair will be chairing the budget task force We are working on ideas to streamline the process, especially given what we heard from the comptroller's office.
These are the new, the new business letters that are going to come up out of ACES that you will hear more about, but I want to single out the work of Leslie because Ian Murphy and Josephine ish month we've gone above and beyond the call in trying to solve problems that the administration has not even solved yet.
Chair of the committee is going to present the four letters, Bert.
We have five new business letters that came out of the month of August.
Nobody chose to spoke to speak about them during the public session, with the exception of Mr Ingram on the letters concerning him.
I, just want to say one thing, by the way, and online 31 I think the governor should be at it because we talked about this is addressed to the governor, the state legislature.
I do have one other bullet point that mark I do not know whether I'm in the right order here, but one thing I wanted to suggest is that to help the small businesses, we asked the city to take responsibility for the sidewalks in front of them right, now.
Announcement, the state said one thing: the city came out and said the exact, you know, opposite So. There was something on the language, not in the bullet points, but something in the language about clear communication.
I'd like to ask Leslie to speak to us about the project and letter, and just thank you, again.
I think this letter is number eight, and I just had a procedural question on eight You know, community board for voted on the way we have all the other letters, it would that be appropriate.
So I'll pass it over to Josephine to talk specifically about outdoor learning letter, which I really appreciate her taking the lead on, I know that.
I, believe we had a caller on earlier from core layers, which is actually a private school, but he was talking about how important the outdoor learning is, and this letter is not about that at all.
But that I think we heard from someone earlier on the budget issues that is remaining with the nypd.
So we do not know in terms of what's happening with the outdoor The school safety officers are not going to be able to be outdoors.
Amendment will already be incorporated, but I did feel that it would be nice if the letter could include some positive ideas on how to improve safety and my beef it up a little bit in terms of security staff or signage or some kind of barriers or cones to delineate the school area, so that people would know not to be carousing in that particular area.
The first issue is: should we be addressing this letter at all right, now.
And, then the second issue is: if we are going to address these letters.
As is because I already know people have comments on the letters themselves if we decide to send them.
That man lives, acrosss the street from me Was afraid to open his door to police officers.
The second thing is that I'd like to add a line to that letter to ask the New York Police Department.
I'm going to ask you to hold the comments on the addition to the letter.
I think on the second letter now with facial recognition.
So, the social justice Working Group was formed, as we all know, in June.
For, our community board We met multiple times this summer to address the way our black and brown community members are treated and police accountability was one of the primary issues that came up in many of our meetings, and then this incident happened on August 7 and it received not only national attention and local attention.
We know that Gil Brewers Office has already written a letter requesting more information about it.
I also think it's really important to know again that this is the whole issue of accountability about how decisions are made within the police structure Is. One of the main issues that we discussed already on the social justice.
That's my concern about sending the letter, the way we have it without the benefit of hearing a broader conversation and getting more opinions about what it is that we need to say all right, Brett.
Sense it sets, but given the live in the issue, the questions I think are legitimate, we want to.
The part that really raises alarm bells with me, since we really are a community board, that's known for having a level headed approach to negotiating diplomacy, We're, really not showing that we're asking question that we want to know, and we're asking for transparency.
My quickly, Paul mentioned about the second letter being I, think that actually is a bigger issue, and it's a good for everybody, because you're talking about surveillance, capitalism.
So, going back to your question that the freedom walking out on the streets precisely why we should be asking that question and sending the letter.
Some people may have voted to keep it on the agenda The challenge we have here is that this board does have a history.
I requested to be on the social justice working group when it was brought up in a meeting Now this letter comes out.
We're, not his legal representation, and we need to make sure that as a community board that they continue to take us seriously and not think that we're just reactionary I will go in favor of the letter with changes when it comes up.
At the same time, they wanted to work with a police to try to solve these problems.
I would recommend strongly that the Social Justice Committee, sit down with a couple of us on the community who have been fighting these issues for many years, and who are now being alienated from the community board because of your excessive rhetoric in these letters.
To try to talk about this, so we can work together, but the Social Justice Committee is causing a great deal.
Most important thing is not a single person from the social justice Working group came to Midtown North's meeting.
I know that at least two people at that police Precinct council meeting were very frightened by the fact that hundreds of people showed up and cause that incident to be longer than it needed to be well.
The research or whatever information that our, our team could find reflects that he was in his right to do the things that the way that he did at his home, you know, I'm not sure how, when he was accused of plagiarism, a role into what happened legally or illegally in our community if it was not him.
Is there something that we do not know, and, and the letter.
However, on by the way you know you say you asked Derek Ingram in at the behest of the social justice working , the dog wagging the tail wagging the dog there.
That's questions we can present things, bring the community together I think a lot of really very thoughtful things have been said by a lot of people.
That's the part of the facial recognition that I think is, is a little concern there I would definitely recommend that the first letter goes out and maybe, you know, a second one in a different way.
I think there's a lot of validity in this letter.
But, I'm part of the social justice Working Group I did hear people take the officers to task.
What happened to him in our community that was not okay I'm going to keep this moving, the rock show and to me, the two letters feel like real call to get NYPD, which is something tonight, when we had the csp earlier in the meeting.
The first letter is a lot of questions that we would like answered.
We do have a responsibility to get the other side, quote: unquote, whether that's giving the public a chance to weigh in on both these letters or by having another group also do a presentation on facial surveillance or something like that.
But if we do, I think that it would be great to balance it out by having other people answer, questions and be part of the roundtable conversation and not just NYPD Just wanted to add that, you know, I was one of the people on in the anti racist groups working group that wanted to have Mr Ingram speak.
He should come and tell us what's happening if he chooses to and I reach out to the school community, all the time to parents or parents who do not even know that we exist.
This was sort of like a beginning of the conversation, and the questions, I think, are something that needs to be asked, and I.
You know, I'm not going to address a lot of the language in the letter.
I can't agree to send this letter out unless we make the changes It's like the business license: This is an ongoing, magnified issue that should be addressed readily and if this can go out, not necessarily tonight.
I speaking as a community member I think that the second letter.
I think the both letters are important and should go out.
I think, there's this dichotomy between sending the letter or having a public process.
I would hope that this would not end with the letter and that we can perhaps in the latter, ask the NYPD or members of the NYPD to come and speak with us, you know.
You know, being open to public information were starting with this process.
I want to go back to Joe for some concrete edits now about what you would suggest, and what can the tone of what I'm hearing from the majority of the speakers is that they'd like to see this letter revised So Joe, I'm going to ask you to, you know, take a shot for shot at that katie The first thing I would suggest is that this goes, not just to Corey Johnson, but goes to the mayor and the police Commissioner and Corey Johnson.
So, let's just jump in here real quickly low, because I think this is important I think I think you've got a legal response here to We did discuss this with people in a social justice working group, but legally arrests can absolutely happen without a warrant.
There are people work as public advocate's.
I work with, you know, I play in justice facility.
Was you know, trying to add that to the letter.
I was just going to make a motion that we vote on the letter as amended.
I'm going to pose emotion that I want someone to make Do we have any more comments on letter.
Or Remand the letter back to the social justice Working group that will take advice from the executive committee.
