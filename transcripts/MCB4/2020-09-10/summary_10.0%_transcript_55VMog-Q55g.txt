Yeah we do have what we think will be a full agenda, so yeah very quickly deal with clinton park is being used passively I've learned that the city of chicago is using their larger green spaces to socially distance and support independent artists, theater troops circles, things of that nature, music in safe distance and they're, rather successful in it and I, was wondering whether or not we would be interested in researching that for our green spaces, I mean I, think it can become new business at the end of the meeting.
So I'm going to kick it over to you to dive right into the agenda Well, let's dive into the agenda and that, and that starts with the discussion of the Manhattan cruise ship and then the second part is I just want to make sure that they have that access as well Okay, three people, it's james, long with edc.
First of all, thank you all for having us today we're going to talk about my hand, crews, terminal and NYC ferry afterwards What we'll do is we'll run through the first agenda item and then at the very end of that we'll take questions and then transition to the second point.
It's just only one story, so the d-bars happen and then the embarks happen after that and generally just like the cruises sail year round to bermuda and then in the summer, in the fall they go up to canada and new england to see some of the fall foliage We can go to the next slide , so I think since Covid-19 19 happened, Obviously like cruz, was huge in the in the in the media at first As soon, as you know, march april hit edc kind of stopped everything and pivoted to doing coveted response.
The security personnel of the terminal are able to control access to this area, thereby reducing the potential for any types of incidents and reducing the risk of anything happen and I would also mention that it seems like there's a lot of space there when empty, but during cruise days the space is all put to use.
We also talked earlier about how the cruise terminal is leased to an operator, so they're responsible for continuously maintaining the facility security, as required by the coast guard There are times when large numbers of people have access to the terminal like cruise calls or events that we have at the terminal, but there's a commensurate security presence from our operator that'll that facilitates that access and allows us to do that in a safe manner, so again, they're required when access happens at the terminal, it's required to happen and have a security presence that facilitates that access by the coast guard The final point is that we require ports, america to carry a certain level of insurance coverage and public access outside of the balance that are already specified in the terminals plan or the term usage could require changes because of the increased liability from changes in use.
This is more challenging, although certainly not impossible in area in an area where the existing electrical grid infrastructure is already constrained like Manhattan The. There are several other pieces needed of equipment on the terminal side, large pieces like transformers and switchboards, which take up quite a bit of space There's, also a connection point required on the pier itself, the actual cable that will run from the shore to the ship, which needs to be a flexible to accommodate different ships and one of the something unique about Manhattan , The Manhattan cruise terminal is compared to many other cruise terminals in the country.
So I'll start this and then, if you and bianca feel free to sign in, but this would be something once we revamp the conversation to actually launch the study, it will be a bunch of different departments at adc, primarily headed by our asset management division, which has folks that overview energy and all other aspects like that correct How do you plan on doing that long term without any funding currently, and what methods are you thinking about using without having that senior leadership available to guide your juniors and your mid-management team?
Those are two apples and oranges people, and so we would love when you guys like do hire somebody and do start moving those wheels again to have them present for a conversation like this with us, so chris you haven't said, and what you need to say, I'm putting words in your mouth is that the community would very much like to see shore power occur as soon as possible before ships come back into port, even if possible, before ships come back into port, but certainly as soon as possible.
Next So, we actually did in an exercise earlier this summer talk about potential opportunities to help with some of the pedestrian and bicycle transportation around the park, and you know we have identified that stretch that runs along the cruise ships area is among the narrowest areas where there is the bike lane The greenway narrows and the pedestrians are sometimes right up against the bikeway, and it's also been noted that, while we do understand that, while cruise ships are important, there's a lot of loading unloading, it's a very busy place and obviously there is not We- understand the safety issues associated with that.
We see a very vacant parking lot area on the ground level and we do understand there is a path that the trust has built by the cruise ships before 9, 11 and homeland security closed that off I know I'm very interested, and this is something that came up in one of our conversations this summer, finding ways where we can start doing security assessments and and with the eye towards being able to schedule that area to be open and accessible.
Think from my understanding , what we've heard from conned is that it would be a much more challenging conversation and it would be north south, but earlier you mentioned that they've been thinking about a east to west connection, which I think would be helpful, and you know just frankly from our perspective, if this is something that a site survey physically means people going out there and just having conversations and looking at what is possible.
We are in very dire financial situations As long as the site survey doesn't mean funded the 500 000 survey with a bunch of details right we're going to hold you to that absolutely and certainly appreciate you in the center's office as well as, of course, all the other folks on this call or elected officials not able to make it here and she's a few people down The conversation with earlier that you know the city itself isn't is in a very tough financial situation.
If, let's assume you did get a go ahead from either, you found money for a study or kane came up with some idea of how to do this, just a guesstimate as to what it would take time-wise to get the first boat plugged into into an outlet Just I'm, just curious in terms of the logistics you got to get people in you, Right like there are as leslie and the senator's office know.
Sure Alan on your first question about timing, just for some context, the Brooklyn terminal took about seven years to build so just to sort of give you a sense of what that looks like in terms of forcing cruise ships right.
In regards to their docking and pollution to sort of minimize the cost to cruise companies as well I think that it's really important that we be able to look together at some kind of site plan or site diagram that actually quantifies the pedestrian and vehicle traffic lanes, what dimensions they are when they're, actually in operation, so that we know you know and can discuss together in a resourceful way.
Amount of space is needed during x time, and there should be an explanation that goes with that, and then maybe we can work together like a safety logistics plan that yeah, but also to you, know, resourcefully come up with what's feasible in terms of recapturing some of that space for the public I'm sure most of us are used to riding bikes past it and just seeing a lot of empty space most of the time Back on that right.
You know along the cruise ship terminal that pits pedestrians against cyclists and that's all because we had to make a highway for vehicles which take up significantly more space than you know, than cyclists and people, and then we're dealing with the same trouble on the other side of that fence, because there's roadways there to make room for cars and parking So I, wonder: there's not money for a study But we need to think about flexible infrastructure.
Don't want to dwell on this because I have two other points, but I would throw that out there for edc to get creative because they don't have a lot of money and they're not going to have a lot of money anytime soon , I would expect the leaseholders to be the managers of that because it's their space, public access and then shore power, You, know at a typical marina.
Don't think we want it to be those people on those ships bring a lot of waste and a lot of trash to our community, and they should certainly be paying to be able to do that and more so These cruise industries should be paying to operate in more ways than just tying up to our infrastructure.
Don't think we should be talking that it's difficult, Never gonna settle for something like that, especially in this day and age, and for years we've been trying to at least I've been bringing up that every passenger should be charged a fee that the money goes to the park so to piggyback, because jeffrey said it very well, there could be a carbon emissions charge, but also there should be a fee that goes along with helping the park which could help incentivize us using that lane Maybe the money goes to that You know, I think we're trying to utilize that area underneath the driveway and the third thing is while the terminal is down Has anybody come to you or is any proposals out there to open it up to the community to have a barge to have the swell like they have in Brooklyn a floating garden for the year?
I would have to go back and talk to my colleagues that deal with pacific area more broadly This is where it doesn't cost money to send out an rfp for temporary use You know that doesn't cost a lot of money to have a creative idea to put it out to the public We have the space and he will in a second on the chat There's a question on parking on the pier people driving into new york city.
You heard that before do we have barging capabilities or activities in there at all folks, barges run up and up and down that river all day long , that's the first step right I'm, not entirely sure of the process of connecting a cruise operator to someone that would actually do that service for them and what that means in terms of cost implications or their logistics and their planning, but would be, would be helpful to at least look into it from our end, if that's even possible to do that Thank, you appreciate that I have seen no hands from the public I'm going to go back to chris, who is trying to structure a letter Please correct me: I apologize but letter one I'm assuming would capture the bike lane mitigation, which would capture flexible use during peak in non-peak times.
So you're saying that the letter should not It should be the fee, but since the board had people on the board have for years been suggesting that passengers be considered as a source of revenue for these issues, I would love to make a motion, because we have much more on the agenda and then you the first two points my concern about The. you know, we're the lay people on the board dictating or making suggestions about, You know business decisions that are So I would suggest that maybe that's a second letter- So, we're expressing I, think our observations about the current situation and our in, and we basically would be expressing our support for them to be able to put pressure on upping fees and things like that.
Think us lay people, have the right to ask edc and possibly the cruise operators to provide financial information about the viability of their peer and of how they might envision funding these issues that we think are important to us, and so I do see it as part of this letter if it can only be constructed in that way and you'll see a letter and I do think we need to come at this from an approach of the conversation.
We look forward to continuing the conversation with you for sure our asset management team, please feel free to to leave the meeting, and then we will reengage once we hear from the community board, and we have some work to do on and between that anyway, and so we're looking forward to that as we go through in our planning process and as we are now squarely in the implementation process, we you know we have been connecting closely with our partners at other city agencies.
One of the things we mentioned in our eis is that the right now we are still contemplating whether or not to leverage the existing new york waterway bus fleet, which we know that has its challenges in it, but is extensive or running our own shuttle bus, as we do at east 34th street, where we use smaller smaller vehicles and provide small circulator service.
Let's get the physical elements organized first and follow that with the need, for you know, making sure that we can I wasn't actually advocating for single fare, but it should be, but in this moment I'm just more worried about the lack of thought of increase in passenger getting off at that terminal and then rushing across the west side highway via car or on foot in which we already confronting greenway issues, and you know park population issues and all that kind of stuff, and so to better understand how edc is approaching.
You want to ensure that all the people who are entering and leaving the park are able to do so safely and so again, we've had previous conversations with city, ot and york waterway, but we want to make sure that this is something that edc is able to look at also The. Other third concern is marine safety for kayakers and small boaters That's really important to us.
We have a robust non-motorized boating community We have four boat houses in the park, so this becomes very important for us, and one additional concern is the potential impact that increased ferry wakes could have on parks, water infrastructure, This is something that we need more information on, so we flagged these concerns to edc and we are going to discuss this further with them in the coming months before this service opens next year and just clarification and then I'm going to go to members of the committee.
The, st george, is expected to be one of our highest ridership routes and that's even though this route is largely you know, half duplicative of the free staten island, ferry It is it's duplicative only in the connection to lower Manhattan in some ways, but, as we said and modeling off, of the trade-offs of how we how we expect people to value the savings that they're going to get by being able to get up to midtown in the time that they are, that I think I will point out also that it's using a similar methodology to what we've done with previous studies, where I might be one of the only people who is cranky I would rather have been.
More than ever right now, You know I'm on the board of the the friends of chelsea, green You, know the new park on 20th street and we've had many requests from groups and private gyms to use our space, because people need a place, we're just trying to help out our neighbors at our local businesses and people that want to work out.
