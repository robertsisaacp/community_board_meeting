recording lights on at 631 good evening, everyone. welcome to the September yet pre labor day meeting of Manhattan community board for my name is Lol current on the chair of the board. we are starting off tonight with two presentations, the first of which we want me back up a Sec. we formed a social justice. Working Group back in June. and we got recommendations from that group at our July meeting which were voted on by the board. one of those recommendations was on a regular basis. invite officers from each precinct to report to Mc before about their community outreach efforts and other community concerns. so we are going to start that tonight with the commanding officer of the 10th precinct which covers the Chelsea part of the district Deputy Inspector Kevin Coleman Inspector Coleman is going to be our first report from the NYPD on a regular basis. there are four precincts that represent our convicted cover our community board and if we do a rotation, we will see inspector Coleman three times a year. and if you're ready inspector will the show is yours. you, you're switching back and forth on and off Mute you look okay now. okay, everything's good. now, okay, sorry about that are good evening. good evening, everybody. thanks for having me. i'm always happy to attend any type of public meeting. i do not like zoom. i prefer face to face, but it's, you know, a sign of the times that we're in, so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go over a bunch of different things that have been going on in the 10th precinct. in particular, and afterwards you know if there's a question and answer opportunity that's fine with me. if there's not, that's fine you know i'm not sure how the meeting will run that way, but first i'll just start off then by talking about crime in general in the 10%. and just to give everyone a reminder, the 10th precinct then covers 14 street. the 29th street from Seventh Avenue to the water and then from 29th street to 43Rd Street from Ninth Avenue to the water. so it's basically Chelsea Hudson yards and the bottom of southern hell's Kitchen area is what we cover here today, our index kind of the 10% is down 9.3% obviously a lot a lot of part that is in part to the cove it from, you know, from that Mid March through May. there was not a lot of people out on the street, or at least through April and that obviously impacts crying. there's fewer people on the street, fewer purpose traders on the street, fewer victims on the street and so on. so that definitely helped the crime numbers. currently our drivers in the present for crime is burglaries and vehicle theft, we are up in both of those categories and when it comes to burglary. one of the issues ongoing issues that we have is packaged stuff, especially in residential buildings and what one of the things we trying to encourage people is if there is a super in your building. if there is some type of caretaker. we think it's a good idea to get them involved in terms of if packages are in the vestibule, or just in line of sight, you can walk up to the front door look into the building and see packages. our recommendation is that a caretaker or somebody take those packages and either secure them or lease move them away from line of sight. from the door so that if someone walks in, they can not see the packages, because a lot of that is actually crime of opportunity. someone looks in they see packages multiple packages. they think it's Christmas, they try and get in the door and take the packages. if they do not see packages, it's likely that they'll move on to somewhere else and then obviously, along with that is you should not let anyone in someone buys this you unless you know who they are. if you're expecting someone let them in. do not buzz in a strange or that you do not know why they're there, or what business because some of them will just simply okay let me see if someone lets me and then they get in and take a package. our vehicle that's a tip. we like to give is which may seem common sense, but do not leave your keys in the ignition. that is something that happens where you know someone wants to run into a corner store really quick. they're going to be like 30 seconds. but, you know, it just takes a few seconds for someone to jump in your car with the keys and drive off. so definitely do not try that, even if it's just a 30 seconds or a minute, you know, turn off the ignition. take your keys. next, and also regarding crime. we do have one homicide for the year that happened a couple weeks ago. this is on 39th street at night Avenue. ultimately, two people experiencing homelessness had an argument. one of them took out a sharp, sharp object and cut the other person they died. and the Good News regarding that is in 24 hours or less. we did make an arrest on the perpetrator, the detectives working the case we're out looking for more video they spotted the perpetrator because we already had a good image of him and that person was arrested. i think the 23rd. this happened on August 22 he was arrested on the 23rd. he is in jail. he's been remanded until you know his case. but then, you know, speaking of homeless miss that is one of, i'm sure you're all familiar aware of this is one of the top complaints. not only in the 10th. i think all over Manhattan and there is has been a rise of homeless people out on the street, and that is, you know, a lot of hotels have been converted into temporary shelters. i do not know when that will end that was to go through cove it and some point that will end in the 10th prison. we had a hotel on 42Nd Street to catch hotel. we had 101 people staying there that actually has been removed my understanding, i was told there was a water main break and they had to evacuate everybody and so that hotel is no longer being used as a shelter and the hundred and one people that were there. i believe were moved to Brooklyn. a couple further things regarding this in about 10 weeks ago or so there is several members of the lower kind of Hell's Kitchen area created their own organization, you know that Hell's Kitchen Action Committee, i do not know if anyone has heard of them. or if anyone's here. but we had several meetings, we've been having a lot of meetings. with different people stakeholders within the command and they wanted officers. they wanted to see more posts officers out on the street. and they coined the term this eight for eight. it was called is the way they frame that which meant eight cups in a particular area for eight weeks. and you know i told them you know i do not necessarily have the resources for that. but we continue the conversation. ultimately, i did implement something similar to what they wanted. we're actually in week seven of the eight weeks. but what i did is i did put more officers in that area of lower Hell's kitchen pretty much 41st street to 43Rd Street. Ninth Avenue and going west to the what between ninth and 10th ninth and 11th area so that we did have more of a presence out there. more officers on foot so far. again, we just started week seven we've been getting a lot of positive feedback from that. and i have been told i wish there was a better way to measure it, but i have been told that a lot of quality of life. concerns have gone down up there. as a result of having officers visible on foot posts and that's part of the idea of view of uniform officers that are visible and then you have officers, you know, walking the streets that creates a deterrent. for crime and quality of life and also i think people like to see the police out on the street and it can make people feel safer. so i've been told that has had a positive impact. and so, you know, hopefully, that is the case, and we're, we're going to continue working like that in the future. do Dhs. we're also, you know, DHS is mainly responsible for the homelessness issue. in the past, the department worked very closely. and this summer, there has been kind of a shift the DHS to hope DHS kind of more accountable for their role in homeless services and we want to come soon cabinets were supposed to notify homeless services at the temporary thing we are doing what we can to work with them on that and, you know, at the end of day, you know, we understand that we can not arrest our way out of that problem that arresting homeless people even for minor infractions is not what will solve the solution. ultimately, it is a public health issue and DHS obviously is involved in that. but at the 10% where we can help out. we're going to, you know, we're going to continue to help out where we can on that aspect. let's see, what else neighbourhood policing in general, i want to make very clear that, you know, we recognize, you know, after the Floyd Killing and you know there, as everyone knows, demonstrations and so on. we recognize that you know there are people that are upset with police in and they have legitimate issues. to be concerned about. but our goal here at the 10% we want to do as much as we can to cooperate and work with the public at the end of the day, our neighborhood policing philosophy which commissioner Bratton initially put into effect. about five years ago, and then Commissioner O'Neill, and our commissioner shape the philosophy behind neighbourhood policing so everyone understands is to have good relationships with the public to build a good rapport with the public and so that we can work together cooperate and do our job of public safety efficiently and effectively. and frankly, if the public does not trust us, and the public does not see us as legitimate. it makes our job, not even more difficult, but almost impossible because we need public cooperation, we need to work together and that's what we're committed to doing. and to give you an example of even what i mean in like practical directly crime related practicality. is this if someone's the victim of a crime, a robbery, for example. the first thing we need is that victim to cooperate with us. that if there's witnesses, we need them to come forward and work with us. if somebody has evidence video footage we need them to work with us. and so think about, you know, if no one worked with us, or if we you know we could work with people to get the job done. it would make our job and basically impossible. we need to have, you know, public safety is a shared responsibility and we take our relations with the public, very serious. you know, unfortunately. you know, i think everything that happened this summer, including the looting. i think that's been a major setback for us and policing, because i think we've made great strives over the past few years, in fact 2017 was a historic low for crime in New York City and you know 50 years and then we actually be 2017 and had a second historic low two years in a row. so with everything that's going on you know city wide. i know we're up and shooting, we're up in homicides. but, you know, we are going to get through this, we're doing everything we can to come combat crime and local issues and here at the 10% we want to continue to have good relationships. we're working to rebuild relationships and continuing to expand to have more relationships and reach out more to the public as much as possible. and so, you know, i do not want to run over my time. that's kind of my overview and update about things and the 10th precinct and the police department and i am. i know there's a timetable and everything. here i am happy to stay. i can't stay for the whole meeting, but i'm happy to take some questions. now, if that's all right but sir, anyone on the board. who has a question, Paul, and then Collin. i'm going to keep this just to a couple of questions for time reasons. also, before we go, Paul. before you start, i just want to make one quick announcement. if you are a member of the public and wanted to speak during the public session. this is last call for signups please use it either use your blue hand or use the raise hand function and we'll add you to the list. but we're closing that list off now. all right, Mr. Devlin. you had a question for inspector calm. thank you. thank you. start Coleman appreciate all the work you guys are doing. i know it's tough out there. on one of the issues that we have on, particularly my neighborhood. i'm on 45th is that the corner of 43Rd and Ninth Avenue is a significantly problematic intersection and the reason is that the precinct lines cross there. and so even though you have officers on duty, who are visible on the street. and they stay in their precinct and they do not cross over the street and the dealers know that you do that so they may see an, an officer in uniform on the corner 40 39th on the sell side. and move their transactions to the north side and nothing happens. so is there some way that you could help coordinate with Midtown solve the 13th and 10 on those in that intersection, where the three precincts interest really crossover and the dealers know that's where they crossover. so in the officers know that's where the crossover. so the officers do not cross the dealers do not cross and we have a problem area. is there some way, you can help us address them. yes. so first i am aware of the precinct borders are a complaint, meaning you know we meet Midtown north precinct in the north, you know, above us on 43rd and then intense about on our east and that actually, when i talked about for eight for eight that was also a main problem they brought up about the border issues and you know people felt that they were kind of being neglected because they're close to the border and so on which you know i completely understand that and that's one reason, you know, i work with them to put officers up there in that location. what you know what i can do is, obviously, i am just the commander of the 10th and not the other precincts, but i will talk to those commands and the NCO is on that level, you know, labored core coordination officers, we should be working together there. it and sometimes, you know, that does not always work because it you know it's a, it's a, it's one of the problems with i guess being on the border issue, but let me look into that and see what we can do about that. or even if you could switch shifts one shift the precinct felt crosses over the street. the next you can cross over the street. yeah, and actually let me just be clear to is where we do not just, you know, we do not look at the other side. normally, and say that's not our problem. let's not fix it. but, um, a lot of times it happens when a crime happens like let's say a crime happens on the north side of 43Rd Street, which typically Midtown enough to not pretend they're detective squad and their precinct is supposed to investigate that not us, even if we wanted to. it's technically you know it's in their jurisdiction and they're supposed to handle it. and so sometimes it seems like we're like kind of passing the buck or washing our hands. hey, that's you know, you know that's not us, but there it is kind of a formal it is their side. you know, they have to investigate that. and that's, you know, we do not want to interview. i will tell you, i had officers who would not ice pointed to a problem. they would not acrosss the street. so i would appreciate any additional effort. thank you. for your time and i know you're working hard. thank you for calling. did you have your hand up before i thought i saw you. yeah. thanks so much, little, um, and, and thank you, Mr. Coleman. my question was you touched briefly on the you know the homeless shelters that have you know the hotels that have been turned in homeless shelters recently on the West side and you also touched on. the shared responsibility with DHS and the city. my question is do. have you noticed that whether or not the city is provided any sort of supportive services for these including caseworkers or perhaps medical personnel and if they have not. do you think that that's necessary D. is there anything that we could do as a community to ensure that these people get the support that they need. so a few things regarding that. one is, yes, i think that, you know, the homeless situation is a public health issue. there are people that are that have substance abuse that have mental health issues and it really you know New York is not the only one with the problem. it's pretty much every major city acrosss United States, and it's an issue that you know, government officials local government, state. really has to look at and probably has to put money into you know i do not want to get too much into politics because that's not my purview for this right but it is a complicated issue when we offer services. so, especially in prior to the summer, we were involved in a lot of joint operations was DHS and so on and when we offer services, they're often refused and, i believe, research shows that it takes about 200 plus times offering services to the same individual before they actually accept and so it's a very challenging problem and i do think i do think the ultimate answer is everything involved in providing services to homeless individuals experiencing homelessness probably needs to be expanded social workers. services, and then a strategy needs to be formed. it's a very challenging issue that you know goes far beyond the nypd, but i do believe the answer. the solution is a joint effort multi agency effort, social workers, health care issue workers and a large strategy. alright, thank you. thank you. Colin thank Inspector. i'm going to take one more question from the board and i've actually got one. so i've got two more questions. but i'm jumping the list for the people i do not get to. if you have questions for inspector calm and you can send them to Jesse and Jesse will filter them through to the spectrum we will get you answers, even if we're not getting them on this call. i'm Maria you were up next. i think slow. thank you. Coleman just trying to make it brief. i had three, but i'll just make it two questions. eight for eight that you have going on. i was involved in one of the co chair of housing, health and human services and i was involved in the meeting prior to beginning me eight for eight. and i'm just curious if you will be able to is that can be able to go further than eight weeks, even if it's modified with an officer of four or six just curious. yes, so really quick on that two things. one, just before i forget the emailing me giving me the questions i'm always happy to answer, but just so everyone knows September 30 at the end of the month we're having a community council meeting at Manhattan Plaza. it's it, it's going to be at 7 pm. we'll get that information out there. but it's going to be a live meeting. we're going to have masks on social distancing and we're going to read temperatures, but just so people know as well. regarding a free. so yeah, i'm very happy with how it's going. i want i can say at this point i'm probably going to have some modification of it going past eight weeks because i want to keep something going there. but in truth. my only really issue or problem or concern with it is resources and manpower. i'm, you know, just to give me an example i am down 33 cops. compared to September of 2019 and it hurts my deployment drastically and everything i'm doing for eight for eight, it's very difficult for me to do it's a it's a strain on my resources and i wish that was not the case. i wish that was not so but that's my only really issue or concern with it. but after the eight weeks, i am looking to keep something going there. great, thank you. and then my second question was, you mentioned the homicide on 39th and ninth was with to homeless individuals. did you mean Street homeless individuals are homeless individuals that live in shelter. ah, yeah, i mean, i believe it's free homeless. i'm just trying to think, i'm not. i do not know if any of them are officially belong to a shelter. i do not think they either of them belong to a shelter. i believe they were living on the street. thank you. sure. and i'm going to end this with one quick question. Inspector, the blocks, where the precinct is your block on 20 the street. the other precincts 54th street on the blocks are still closed. how do you have any idea how long those barricades are going to remain that is not the question. that's the question i'm asking them. out. so, excuse me, so that is a decision that actually comes above me. and look, i think ultimately will come when we're certain the unrest. there is no further unrest. i know the perception is bad. i know there's a lot of people upset about it. and so let me just talk about that for a moment as well because when the demonstrations originally happened for floyd at the end of May and June, which is, you know, we respect everyone's right for peaceful demonstration i believe Floyd was murdered, and that was wrong, how that was handle and we are i mean our, our job is to ensure that people can exercise their first amendment rights, and that you know most of the demonstrators 99% of demonstrators are all peaceful and maybe you can say it 100% are. but what happens is whenever there you know people are opportunists just like any system. people are trying to take advantage of an opportunity of a situation. and so there are people when there's mass demonstrations, they try and take advantage of that to cause problems to cause violence to cause vandalism and at that time. it was for that small group of people who is doing that in New York and acrosss the country. there they the target was police officers police stations police cruisers and we have to ensure that we're protecting our resources, our our, our station houses our police facilities, our vehicles so that we can respond if we have a station house that is set on fire or something like that. that's going to hamper our resources in responding to everything else. so that's why those barriers were originally set up and you know there were over 200 police vehicles vandalized i think that it's actually higher than that. i just do not want to say the wrong number. but i know it's at least 200 and there were police officers assaulted, including officers within the confines of the 10th present and so there were issues going on. we just when, in my perspective, we were looking at, you know, uh, you know, have guns. calm down, then this whole incident in Wisconsin happened and, you know, we are not sure what how that reaction was going to you know what was going to take place in Manhattan or, you know, in New York City in general. and we just want to be ensure we just want to ensure that you know, we're able to respond and our property is not been vandalized and damaged. so what i do not, i can't say for certain when it's going to be taken out. but i would say it's definitely going to be taken down when unrest is over. this is, you know, unfortunately. i think everyone agrees is extremely challenging year. i do not think anyone is happy with 2021 or 2020 i mean i'm hoping 2021 thing like we can all get back to normal. but will there be further unrest. in New York with the country going further in 2020 possibly. i do not know. you know, there's a presidential election coming up. it seems contentious. there could be an uptick and Covid-19 we do not know what's going to happen and but ultimately that decision will come you know, from above me, but i do want to make clear it 10th precinct. i can't speak for, you know, there's 77 precincts acrosss the city. i think most of them are operating like i am, what i'm about to say. but we are not the street is not closed, for example, although we have our barrier setup. i do not even have officer station at the end of each block. anyone can walk down the street. anyone can drive down the street. the block is not closed in any type of manner. right now the those the barriers are still set up in case something happens and we have to quickly take control of the block. that's the only purpose. they're there for right now. so, and we're working with anyone in the public the businesses, you know, on Eighth Avenue and 20Th Street. i have a restaurant on each corner on our side, and they have outdoor seating on 20th street, we move the barriers so that they can have their outdoor seating and, you know, we want to support them. we want them to have business there. so right now, to be clear, you know, 20th street is not shut down. it is not blocked it is open to everybody. anyone can walk down the street. anyone can drive down the street and those barriers are just there is a safeguard in case something happens, where we have to quickly, take control and secure the block. all right thank you for that answer that, that is helpful. we had sent letters to not only to the precinct commanders of our four precincts, but to one police plaza. and we never got a response. so your answer is helpful. i do not know that applies for the other precincts as well. i do not know if you could pass that up to chain of command, please, and see if we can get a response to earlier letter. okay, i'm just, you know, i am aware of that letter and to my understanding the police commissioner responded to the letter i. i'm not aware of that. i can check back with the office. but i'm not aware of receiving a response. okay, i'm not, i'm not trying to put this on you. i'm asking if you know we were looking for an answer from commissioner shay. right. i think we should connect. if you check and i double check. i think we should connect, because i believe it was handled. okay, thank you. all right. and i know there are other questions that people have had. i do not have time to keep going on this right now. i do appreciate your time. is it okay if we have Jesse send you some questions for follow up. i'm always happy to answer any questions. so please send me questions and i'll respond thank you very much. inspector. okay, thank you. thank you. okay, we're going to move on now to our to our next presentation. this one is almost probably equally important. we have a presentation on the status of the city's budget from Controller Scott Stringers Office. i saw Luke before. i'm not sure who is actually presenting this on behalf of the controller, Luke, would you like to either take over or introduce the presenter. or the press the new black, who is our deputy controller for budget is on and he will be leading us through this part and just yes the slide. so, oh, some visuals for everyone as well. okay, great. thank you all very much. thank you for having me. Jeff to run slides and share screen or something like that. i will give me one moment. yeah. just introduce myself. i'm Preston it like i'm deputy controller for budget and i've been with controllers office since 2016 and i'm just going to give a brief overview of the of the 20 adopted budget that was adopted. for the year that just started July 1 if you go to slide show. Jesse. there you go. perfect. so let me start with a picture of the economy over the last several months. please. Jesse so we've had really as everyone's aware. i think of an unprecedented economic crash both nationally and locally. we went from February's or the last pre pandemic month with 4.1 million jobs in the city to 3.2 million jobs in April or loss of 900,000 jobs. in the space of basically a month. the employment measures jobs in the city that could be held by residents of the city or non residents, commuters. the unemployment rate measures, actually the employment status of residents of the city. so that has lagged slightly the recovery, which has been slow but it went up really from an historic low of 3.4% in February to 15% 18% 20% in June. tick down just slightly in July, we've recovered about 25% of the jobs. we lost, which is much slower recovery at this point then nationally were about 45% of jobs have recovered in it has a lot to do with the composition of jobs in the city which very, very heavily oriented towards retail and tourism hospitality restaurants, etc. so i think that's been part of the reason for the lag and obviously indoor dining has become a big issue.. so all of that resulted in a gap that it ultimately totaled$ 8.3 billion for fiscal year 21 compared to the mayor's preliminary budget in January. so i'm sure you're all familiar with the budget cycle, but in the in the time between the marriage preliminary budget and the mayor's executive budget in April two things happen one obviously the pandemic. and the resulting closure of non essential businesses and restrictions on activity and then not quite as damaging but not totally positive, the state adopted its budget. for the year that begins their fiscal year, which begins April 1 so revenues in the executive budget were marked down$ 5.4 billion for this year, relative to what had been projected in January, the state budget impact was almost$ 800 million then in the end of May, the mayor mark down further the revenue projections for this year. so in total revenues were down$ 7.1 billion are almost 10% and as i said, in about an$ 8.3 billion gap. so. how did we close that about a third of the actions that we took of the actions that we took to close the gap valid third and consistent drawing down reserves budgeted reserves another third was from a savings program that the mayor order which led to about$ 2.8 billion all together in savings we had some federal aid from the Cares Act, which are actually prior to, prior stimulus bill, the name of which i'm forgetting the stimulus to and then there's been a lot of discussion lately about the$ 1 billion and layoffs. the mayor was seeking or is seeking from the city's unions, a billion dollars in savings. for each year of the of the next few years at that point that the budget was adopted, there was no and still there is no agreement. between us and the city on saving so that number is sitting out there as yet kind of not made real and then we had a little bit of a surplus additional surplus from the prior fiscal year that we carried over. and that was how we close that gap.. so all together. that was a fiscal year 2021 budget of$ 88 billion, which was again down almost nine and nine and a half billion dollars from the fiscal year 2020 budget. right now, where the city is projecting that revenues will rebound in by fiscal year 2022 and going forward. but spending is still budgeted well above projected revenues, so that we have gaps that are significant but manageable and size$ 4 billion next year$ 3 billion after that. so that's kind of the overview of where we are in the budget financial plan you had asked a few questions about some specific areas which i'll try and answer.. one of them was about affordable housing. since the Since March. basically, when the pandemic. and the closures first began, and it was clear that we were going to have us economic consequences. pretty significant economic consequences. the mayor's Budget office essentially cancelled all capital spending that was not either emergency or legal mandate or related to related to the pandemic. and that has meant affordable housing production has been slow down or stopped as well. there were a number of projects that were sort of in the pipeline and close to a close to completion, that i think went through, but i know of others that were that were never completed the in the executive budget capital plan. the Hpv capital budget was actually reduced by a billion dollars over the course of fiscal year 20 and 21 and that funding was stretched out essentially over the next three years f5 22 through 24 the programs that were caught were primarily production of housing for very low income and extremely low income households and supportive housing and assisted housing for the elderly.. i thought i'd talk for a moment about the police budget. i know that's been of interest to many people. there have been various statements that the budget was caught by a billion dollar, the police budget was cut by a billion dollars not accurate. the actual cost for this fiscal year was 420 million dollars. the primary component of that was a cut in uniform overtime of almost 60% or 200 290$ 5 million that's only for this year. it's not carried out into the future years. very unlikely to be achieved, the department always has been tasked with holding down its overtime spending and usually ends up coming back for more funds during the course of the year. so i think that's a big risk in this budget, it's unlikely that we will save that much from overtime. the total heedcount for the uniformed heedcount that is the number of uniformed police officers was reduced relative to the plan by a little shy of 1200 officers. which brings us down will bring us down to about 35,000 officers, which was the number of officers basically from Fyi fiscal year 2011 through 2014 when Speaker Mark Rido push the mayor to hire additional police officers. so this is, you know, coming back down to the level that it was for several years prior to the De Blasio administration. there was also a promise that school safety would be taken out of the police department and moved to the Department of education. that did not happen in the budget. and supposedly there will be more details about that in the November when the first quarter modest budget modification is released, i think. given the challenges of reopening right now. i'm not sure that i'm not sure that i'm holding my breath on that so and then there were some capital reallocation which the mayor has sometimes counted towards the$ 1 billion cut there was a new property facility in particular that was budgeted about 300 and some million dollars that was cut out on the budget.. so you asked about a variety of neighborhood services here. i'm going to talk a little bit about transportation safety as well. the, but just it's a little bit difficult to talk about the impact on services right now, since a lot of the savings in a lot of agencies relied simply on not filling bacon just taking the budget back for positions that were vacant. and so there's not really much detail about sort of what that means in terms of services department of sanitation was a bit of a exception to that they actually laid out new sort of program and service costs that they were going to do to realize their$ 59 in savings. i think everyone's aware of this point that St Basket Collection frequency has been reduced the organics program. recycling sorry the Organics program was cotton and partially restored by the City Council. Outreach an average public information regarding recycling program was also cut and then hazardous waste likeE- Waste collections was reduced or eliminated. parks and recreation is similar$ 53 million cut. this is an online where it's a little bit difficult to say exactly what the impact is going to be the general reduction in heedcount there's additional details that you can look at and i'm happy to try and answer any questions you might have. once you do from a publication called the city wide savings program which is available on the OMB website Nyc.Gov slash OMB look for the citywide savings program. you know, i can't tell you exactly what everything will necessarily mean in terms of services, but if you have questions about anything specifically you can pass them on to Luke and we'll try and answer them. and then final slide. just to talk for a moment about transportation, so sorry, not quite. final transportation safe. thank you. the department transportation took about a$ 65 million budget cut overall lot of it was, again, this was sort of city funds, a lot of the savings was realized from substituting in some federal aid from the cares act some state money. as well as, again, sort of vacancy reductions with unspecified impacts on services, but there were a few cuts that i thought people would care about vision zero cots of$ 8 million reducing the public vision zero public awareness campaign canceling some lane markings and bike lane protections that had been planned for this year. the better Bus initiative. the$ 5.7 million cut there was will funds that were intended to speed up bosses. so a lot of that was lane improvements Lane markings. some lane protections, as well as the continuation of the program to equip buses with transponders that would essentially change traffic lights in the buses favor. so those were delayed as well. and then there were some vacant traffic enforcement agent positions. that were eliminated. there was also at the same time. some new traffic agents enforcement agents that were hired, with the goal of essentially raising revenue by writing more parking tickets so park carefully. and then last, this time, actually the last slide. just briefly, the, the outlook, which is quite a bit more uncertain that is typically the case for a variety of reasons. the most prominent. one is, of course, Congress left in August for the summer recess without passing another stimulus bill and there had been hopes that the next room is bill would include a two state and local governments, all of whom have been obviously on the forefront of delivering services and fighting the pandemic and real time. but his revenues have dramatically fall and some places worse than others, but certainly in New York. it's been quite as sharp fall that the lack of federal aid will affect us directly, but also indirectly through the state budget, the state's looking at a 14 and a half billion dollar gap for the fiscal year that it's in now we started again April 1 and they're kind of have not done anything yet to implement those savings. they've been delaying they've been holding back about 20% of local aid payments for several areas, but not yet quote unquote cutting it. they're running out of time. by September 30 they will be halfway through their fiscal year and the opportunity to realize the magnitude of savings that they will need to balance their budget is obviously going to they're going to have to act, and i think it's at this point seems at least as unlikely as likely that the federal government will pass any kind of stimulus package by September 30 so that's obviously a big concern at this point about what will happen with the state budget. i mentioned earlier the billion dollars in labor savings and this has been in the news quite a bit. lately the mayor was planning to send to agencies, no end to the union's rather notification of agency layoffs and all the all the city agencies were tasked with coming up with a list of people, they would lay off the city was going to notify this the unions. that those lists. the union's ask the mayor for additional time and the mayor agreed. he's been characterizing as kind of a day by day decision. with without either the labor savings or the layoffs, or some other step. the layouts could. i'm sorry, the labor savings or some other step the layoff could happen, but the mayor's solution to this has been to propose. state authorization to borrow money to cover the operating gap for this year we've only done that once since the fiscal crisis of 1974 75 after 911 where we borrowed$ 2 billion. and we're actually still paying that off to the tune of 100$ 50 million a year. so, you know, that's a step that i think there's cross pressures here, there's obviously concerned about the impact on city services and on city workers. there's also concerned about burdening future generation with debt service costs to pay off the borrowing that will limit their options. as opposed to, can i, can i jump in and ask your question there about the layoffs. yep. my understanding was that it was mayoral agencies only meaning that the Community Board, which operates under the borough president's budget would not have been affected by the potential layoffs, is that correct my understanding of this was that elected officials were not asked to submit layoff list. they were told what their target would be for savings if they, you know, had been instructed and it was sort of voluntary. so i do not, i do not know how, exactly. so i assume that the borough presidents got a target. i do not know whether that was whether that was supposed to trickle down in some way to the community boys community boards obviously have their own budgets in the in the city budget. so i do not you know if you did not get if you were not told that you had a target, then i guess you probably did not have a target. i think it would be hard to do layoffs. in community Board since are very few employees. well, i will tell you right now, i will stay just sit and if you come after any of my three full time employees. i'm not, i'm not coming. i'm not coming after anybody so have to talk to the mayor about that. alright, sorry, i did not mean interrupt you, but you are on the line. i'm actually done. i'm happy to let the presentation, i'm happy to answer. okay, we've got two quick hands that i have seen up this whole time. James Wallace. did you have a question for Mr Ny Black yes. and thank you, Mr. Nick like that was very informative while you were talking in the link went up for the savings plan. i brought it up. and took a quick gander and two things jumped out at me. one was there appeared to be a$ 400 million cut from do we, and about 200 million of that was from operational savings. i'm just wondering about the other 200 million, it seems like that's a lot to be coming from do we so, i mean the deal we budgets, you know, in the neighborhood of$ 28 billion. so it's, you know, largest budget i there were a lot of people who felt. i think that it got cut disproportionately compared to some other agencies. there was elimination. the mayor had proposed eliminate 100 million dollars in fair student funding, which is a formula driven funding to try and your level up schools that have large numbers of high needs students, the Council City Council actually restored that there were a lot of there was there was a significant savings from not hiring titles not hiring new personnel in titles that were represented already represented in the absent teacher reserve the atr there were some cuts to professional development contracts. there were some cuts to some of the equity and excellence programs. so there, there were a large number of cuts that were you know, for diverse i guess in their impact and added up to that total about$ 400 million and one follow up. you mentioned that the city is part of its plan to deal with the gap is borrowing. i'm just wondering, you know, what is the current ballpark depth service for New York City and you know our thing when you say borrowings that include the issuing of debt bonds, things of that nature. because, you know, this is an extraordinary time and you know there is a recovery and we can all you know one person's crystal balls as good as the next but you know reasonably speaking you know, i understand the concerns about burdening future generations. at the same time, you know, there is a crisis now. so i'm just wondering what is the view from the administration on the debt stack issuing bonds and other forms debt, and i appreciate it. yep, i can't, i can't tell you what do you miss. well, i can tell you what the administration's view is, but the current debt service that is the annual payment for bonds over issued to finance the city's capital plan is about$ 7 billion. the, as i said, there's about$ 150 million a year again for another, but another three years to pay back the bonds that were issued for operating purposes. after 911 the mayor has asked for about$ 5 billion total in bonding authority. and that would result in debt service of about$ 300 million a year. alright thank you kit. i'm assuming this is going to be about the school budget to i'm kind of disappointed. i'm so predictable also very much appreciate the presentation. super week but a very informative. and the question is about SCA in their budget around the world countries that have relatively successful reopen their schools are investing in facilities improvements, you know, starting in the spring and through the summer. things like H back systems, adding places for more students be able to wash their hands and now is we're trying to reopen schools. one of the big talking points, especially from principles is that their age back systems either are not where they need to be, or they can't even get information on what level of h back system they have. and so just curious if you can speak to what is happening with essays Budget and what is likely to happen in the near term future because this is a very urgent issue with schools reopening with students, very soon. yeah, so the SCA was not exempt from the, from the shutdown of the capital program again you know there were exceptions for Covid-19 related. i'll come back to that. legal mandates and you know so pcb removal, for example, program, i think, was continued and health life and safety. as far as i know, there were there were no fun, no capital funds spent by the S Ta on any building improvements directly intended to mitigate the you know likelihood of infection. so, no, no changes to bathrooms, no changes to h back no changes to water fountains, as far as i know it all. all right. thank you. Alan was yours seo related as well. Alan follow up with some time. so, if i may. yeah, thank you. Preston there's could be yes. any of the any of the funding affecting ongoing construction or reconstruction projects and that will show you i'm sorry i was having your you're breaking up there, Alan, i do not know if it's your connection. maybe i'm type your question in the jungle you're going in and out. Alan, would it be all right. if you want to check a little chat, chat. all right, what i was going to say is, let's see if i can find it here. has funding for school construction projects in progress been defunded i mean, they have not been defunded they've just been suspended. i think for right now and again you know they're there were certain exceptions. but other kind of routine capital projects are suspended the appropriations are still there. but it's been the it's been the administration's decision to suspend capital spending that is considered discretionary well, these are these are projects that have fencing around them and ongoing so those projects are suspended in the funds of being used, you know, for another purpose within do we have they can't be used for another purpose if they've been appropriate for a specific project but you know there's frequently kind of big lump sum units levels of, you know, budget lines units or procreation. in which a number of smaller projects can be done so. but again, as far as i know, the main the main action has been just simply stop spending and not really to reallocate spending, necessarily. i do not know all the details about how you know what the St about the Cia's capital spending and we can certainly try and look and see if we can get more information about that. thank you. thank you. all right, i'm going to have to cut off the questions here now because we've got to keep moving. i know that Leslie had a question. if anyone else had questions for the comptroller's office about the state of the budget, please forward it on to Jesse and we will forward it on and get you answers from the controller's office. thank you. Preston, we appreciate your time and hopefully you'll be able to answer some additional questions by email for us. yeah. absolutely. happy to. thank you for having me. thank you. all right, moving, moving on with the agenda. we would not. we're going to move into the public session now. i'm Jeffrey is not here. so Jessica is going to run the public session, but i'm going to introduce the first speaker. as i mentioned earlier, the social justice Working Group was formed back in June, there was an incident that took place on West 45Th Street in early August, that the social justice. Working group has drafted two letters about they specifically asked for. Mr Derek Ingram to address us about what transpired on that day to him. so we extend an invitation to Mr Ingram to speak. he has a prepared statement which we are going to let him give in its entirety. and then we will move on to the rest of the public session in our normal order. so, Jesse. if you can move, Mr Ingram over and then the panelists section. all right, Mr Ingram, the floor is yours. Mr anger and you're with us. you're on mute. you have to unmute yourself there. oh, sorry. can you hear me now. yeah, there you are. thank you so yeah my name is derek and grow. mom, i'm a resident of community Board for and i currently live in Hell's kitchen. i'm here today to ask you to send a letter to the City Council and Speaker Corey Johnson to request that the council's committee on oversight and investigations launch an investigation of the NYPD and they're in for budget transparency purposes for the NYPD concerning their actions and their attempted besieged one of my home on August 7 2020 i'm open to any questions or anything about my statement moving forward. the backgrounds of the events leading up on August 7 are critical. i've been a vocal advocate for ending police brutality against people of color, since 2014 when i lived in Ferguson, Missouri, and became an active member of the black lives matter movement for the past six years i've spent nights and weekends engaged in community organizing, since moving to New York, i immediately became active in the struggle for racial justice. after the death of George Floyd i helped co found a nonprofit and we just received our 513 see status called warriors in the garden. a collective of activists in New York dedicated to non violent protests propelling social and legislative change. warriors in the garden has been leading the charge to protect our community from police brutality in all forms of systemic oppression. the warriors have led countless Nonviolent protest in George after George Floyd's desk in our advocacy efforts were highlighted in the New York time. the Gotham missed see on Cnn and the guardian NBC news and countless other credible news outlets since June 2020 i believe that it is my work as an activist and the app. my voice being amplified and specifically as an advocate for the black lives matter movement that led the NYPD to target me with such ferocity last month. on Friday, August 7 i was awoken at 7 am to the police banging on my door. they claim to have a warrant that are asked to be slid under my door that they never provide it. for the next five hours dozens of offices harass berated me and terrorize me by taking over my street. barricading my neighbors in and out. and blocking off neighboring buildings. pointing guns at me through my window. demanding that i leave my home without calls are worn and that i surrender myself. i heard dog scratching at my door there was a battering ram that left a huge debt within my door. they almost broke my lock. they brought drones fire trucks helicopters emergency vehicles and there was no warrant. they set up barriers they shut down traffic. they remove protesters. i was filming that incident inside my apartment on Instagram Live i garnered a lot of media coverage and viewership everyone from Shaun king to Alicia keys was watching and people came out to stand in solidarity with me as the siege continued the crowd group. the police were unrelenting while people were rallying below. i was on the phone with my attorney who was trying to figure out what was going on. she sent legal observers and was an arranged my peaceful surrender to say that i was terrified is an understatement. i was traumatized. i still am. three days later i broke out in hives. i had night terrors. i'm scared to be within my home. i'm scared to be within Hell's kitchen. to say to say that i was terrified is inappropriate i fear, deep down in my core that if i opened my door to those officers, my life would be swiftly taken like that of my friend status mckerrow in 2015 when he was having a mental health crisis and someone called 911 they sent an army of officers instead of social services, thanks to the support of my neighbors and community my attorney my and other news media outlets. the NYPD eventually surrendered and left my, my home and building. i was able to peacefully surrender the following day. i marched to the precinct early in the morning with my fellow warriors and other community members outreach at the police actions. on August 7 and it was not until i made it to the courthouse hours after the surrender that i even learned what i was allegedly accused of sadly, i'm not the only activists that has been targeted by the nypd, they have a decade long history of harassing and disappearing activists, unfortunately, without due process. they have not paid millions of dollars and loss lawsuits settlements their actions have been covered by unions. and yet people like me, people of color black people who are fighting for racial injustice continue to be targeted arrested in person should be persecuted for demanding the right to not be killed by police because of the color of our skin. i'm scared now to walk the streets of Hell's kitchen alone. not only because of the police physical presence, they because of their utilization of facial recognition and abuse of power and digital harassment. where does it end i found out that they were posting pictures of me. and posters of my face unknowingly all over their social media and within my neighborhood. what if a vigilante decided to do a citizen's arrest. this should not happen in our neighborhood, this should not happen in New York City. we need answers to find out who authorized the NYPD to come at me with full military force without a warrant and without telling me when i was accused of and lying to me about having a warrant. we need to know how much money they spend that money has been spent on homeless people because that money has been spent on people that were going through drug abuse issues. Hell's kitchen is riddled with needles and you sent an army and a helicopter to a to a resonance home without a warrant. we need to know how much they spent on this endeavor. all the strike fear and all of this to strike fear in the hearts of activists and allies. this was a political statement by the police. are law enforcement agency should not be a political arm. we know that the facial recognition software was used, but how and why community board for can be a partner in this work to hold the NYPD accountable for their actions on August 7 and stand up for the rights of your black neighbors, i urge you to sing your proposed letter to Speaker Johnson and the City Council. thank you for listening and thank you for your support. thank you, Mr Ingram for addressing us and accepting our invitation. we are going to move on now that the letters will be addressed that they are new business letters, they will be addressed during the business session. we're going to move now to the regular public session, as i mentioned Jeffrey's not with us. so Jessica is going to our second Vice Chair Jessica Change is going to run the rest of the public session, Jessica. great, thank you. little we have nine public people who have signed up for the public session today, i'm going to call you up. now, Catherine Headon Michael Glasser and Sean Ruskin Jesse will unmute you. and just to remind everyone that you will have two minutes i will be timing, hopefully you can police yourselves as it is, but i will have it here available for us and remind you, at the 15 second Mark Catherine does not seem to be on any longer. i had Michael Glasser and he's been moved over great. and if we can just get Hassan read up and ready, Michael. thank you. and thank you for your time. my name is Mike Glaser, i'm a small business owner Condo Board president for the grand Chelsea on 17th and eighth and apparent of children in school in the district. my kids happen to go to core leaders, it's a private school on 15th street between eighth and ninth. it's no more than a couple of brownstones much together with a nice little courtyard in the back. and also happens to be one of the only schools. that's offering full time, Monday through Friday classes opening and just a couple of weeks for all age levels that it services to 10 we are desperate, the parents to keep the school open and operational. it in person, learning, part of that is going to be contingent on getting some street space, which i know the mayor is working on with public schools. i'm not exactly sure how it applies to private schools. i know that the school filled out their request form. to do t to get the street access but i do not really have requested this time it's more of informational just to let you know what we're trying to accomplish and perhaps in the near future, somebody from the school or parents from the school, obviously, a lot of us live in the district. are going to need some help. you know, to be able to have lunch outside to be able to offer more than just the 12 kids that can play in the courtyard at once, would be obviously incredibly useful, especially as the weather stays nicer in the fall. and i know that the school is also trying to gain access to a couple of the small parks in the district. the one over on excuse me. just 15 yes, sure. so that, that's really it. i do not have a specific request, just to let you know that this is what we're after, and hopefully you'll hear from me. with pleasant news that we got it. and if not, hopefully the community board can help us out. if we need it. great, thank you. thank you. thank you, Sean Ruskin yes. hi, good evening. i want to thank the Community Board for allowing me the opportunity. i'm going to try and speak quickly. i work for an organization called village care or non for pot health, not for profit Healthcare organization based out of not just the West village, but throughout Manhattan and the other boroughs. we do have a and we care for New York's frail most vulnerable seniors folks are on Medicaid and require care. we have an assisted living residents called villas care 46 and 10. it is just that on 46th Street and 10Th Avenue. it's been there since 2001 it earlier someone spoke about affordable housing for folks who have medicaid who require some level of care. and are over 62 and we just wanted to present ourselves to the community, because we do have vacancies available and we know that there were folks in need and again, it's called builds care at 46 and 10th. it's a great, beautiful facility for individuals who either need assisted living and we even have privately independent living as well. great, thank you. i understand that Hassan is not on. so we're going to move to Brian Weber and then we're going to go to Lisa Wager and Sondra Hollingsworth hi, thank you. many of you know me. i've spoken frequently with you. i'm a resident of West 36 three and i'm also a public member on the land use and Zoning Committee and Chelsea Hell's kitchen Clinton hell's kitchen. i'm calling in regards to the temporary shelter situation on West 36 and 37 street i spoke about it last month. i'm hoping i do not have to come back and speak about it again. this month, but we've seen little to no change or progress in the situation west 30s and just for quick background, you've heard it all before. DHS has moved three temporary shelters into three separate hotels operated by three separate providers with the total of 820 single adult individuals, which is approximately 6% of the single adult populate single adult shelter population. that was relocated from congregate settings into hotel settings, the density is far too great. and we are experiencing nothing but turmoil and chaos in the west 30s, since the arrival of the shelters and i've been pressing our elected officials and anyone who listened to me. to advocate for relocating at least one of the shelters and reducing the density of the shelter population in the west 13 officer Coleman spoke about a very briefly, but we've had two deaths on our streets in the last two weeks. one was violent homicide in author Officer Coleman's district. the other was an unfortunate overdose on the sidewalk, i believe it was Mike 7138 39 you have 15 seconds. okay, well i'm just asking is, we inquiry Johnson to advocate on behalf the residents. to reduce the density of the homeless population or neighborhood at the height of the pandemic. he advocated for moving the adult population into hotels, but i'm sure he was not advocating to move three hotels onto one street. at such great density so, thank you. thank you very much, Lisa. do we have Lisa Wager from Fit. so you need to unmute if you'd like to speak. Jesse. can you see her. should we move to Sandra. well, she works out very well, okay. i have two minutes. it's great to be back at two before even see you, even if it's only virtually i have three things to talk about. i'm going to talk super fast. as you know, educational institutions around the country are grappling with starting the new fall semester where the same restart fall 2020 plan incorporates significant health and safety protocols and of course all sunni campuses are going to be responsive to whatever changes happen in the environment. but here's what we're doing classes began on Monday, and they're continuing through Wednesday, December 23 all classes, except for a couple of graduate level courses are being conducted remotely. students do have limited access to lead some students with the supervision of trained personnel through a reservation system. and following health and safety protocols for social distancing, etc. as of November 24 all classes and coursework will be fully remote there'll be no students living on West 27Th street in those residence halls this semester and Catherine Hall, which is in Cb for on 31st street has a limited number of students and the dining hall and the Dubinsky center on Eighth Avenue. is open for those residents students take at food knowing door dining we're maintaining a full complement of public safety officers on the campus and building some grants staff is continuing to maintain and oversee the campus environment. so it's safe and pretty and the full, full restart plan is on the fit website which i gave Jesse if he feels like sending it to you. and you can also see our Paul public programming. three students from air if you subject. if i tease Fashion design class that graduated in the spring we designed the girl scouts uniform and apparel line. is super cool there at new interchangeable pieces for girls grades k through six. it got lots of coverage. i sent you an article and i have a lot more to save it. i do not get to say yes, i do, Sir. oh wow, okay. and one of our alum Straightaway. i have many more exciting details, but i'm just hitting the headlines, one of our Alum Illustrated Lebron James is New York Times Bestselling children's book. i promise. she's a an illustration alum from oh he grew up in Queens and she says she basically just drew her childhood for this book. and i also sent Jesse a link to that article. so if you want to know more about it. it's all there. thank you. thank you, Lisa thank you. we're going to move on. we have sondra hollingsworth and then it's maybe Pam Wolf and Susan Ross. hi this is Sandra, can i go ahead. yeah. we can hear me can you hear me yes we can go ahead hi Hollingsworth and i registered nurse and i'm from New York. and i'm also just reiterating regarding four to six and 10 our assisted living facility that's in New York City. it's a fabulous beautiful community assisted living where the seniors six to eight years and older can attend we are located in the heart of Manhattan there by restaurant row. there in near Times Square. it's beautiful, beautiful location and we are the most affordable senior living facility, the most affordable the cheapest phone now you can if you need to contact me. i can be reached at 646- 634- 3102 or you may call the facility. if you know anybody who would like to come there and see and have a tour or we can do virtual tours for you, but if a number is 212 977- 464- 0229 774600 hopefully that's interested in coming to some beautiful facility because we're in a heart the community and the patients and they'll benefit from that beautiful facilities for those folks would like to live there is an assistant. assistant living that i would i would recommend to anyone sitting over to come and live there and have a wonderful life of wellness. thank you. thank you. Sandra. can yeah. so thank you for letting me into the meeting. i did have a question i wanted to pose to captain Coleman and that has to do with the link NYC towers on eighth avenue between 20th and 20 seconds streets. combined with the sidewalk shared that is up in front of 20725207 870 they are situation is has become much, much more dire in recent times. and i wanted to ask if there was a way to have more police presence to focus on that section of Eighth avenue while we wait for the process to get rid of the sidewalk shed, which is the major attractive nuisance there. that was my question for him. thanks. i'm Pamela i've let Brian Lewis know from Gail's office and we will be following up on that, as i promised you. i did hear from Brian during this meeting and i did. i did seeing Gail's letter, and i'm very grateful for her support in this and i hope it continues. thank you very much. great, thank you. i just want to confirm that we still do not have Catherine or Hassan okay then. that concludes our we will take a son is back on so ah, ok. Hassan, are you with us. even one second is shifting over to say okay assignee with us. okay. where'd you go looks like a song is not with us now. i'm sorry, i do not know what happened. but he was there a second ago. so i'm afraid that concludes our public session them and we will meet with Hassan hear his feedback. hopefully in another time. thank you everyone. well, thank you, Jessica. appreciate you stepping up on such short notice. alright, so a couple of procedural things we have to adopt the agenda that we're already halfway through is their emotion to adopt the agenda. i know this is dolores i have emotion to amend the agenda. okay, sorry Glarus. go ahead. it's okay. i'd like to make a motion to table the two letters from the social Justice task force because we have not had any public discussion on that. and even though the committee's and the Community board has an opportunity to speak tonight we have not had an opportunity for the broader public to speak to these two issues that were writing on a second okay, we need a roll call on that then on whether or not the motion is to amend the agenda. i mean, just this list be let's just make sure i'm doing this right. are there any other motions to amend the agenda. okay. no, but i have a question. all right. hang on a second. Michael was that, yeah. it was all right, i'm not ready for the roll call yet Maria, you said you have a question, i thought sounded like your voice. it was my voice for, i guess you into Loris so if we're if we bring up the letter to my and we talked about it that's that does not, i guess, for the last, i guess, that does not count as having a discussion about it and then being able to emotion is because there has not been public discourse. we are the Community Board. and yes, we'll have an opportunity to speak about it. but the broader public has not had an opportunity to weigh in and we did get to hear from Mr Ingram tonight, but that's the only person from the public that has spoken to either of these issues. so that's my. that's my concern, it's more about process than the actual content. and the public can't speak. about it right now. that's right, but the letters were all right. i'm just going to a couple of points. you're just so everyone is on the same page here. the letters were issued last Friday. they were available to the public and the Signup was available for anyone who wanted to speak. that's the first point. second point, and this is a parliamentary question that i do not know the answer to. and i'll take parliamentary advice from anyone. these are technically new business items. so i'm not even sure they've been added to the agenda, as yet, so can we amend an agenda that they're not been added to it's a straight parliamentary question that i honestly do not know the answer to. i have plenty of information alone. go ahead, though the Social Justice Committee did they have a public meeting about these letters. no they did not. so i think we have an issue that's a broader one that is our meetings have to be public. they are a working group show they are not a committee so they do not have to be public. they are going to be reorganized so their meetings will be public, but at the time. they were organized as a working group in June, they report it out in July. we do not meet in August, as everyone knows, so there was no anticipation that something would need to be done in August, then this incident happened on August 7 and the group. by email decided to submit these letters i agreed to take them as new business because they would be available for public discussion and they would be available for board discussion. i'm not saying we have to vote on them. i'm just, i'm, you know, just trying to manage the meeting right now. i'm not giving an opinion one way or the other. but from a parliamentary question. i'm not even sure they are technically part of the agenda until they are introduced as new business when we get to the new business section. on their list. i can step in here. okay, go ahead. i mean, again, i am not the expert here, but you are about to you're about to adopt an agenda with them listed and so that would okay. i would make them on the agenda. okay, so then what kit. go ahead. yeah. another question for tourism potentially an amendment to the moment tours. case for the implications of your would not send this back to the working group to hold a public meeting, perhaps a hearing and then that's the setting where this will be discussed and come back would not go to a specific committee just curious what the next step of your emotion. yeah, ideally it would go to committee, but they're not assigned to a committee, my, my motion is simply because there has not been public discourse. i was considering also your ACES letter to go ahead and take that off the agenda because there has not been public discourse there either. you did not have a meeting. that seem to have had enough public input and history that i'm not, i'm not making a motion on that it's mainly because we do not have any public input the working group is not open to the public. and these may be reflecting views of ourselves on the on the board and there is no evidence that it reflects the broader public. and i'm concerned about that. oh, men suggestion to the amendment. let me know if you are comfortable with this would be working group will have a public meeting where there's an opportunity for the public to comment on the letters. that's my hope with this motion is strictly on the agenda the emotion is to not have these letters on the agenda. maybe i should on my end. but my able to suggest that as part of i will have. i do not care. i do not think that's actually God procedurally, okay, since it's just a motion on the agenda. but i will state to you and i will state to the whole board that if dolores is motion passes. and this is taken off the agenda, i will ask the working group to hold a public meeting to continue with this process. local papers Kd, please. yeah, this is Joe's comment about there was no committee no public meeting. i'm working group. is less a formal body to have a public meeting, i am not aware of a working group. actually having public meetings when they are not a designated community meeting so i think we need to be very careful. i like the idea of them working with aces. that's the committee and this is a concern. maybe they can work from the Isis Committee. Jd, we can designate them as a task force as opposed to Working group. the task force. now a task forces public meetings are our budget task force is a task force that has open public meetings and presents things to the full board for consideration so we reconstitute the working group as a task force. then they can hold a public meeting and do this without it having to go through an organized committee. oh, okay. i just have a content question. is going back in the chat is time sensitive, is it not time sensitive. my question is, and maybe one of the City Council reps can answer it. has to City Council deal with this. what is it about to deal with this. is there a resolution in the City Council right now. i think that's an important piece for me to know Carl, you with us. can you answer that. for i've just been advised the council member Rosen Rosenthal is on Helen Rosenthal, have you with us still all right, i'll take it from either car wilson or Helen Rosenthal. if anyone can answer Burt's question. all right, Chris. Joe or Stitcher. you were next. and then, Christine. here. yeah. i played both working in task forces and they hold in public. so i think we do not, we should get away from the language, the board and our canadian task lists and working group. or accidentally public and forget the substance of this matter, which is a really serious one, i think it's important, considering how important it is that it be debated in a public lb weird zoom fashion. so, is there any issue, which is taking referring this back to the working group. they are like make a substitute motion to refer back to the working group and hold a public meeting is i think what rather than position, but it should be air fully public okay, Christine. you're on mute, my friend. yeah, i wanted to suggest that maybe what we have done in other situation is let those letters to be on the agenda. and when we get to the discussion and we have a discussion, which is a public discussion. the conclusion of that discussion could be it needs to go back to the committee or to whatever it is that is not a committee right now, but so my recommendation would be to lead it on the agenda and have the discussion and potentially at the end of that. decide to go back to some other process that is more appropriate but i do not think i think you know removing it from the agenda of front. is not necessarily appropriate because we are not hearing the input for the Community board from all the members and that input could be very valuable, even if it goes back to the committee. yeah, and in all honesty that was the thought of the chair and adding these to the agenda at this time that we would have an opportunity that would be available to the public that we would have an opportunity to discuss it as a board. and there is always the possibility as we've done before to vote to vote to remain something back without sending a letter out. so that was the thought and including it to the agenda tonight. so thank you. Christy and i'm going to take two more comments. i'm going to give Vernon, Katie. the co chairs of the social justice. Working group an opportunity to weigh in here and then we will analyze what is actually on the table for an amendment and vote on it. right away quickly. just a couple of things. i mean, everybody knows that we were not meeting in the month of August. it's happened in the first week of August. it's time sensitive matter. issues raised by Social Justice group members and the Community board members as well as the folks in the community. so there was a response that was called for, and it was communicated via email first amongst katie and i and the chair and Jesse and some of the social Justice group members, what sort of initially raised the issue for the conversation became sort of more critical, especially for recognizing what it already happened, what transpired and fam action had to be so the internet law and christine both explain for these letters to be on the agenda is to have community boards input. and we totally recognize the social justice. Working group is not a committee and we were told that we could not have public sessions. and this is katie. thanks, Bear. and i agree with what you just said. and i'm concerned by the proposal to remove these from the agenda. i mean obviously i'm quite new to the Community Board only having been on it, a few months, but my impression is that there is a history. of when issues come up that even if they're not discussed in a committee, there is a history of proposing letters at the full community board to be discussed when they are time sensitive and, especially, it just strikes me as just procedurally stream. be not discussing these two letters this evening i'm in the same way that we've discussed letters in the past, and especially if we're leaving the ACES letters on that also came up without having been discussed in committee, but taking these off. it seems not correct okay, i'm going to Carl has been texting with Carl, he is not aware of anything pending in the council right now to answer birds question, but he's checking and we'll get back to us. hang on. i know that's Jesse writing not Carl writing dolores i'm coming back to you. you made the initial motion. would you like to restate what it is you are asking for. now, in terms of your emotion based upon anything that you've heard my emotion. i will amend to add both kit originally mentioning and Joe clarifying to send back to the working group to have a public discussion. alright, so the emotion. the emotion is to remove these lead two letters from the agenda and have them referred back to the working group and ask the working group to hold a public session. is there a second i'll second. thank you, Michael. we need a roll call on this Michael and i have not even gotten to this yet. but we have a new co secretary Maria Judah work issues had to step down as co secretary. she is still co chair of housing, health and human services, ladies and gentlemen, Leslie but Cozy and Murphy our new co secretary and Michael Noble will run this roll call. okay. all right, now let's just make sure i guess is in favor of dolores is motion. to refer this back i know is to leave it on the agenda. right. was legal to make two copies of this to fill up tonight. anyway, let's start with Sarah Appleton i know leave on it and christine know when filling this in action again. one second, just Mike just take a second when if you're on by phone. can you press star six to unmute yourself or star nine to raise your blue and we'll find you. i have a question. in the meantime, because i'm up next to vote. if it's unless it's a procedural question about the roll call it can't take it.

Gail Welcome. thank you, Brian, for keeping me honest. moving over know what i'm here for. ladies and gentlemen, Manhattan borough president Gale brewer. thank you very much, Mr. Chair, i will be quick. i love this. i'm not going to talk about the hotels and shelters, except to say opportunity you on board seven and 10 and 11 yeah, oh my god, it's a full time. so i think we obviously need a longer discussion. with all of the boards. but, congratulations on what you're doing. and we'll just keep working on it together, second issue is we did a small business call. i want to be, again, people are more affordable and also from the community. we went from 52nd to 49 street. you know, handed out the usual pee Pee. but basically the main complaint, to be honest with you is obviously the rent. you're going to hear that. but it is and the lack of indoor dining, i am on the governor's task force, you do not get a lot of information in terms of opening in general. but i do think it's going to come up very soon. i heard the mayor was talking about it today. a lot of the restaurants have board for have put in brand new. filtration systems and been scrubbing. they have figured out how to have distancing, etc. so you have a ton of indoor restaurants that do not have the opportunity to do outdoor so i do think something that is going to be coming up to i do not need to talk about the sensors, a lot, except to say three things. we do get funding from the governor very late. but we were the first president to get it out to nonprofits that we have about 20 or 25 of them and they are now. in the field. supplementing what is going door to door, it's still hard. no question. second, we put two postcards out from our office 140,000 each one was about a month ago, one more recently to those areas and census tracts that are under performing. and number three, we got the list from the board of elections as to who has moved and where they have gone temporarily 35,000 manhattanites. i think it's a much larger city number, but after struggling, the list. it's about 35,000 and now we're going to send them a letter saying, we'd love you very much. a person who is temporarily elster but you need to fill up the census with your New York City address and not whatever you are temporarily, even if we do it. that's okay. please do that. so we're working on that. obviously we do not have much time left in terms of the schools. it's an ongoing issue. we know, of course, that there's a different date September 21 in terms of the opening where there are lots of other issues. number one, when we met this morning. some of you may have been on the call went the issue of executive superintendent. there are lots of issues that came up, but even just the devices is an issue. the deal we only have 20,000 left and many more young people are going to meet them and all the broadband issues, etc. and then the one that upsetting me at all. City Council members and the president is we allocated around just us$ 12 million to school. a year ago, not even the recent budget, a year ago and the Ob has not spent it and will not spend it. and then the answer in the post article that said, do we all we have enough, etc. they're all fine. all the bathrooms are fine all the technology. it's fine. all the water fountains are fine. we do not need your money. well, that's not correct. so do not know how much going to enough, but i am very frustrated with the theory, the month. i do think that outdoor descent. the list of the outdoor possibilities in terms of streets and some lot of schools and districts to discern for Drew want outdoor. it may or may not work. it's very noisy. i even suggested to do a week today that they talked to the ambulance Cms. Wire Department and Police Department that this is a different time and if kids are going to learn and learning outdoors. those ambulances and sirens, they can be very loud so you combine that with the challenges of motorcycles, etc. you're coming up with a lawsuit more so if i can work. i do not know. we'll also send a letter today, you'll see it soon. some of the police departments, they should i think perhaps have barricades around their building, but the clothes off the street. is quite challenging for the residents and that has a message that i think is incorrect. so we're asking the police department to review closing off streets do not think it's necessary, we'll see what kind of response we get we also walk the bottom mcgraw way to the top of broadway and store vacancies and we put release that out today. i do not know that we can do a lot about them. we all know the issues, but by the end of this year, even pre call women to have the data. so how many vacancies. there are storefronts in the city of New York and we just want to remind everybody about this challenge the nonprofit community does so much work and it's so underpaid for it. so we got all fibro person to sign a letter. if you're in a non profit to know the term indirect rate cost initiative. that's the issue. basically, of getting not the full payment for the work that you're doing from a city or state contract state has the same problem and the poor not you know the nonprofits are really under the gun in terms of having to just take it and do it and then i want to thank everybody who knew about participated. please go see the monumental women. step two. and central part i'm not proud of a whole lot that i do in my life. but seven years who worked on this. i was one of the ones that movie got this set to off. the drawing board with parks and other city agencies. it is stunning. and it, you know, nobody can say anything but great things about it in terms of the work that the sculptor did and it has educational component and so on. you'll love it. um, we've been trying to work. with the holidays coming up the doors holidays coming up to get some of the open space. it is available to be available for some of the synagogues and the congregations. and we have not gotten an answer yet from do it. but if you have any synagogues, to have that let us know Jc Rc is working with us. i do want to thank the city of the work that the nightlife commissioner has been doing the men mediating establish a neighborhood disputes. we'll see if that works for me. she's trying aerials trying to find a way that neighbors and bars can work. together. so those are some of the things we're still working on the issue of affordable housing talking to different people like a board for who knows everything about affordable housing, but the rest of the world does not so we're trying to put together if not for the immediate but for the future, what a real affordable housing program would look like. because i do not think we have one right now. thank you very much. and thank you Brian for all the thanks for being Tired board member for thank you, gail, and we really appreciate the efforts on the 36th street situation. i know how hard your office is working on that. i'm going to go to our elected officials. now it appears that representative Carolyn Maloney, is still on the line Representative Maloney. are you still with us. i am sorry to disappoint. it is not carolyn, she was at another event. i'm betsy. hi, Betsy. have other elected, you're welcome to. i know Taylor's your normal person. she's at the event with the congresswoman, so it's me if you want me to go. now i can, or if you as long as long as you keep it short. you can go right now. all right, what we have. so mostly what the congresswoman has been doing is working to save the office, we held a hearing, i'm opening my nose. on August 24 with postmaster to joy about the slow down what's been going on with the postal service. he's refused to turn over documents. so today we sent him a subpoena. um, the other big thing like for our president mentioned is the census. they're actually they were at a census event. and it in September 30. so again, we're just encouraging people to fill out your census, i can drop the link into the chat and just a second. yeah, she was at a press conference earlier this evening, talking about that and how important it is, think you all know that. so i won't you know spend too much time on that. oh, the bill that Congress came back to pass on August 22 pass the house. was in fact Congresswoman Maloney's bill. it's called the delivering for America's act, it would put the post office back to the level. it was that in January of 2020 we think this is needed, of course, we're waiting on the Senate. for that one. we've also introduced the Nonpartisan Postmaster General Act to prevent what we're currently dealing with, um, what else we've launched a committee chairs are asking the Department of Defense Inspector general to launch an investigation based on new complaint against Army lieutenant Colonel then men and his brother. these from them anymore. it's just a lot of things i'm romeo, mostly, you know, we're going to keep trying to do everything that we can to support the post office to make sure that elections balloting goes smoothly in November, that make sure people get their medications. and to make sure that New York is fully counted in the census. if you need anything, i can also put our email in the Chat box as well. we handle a lot of, you know, any federal issues, reach out to us and we're happy to do what we can. thank you very much. i'm going to go next to state Senator Bread Heilmann who i believe is logged on in person. and if i'm wrong. we'll move on. i'm here. in first hybrid hi, Vicki. i think it's very helpful to make us not make us, but to give us the privilege of listening to the public. as you did before. before our reports is really wise and i wanted to thank everyone who spoke in particular i know my birla is on the line, who everyone knows here, you know, we were really moved by Derek Ingram's testimony tonight, but also by what he's told us personally and what we've learned from neighbors about that incident on West 45Th Street. last month, we, you know, as Derek said it's just it's it i mean to talk about excessive force without a warrant. you know, i was as that happened in real time i google the aclu know your rights page and they have a booklet and derek his response was straight out of that book. i'm not sure if he read it, or he has knowledge independently or from other some other source, but i thought it was i thought it was actually really inspiring that one of our constituents knows not to open a door when somebody's paying on it without a warrant. and to slip a note under underneath that door and request that warrant. i've sent a letter. i know the borough president has as well to the Nypd, commissioner, asking for a full accounting of the events, including questions like, Derek raised about the cost. the process of approvals involved officers and the use of facial recognition i carry a bill in Albany. that might help as right which would ban facial recognition. by use of the NYPD until there's a task force setup to understand where that data goes, how it's used. is there any accounting on it. we think it's really out of control here in the city and we do not believe in my pd is the right source to oversee it but the letters on the on the board report. secondly, very quickly. i held a press conference at Farley with our great colleagues and remember Godfrey to in the borough president and Council members Carlene Rivera, and Keith powers about the need for ballot drop boxes in the state of New York 33 states in the District of Columbia have an alternative to us. by voting by mail to the Us Post Office or having to go to a polling site and drop off a balance. as the borough president said at the first garbage. i think is really wise, it's like it's a low tech solution to a complex problem which is we could establish drop boxes acrosss the state of New York at some expense, but the cost of not doing so, given the fact that the post office is being underfunded and undermined by this federal administration is so enormous so we're pushing for that we had a prototype valid dropbox at our event. and i appreciate the support of a league of women voters empire. indivisible, and other organizations like downtown win for change wanted to give a huge thank you to see before is Leslie Murphy and Josephine issue and for the for the project. that they created to get student teachers from nearby universities to provide live distance learning to see our elementary schools and district to this is going to be an incredible asset as we engage in remote learning. so it's a big credit to see before for taking the lead on this and i just really want to give you a shout on that we're very happy to provide any support. we could also wanted to note that there's clearly an issue with small businesses and their rent that's do. i've been getting a lot of calls from in particular tenants in grand central station, just so you know. i know it's not your district, but the mta. i believe has to set a better standard and negotiating with the businesses in Grand Central. it's the front door to New York City, in many respects, and they need to cut these small businesses or break, whether it's a complete, you know, rent forbearance, or abatement. they have not been negotiating, i think, fairly with the small businesses, but this is a problem that you're seeing acrosss the entire city. landlords that are not negotiating and i have legislation that i carry with us on the river harvey Epstein, which you can read about in the board report to address this very problem. and then finally, wanted to say that i'm having a you know a Mammogram Van coming up in the neighborhood, fill out your census. continue to, you know, to work with volunteers with Councilmember Johnson and other local elected officials and make sure you request your absentee ballot, you can do that right now. thanks so much. oh. thank you, Brad. i believe Council member Helen Rosenthal is still with Us Council Councilmember Rosenthal. hey, great to see law. great to hear your meetings. it's really a great session. it's great to see everyone thank you all for the work that you do, on behalf of the community. i have five quick updates first for those who are following the temporary hotel shelter issue i think things are settling down on the upper West side with the three shelters that we have in my district. i think the both the NYPD and the shelter providers are doing a great job doing their jobs. so we're the clients are getting very good services. i did a tour today where a client was telling me, interestingly, that being in the hotel, he's able to recover faster that he has more you know, quiet time where he's studying for his, his ged. and he can really do the work of getting his act together. so i was really pleased to see that. please tour. i'm glad to know the shelter providers are doing good work. i will say, and i think Gail touched on this in terms of the indirect rate for those of you who know about the fight we had over the last two years about getting more funds to social service providers. we had a great success that last year and then in this budget, the administration actually misled the City Council. and said was that there would be no cuts to the indirect rate. the something that was we fought so hard for. and now it comes out, they're actually making cuts to it. which is very disheartening inquiry and i've talked about it. i think we would have fought to get funding for that cut had we known it was a cut. so and sort of tangential to that, i think, you know, there are a number of things where the city went way too far in terms of budget cuts, whether it be cuts to social service providers or cuts to litter basket Litter Basket pickup. you know, i think there are hundreds of millions of dollars, where we cut the city cut way too deep, and it was one of the reasons that i voted against the budget. so a number of us are starting list of things that we think should be sort of refunded and i'm very proud to be the prime sponsor on the resolution to support borrowing. and i think that's something the state should allow the city to do i think that our city cuts are cuts have already gone too deep. i would not recommend any more than what we've already done and we're in the situation we're in. people need to remember that back in February, the city had gotten the highest bond rating ever and so, you know, the city was doing something right before Corbett hit i wanted to let people know i'll be sending out an email tomorrow actually about for parents who can afford to not have their pandemic abt card. they're asking our office, what to do with that we're encouraging people to go to the website it share my p E Bt calm and they have great suggestions for what you can do with your abt card. and i've two upcoming votes that are very challenging and would welcome feedback from all of you, you can email me at Helen. Helen Rosenthal com we have the vote on tweaking the chokehold bill and the vote on industry city. i am leaning to know on both of those issues. but i welcome feedback from the community to hear your input on this and actively investigating and questioning people. why should i vote yes so i welcome your feedback about that. and lastly, our offices working as, you know, full time remotely we're helping people get food through the get food program. so many people are getting eviction notices our offices working very hard to try to help people stave that off. and we're working very hard. i'll be it remotely anyone to feel free to reach out to our office encourage you to sign up to get our emails. at Helen.

September 14 in the afternoon. we'll be sending out an email with more information. and if anybody wants to volunteer, you can contact my office. it was very successful last time. and we're just trying to continue getting those census numbers higher for the reporting. we are doing a virtual blood drive this month with the New York's blood center their blood supply is down about 75% because of the events they typically hold at schools businesses. and other in person mobile drives are not currently happening due to cove i d. so we are asking people to go online and try to find their nearest center so that they can donate blood, if they are able to they're opening up more of their centers as things are getting a little bit better in the city with Covid-19 and it's all over New York state. so even if you are quarantining with family in another part of the state, you can still find a nearby center. and then we are also going to be doing an event with the Food Bank of New York city on September 24 and that's going to be at Lincoln Center. but anybody can come, they'll be giving out pantry boxes of food. and assembly member bows and fall will be distributing hand sanitizer and masks and other p supplies on site that day. so if anybody has any questions, i will put my information in the chat again here. and please feel free to reach out to me for anything. thank you, emily, i do not believe we have representatives with us tonight from either state Senator lose Kruger District Attorney Cyrus vance or public advocate Jimani Williams. am i correct if you're here from one of those offices, would you please let us know. our elected. so we're not speaking tonight but you know our ubiquitous representatives. Carl Wilson from Corey Johnson's office Matt Ty from Deke Godfrey, it's office are with us. as always, and you heard from Luke well from Controller Stringers Office earlier. that concludes the elected officials reports, i am now going to go to the single most important person in the whole wide world my district manager Jesse Bo Dean. evening everyone. thank you very much law. i'll let your kids know about that. very quickly, i'll be very quick because i know we've been here for quite a long time. so i'll skip through most of this you know what we're working on in terms of public safety and street issues regarding the temporary homeless shelters, the chronic homeless on the street. the encampments we're working with multiple agencies multiple elected officials multiple local nonprofits on a number of different initiatives. so that's all happening. i'm also working hand in hand with our local superintendent about illegal dumping. we all know that there's a huge cost to sanitation and so we were trying to mitigate some of that. i do think that is something maybe collectively. i know there's a lot of initiatives out on the street. block by block cleanups. i think that is something we can explore more as a board. i think that'd be really helpful because we're i think we're in for a very long and dirty year we are holding a second tenants rights information session that is going we're sort of sponsoring at HCC is going to be doing most of the moderating and panel. they're going to have a number of tenant attorneys there to answer questions to present on what's going on currently. what are the trends, what's happening, what are your rights, that's going to be on September 15 at 6 pm the registration can be found on our homepage. just so you're aware, to get back to the budget, a little bit. so our board on all community boards have took a cut in their budget of around$ 8,000 for the year i know that sounds very small compared to some of the numbers that precedent, we're talking about, but just so you understand where that where that ends up from our end is that right now that's requiring us to reduce a part time employee from three days to two until we get some more clarity as to what the budget will look like. a Cb for office space update. we're still all working remotely, the agreement for new office space is making its final, final passage through the approval process at City Hall. and then for September committee updates and board reminders. so Monday, September 7 the office will be closed. for the holiday ACES committee will be meeting on Monday, the 14th and the exact committee will be meeting on Tuesday, September 28 all other communities will be meeting at the regular time and dates. and that is about it. if, same question or anything like that. thank you, Jesse Chicken Sec know how i feel i'm next up on the agenda is the chair report, it is September, believe it or not, which means we've got two things going on that i need to address first see before elections, yes. it is that time again. we do this annually. Paul Devlin has graciously agreed to chair the Nominating Committee, the other committee members are Christine birthday Viren Brahmbhatt else or a Gadsden Cleveland Sabrina Reverend Hector Vasquez and Rob Walker. if anyone is interested in running for any of the executive committee positions Chair. first Vice Chair second vice chair either of the two coasts secretaries, please send an email to Jesse within the next two weeks, indicating your interest in running the current officer slate is not restricted from running again i am running again. i believe the rest of the Executive board is planning on running again but they will let you know. but please let Jesse know if you are interested in running. the other thing we do, since it's September is it's almost budget time the statement of district needs process kicks back off again. Jessica is our second vice chair will be chairing the budget task force and we are working on ideas to streamline the process, especially given what we heard from the comptroller's office earlier. that we will probably have advice for the committee chairs before your committee meetings as to how to go about this. but otherwise, it's the same process. as always, where we need your input to create the statement of district needs. small meetings that have taken place, even though we do not meet in August as a full board, especially this year things did not stop and i've not been going on our normal monthly cadence. but things are that are progressing. we have the housing, health and Human Services committee special shout out to Maria or cheese. Co chair of that committee which over suture. and the staff and everyone else who's been involved about the shelter issue we are continuing to work with Corey Johnson's office with Gail Brewers Office. we are trying to get the department of homeless services to limit what's going on West 36 street where they their lack of foresight is in the process of destroying a couple of block neighborhood there. the Clinton hell's kitchen Land Use Committee chaired by John Daniel Nolan is continuing to work with rats and etc for an upcoming mueller process that's on slaughterhouse, and some other sites, the transportation committee and the Chelsea land use committee. Paul Devlin Betty Mackintosh Christine retail to Hell Corvino and our first vice chair Jeffrey left Francois have meeting with Cb five and with the regional Plan Association regarding the empire station complex project and that has been ongoing in August, the port Authority Working group continues to work with port authority on a redesign on the ACES committee. has been working and these, these are the new the new business letters that are going to come up out of ACES that you will hear more about, but i want to single out the work of Leslie because Ian Murphy and Josephine ish month we've gone above and beyond the call in trying to solve problems that the administration has not even solved yet. but you'll hear about that when we get to those letters i already mentioned that Leslie has taken over as the new co secretary because of Maria's professional obligations and then on a personal note, i just want to thank all of you who reached out to me on my mom's passing a couple of weeks ago that does it for the chairs report. i'm going to. yes, Jesse. someone is leaving our board. oh, i'm sorry. i forgot. Patty carnival is is, as has also said she is going to step down due to professional obligations and we thank Patty, for her service. her position probably will not be filled until next spring through the regular cycle process. so we'll be operating at 49 instead of 50 but thank you again. patti for your service. Jesse i miss anything else. that's it. alright, then we're going to move into the business session. the only committee that regularly meets during August is the business licensing and diverse community. because drinking does not stop, especially in this day and age. Mr Lazarus. as co chair of the committee is going to present the four letters, Bert. seeing that we bundle the four letters. does anyone have one with a backyard. the other one is going from a wine and beer to a full liquor license as Don Giovanni two, number three and four are two new establishments one with a wine and beer and one with a full liquor license. there was not too much talk at them at the meeting. and so i'd like to bundle in and bring them up for a vote. now lol you are muted. i'm talking to myself and saying lol you're muted. does anyone have any questions on any of these four letters. speak now alright, we are going to i think we could probably just do a voice vote on this, since there are no questions and they are non controversial. all those in favor, say aye or raise your hand on the bundle. ay, if anyone is opposed. please say Nay. okay, you're still going to have to fill that all out on your vote sheets, but those for pass. all right, we're going to go. that concludes Logan, i just get Majestic Mike and Leslie Saturday, just to confirm this one case there's any are moving very quickly. is there any other votes. besides, Yay or Nay. does anyone know i'm sorry, anyone. i'm saying or present not eligible on any of these items. i'm sorry, Jesse. alright, hearing none, please remember to fill that out. and it's all got to match up or Mike nobody's going to have my head. as i was saying, that concludes the regular committee business. we have five new business letters that came out of the month of August. i want to say a word about process. so we do not have to get bogged down on process. the decision was made, none of these have been heard by a public forum, yet this is the public airing of these letters, as i said earlier, these letters have all been available to the public. nobody chose to spoke to speak about them during the public session with the exception of Mr Ingram on the letters concerning him. week, we can look at these letters are not ripe for sending now. and send them back, if that's what people want to do the decision was made, given the timing, particularly on the to do. he letters that these were time sensitive and needed to be brought to the boards attention. these things are not going through our normal monthly cadence with the letters regarding the opening of the schools. if we sent it to ACES in September, we'd be sending letters to do we, at the beginning of October about schools that open two weeks earlier. so we decided to bring these all through as new business that was the decision that was made. if you want to criticize the process, that's fine. but here's where we are. so i'm going to start with. item number five. which is a letter from the balanced business task force that we reinstituted back in June, due to the Covid-19 crisis, Bert shared that task force and they have a letter with recommendations, but would you like to address that letter, please. yes, i would. and just within context in this letter derives from what we heard the task force at a public forum which was advertised. we had panelists on the people here tonight were on the panel. and we had attendance and people back and forth questions. and the letter you have before you asks for consideration. of the bullet points. there's a lot of introductory text narrative. what's going on with small businesses, the deaths of many small businesses in Manhattan in the city. the concerns they have the struggles they have and we hearing what many of the small businesses said and what we heard from them. what suggestions came back and forth. we came up with these bullet points. i know some of you have read the letter because all during the day i was getting suggestions modifications friendly amendments, i know, marty. i think has a friendly amendment. i got something from christine, which i think i have cooperated already in or she has some something she might want to add questions. i just want to say one thing, by the way, and online 31 i think the governor should be at it because we talked about this is addressed to the governor, the state legislature. and it's also just in there and the city council people and the borough president but in line 31 in the in the text of the letter we forgot to add the government on that line. so i'd want to put that down there. um, i do have one other bullet point that mark Marty suggested, i do not know, marty. are you here if you want to do it yourself, or i will just take the language that marty came up with. i excuse me. i am here. okay, so i'll leave it up to you to come up with a friendly amendment. but before we come to friendly amendment or not friendly amendment does anybody have any questions. i saw Christine's hand go up and then go down, christine, did you have something you can just shake your head. yes, i do have something go ahead. any was a friendly amendment. i mean, i do not know whether i'm in the right order here, but one thing i wanted to suggest is that to help the small businesses, we asked the city to take responsibility for the sidewalks in front of them right now. the landlord and the retail have to maintain the sidewalks and that's something that changing and i think you would be a great relief for lawsuits, etc. to remove that and put it back on the city. are you okay with that. if christine and i think we agree this it would be put in the language of the letter, which is we want our elected to consider. yes. okay, yes. okay, let me. let me add mine. go ahead, marty. this is in the same spirit of taking pressure off of landlords who are going to get pressure because tenants can't pay their, their rent or maintenance and there are three areas that i would look to that is insurance companies utilities to name to name two of the three that i do not have in front of me so that time the bullet that i would suggest and that burden. i have talked about is time limited modifications. to insurance. to cut workers compensation to electric and water your water rates. sorry, i started through that. but i clear or should i say it again. let's clear i accept it as a friendly amendment. okay, again, i just want to emphasize, we're not saying you should do any of this. i mean, though i have in my opinion. others have their opinions, too, but from while we heard you definitely should consider this to help our small businesses survive going forward. all right. does anyone else have anything else on this letter. any questions, comments amendments thoughts. oh Barry had suggested that we give a title to the letter. to Betty. Betty suggestion was measures to support small businesses. thank you, baby. okay, we are going to not vote on this individually. what i'm going to do is i'm going to go next. and if there's no other questions. i'm going to go next to the two educational letters. and then bundle, those with this one because i think that will let us focus on the social justice. Working group letters separately. so i'm going to go next to the education letters. Christine Sabrina Collin, are you raising your hands about the education letters or about the better the better business letter. better business go ahead, Christine. that's it. all right, you're done. okay, you guys have additional comments on Burt's letter before i move on to well, i just, just a common new regards to what is being set now to advocate for indoor dining i capacity. i do not know if there's something that we want to add. now we want to start thinking about it, or, um, or how we feel. but it's, i know that there's something that it's starting to circulate among constituents sure you suggesting we add something to the letter on that. yeah, i do not know, it's just, again, this is how the committee me the word feels about this. i mean, again, will be 25% capacity. but i know that at least today. i saw a few even nickel officials advocating for this. i do not know if we want to complicated more or just leave it as bad or be something that maybe start thinking for maybe next month. especially as we know that, you know, winter is coming. and i do not know how are we going to have outdoor dining our business are going to survive without not having this not know if right now is right moment. but it's definitely something that i would like this district. Burgess. is that something you want to add now or do you want to meet number on it. i would not like to edit now, but i think it's very immediate i actually maybe the small business group to come up with something separate i was also thinking, even though it's not traditionally done this way, but maybe be Lp can consider it and come up for October. with the residency. hopefully, actually by October all be settled and our resolution will be necessary. i saw Corey this afternoon came out in support of indoor dining yes, all right column. that bird. thank you for putting together the letter in the round table. i just said one thought. i do not really have fully formed language and obviously you can take it or leave it. if you want, but one thing that i've heard and small business owners would like it was more of a unified front between what the city and the state sets and more certainty in finality. you know, in pronouncements. so i'm thinking for example of my friend, who owns a gym. there was a recent gym announcement, the state said one thing the city came out and said the exact, you know, opposite and it's created a lot of confusion. so that might be something that you'd like to consider for this or for a future letter. no thank you card. there was something on the language, not in the bullet points, but something in the language about clear communication and maybe we could add to that. in terms of the different levels of government. yeah, that's, that's exactly meeting with each other. yes. i'll go back and change that part of a letter. all right. anything else on Pond. this letter. okay. the indoor dining will be taken up separately for next month. Burt we'll figure out the best way to do that. and we're going to move on. now i'm going to move on to the to do he letters and i'm going to go to kit and Alan to figure out how we're going to discuss these well, first of all, thank you for clarifying on these new business letters. i'm going to speak a little bit on the virtual learning and kids going to take on outdoor learning letter. so it's, um, with pleasure that high echo and the remarks that you made in the center made and thank Leslie and Josephine on their work on coming up with this. solution to a, an issue that was a great concern to parents and to teachers. which was also discussed at our education forum and getting the bodies together and moving this along and especially in getting do we to get on board on this at warp speed has been heard. so i'd like to ask Leslie to speak to us about the project and letter and just thank you again. great job. thank you. thank you, everybody. um, i do want to note that Josephine was the primary author of this letter. so i want to give her the credit for that. i'm just presenting and just a actually texted me and said, this actually was born. out of we held committee discussions about this. in general, we held a forum about this in general. and that's where kind of this was narrowed into this initiative. um, we have accepted some friendly amendments to this letter. i do not know if you want me to. well, i guess i will now we're taking out i'm paragraph on page two lines 34 and 39 and then we're just moving a paragraph from page three. lines, six and eight up higher and then some Typos. obviously, i also want to just make a note to Brad Wellman's office specifically my, i do not know if my is on the line. but she was the one that texted me and said, let's do this thing and Brad's office was awesome about it. so i also want to credit them. and i guess i guess that's it unless anyone have any questions about the initiative or anything else. but it's all pretty much stayed in the letter. any questions from anyone about item number eight. all right, let's move on item number nine, then kit. i think Marty's raising his hand. oh i'm sorry, Marty. i did not see thank you. sorry about that. i think it's a wonderful letter and i'm impressed. i do not need to go through all that what's missing from the letter and maybe it's intentional something about safety. teachers and it seemed to me that somewhere, you might insert something about the primary concern of whether it's testing or social distancing it's missing from this, i think, are we talking about this the same letter this letter is about the student teacher virtual learning initiative. that's right. number eight. oh, okay. well, i'm not, i'm not sure. Leslie followed what you were saying, marty. yeah, just what would you suggest marty, and we can put it in. a small statement about making sure that all the participants students and teachers are appropriately tested or some language to that effect. this. this is happening because code is around and you're trying to devise ways to get the support that students and teachers need, but there's no statement about p or testing or something, something of that order short paragraph or short sentence. i could just jump in for one minute. Josephine. so the mayor has said that they all they are not going to require testing for all students and staff that is voluntary. but what they are doing now. is they have a new medical program that they will be mandating testing for 10 to 20% of students and staff at every school, depending on the size of the school so they'll be taking a random sampling i guess the feeling was is that they did not want to test everyone because i mean you could catch it on the way to school, you know, on the subway on the way home. from a family member. so that's what the mayor's put into place. now, and that was accepted by the ufc and that's why they're moving forward to open the schools. just all surgeon very good. awesome already this letter, one at a time when it was my first thing i think it was next. marty just specifically this letter is very, very specific to the remote learning this is this is not has anything to do with the in teacher in building in learning. it's just the virtual learning. that's it. hurts everyone staying at home. so there's nothing. there's no contact or travel to school for this for this piece kit and then Betty. was they said what i was going to say all right, daddy. i've already told me how wonderful. i think this letter is number eight, and i just had a procedural question on eight and i would it be appropriate for a little bit of, you know, community board for voted on the way we have all the other letters, it would that be appropriate. 12 we're going to vote on it tonight. i think it would be we can add that can be added. pretty simple. and yes, we will add that the standard language okay clarifies thank you. Betty. all right, any other questions, just on number eight. hearing none, let's move to number nine, kid. i think you were going to kick this off. yeah, i'll be brief will hit the nail on the head when talking about the timeliness of both these as a rationale and grab it. helped to produce these and was well attended by the public was also brought up. one other piece that i want to make sure folks understand i'm thinking about process here is that Leslie and Josephine. also, we're in direct communication with the dmv about each of these letters. and so, as both a communication input from the most relevant agency. and so that's why we were motivated to do these as new business. and just quickly want to add my name to the Wesleyan Josephine fan club, and this was really fantastic work and much needed by our schools. and so i'll pass it over to Josephine to talk specifically about outdoor learning letter which i really appreciate her taking the lead on, i know that. the principal and others do we, who asked for this and initiated it and teacher thank you. so the letters. pretty self explanatory. i believe we had a caller on earlier from core layers which is actually a private school, but he was talking about how important the outdoor learning is and this letter is not about that at all. whether the whether we should be doing outdoor learning or not. the point is, is that the mayor has already decided that we're doing this and any school that wants to can apply for the program. and then the deal, we will work with all the sister agencies to see if the space is feasible or not. what this letter really is about is the fact that safety issues is it a street crime have not been addressed by the mayor's office or the do eat so they have addressed other issues like if your school is acrosss the street from subway station or on a bus route then that does not, that's not feasible for closing down a street. but how are we keeping kids and staff safe from you know, sort of disorderly conduct on the street or more serious crimes. so this is basically just asking the Dea and someone from the mayor's office to come to our asis meeting, hopefully, in September, we can get someone the earlier, the better and hear about some of the concerns that we have and i did get an email from a principal who said she has applied to this program, but she is concerned about some crime. around the school area that is making that may make this very challenging. so we just want to have representatives come in and talk about what they are doing to ensure the safety of children and teachers and there were a couple of friendly amendments that came in on this as well. yes, there were some yes and most of them will be taken. thank you. all right. does anyone have any questions or comments on letter number nine about security. if people are teaching outside when people are teaching outside, christine. it looks like that letter is not on the voting sheet. so just wanted to flesh that out. oh, Jake's so we should put it in the nine in everyone should add that is number nine, number nine, number nine, just like the beatles said right, that's it. all right, rock show. i'm sorry Buddy. i'll get back to you. i just saw your hand go move rocks. your first yeah, can i get a little bit more context on what the school is currently do for public safety is that usually through nypd, or like private security contracts. well, the school say they have school safety officers so that currently is through nypd, but they do not. it's different. they do not carry weapons or anything like that. but that i think we heard from someone earlier on the budget issues that is remaining with the nypd, so we do not know in terms of what's happening with the outdoor so it's different. yeah. and that you know they're going to need all the bodies that they can inside. so the school safety officers are not going to be able to be outdoors. you know, they just do not have enough people to do that. okay, to study answer their question Betty. i was going to come back to you. yeah, i'm i may be friendly amendment will already be incorporated, but i did feel that it would be nice if the letter could include some positive ideas on how to improve safety and my beef it up a little bit in terms of security staff or signage or some kind of barriers or cones to delineate the school area so that people would know not to be carousing in that particular area. so i, i felt that the part of that mugging three crime was a little heavy in terms of drug life slashing is a big heavy so i suggested softening that up and also having some positive ideas to discuss thank you. Betty, your, your points are well taken. i'm actually taking that part out. i'll just leave it at street crime. i'm not going to include any of those other specifics but on the other matter i specifically did not want to make any recommendations, because this had not gone through the regular process. this is about. first, just having the deal we come to an asis meeting. and then our committee members could talk about discuss whatever recommendations. they want to make can i add on to that josephine. a little bit, yes. i'm just to give everybody a little more context here Josephine. with actually working with me on through the district office reaching out to principles. and this is a project that i'm working on. and many times as we know. and we've seen this throughout the last few months, especially because of the pandemic, you know, we, our office gets contacted by a group of folks that want to help in some way. and so we were contacted by some folks that have the potential to help some of the principles with exactly the things that you're right you're mentioning Betty in terms of barriers intense and things like that. and so you rather than me recreating the wheel. i went to Josephine. who knows, pretty much all the principles by first middle and last name. and has relationships with them. and so she was on working on the actually the district offices be have reaching out to find out information. and that's when the information when principal starts telling her about their concerns about safety. so i just want to give that context we are working on that. and we are talking to the principal's directly as to what they could use and hopefully we'll be able to report on something very shortly. in terms of a really good part. you know, some someone being very nice and volunteering to donate some material for a number of the schools in our district and Josephine was extremely helpful and finding the right schools. right. okay. any other comments on letter. number nine. not seeing any hands move okay, i'm going to ask a question. is it and if anyone has any objection to this. it's fine. but i'm going to propose that we bundle 589 and just do a voice vote because there has not seemed to be in a lot of opposition. and we're still we're already three hours into the meeting if anyone wants for any reason, procedural otherwise us to do a roll call on this. will do a roll call. but if no one has any objection in the interest of time. if people are right with a voice vote. does anyone have any objection to doing a voice vote, i do not care who it is. i do not care what your reason is if you have an objection. just say object and we'll do, we'll move on. once twice. okay, we're going to do this by voice vote. we're bundling items, five, eight, and nine. all those in favor of five, eight, and nine, raise your hand or, say aye. is anyone opposed to these letters. because anyone abstaining. Judith is abstaining. on president not oh, ok. let's look like anyone abstaining on any of these three letters. Rock Show. were you saying something. yeah, i wanted to vote no on letter nine okay, okay. yes, on the other 2919 that's fine. um, any abstentions anywhere. anyone present not eligible Judith is present not eligible on eight and nine. anyone else okay, those carry then please mark your vote sheets. okay. give me just one second. hello. yes. anybody have any questions, and i apologize. about the vote sheet not being up to date, but does anybody have any questions on what they should be writing into number nine. yes. okay, what's your question. Carrie. what should i be writing into number nine. my question was a stupid question. so the two motions, the first portion of the meeting. i'm sorry, Paul, what should we in the new business should we put into that line the motion that should be that should be added as a line item like Paul, i got it, i got it. item number nine should be letter note number nine on your vote sheet that should be added in. what Paul is saying is we need to add in an item 10 which was the roll call vote. we took earlier on the agenda. right. Paul did i get that right. yes. okay. oh, okay. as long as it's clear on your vote sheet i will buy Michael and Leslie drinks when they figure this out. we never vote, we never put the vote on the voting sheet for the agenda. right, but we get a roll call for christine okay not making the first day easy little we did a roll call. so it should be reported. alright, we are going to move on to item six and seven. i'm sorry, i've got one who's not who's not ready to move on. go ahead, Mike. all right, so what do we put in for number nine. number nine is letter number nine letter to do we re security open street school program. item number 10 on the vote sheet is the motion to drop items from the agenda. oh, is that clear. yes. can i move on, marty. what's up, you're on mute. or it is not clear item. item number 10 on the boat sheet as my name and i and that should be mine. i actually, sorry. can i Jesse overrule me. go ahead. yeah, i'm going over when we say what i did. wait, Marty Legit Jesse's going to solve this lip Jesse Soften. that's what he gets paid for fixing my mistakes. i disagree with, with the idea that we agree with. so never vote on our vote sheet about the agenda. so there was an amount. there was an amendment to change the change the agenda, it failed. it was it'll be recorded in the minutes, the agenda was admitted was voted on as is. and i do not think you need to put it into the individual both sheets. okay, fine. even better. i was trying to be more i know i hear you. yeah. we did a roll call. i thought it should be recorded somewhere if you're telling me we have a we have a visual recording of it and we have Mike nobles. all right. and now in the answer to James. well, this is question number nine is letter number nine letter to do era security for open streets school program. there is no item number 10 i was wrong. i thought we needed it. i'm told we do not. there is no number nine. yes. item number nine in new business. okay. now for the main event 15 rounds of boxing. i see two different issues here that have been raised and may need to be discussed. the first issue is should we be addressing this letter at all right now. and then the second these letters. and then the second issue is if we are going to address these letters. now what should they say, are we adopting them as is because i already know people have comments on the letters themselves if we decide to send them. i'm thinking we should discuss them one at a time and not bundle them. but, if any, again, i'm open to suggestions on the best way to do this. Paul your hand is up. thanks, a little, um, so my feeling is that on the first letter. addressing the August 7 incident on that we should move forward with the letter. it's very timely and that incident happened on my block i live directly acrosss the street from the building. i was home during the entire incident, the police line was outside of my building. i could not leave my building during that entire day because of the police presence. and i think that derek presented a very strong argument and Brad Wellman reinforced it an important issue for me. that derek as a young black man alone in his apartment with police outside the door counting on it. if he was not educated enough to slide a note. out of the door saying, where is the warrant and opened up the door. he might very well have been the next Eric Garner in New York City. and if you think about the global mantra on police brutality started here with the killing of Eric Garner. that man lives acrosss the street from me was afraid to open his door to police officers. that is unacceptable. and we should not be living in a society like that and i'm embarrassed that we're thinking about a procedural reason for not sending a letter without outrage and that it's appalling to me. and the second thing is that i'd like to add a line to that letter to ask the New York Police Department. how many other vip ioc members of our community have been arrested without warrant and have been pulled in, like them. i think it's an atrocious activity. so i really think that we need to take a stand on this very quickly, very vociferously alright. Paul. just give me one second. i'm going to ask you to hold the comments on the addition to the letter. for a second, keep addressing whether or not they should be said okay, i was done, i was done with my reasoning, why on and i think on the second letter now with facial recognition. that's a much more complicated issue. i think we can table. i went for further discussion. okay, Katie. had to unmute myself. um, i also hope that we will discuss it this evening and vote on the letter. and i think it's really important to acknowledge a little bit, the history first. so the social justice Working Group was formed, as we all know, in June. for our community board and we met multiple times this summer to address the way our black and brown community members are treated and police accountability was one of the primary issues that came up in many of our meetings and then this incident happened on August 7 and it received not only national attention and local attention we heard from several community board members about it. and that's actually how it got raised to the co chairs. and i think it's really important that we take this opportunity. especially because, frankly, we know that Gil Brewers Office has already written a letter requesting more information about it, as we heard this evening Brad's office has done the same. i think it would be really unfortunate for us. to not be willing to immediately address an issue that affects one of our community board members. and to sort of postpone it yeah, i just think that would be unusual. i also think it's really important to know again that this is the whole issue of accountability about how decisions are made within the police structure is one of the main issues that we discussed already on the social justice. Working group only have plenty of evidence that this is a shame. so i hope that we will address this, this evening, and we're certainly open to any you know comments on the letter. David, Warren. Dish thank you for this report, i agree with you and everyone else there's one thing that people forget. again, it might this might be a digression might be for another time. but the financial cost and cost to have all those beautiful people there over time and all that we could have created a recreation program a homeless youth with that money. so the Financial i'd like to know what it costs to no matter day but that's in the letter, David. okay, i did not see that one. okay, so thank you stand corrected Sideways type Brett. very and i'll get i'll get you in a minute. Brett. okay. yeah, thank you. so i'm just first you know my sleep is not a reflection of my opinions that support the need for justice and accountability. from our elected officials and public servants. some i'm commenting on the letter for item number six. as it is written, and i would likely feel differently about the letter for written very different tone. so there is a inherent bias in the letter. the leading questions at the top of the letter are appropriate. and alone or not object objectionable. i think the final paragraph that reveals this letter is a, it's a political document. it's a blatant statement with the verdict against the NYPD before receiving a response to the question is the letter poses. i'm making obvious that the responses to the questions are not really important around read it. Brett. can i interrupt you for one sure. you're going into content of the letters and i want to stay focused at first on the idea of sending the letters i will come back to content. i will come in and make the same point. sure. no, i mean, i think i what i'm, what i'm saying. it's sort of the, the lead up to. i'm not. i do not think it should be sent. okay, i'm sorry. so, so i think there's, there's a lot of rhetoric in the in the letter that would be different if we have a public conversation. you know, if we were true to the process of asking questions to get information are, you know, rather than being the judge and jury without hearing the witnesses, including the defense. i think we've got to be careful and i disagree with the approach of using this respected community board, which has a very hard reputation for fairness. and objective advocacy for the needs of our neighbors and the district's it's really as it's written. it's a blunt instrument. in a political oregon's police. so i think what we really should be doing, you know, again, i'm not saying that Mr him does not have a case, you know, his testimony very clearly is very courageous and it raises issues that we should be engaging but as the way the writers letters written it, it feels more like a soapbox rather than an objective conversation. and that's my concern about sending the letter, the way we have it without the benefit of hearing a broader conversation and getting more opinions about what it is that we need to say all right, Brett. i'm going to ask you a point plant question if the letter were tone down. how would you feel i think if it was about the questions that we raised up front. we want to get information. you know, i still have concerns about the precedent sense it sets, but given the live in the issue, the questions i think are legitimate, we want to we want to know what has happened in our district. it's the last paragraph that you know uses words like heavy handed totalitarian shocking when we have not had responses. that's the part that really raises alarm bells with me since we really are a community board that's known for having a level headed approach to negotiating diplomacy and if we have letters that are going out like this that are filled with very volatile language without getting the right kind of without getting any response. we're really not showing that we're asking question that we want to know, and we're asking for transparency, we're basically saying we've come to come to a conclusion. this is how we feel and we have not really brought into the conversation we just, this is what we're saying. and that's that i do not think is, is historically who the community board has been, and that's the, that's the part that yeah, i think the idea of putting something together and you know there are emotions. i think these are all important things. and i do not want to invalidate that i just want to say that it's not a procedural reason why we would want to send it back. it's more to make sure that what we are saying really is representative of our community board representing a diverse community. brad. can i ask a general question. i think this may be goes to what Lowell just asked, but you have a conversation. hang on, hang on, hang on. Katie, ask your question. i'm just wondering, to just clarify. i think this is what you were suggesting will and i prettify understood you know, i want to be clear, i was not suggesting anything. i was asked. i was trying to understand what Brett was saying. i hope i guess my question, Brett, would it help would it help address what you just said if the first sentence of the last paragraph was removed. all right, Katie. you're not getting into content. i'm not ready to get into college yet. okay. all right, i'm going to viren next my quickly Paul mentioned about the second letter being i think that actually is a bigger issue, and it's a good for everybody because you're talking about surveillance capitalism. here we're talking about how do i put this we talking about no oversight about how they're being surveyed. i do know that because of the protests. police have been given NYPD has been given much more leeway in terms of how they collect information, who keeps the database, how the information is actually used facial recognition is just one part of it. so the second letter actually goes back to a breath for both be asking them, what is it, how are you using it. how are you collecting the data. where does the data reside. and i think via the community that i do know because more often than not, when we talk about traffic cameras and you talk about surveillance cameras on our blogs, we become the willing victim. but if we do not know how police are in my pd can access that information. then it becomes problematic when it gets us in a particular way. so going back to your question that the freedom walking out on the streets precisely why we should be asking that question and sending the letter. alright Kit i see your hand. Jd, i'll get to you get your try to be quick. so first one to say loud and clear that i share the outrage that call communicated happened history room is totally unacceptable. the reason why and appreciate what beer and Katie said as well. the reason why i think it's important. this not get discussed about it on tonight because i think that outrage that i feel and i imagine many other folks on the community board feel is an exclusive to us. and there's an opportunity for this to be a public conversation that the public engages in with us and i think not Mr connected that but along with that, and we would be remiss not to engage with the NYPD on the front end of taking a stance on something this high stakes. you know, who knows where we would land after me engaged with the public. and with the NYPD on with the languages are the list of questions. it's longer or shorter, but the folks who are on the community board in my personal opinion. should not be the end all be all decision makers on something that's this high stakes and that many people have very valid really critical perspectives and we have not heard from you. so that's why i supported doors is motion and i hope other folks will consider what i'm saying. all right, James Wallace. i guess first just as a point of order before i make my point. it sounds like we're discussing if you could clarify we're discussing whether or not we should send the letters which yes. seems like that was this, we're talking about moving the item. are we just like relitigating this know, because what we said when i, when we were addressing well, so i'm echoing i'm hearing somebody else's. i'm sorry. we said that part of the reason there were people who voted to keep it on the agenda to have this discussion now. and we said that we would discuss now whether or not we would send it. yes, the vote may come out the same way you are right. but part of the reason, some people may have voted to keep it on the agenda was to have this discussion tonight. i kind of putting it all off. okay. thank you for clarifying. so with that, i will say, i'm going to try to avoid discussion of the content. the, the challenge we have here is that this board does have a history. of approving letters that are required because of regulatory or legal requirements and they're passed by executive committee and then ratified. however, this is not one of those letters and i even though you know we can have a discussion about content because some of the things, Brett says i think made sense. and some of them might disagree with. and this is very important and timely it's timely because it's in the news. the fact is that the event is done. and now, there needs to be an investigation that investigation can happen next week, or it can happen next month. so the public comment should happen. i requested to be on the social justice working group when it was brought up in a meeting and i requested it via email. and i was not for whatever reason invited to attend. i was not aware that they occurred. so now this letter comes out. and although it's well intended. i absolutely would have commented on the tone, so that we would get a more balanced response. what happened to Mr Ingram based on one side of the facts. sounds perfect and reprehensible. but again, where the Community Board. we're not his legal representation and we need to make sure that as a community board that they continue to take us seriously and not think that we're just reactionary i will go in favor of the letter with changes when it comes up, but i think we need public discussion and public all right, i want to apologize to you for not being included, i do not know what happened. i will kind of 30 lashes for the district manager with a wet noodle for that one. i'm sorry. James will make sure you're included going forward. Jd known yeah, i want to comment on a couple things. i do not mind if the letter is voted on, if it's down, much to the recommendation of Brett Pfeiffer, i want to say one thing, i believe. Katie made a comment about the new to the board. well, i'm old to the board. maybe too old to the board. this is very, very disturbing to me. i do not think anybody is unconcerned about what happened to Mr Finger. in fact, last month at the big time North Precinct Community Council police Midtown north or raked over the coals because of this incident on 45Th street. i did not see anybody there from the Social Justice Committee. i did not see that but that was the forum to take the cops to test it turns out big town north had nothing to do with this. this is some kind of other unit that does this. they did not go after him specifically apparently they do this in Brooklyn, they do it in Bronx. it may be wrong. it may be terrible. we should bring that up. absolutely. secondly, Mr Ingram was invited to speak tonight. nobody else was invited to speak. apparently, Mr. Ingrid injured a police officer. i do not know entirely the details or who's right or who's wrong. but there was an incident and i suppose there will be some kind of trial of whatever it is that was not brought up, why not. there was a cop who was injured. was she contacted was she invited to speak. the problem is we are i think all on the same side about these kinds of incidents, they should not occur, but the problem is and this is because i've been too long of the board. my feeling is, we should not be in a little bubble up here speaking for the community without hearing from the community. at that meeting a big town north most everybody agreed that it was excessive at the same time they wanted to work with a police to try to solve these problems. i would recommend strongly that the Social Justice Committee, sit down with a couple of us on the community who have been fighting these issues for many years, and who are now being alienated from the community board because of your excessive rhetoric in these letters. i'm in sympathy with you. i think we agree with this needs to be changed, but it's not only the process. it's the public presentation and it's not reaching out to many members of our community. whoa. please have a couple of a sit down with some Block Association President to try to talk about this so we can work together, but the Social Justice Committee is causing a great deal. of Agita in their community. they are not reaching out to all of the community. and i hear you. jd that goes beyond this, i understand what you're saying that goes beyond the scope of the letters and just in the interest of time, i'll tell you that we will bring that up at exec at the end of the month. i want to stick to the letters. i just want to respond to one thing you said because i made this point earlier when i introduce Mr Ingram. the reason he was invited is because the social justice. Working group ask that he'd be invited. that's why i extended that invitation. no one said anything. about inviting the cop or anyone else. i was not aware of it. i am not sitting as a member of that working group. i was following the request to the committee chairs. and i, and i stand behind it. and i think what he said tonight was appropriate, i realized it's not the whole story. but i just want to address that point since you're questioning what i did and that's my answer. i'm going to move on from there to Bird Lazarus. he lives in our Community board area. all right, all right. oh, sorry, one Sec bird. yes. i want to echo what Paul was saying, starting out, not only was he terrified of the incident, he's talked to us and told us. he's terrified. now he's traumatized. okay, that i think is also important, what you said. Jd about a wider conversation. i think that's critical as well a wider conversation pulling many, many constituents in that's important dialogue and conversation. i think it's also important. to have this letter go out this letter is asking, we can talk about the language and Modify or not. but it's important to get this letter out now and call for an investigation and support an investigation that's what's critical right now in this first letter. to Loris hi. so i just wanted to make clear for those that think that the reason why i proposed the motion for the agenda is on procedural alone. most of what Jd said speaks to what my concerns are. the most important thing is not a single person from the social justice Working group came to Midtown North's meeting, i was the person there because i was hosting the meeting. but the truth is, we had a good number about 40 different residents folks that actually live on the block like Paul that express their outrage and their concerns. they were speaking directly to their needs, but they also spoke about their outrage and their concerns about the flash mob that showed up on the block. we are focused on one person who has been violated in terms of his, his rights without a warrant. that's true. but again, we're taking only one side of the story. and that puts us as a board in a political box. this is not what we should be doing. this is not our mandate, i respect that. you said that you was requested that we invited by the Social Justice Committee, there's no reason for us to be requesting anyone to come speak to us that is being investigated. if somebody comes to this board on their own and says, i need help. you're the board. how do i do this. that's, that's one thing but our outreach specifically has now politicized us that's a problem because it reduces our respect from other agencies and how effective, we can be as a board to advocate for an entire district. that is why i'm very concerned about these letters going out. it's not the procedural we have not allowed an entire public discussion to understand what are all the things happening here. police concerns, but also flash mobs that showed up on that block. Paul, i do not know if that was a concern of yours as well. but i know that at least two people at that police Precinct council meeting were very frightened by the fact that hundreds of people showed up and cause that incident to be longer than it needed to be well, thank God. thank God. they show it out. all right, all right. i'm not i'm not going to allow anyone to come in here. i'm going to shut this all down. if anyone interrupts we're having a civil discussion here. no one's interrupting. dolores please finish. we can not solve systemic racism on our own. but what we can do is be responsible to our community at large, which means we need to include these voices. we need to be responsible how include the voices. that is what my concern is thank you, Leslie. i'm again, i'm not going to get into the content of the letter. i'm going to echo what Jd and dolores said. just on the point of i was also at the Community Council meeting when the police spoke about this and they were to police groups involved. one was Midtown north who was there and one was warrants is the one that executed this whole fiasco. if you want to call it that. my question though is to both to katie and viren i'm just to be clear. because i got two calls from high ranking police officers from Midtown north today. saying no one even asked us about this, let no one, we would have talked to you guys, we would have told you what happened. we were open to communication. so i just want to ask you guys just to make sure. did either of you or anyone on the board. i'm sorry, the social justice. Working group contact the police that were involved are the two departments that were involved to incorporate them or i do not know where they contact, because i know they have spoken publicly on this and directly with the community. i know we did not because, well, actually. do you want to tell you why, or should i just say yes or no. no, i'm just, i just, i just do not want to take one side over the. i just want to make sure it's clear if there's a if there's a reason that was discussed why you did not care. here with us, please. so we actually we do not want to be the courtroom for this, this actually for us was not about this. particular incident. it's about the whole issue of accountability about where decisions are made, there's been a there's a strong belief on the social justice working grip and what we heard raised through the summer about the fact that decisions are made. nobody ever knows who made them. and that there needs to be a wade, we in the public can get information for our constituents. and so we wanted this is a letters. you can see it's actually not to Midtown north. that's not towards it's actually to the city Council, it's just about overall using this as a specific example but just overall how our decisions made, what is the cost that sort of thing. so anyway, so it was not. we did not think it was appropriate to have this be a forum about this specific issue. it's about the issue of who's making decisions and that sort of thing. so i understand that it is that when you i think when the language that was you that makes total sense. but when the inflammatory language that's used as Brett was saying, then i think maybe there is an obligation to ask for the other you know the other party. i do not know. okay. thank you, Leslie Joe Restitution. so first, i think that what happened to our neighborhood Eric Ingram was horrible. and the police our fault period. but how we respond to it talks about our community. and what we could possibly do. so i must say the letter i think the board already had a discussion with us to discuss this tonight or not. i want to say now, i believe these letters should go out tonight. but these letters should go out in a way that actually portrays the board that we are and katie i want to say to you is we use so many specifics about our neighbor. we should be talking about how are hardly our neighbor was treated and how it should be investigated as to the treatment that he received in the problem is it's not just to the city council but also to the Pdf. the mayor's office, it should be broader because any investigation is going to be at multiple levels, not just City Council. i also recommend when we get to that point. some amendments that will just try to clarify it because it does feel way too much of rhetoric, as opposed to one of our neighbors was treated horrifically and this should be investigated immediately and just he's, he's a black lives matter person. he's in our neighborhood that's the most important part and that's crazy at this happen in our neighborhood on our watch. so if that's where we are today that two thirds of our board said let's go ahead and do it. let's do it. but i want to say one thing i say is that it's a little before the process here has to be going forward public because that's the bigger rub here. it's not public. we do not get the full discussion with everybody. and then these letters become much more not even balance, like they get crafted Warren. that's my real thought about it, but i want to say let's vote tonight. let's really practice. thank you Joe else or did you want to say something you were speaking before good. okay, i'm sorry to sound. yeah, i mean, i definitely i voted to not have it on the agenda, actually, by voting yes, i believe. and that was because i strongly believe in protocol and the public should have been included. however, having taken a vote in that not passing i to believe these letters should go out you know, just to me it's a little insensitive to say that we need to be to just make them both the letters more sensitive. let's just make the letters make sense and be honest and speak truth about not soften it up because people's feelings will be hurt. let's send out a strong letter that makes sense that speaks to the fact that a member of our community. was treated this way. the research or whatever information that our, our team could find reflects that he was in his right to do the things that the way that he did at his home, you know, i'm not sure how when he was accused of plagiarism a role into what happened legally or illegally in our community if it was not him. if it was someone else did they use the proper procedures. what is the cost of the procedure that they use that we do not believe was a valid legal process. i mean, we're getting ready to cut salaries for our community board. we could very well have paid for those act that extra day of our employees working with the amount of money they just wasted on something that may have been done illegal illegally. if we do not want to accuse that we have the right to have the right questions answered. i'll stop there. i believe it should come to the vote. Betty your next, i'm sorry. i was on mute Petty Macintosh. thank you, Sir. okay, um, i am glad that i heard Mr Ingram's experience described i guess in a blended Brett said to take out that last paragraph. i was initially in favor of withdrawing this letter but i guess i would like it to be more balanced in the sense of like one of my questions to the police, is why is there something that we do not know about mystery that precipitated the police act in such a massive intensive way i'm just, i'm just saying, you know, is there something that we do not know, and, and the letter. i mean, i feel uncomfortable that we do not have the police saying their position about why they did what they did. so i wish the letter would have something that would indicate lot. why did they do such a show of force, if it was granted that there was something that Mr Ingram did which was i guess shout in a megaphone at the ear of a police woman and her and so way physically. and i think that should be maybe acknowledged in the letter that he did do something. apparently so. that's, that's where i come out and i was Minister. has not been a public discussion. thank you. Betty Michael Noble everybody that this is a terrible thing that happened. i still do believe as was mentioned, we've got, you know, the way we usually do things, is not this way. it should send a letter around the city Council. less rhetoric less political about that final paragraph. of the next letter. however, on by the way you know you say you asked Derek Ingram in at the behest of the social justice working that's the dog wagging the tail wagging the dog there. for us to go out and pick people on the community to come speak to us. well, as was noted is part of investigation by the voice is inappropriate. i just can't do it. too much rhetoric too much politics in that letter. the next letter to commissioner shape. it's not a letter. it's an indictment. it's a subpoena, written by an investigative legislative body. okay. do you expect him to answer those questions now way. i mean, why even bother. to tell you the inner workings of the police department with respect to facial recognition for the love of God, nobody on earth has gotten that question answered anywhere. federal level staver nowhere. it's not going to tell you we're wasting our time with that one. what the first one. go tone it down and that'll be the end of it. that's my feeling thank you. absolutely. the last one you just forget him. let's not do that anymore. that is an embarrassed. i'm back to tell you to embarrass we're not the legislature. here we're advisory body. all right, that's questions we can present things, bring the community together but no better like that. all right. thank you, Maria Sabina looks like right well you Britain. yes, thank you. all right. i think your point. i think you made your point, christine. you're on. i'm on. okay. yes. okay. um, i think a lot of really very thoughtful things have been said by a lot of people it seems that the, i think the first letter should go out because it's urgent that we get answers. it's about in my mind. it's about accountability. a local cuisine does not have the information to respond to that and i think the last paragraph could be much improved, as many have said, Brett and others, and i want to talk about a little bit about the fight facial recognition. something that Mr in Graham said was that his picture and i do not know whether it's true or not, has been sent around for facial recognition for the other prisons and if it's true. you know, i mean, i do not want anybody else in the city to have an excuse to resting somewhere and take some drastic action. so that's the part of the facial recognition that i think is, is a little concern there how it's being used to around somebody was already accepted his penalty. so i would definitely recommend that the first letter goes out and maybe, you know, a second one in a different way. thank you, christine hector. okay mom has been set tonight. as a active participant in the social justice work through it. i do agree with the majority of folks that the last paragraph is a little heavy handed, so to speak, um, look, the police procedures are obviously been misused, especially in this case there's a breakdown there. so the point that he brought up about the procedure using facial recognition. i believe it should not left in it because obviously if you ignore something that was abused in whatever way if it was abused allegedly um, that needs to be investigated. somebody needs to bring it up. and if we ignore that fact, along with any of the other procedures that happened. at this incident, then it can happen again, and the it'll just get any worse. unfortunately, and nothing will change. um, it was horrible. what happens in the same room, i would not wish that on anybody was terrific. but we also need to investigate for us to why it happens. so i think there's a lot of validity in this letter. is it heavy handed the end. i think it's been mentioned already, we need to modify that. i was one or ones that wanted to hopefully bring this back to the present have the public speak on this a little bit more and get some feedback as well. fortunately down voted. i understand that. so we're just going to proceed, but it would be helpful to hear from the public as well, especially to get more input on this. and i'm pretty much, you know, i've been very properly. so in the fat in the past the military myself and working with the police officers of all walks, but i'm really surprised that somebody excuse the expression to mess up. they've been doing lately concerning procedures and i think that's a big problem. so i think this letter. addresses, a lot of it does not need to be modified possibly toned down maybe more professional. reflects what the community board for is done in the past. yes, i believe that, but i think it still needs to send a strong message as well. so i would not turn it down so much that it's effective. and that's my feeling on it. thank you, doctor. thank you. Maria hey, thanks though. um, i wanted to be honest, i really want to say a lot it's after 10 so i'm not going to say a whole lot the most important things that i, i just want to share a highlight is there was a Midtown south yes precinct meeting that i was involved with, i do not know. Jd and the loris if that's the meeting that you were referencing but i'm part of the social justice Working Group and i was present in that meeting. i did hear people take the officers to task. i did not say anything because i felt it. it was not necessary. the officers that were being taken to task were not the ones who made the decision or approve the decision. and the other thing i wanted to add is that i did see the letter beforehand and email. and i did make comments to the letter like Brett, i also did feel that some of the tone of it was particularly at the end. like he pointed out was not neutral and or accusatory for lack of a better word, and i'm used to letters from us being more neutral. however, i also agree with Paul about how he feels about this having happened to someone in our community. which leads me to say that in the end, i really just agree with Joe and Aozora that it should go out today and i do like Joe's idea about it being a strong letter, but about somebody in our community. and what happened to him in our community that was not okay and i have a question, just because i do not understand the reason that even though i said i want it to go out today. i am not entirely clear why it has to go out today versus in four weeks. i do not know that there's actually an answer to that maria that's it, that's a, that's a feeling question, more than anything, how urgently. do you feel this needs to be addressed. i, that's the best i can give us an answer from where i'm sitting. i do not know if you're in katy have any other thoughts. i'm going to let them wrap up at the end. and they can address that i'm going to keep this moving the rock show and to me, the two letters feel like real call to get NYPD which is something tonight, when we had the csp earlier in the meeting and you know, the first letter is a lot of questions that we would like answered. the second is a chance for NYPD had Chris present on their facial recognition technology. i think that because of all the effort, we're putting in to get NYPD to come to the table and answer our questions. we do have a responsibility to get the other side, quote unquote, whether that's giving the public a chance to weigh in on both these letters or by having another group also do a presentation on facial surveillance or something like that. so i'm going to be personally voting against. voting on these without public presentation, but if we do i think that it would be great to balance it out by having other people answer questions and be part of the roundtable conversation and not just NYPD telling us their side of it. thank you, Russia, Josephine. just wanted to add that, you know, i was one of the people on in the anti racist groups working group that wanted to have Mr Ingram speak. simply because he is a constituent. he is a resident here. and so it was not about him versus not having the police talk about what happened. it was about he is a constituent here, he should come and tell us what's happening if he chooses to and i reach out to the school community all the time to parents or parents who do not even know that we exist. the Community Board or what we do. so it was really more about that process and letting him know that listen we're here. we are a community board. we would like to know. what happened. i mean, it's a lot has been written in the press. we just want to know. so it's not that we do not want to hear from the other side, this was sort of like a beginning of the conversation and the questions i think are something that needs to be asked, and i, you know, i'm not going to address a lot of the language in the letter, i think, you know, as a lot of people stated that last paragraph can easily just drop off and we could focus on the questions, but i just want let people let people know this is why we initiated this we wanted him to come as a constituent of see before. thank you. Alan thank you. so i think it's important that we do get this letter out as soon as possible. i think waiting you lose momentum going into another new cycle. something else becomes important and issues get left behind. nothing should be left behind. but we do need to change the language but i think i do not know i forget i heard something about there's some sort of breakdown in police procedures or something. if i'm hope i'm not, i'm not misquoting you but you do not get breakdown in procedures when you get this kind of mass attention to a situation, this was a definite procedure planned out helicopters. someone did not forget to make a phone call and all of a sudden, all these guys will these police showed up or somebody made the wrong phone call. this was a deliberate attempt to scare people put people on a defensive. so it's important that we do get this letter out and but i would certainly agree with everyone. regarding more participation and Maria i think summed up a lot of the comments were very well and Bert and Brett. i'm sorry, in terms of toning down the language. maybe 20 thanks, you guys are rock stars relaxing the song i'm young. i can't even do it, but i wanted to say yeah we seems like we're sort of mixing up content a little bit and it feels like what happened with the Chelsea land use, where it's like, i can't agree to send this letter out unless we make the changes or it's like the business license Permits Committee, you know, you can agree to let us being sent out as long as these changes are made and those specifically as everyone's been saying is just you just want to an exchange of information you want to be level level and even keel in and how you're presenting yourself. however, yes, you can still express outrage in a way that is not conclusively. so, those, those are the things with that. and in terms of answering Maria's question. waiting for weeks. i mean, George Floyd happened two months ago, this happened, August seven, which is six weeks ago, Jacob Blake happened. or six weeks after George Floyd, and then Jacob Blake happened two weeks after two months after George Floyd. so this is an ongoing magnified issue that should be addressed readily and if this can go out, not necessarily tonight. but if modifications can be made, you know, before the end of the week. it's a, you know, labor Day weekend. it's not clear, but the sooner is better than later. and just as a personal note, unlawful arrest happen all the time. they happen most heavily as far as i've seen in the Bronx and sometimes in Brooklyn. so to see it in and see before is, you know, it's just showing how much magnified is thank you Colin. yeah, i know it's late, so i try not to repeat anybody i speaking as a community member i think that the second letter. i think the both letters are important and should go out. i especially think the second letter is reasonable. speaking as somebody who used to work for the dean's office in Manhattan. i can tell you that there are some i am frankly pretty alarmed by what the NYPD is able to the tools and tactics that they have and that they're able to use. and i think that they need to constantly be held to account for those and to you know, go before the public and explain themselves i think that i do not i think there's this dichotomy between sending the letter or having a public process. and i would hope that the letter might be the beginning of a public process. i would hope that this would not end with the letter and that we can perhaps in the latter, ask the NYPD or members of the NYPD to come and speak with us, you know, maybe we could turn down or, you know, remove the last paragraph, if that's what the board, you know, boats on and instead asked for cory to arrange some sort of, you know, public forum or something so that we could continue to talk about this, but i do think it's important to get the letters out because i do think that the NYPD needs to be needs to constantly be telling the public, you know, explaining themselves for some of the tactics that they're using that tend to be pretty scary. all right, thanks. David Salma last blue hand. i see. yeah, i just, i just wanted to comment on a lot of comments about the board, you know, not wanting to put out very strongly opinionated letters and you know that there is not much precedent for that. and that does not ring true to me. this board sends out a lot of very highly opinionated letters, the committee's i'm on, you know, transportation and land use land use has taken the DOB to task in no uncertain terms taken etc to task and no uncertain terms very strongly worded so, you know, i do not. there's plenty of precedent for strongly worded letters i do agree that while wording, a letter strongly one also wants to be asking for further information being open to further information. you know, being open to public information were starting with this process tonight. but the idea that we have to be Mealy mouth. all of a sudden, that's not that's it does not sound like the board. the board history to me. Dave hello calm under the wire. okay, yeah, it'll be very quick. i would just take the first letter and focus on inquiry, not the accusation or conclusions lose totalitarian heavy handed shocking, maybe even costly. all right, i'm cutting off the discussion there for a second. i just want to say the reason that this came up tonight. the reason was invited the reason these letters came through is because i thought this was worthy of discussion and you've all made me proud. i'm go about 40 minutes ago. i cut off Joe researcher who had some recommendations about how to change the letter M, since everyone has viewed that you had a chance to view their opinion. i want to go back to Joe for some concrete edits now about what you would suggest, and what can the tone of what i'm hearing from the majority of the speakers is that they'd like to see this letter revised so Joe, i'm going to ask you to, you know, take a shot for shot at that katie, i'll give you, Joe is going to address them and you and Brian i'll have a chance to respond. so the first thing i would suggest is that this goes, not just to Corey Johnson, but goes to the mayor and the police Commissioner and Corey Johnson. is there are three levels of government that we're dealing with an agency City Council and Executive branch second on line on the paragraph three i would change that to read lie to the NYPD approach, Mr Ingram out and arrest warrant, that's the big issue here, clear. they went that arrest warrant to his home was needed to take at his home address. what's paragraphs three it's a question three questions ready so let's just jump in here real quickly low because i think this is important so i think i think you've got a legal response here to that 1 am i correct. Katie so, i'm sorry. so we did discuss this with people in a social justice working group but legally arrests can absolutely happen without a warrant. so it's actually not the biggest question and you can't. there are lots of things, but they can't go into somebody's home without change that to a search wise. yeah. i know i'm going to i'm going to i'm going to come in here with a legal answer to this, because this is where i thought Katie was going to go. people can be arrested without a warrant. yes, under the doctrine of hot pursuit. if the cop see someone grab a handbag and chasing him down the street. he does not need to get a warm he hang on, hang on. the key here is that they showed up at his home without a warrant almost two months after this incident supposedly took place. and that's why the warrant was necessary, not because you can arrest someone without a warrant. you can't arrest someone without a warrant. the issue here is they had two months they knew where they were going. they could have very easily obtained a warrant for his arrest and they did not pay does it take kids as a point we articulate just that, because that's the fact Katie. Katie so as long as you have probable cause. it does not have to be hot pursuit low okay. that they could not go into his home, which is why they were trying to get them to come out of his home. but the point is to hit two months to get a warrant. and i think that's the point. Joe is trying to make yeah. in other words, it's not as if this had just happened and they were after him, or they had gone through a process and just waited and they made a big fucking deal to make a point. i think that's the thing we have to sit here and a nice way. not, not the big fucking deal, you know, but just to make that determination. right, i understand. then the next thing on the fourth item i just would delete. if so, have they been held accountable, because i think it's important to stay have any members of the l NYPD that held accountable for this out of proportion arrest. operation, because i think we can all agree to this call action was out of proportion to whatever may allegedly have had to have a current i'm sorry Joe just. so what's different that you're suggesting about number four. you read it in the second sentence. you really have any members and the NYPD been held accountable for this out of proportion arrest operation period. that's it. i would say excessive instead of proportion. so you're saying get rid of missteps and say, out of proportion or excessive you did whatever the word whatever the proper word is where the, where we can agree on, but it's appointed. it is. it's just that. it is completely out of proportion to whatever happened and it's excessive to whatever happened. okay, and then you're saying get rid of the second question how they've been held accountable. just if they've been held accountable. right, right. because again we're sort of like getting deeply into that. notice that the be held accountable, yes or no, what is the next item i. number five, i would delete the first sentence because i think this really devolves to one person. and that's according to mayor De Blasio the fifth dimension or data know they're the ones who are ultimately accountable here. so the idea that any changes on the command. we're assuming something and getting to a conclusion if you do, what would be the sentence on five i would delete the first sentence. and then you've everything is in five oh, then you wanted to just be focused on the cost and not about command and control because we think that command and control question is very important, it's like really weird. i mean really unusual we think that no, you're not saying you're saying, will there be changes to commit command to control your i'm saying, who was in charge of command and control. he said changes. well, the command and control issue is addressing one who was in the NYPD right. yeah. you said it. number one, ready, who is it what happened. how did this. yeah. i mean, where's my goes to accountability. you know we like. break. and will there be changes now because they made that decision. right. but again, if we're if our job is asking these questions. we can not do it immediately go to the conclusion of where the change in this pilot puppet discussion we're starting to try to get some accountability and assistance for our neighbor who was totally hardly handled in this thing. it was intimidating freaked out. and then i think the man said he can't sleep. six. and then for six, i think, again, we get into this in tweets that it clearly. my partner, my partner does criminal defense for legal aid in the Bronx. and trust me, i can tell you that people are arrested all the time for bullshit and cops lot so i will say that however, to say, is it regular practice to attend to Us citizens are having a western restaurant will are not it's again like leading the, the idea again conclusion. i mean, i do not think you even need that because what happened here is so obvious is the craziness. i would delete all of number six. what about asking for the numbers. again, we're getting citywide here. we want to focus on our neighbor been badly treated the amplifier to what happened to the change needs to happen. and next time is number seven. i just would delete the words after identify and later locate because the real issue here is was there's facial recognition software used to identify that's the big issue. they do not use that to locate you later. it's identify well, i tell but i think his point about the poster was that it actually was used not only to identify and then they put up the posters with this based on it to locate them. right, but that's but that's, is that really facial recognition software that's, you know, an old fashioned wanted poster, is not it. that's a picture that the real thing here is that freaks me out and i really agree with you. this and this one of the next letter, the idea that they're using with a new idea facial recognition software. but i just think it just says to identifying because they must have used that at some point or other protests of things, but that's what i figured out and then in the online 41 i actually would keep these heavy handed and costly, but i would delete the word totalitarian and say out of proportion. because that's what out of proportion and excessive however we want to phrase that over and over, because we're not afraid, as a board to take hard direct stands and be direct with it but totalitarian is to it too much rhetoric. i'm sorry. this is about alright. so i would say i would say Chapel. you know what i mean, like, give me a break. he sees. he's a protester hold on to that did come up and we just kept it in there because we're really looking for that i get notified of take away that kind of force with the letter. no, i do not think we're taking away forcefulness by being direct know i take a suggestion would be oh, gotcha, Gotcha. yeah, i do not want undercut our own position, which is you cheated our neighbor like shit. and, you know, okay. so Joe you know as well as i do. what happens in the Bronx. so that's excessive already so what we can probably say as a better phrase in this particular instance, which i've mentioned before, it's magnified. so we can say it's grossly excessive. great make the point really is. i mean, no matter what he did, you would never have this kind of reaction to something else. that was not hot never would have had so my question for you, Katie. is this helpful to sort of like yeah, so very my only question i have to confess, i'm a little confused. still, can we just go back up to number three. i think i've ever seen everything else. but what was it about Paris. what do you want me to say for number three. why did the NYPD approach, Mr Ingram at his home without a warrant. well, you have to say to get inside his door. well, no, you have to say after two months or something. time element is what's really key there. after two months of the alleged incident. why do they approach him at his home without a warrant. that make sense. yeah. okay that's helpful. thank you. alright, Joe. is that what you had yeah and i want to go to i want to go to Brett Next Brett you still with us. yep. do you have anything you want to add change suggest based upon what Joe just suggested um, i you know, again, a lot of my concern is, you know, we were getting testimony, but it's not complete testimony. we've got conclusions and, you know, everyone has their personal experiences. in you know the justice system here. there are people work as public advocate's i work with, you know, i play in justice facility so i meet with people from all sides, you know i promote a lot of very progressive approaches in change in the justice system as well. all that is not it does not tell us what exactly happened here you know i want to be careful. i would want to be careful how we're coming to conclusions about, oh, why did the being a helicopter. if you think about this during his background. he could be he could be a saint when we're not doing is advocacy and or we do not know anything about it. so i'm just saying NYPD had their had their caseload. we do not have answers were already jumping to conclusions that things are excessive or disproportionate. so i'd like to be the evidence that we do have of something potentially being disproportionate i would suggest that we use his language is we do have on record both, you know, service district attorney and the mayor expressing those terms is, you know, the disproportionate response, etc. i would rather see a site those us coming up with those opinions on our own. i actually liked that idea you show what you can do, or katie, you can use those terms, put them in quotes and drop a footnote to the reference that the mayor made call a disproportionate. that i do not i do not want to rely on us, as the court that's trying the police in this incident. public record. yeah, there was a court case there was an arraignment there what you know he was given a misdemeanor. which was a reduced charge from the assault that he was charged with us. so there is there is enough record to look at about the incident, so we can cite that i just, you know, so that would make me a whole lot more comfortable if we're not coming up with the opinions of what would happen we're using public record rather than us. that's, that's the main point i would make her a tweet and then jd i hear what you're saying about and a logic behind citing the words of disproportionate from the mayor and side Vance's office. but i'm looking at this from a reasonably prudent person's perspective, if you are in this person's shoes, would you have considered the successive grossly excessive and this is goes to i think it's live or a horse sense of you still want to express outrage of what's happened in your community. well, but i'm so i'm just, you can do Brett. Brett let her finish. go ahead. we just, just you can you can still put both in i do, i do. i do understand your logic with it, but you can still express the outreach that way. sure. i mean, again, there's, there's another side to the story. you know, can you imagine if you're a police officer over the last five months under, under intense pressure work. you know, we go to work with someone, you know, says something bad about me work. i feel bad. please have this is this is there, day in and day out unless you spend a day walking and there's your shoes what i'm not saying i'm not justifying what they do is right or wrong, but again, want and you can you imagine being in the police's position in this situation where you're approaching a suspect to who you are there to arrest. and again, these are people. these are police officers. some of them are experiencing, you know, the you know the post traumatic stress disorders and all that. so again, this is not, this is not having conversation. hi, Katie. yeah, i agree with Brett, i think that's an excellent suggestion i think we need to keep in mind what we want to achieve here. we want to dialogue we want to change things, beating up on somebody is not going to get them to respond. i think Bert Brett suggestion is an excellent one, it will make it easier to continue this discussion and solve this problem. Part Lazarus. i just want to say whatever he did or did not do. Garrick. he could be a saint. he could be a major sinner. right. but the, what we saw was experience was excessive closely excessive intimidation. and yes, maybe are many police officers are having post traumatic stress. but what happened to this person and our district. was not right. column. yeah, i agree. i see you, Leslie. okay. for me, for me, i do not think that we need to, i first of all, i do not think that we're being held to the standard of court here or very, you know, to legal standards to, to an extent. i mean, i think we can you know give an opinion as a, as a community, i know that sort of a vague statement, but where i mean to get there is that i put on safe ground by talking about our perception of the incident based on the facts that we have. and for example, i think that you know, when we say in line 35 and 36 however the scale of the attempted arrest is grossly out of proportion to the alleged offense. maybe it's the case that will you know the facts that we have is that it appears to be grossly out of proportion. maybe we do not say is, maybe in line 38 instead of saying it did create a false impression. maybe we can just say it created an impression, you know, then we are get then we're just, you know, telling them exactly as a community, our perspective of the situation. i mean, that seems to be i would, i would suggest that we make those two changes. at like those or we could simply call it an edge reporter and it's been a fortune. yeah. you know i think that goes back to what Brett was saying, you know, refer to something else. if you're there. and if you're saying has reported. i think it gets you to the same place that collins talking about Paul D'Evelyn, did you have something you wanted to add no okay less Williams. yeah, i'm a little concerned that whenever a situation like this occur we look to vilify the victim of the circumstance. by saying, what about his background, what did you do what him says history 10 years ago he was arrested for jaywalking, when we know in the city. the most of the people who are arrested, happened to be people of color 90% of the people in prisons are people of color, not people who are, you know, walking in the street money their own businesses. so i do not understand why we vilified someone's history when they were a victim already and also this guy was protesting its first amendment rights. he has a right to protest. that last i do not think there's anything in the letter. that's cool. that is, as it now exists. that's questioning, Mr Ingram, or his background. no, but the comment was made a few minutes. ago. the comment was not in the letter. it's not a letter. was saying Brett was trying to make a point with it. i do not think Brett was you know, trying to add that to the letter. i'm just trying to keep things moving. yeah. i got to christine i think pauline before maybe a good suggestion at the end of the letter to open the open the dialogue, you know, to see, we would look forward to have you know, to receive to have. i do not know meetings with the NYPD and understand what's going on. something to open the dialogue and open the process. first suggestion. okay. does anyone have anything else, they'd like to see added change subtracted from this letter David Salma yes, i just i just do not think we should be quoting the mayor on this. this is our letter we should not take our language and use the mayor as its voice. let's just keep it to be. keep it to our voice. i think varun had the suggestion for that, you know, as, as reported covers the same thing. i think varun suggestion solves that kit. we're ready to go. almost kit. just want to quickly say okay. on this board even folks who said things that i disagree with me. but as a process point. i do want to just call out now. i'm one of the few folks on the screening ward who identifies as both african American and Male, and we have spent quite some time tonight going line by line through this letter and it has not gotten public comment. and your time has really been dominated by folks who are white. and do not share the lived experience of the person is the focus of this letter. and so just want to say very strongly that i really wish we had open this up to more diverse voices and to the public. as someone who identifies as black ends mail, and this was wanting a long list too long for us to recall horrible incidents unfortunate likely won't be last. i'm concerned that we handle this. the way that we did. okay. Kitt i understand what you're saying. i think i can very safely say that anyone who would anything they wanted to say from the board on this. has had a chance to speak tonight if the most of the people who have spoken are white. that's because that's the makeup of the board. i understand your point that this should have gone outside the board to the public. i'm not opining on that one way or the other. but if you're talking about just to spoke tonight. everyone who's wanting to speak is had a chance so far. Devil. when i saw your hand and then it went down again. i was just going to make a motion that we vote on the letter as amended. and i'm not there yet. i'm not there yet. i won't entertain that motion yet so loris i just wanted to say. i think this has been a great discussion. i think we've allowed everyone to express their concerns from their observations from their emotions. i do still strongly feel that we need to be led by the broad community in all of our conversations and discussions. but after hearing from everyone who's expressed their view and the amendments that are being recommended i am comfortable that we move forward with the letters as it's been amended. i know that's all you were trying to make that motion. but i just wanted to because i began with making that motion on the agenda. i wanted to say that i do appreciate that this conversation has been real. yeah, it has been without will call it emotions that create more problems and we're trying to solve for how to bring the community and how to get answers. so i think everybody for that and i'm ready to vote. all right, i have one question before i i'm going to pose emotion that i want someone to make but do we have any more comments on letter. number seven, about the use of facial recognition because we've only gone through letter. number six. sorry to be sorry to be the you know the bearer of bad tidings here, but we have not really discussed that. and i did not know if there was anyone who wanted to add anything about that letter christine you your highlighted, do you wanted to say something. okay. all right. who is the 917 number with their hand raised. it's me, Rob Walker. i just wanted to make a comment about facial recognition. it's only as good as the company that's supplying it and their database is a highly and accurate. and when you start dealing with the Latino Committee. Native American the black and brown community. it's a rate of accuracy goes down tremendously and i can understand why we're currently using this, this should barely be in beta, let alone having the authorities use this. all right, Rob. Rob, i'm going to cut you off there. the point of the letter is to say, how is it being used. so, you know, i understand that we're points, but we're not testifying here. we're just asking the questions. marty to cat. number. number seven. i mean, we've had a lot of word smithing on the other letter, the language on the line 17 needs some work during the botched arrest of a journey attempt to arrest. yeah, that makes sense given the other changes we've made that change makes sense to me. Katie oh yeah, you're saying, oops, sorry. am i on Mute. another you're okay. um, so you're saying, change the word botch to like attempted arrest. yes. mine 17 watch, watch the value Laden attempted is a descriptor. yep. okay. anyone else on anything on item number seven. all right, here's what i'm going to do. i want katie, if you can take us through what letter number six looks like with the final edits. then i am going to ask someone to make the following motion. i would like emotion that is a vote to either send the letter as Katie's. now i'm going to send it out. or Remand the letter back to the social justice Working group that will take advice from the executive committee so yes would be sending a letter, no would be to Remand. and i think that's the easiest way to do that if anyone has anything else, they'd like to say about that motion. when the motion is made, you can, we can discuss that. but i think that's the easiest way to get through this. Katie. can you take us through six, and tell us basically what it looks like now. yeah. so how about i just read through the whole thing is i think it reflects what we discussed sorry, and no i do not want anyone interrupting her if there are changes that need to be made. i'll take hands at the end if they've give you think Katie missed something. but let's just get through it once. please, Katie. ok, so my hand community Board for respectfully request the City Council's committee on oversight and investigations launched an investigation of the NYPD for accountability. in connection with the attempted arrest on August 7:20 20th derek ingram on West 45Th Street in Manhattan. we believe the following questions need to be answered. number one, who within the NYPD command and control structure a conceived of and be authorized the massive scale of the arrest operation against Mr Ingram, including deployment of NYPD helicopter canine unit members of the strategic response team. multiple offices and tactical gear and closing of them and Hatton block to traffic for several hours. number two, what was the total number of officers who were involved in the arrest operation and Mr Ingram, what is the total estimated number three, why did the NYPD approach, Mr Ingram at his home without an arrest warrant, more than six weeks after the alleged crime, question mark. number four, have any members of the NYPD and held accountable for the excessive wait, hold on. and for the access for the excessive use of force in this attempted arrest question mark.
