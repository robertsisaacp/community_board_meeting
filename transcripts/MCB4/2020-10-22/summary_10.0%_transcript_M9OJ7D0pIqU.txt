I'm joined by my colleagues, lily, Gordon, Covid-19, Brian, Parrott and Caitlin Toner from Dot's bikeshare program, as well as Colleen chattergoon from the Manhattan office, who many of you also have the pleasure of working with so last year, DOT embarked on our five- year phase three CitiBike expansion alongside our partner lifts, and this is going to double the size of the bikeshare system, Triple, the number of available bikes in the program and since CitiBike launched in 2013, new yorkers and visitors have turned time and again to the CitiBike system as a healthy, safe, fast and affordable transportation.
Three expansion in Manhattan started this spring and I will let you know Lilly go into a little bit more detail into what we've done so far, but as the bike system grows into new neighborhoods ridership into the existing service area is going to grow as well.
The first is cleaning high contact areas on all the bikes when they're returned to the depots, which include seat posts and handlebars baskets things like that, as well as disinfecting bikes when they're docked at high use stations near hospitals and the crews are using social distance practices in the field and while handling bikes and then the other key piece is the critical workforce membership program which began in March, where Lyft and in partnership with the city was able to offer free member annual memberships to essential workers.
This will support increased demand from the phase three service areas, folks on the outer part of the system coming in as well as help us meet existing unmet demand when riders can't find a bike or a dock.
It will be a rolling installation and we will be covering multiple community boards at one time coming back to community boards over the course of the following years, and the iterative planning process will help us address changes in demand.
The first is to add new stations, and the second is to expand existing stations by adding new to stations that are already on the ground and then the third is creative design solutions like 3d bridging which you can see here on in this photo, which will allow us to have stations that are both on the sidewalk and road bed.
You know whenever you put something on the sidewalk, the people going to the lane, to the parking or from the parking right on the sidewalk, and it's not something we want to encourage, especially because you are just acrosss a large complex with a lot of seniors.
The thing is that you know once you have, that you have people riding on the sidewalk to get to the station and that's not something we want to encourage, in our neighborhood.
I think, especially since we've seen with Covid-19 We've, seen less compliance rather than more compliance when it comes to sidewalk riding and by the way, a lot of what we did not see used to see before a lot of CitiBikes on the sidewalk, which is upsetting So. The bottom line is we do not want it on the sidewalk right.
Thank you all for coming and being here, You know, I think it's great that you're putting these in the area, especially if you put them on the street, but the thing is: If I.
It's, just for us in Manhattan and just parts of Brooklyn and a neighborhood here, And there thrown in what's your connectivity plan and what And like, if you, if I'm going to buy from Coney island to my office or to my work, I need electric bikes.
So, I love to be like I'm, a frequent rider, but not only do I think that you know having docs on the sidewalk is dangerous for pedestrians.
You've heard me mention this before, because we've talked about it in my professional cap with gansport Street issues and having a sidewalk station there, but this is significant, given the fact that when the city begins to bustle again, our sidewalk space will be precious and we need to prioritize people as much as possible.
Can I ask committee members who are not speaking to please go on mute While we've got all these stocks going on the street and that this is really a partnership between the city and city Bank.
One thing I would be very interested in seeing D.O.T implementing with this expansion of the CitiBike program, is taking another look at the bike stations and seeing, if there's an opportunity that, while we're in the street, where is it, which is a great place to park, bicycles, to incorporate free bike parking racks for non- CitiBikes, so that way, riders, that are that are doing one better than CitiBike, which is owning our own bicycles and maintaining them ourselves will also be part of the amenities that are that are happening to us.
We have partnerships that provide discounted memberships to NYCHA residents and snap recipients and wanting to make sure folks know that those are available, and also just doing cyclist, cycling, education, so that people understand this is a system that works for me.
These are the rules of the road, all those kinds of things, so we're looking, I think, at trying to figure out how to maximize those opportunities, how to expand even to folks who are low income, but are not nitro residents or snap recipients and strengthening our partnerships with local community groups and local cycling groups that are already entrenched in their neighborhoods and understand the needs of their constituents.
You know citywide plan, so you know, there's lots of good reasons why putting bike parking associated with the CitiBike docks Would be, would be a brilliant idea, and you know particularly considering that your current program for putting him in the street is not viable because of the way it's established been established.
That looks like a wrench on the dock and you can press that button which will take the bike out of service for other riders and also signal to the operations team that it needs to be looked.
You know, hopefully that I'm sorry to hear that that's been an experience and definitely encourage folks to hit that wrench button if they are experiencing that problem and if it's something a more sustained issue, certainly something we can talk to the operational team about as well.
You know the preference in this community and at least in this committee, and this community board would be to take space from cars instead of pedestrians when it comes to placement of racks or docks.
But to the second question- Your second point about city rack installations over the last year, I will say that Covid-19 definitely put a halt, as one would guess, to a lot of our non- essential work for some time, but our public space unit has been working on our bike.
Recovery, pre plan to essentially kind of cover, areas, city- wide, where we are installing additional bike, parking facilities and capacity to help with this increased demand in cycling.
Are there any sort of programs that CitiBikes has with public schools So, within the service area, we have a policy of placing at least one night, a one CitiBike station at each NYCHA, facility.
We look to place stations near schools and any really large amenities, so school museum, shopping, plaza anywhere, where there's going to be a lot of activity and people coming to or from we want to have a station there.
Thanks, I'm, going to open it, I'm going to go to Carl Wilson from Speaker Johnson's office, and then we have at least two questions from public Carl Hi everyone , evening, DOT, ncb4, just quick question any of the sites that identify do they disrupt any current outdoor, dining setups, and you know how is that can taken into consideration now when selecting sites for new racks, hi Carl good evening?
And, we'll frankly, continue to look into as outdoor dining is becoming a more permanent fixture in New York , City Thank you another wrinkle, dale and reason to take up more space from cars for cyclists.
I can read out your question if hello, yes, Hi several of these of these racks and thank you for expanding the one on West 22Nd street, better to have the racks there than the cars, even though some folks on the block were a little upset that they saw so many bikes.
It has become more and more dangerous for pedestrians, especially elderly people to get their bikes are on the sidewalk Although I've seen those I mean, I.
I do not know what we can do, but if you're adding all these bikes, I'd really like to know how you're going to enhance enforcement so that the streets are safe so that pedestrians and other cyclists, I mean the cyclists, who are abiding by all the rules, are in as much danger as the pedestrians.
We have a lot of some of our typical education components like on- street teams and going to schools going to different businesses to educate people on how to safely ride a bike and what the rules of the road are.
Think it's a great reminder not only about the need for enforcement, but also the need for education, and you know, I think, the, as well as looking to place stations in the street as much as possible, which we appreciate.
Your support with not every area is as supportive as taking roadway space for CitiBikes, Does your mobile interface have like basic instructions for riders on riding safely in New York, or should it the city, the CitiBike app I know, there's been some renewed conversations around rider training and having folks go through a quick demonstration or a quick set of slides on their phone about rider safety and rules of the road?
Great hi, I tuned in a little bit late, but Brian weber, a public member, a resident of West, 36Th Street and the co- chair of the very nascent Avenue did not know that it was coming back, but residents are very glad to see it reduces the number of cars that double park on that corner next to other cars.
I'd, really like to understand how we got to 70, and maybe we need a bike lane on 22nd street.
Do you mean, of course, thanks Brian and so Susan, just to speak a little bit more to you know your request, your suggestion of adding in a bike lane on 22nd 20th, street.
Dale, yes, go ahead, Jeffrey that the board applauds and welcomes the infill in CB4, but would like the 27th and 8Th Avenue Street sites to be reconsidered and placed on the bed and not the cycle, and then I have some addition to that.
We have seen a steady increase and recently as high as 60 to 70 percent of ridership from last year is actually riding now, something that shows us that our recovery for our slice of the ridership of the transportation modes in New, York City, is starting to see that recovery We're keeping a close eye, certainly as we go into fall and cooler weather to make sure that at least proportionally we're seeing the same levels and trying to get people on board and moving to help support the city.
Everything was purpose built for NYC ferry, meaning that we do have lower emissions, quieter, vessels, a more stable ride, which is generally noticeable when you're on some of the longer hull, routes, and also one of the things that we think is important is that we're also creating less weight than some of the older vessels just because technology has improved and designs have improved on catamaran style vessels in the harbor.
First of all, there are changes to travel, behavior that are working in our favor and by in our favor I do not have the exact numbers, but they said far fewer people are using the shuttle bus to access the pier 79 area, either to or from the landing which, from a local perspective, is good information, because that means that fewer people are creating demand for those buses to come back to a full system.
We are still negotiating but planning to leverage the existing shuttle buses so that we do not have to increase or add any new bus service to this area, understanding the constraints that are already there we're trying to avoid any, adding or exacerbating the issues that exist in terms of and then, of course.
Next year and sort of finding the times that it makes the most sense to bring traffic flag people and to put them at the two intersections that are needed in terms of other operations.
It does sound like there continues to be both an interest and a need for some long- term visioning in terms of how to recreate access points here, which is, you know, a longer and bigger capital, planning, process and project.
I do not believe at the moment there is an active capital planning process for this area, but did want to leave note that you know from our perspective.
The fact that they use the area for parking and layover, which has become a problem in particular at night time and Jeffrey I, want to acknowledge that I know.
Once we get started in my conversations with the people who are there on a more regular basis, what they've said is that yes, of course, the total slice of people who are using the ferry and the terminal is much smaller, but what they are surprised by is that the proportion of those people using it is even smaller for bus access, meaning that, since people who were using buses were generally going towards places further north.
Think people are walking and biking to areas that are closer.
I guess I'm going to refer defer to Rashi to speak to capital planning within the trust, as it relates to what I was saying earlier, is I have heard rumors of I have not been able to pin down or see if there's any active capital planning process for the area in front of pier 79, whose jurisdiction is not the trust but actually like a mix of a few different layers.
The area from 29th to 44th street is Kind of the last big, not yet in process fully plan planning zone for Hudson river park, aside for our river research and education center down in Tribeca, and it is in the queue and we have been working on an RFP for that area, which is pretty complicated given all of the transportation and other uses that have leases and lots of issues.
It's, something we're going to have to be talking with you all about, because I think it's probably a zone that would be addressed almost in phases, because there are more open space opportunities in some areas and in some areas it's really more like enhanced, vehicular, passageways or pedestrian passageways.
I. Think in the in this day and age, people would take that more than I mean I'm going to take a couple more questions from our committee.
Although the marketing has changed, I, think the fundamentals have not, and I, think New York City is still putting the people at the back of the bus, and I wanted to give you some of the examples I have identified so from the standpoint of real estate.
It's called congestion, but pedestrian and cyclists have to ask for a permit and even on the sidewalk pedestrians have to ask for a permit when people chant industry demonstration, when car screams and Yell Honk in the streets it's normal and when marchers block in the street, they go to jail, but cars block the traffic I mean I just wanted to open the discussion for everybody to chime in and give their thoughts and see whether we could design a program we could go forward with to ask for different things.
If, you look at it historically, there has been totally uneven distribution of street space between the pedestrian and the cars 27 percent of New York City's roadways of our cars, pretty much, that is, for a very small percentage of the population, because car ownership, as we know, is much lower in Manhattan and other parts of the city compared to Outer.
I think these are all things that we in the committee have all been fighting, and you know we had a moment where you know we had an argument once in our committee meeting about thinking D.O.T about making a change to 41st to 9th Because people, someone had to die before they did that, like the there Well, the scaffold is newer than the dent on the sidewalk on on 29th and 8th avenue.
We want there's a lot of really good things in that legislation, for the sake of the city for But there's also so many gaps that are going to have so many unintended consequences.
I, think we do need more of diversity, diverse opinion on our committee, but the and the last thing I wanna You know.
I mean you're talking about bike, bicycle dogs and talking about taking over parking lanes, so I think it goes into that little.
We put this because you know we had, especially when the bike lane at Ninth Avenue was coming in, and so we were suggesting red turn arrows because of the danger of people crossing green light, green lights.
The entire city has got these split signals everywhere, especially in Manhattan, and it started, I think, with our transportation committee's discussion so and the bike corrals.
A lot of times is not curb adjacent because the bike lane is next to the curb, and then you have the street dining kind of in the parking lane, which is between the bike lane and the traffic.
This is just looking west, so you can see the street dining area is pretty large and they were just constructing it.
If somehow the committee could recommend, I do not know who's issuing the permits for the street dining, but just some sort of limit on how close they can get to a corner where there is a conflicting turn movement that would probably help just keep everyone a little bit.
The second thing, is, I, think we know the DOT is supposed to come back to us when a study of the rest of the Eighth Avenue, okay, And, so I would be happy to to send a resolution covering those three things.
Have you know a warning to drivers that there's a hidden bike, lane That goes for a lot of places in the city.
Have experience with, because, like any community, should know their streets and their sidewalks.
This is before we even start talking about the pedestrian issues and ensuring the foot clearance on the sidewalk thanks That I bike on 45th and 8th.
You, know, I'm sure nobody on this in this committee ever is on a bike and runs a red light, but I always look both ways.
There are a number of areas of potential conflict between cars, turning left and bicyclists on the bike lane that need to be addressed, and so you know thank you so much for bringing this to our attention, and I think that this is definitely That's, something that D.O.T needs to take.
And so I think that there is a massive issue of enforcement which is not going to get better until you know middle of next year, And then, after that.
I'm, not surprised, I'm at first For, that did you can't leave I've been a staff member on these meetings before when I worked for city of Arinda, Okay, I'm going to move on quickly to the next item, which is helicopter, safety, and I one second, just to kind of keep it on the recording.
So I have an item of new business that I would like to put before the committee for anyone who does not know my name I work for the Hudson Yards Health, Kitchen alliance, we're a business improvement district and we are within CB4.
We see this as a really congested construction, heavy block, and we would like to do a little interim greening before we could work through a longer term plan where we would, you know, do other types of enhancements, but for sort of the foreseeable future, we'd like to do something- We see this as an opportunity since D.O.T is about to take control back over this portion of the street.
Well, you know anything is better than the lane of traffic My emotion, I think we're generally supportive of this and like make a suggestion, about, like potentially partnering with highline for an art program component right, but the more green in this area, the better.
Yet, it looks like D.O.T has said they can use our block for outdoor recreational activities and they can close it down to parking cars during those periods.
Think I do not know if this is a good block for the.
I. Do not think it's a good block for this to for this to be open streets for the school.
