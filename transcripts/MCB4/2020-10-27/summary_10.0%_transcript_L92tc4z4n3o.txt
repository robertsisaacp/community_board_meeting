Just to recap for everybody we over the last two sets of meetings, not quite two months, but almost two months task force committees have had the opportunity to review past budgets, make new requests and Jesse, and the office had prepared a very helpful sheet for re-ranking past priorities, adding in additional priorities that are just new and then also adding and identifying priorities which were specific to Covid-19.
We also did a survey which will share the results with you shortly, but we had over 300 or just about 300 participants from across the community, and I think their feedback, combined with really the narrative that we heard from the committees, as well as the budget task force.
The issues of homelessness and housing, education and sanitation, The budget task force met last week to begin the process of prioritizing both on the expense and capital side, as is typical and, as has been done in past years.
All of this remains more or less in draft form, but does reflect the direction we are going, which is to prioritize the three areas: I mentioned: homelessness and housing, education and sanitation, jessie anything you'd, care.
You know, as you guys all know, committees really kind of made the Covid-19 requests or the requests related to the impact that cobit has had as their primary as their you know top priorities and let the last year's requests sort of shift down a little bit.
An important conversation about the priorities I was reading through the expense and capital spreadsheets today and was kind of surprised that there were so many sanitation issues so high up on our priorities, but because it did not.
Is, not necessarily seen or the department you know, HPD is not necessarily seen by sanitation, and so there is an effort to kind of move things and show a variety of issues at the top recognizing that, ultimately, each department, New York City Department, gets the priorities that are related to their work and their work.
I think, there's also an element of things that are what are priorities to be budget items that are reinstated versus new money and doing something new, and so there was a regular kind of reference to like what do we think is actually possible or what is a longer term.
That is something we have been advocating for a long time, whereas I think a lot of the sanitation cuts are very specific to again not Covid-19 in the sense that Covid-19 did not cause sanitation to not be picked up, but rather the budget related to some of the challenges our city's experiencing because of Covid-19 have impacted the amount of sanitation, pickup and clean up.
That's why all the NYCHA stuff is, you know relatively high in capital If you talk about the balancing out of this, the staffing request for NYCHA, elevator, repair, people, then I think maybe we can look at that, but I do not know what the difference off the top of my head.
But if I look at if I look at operating expenses right, we have basket collection as a priority for, but we have providing students with access to enrichment and nourishment programs is number 10.
You look at the expense budget priorities that link that's in the dropbox They're prioritized and the fourth highest priority coming out of this community board is provide more frequent, litter basket, collection, whereas the sixth is expand, homeless prevention programs.
I. Think that's really important, because when we boiled it down, we had to put into buckets if we have to pick one issue to address the homeless factor You, know, affordable housing program through DHS We need a clean and safe district with access to more housing for new Yorkers, and I.
And I think it's going to be very bad to constituents in the district that we are saying prioritizing another new shelter above permanent, affordable housing or NYCHA capital.
The first thing: that's coming up is homelessness and we do not even have one permanent family shelter in the district right, but we have a number of family shelter rooms vacated by the city.
We know we keep them on just to keep them on and keep them going below that simply because the huge number of people live in NYCHA, deserve, I, believe, more consideration first, because their capital needs are so outstanding.
We often keep it in our book for 10 years, because we know that it's worth the fight, if it's something that we want, I, think that, given the fact that more and more people are not going to be able to pay, rent when Covid-19 is over makes me want to double down on the fact that we need a family shelter in the district.
I think that a lot of NYCHA folks would agree wholeheartedly that homelessness is a major issue and it should be addressed by finding an appropriate family shelter in the district.
You welcomed the family, shelter and then what had ended up separately happening was BRC and the BRC issue being the number of beds and the impact on the community, and then I think two about two cycles: ago.
They were not never really initially together, but they were together for, like the last two years, and so I just want to give that history there that this request for the at least a family, shelter has been something that's been on.
In that text, changing like Leslie was saying changing the text to say decent, you know identifying the single bit he's been dozing by Can I propose that we move six up to three and establishing the new shelter as number four above the school request?
And do a clean, one, All right, a queen clean, swap just opening another can of worms, Jesus Mary and Joseph, okay, Paul Given the conversation that you know, I'd re repeat my concern that waste basket cleansing is a higher priority on our budget list than NYCHA elevators I understand that it goes to agencies The waste basket on the Paul on the survey basket, overwhelming on what The basket service Paul.
I. Think that's a very big deal when it comes, and I understand what you're saying you're like basket: Service, Like, imagine, being imagine being a NYCHA resident, and you pick up this document as Bert says, and You see that the board has voted to empty the waste cans on the corner , there's a higher priority than fixing the elevators in their buildings, but that's in the expense.
It's still occupied by DDC, so The construction, okay, We, and we would like the same thing on the other end of the street when that's available and someone sometimes do either they're using the phone I think you want to say, take away, delete the a and just bus parking is located blah and speaking of bus, parking.
But a desire to have a permanent exhibit in the North East Corner side of central park, and they have been asked by Boro President's office to actually go to different community boards and kind of garner support.
They came and they made a comprehensive presentation to all of us and the task force members pretty much sort of were quite you, know, blown away with the comprehensive nature of their work, because we did not realize that they've been doing this since December last year and Dale actually did have a listing for this.
I do not want to speak for her in this letter, but that section, I think, is pending our discussion on the point of derek Ingram.
Think you know, but I read the letter and seeing that the second entire paragraph about derek ingram.
You could make it shorter, but I think talking about Mr Ingram in this letter is so appropriate because it makes a connection to what happened in central park and it brings it to our community They want our support.
Many people want the letter with the paragraph about Derek Ingram?
