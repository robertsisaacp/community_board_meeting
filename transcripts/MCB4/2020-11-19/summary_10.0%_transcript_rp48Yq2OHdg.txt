We want to invite the revocable consent, the applicant for the revocable consent for a stoop and proposed stair to the basement, with guardrail and gate at 278, West, 25Th, street, and so.
I thought you would like these drawings today, because they show more of the neighborhood context, which I would think community boards interested in.
There's, a language of stoops and stairs to cellars and little fences, whether it's an apartment building or some of the row houses on the block on the south side.
You can see that the sister building on the right, which is to the west, also has the same fence what we noticed when we started working with DOT because of the tree, the tree bed and tree that exists, there, that the existing fence it leaves less than five feet.
We wanted to remove the fence and work with the proposed stoop.
You could show the next page a stoop that is projects less than the existing tall fence, but still accomplishes getting stairs into the home at the parlor level, and we sunk some of the stairs into the actual building to be able to make this work mathematically.
And, there's a gate there, and we worked with Public Design commission to make sure that the stoop and the stair are aligned and the fence with gates are again in alignment and then from working with them.
A stoop is traditional for New York City, and we think that this block, but particularly the south side, has lots of stoops and we liked bringing that element back in to the neighborhood and.
So I just wanted to show you everything, but this is simply a repeat of the first eight slides, thank you, and so the consent is for what the consent is for the stoop and the stair to the seller with the fence and there's two gates to allow to use the sidewalk right.
You would have to have ramps or means, but the way we design inside is you know for aging in place and comfort, and we always like around doors.
You know a garden apartment downstairs, right, it's not making it available if they want to rent it somewhat and doesn't make it available to people with ADA.
Think Christine's, trying to say that the this current project is a is an opportunity to cure what is current, as you are curing the sidewalk clearance and recognizing that it's not required by code with a two-family residence, right.
So I think that DOB doesn't necessarily ask questions about the fence.
The question is about D.O.T and whether they will allow you to continue to use the fence, and you know it would be a good idea to go back and ask them.
You, don't have to have an answer right away, but it would be a good idea to ask that if they haven't asked you right now, they can even after construction starts, so you're really better off clarifying that with both DOB and D.O.T. It's D.O.T that would determine about whether the fence is allowed, but you know, as far as the ADA I, completely disagree, that you know that they should be required to make this ADA accessible.
You know there's that company that makes trash receptacles for residences and it would fit inside that fence area, so he's been considering it.
Then I'll probably want to just comment and add something I think we can summarize it by saying, assuming that this plan corrects the current deficit in sidewalk, clearance.
You know we should change long-established ADA compliance for single and double family homes, I mean Jeffrey.
You honestly, when you send, in an application like this to DOT, more often than not, DOT, doesn't check if you're actually encroaching upon right of way, because they assume this is an existing condition improving upon it.
But if we just go down the assumption, that, like DOB or Drt, says you got to remove that fence and bring it back to the clearance line.
Some of these are actually residents are actually turn out to be drivers who park on the street, but they like having a quiet street that they can also walk on with a pandemic, making it dangerous to petition I created a qr code and linked it to a petition hosted by Ta and put it on the barriers.
I think it's even more important for people to have this open street to be able to walk on and socially distance safely.
Unfortunately, for now, I'm, still hoping that the blocks west of me will join in, but that's not happening just yet Jeffrey about the garage on the street.
You know I actually, like the barriers that I have the police dropped off.
Jeffrey I, think that it's critical, we included in our letter that DOT, replace if needed, and also that open street partners like this, should be considered for other infrastructure.
I. Think I would like to focus on the one that worked and say: okay.
Then, let's figure, what else we need to do in order to make the other one work, because if we start with, we want everything, they're just going to say: look half of them didn't work.
Let's focus on the one that worked I know, but the question is: Have we done that kind of overview of streets that don't work or the states that work.
I mean it's not just one block in one street and West 22Nd. I'll.
It has kind of de facto become an open street, but I found out that West 22nd is actually selected, because NYPD would like that.
My observation was: You know when the street says I want to change direction.
When one street say I want a loading zone for parking, we don't invite everybody and say: Is it working.
But you know I think we need to open up that conversation.
I mean many opening and closing the street.
I. Think we can support this specific block and also, you know, develop some language to say.
We would love to encourage this block to continue in its success with an open street so that others may follow suit to that degree, as a model, because I agree with you veren it is, it should be larger, but you know that I don't want to say that the program was sabotaged from the outset.
But you know the hoops that everybody had to leap through to get an open street running and functional.
At the same time, two more things being added to that list might not hurt, because I think it just makes a larger point that we really want to reclaim part of the street which should be reclaimed because there is actually a problem.
And, I, think Dale had a very good suggestion which says you know.
You, know, I think they put their foot in the door, and now we need to open that door a little further as you are suggesting in our recommendation.
I think there is a block that is an open street that has a.
Can I suggest that the angle be like a pr suggestion to DOT in terms of developing permanent infrastructure and elements for the open streets program and finance, Jeffrey and financially and official signage, because no right turn and no entry.
You know what time or day, but we are going to be resuming that, but at this point yeah, it's basically making sure that we have all the stakeholders ready to resume talks in these task force.
But I think they need to get on it in terms of getting the New Jersey tourist helicopters.
Personally, I, don't think anything is really going to change that much until yeah new administration takes place, but they have to keep the pressure.
I, think the issue with the heliport and as concerned, you know.
So I think there was at some point a suggestion that the help would not be at 30Th. I'm, going to get Jeffrey to come, so you're done, Dale Jeffrey.
Second, from that, I think that what melody's neighborhood and I she keeps being called in particular just because we know where she lives.
That I think Gottfried submitted, which gave the teleport renewable forever just about so that should you should be able to access that pretty quickly, but a couple issues with the heliport, the 30th street helicopters.
The issue that my dale brought up in terms of landing is a good question, because over the past year and a half I've been tracking the incoming flights, the idling times that I submitted a long time ago to I think to approximate at some point and also to the trust.
What we probably want to do, I know if it's transportation or if it's wpe.
You know like looking at the heliport as a transportation asset and saying it is deficient in the as a transportation.
You, know the other heliports, so I think it would be probably better to just narrow it down to just the issues.
I totally appreciate that point, but I think our purview is going to be like.
Once once the waterfront looks at it from an EIS standpoint, but then you know, waterfront is going to have the same issue.
Would, like the committee to think this through I.
Don't know who the appropriate guest would be to talk about it or guests, plural, but I do think it could be a good use of our recommendation.
I think we first have to have people from the trust, because we need to understand what's happening, there, don't we and.
But I, think you know a lot.
And I think we should invite them to this committee for a presentation so that we understand how they are looking at these three different conditions that Jeffrey just described the two ferry terminals and ps76 right.
Standpoint, because even if we have paint you are going to have more people coming right instead of cars, and so we just need to understand how that works, because this area is horrible.
However, one of the proposals is, for you, know: 20 development, 80 park, space.
There's, multiple ways that I think it's going to be looked at, but no question transportation is going to have to be considered because of the use.
