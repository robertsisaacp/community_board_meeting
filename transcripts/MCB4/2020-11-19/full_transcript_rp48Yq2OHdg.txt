Take a vote, so this is the October November already November we're halfway through November. Oh my god. This is I, can't stand it. I'm totally losing sense of time here, yeah, so November, meeting of the community ward, 4 Manhattan community board for Transportation Committee, and you know you're all on zoom, because we still have to do zoom per the guidelines from the a governor. And so, if you want to talk or if you want to raise your hand, you can do that in the raise my hand panel, which is when you go to the participants and the attendees, can the attendees raise their hand? Yes, they can yes, okay, so you raise your hand and we will call you when it's appropriate for those people who are on the phone. If you do the numbers asterisk 6, you will be able to toggle mute and unmute, and when you do asterisk 9 it will raise your hand and generally we are going to ask everybody to be on mute as much as possible. So there is no interference in the sound. So the way we run the meeting is we have an agenda. We are calling the Pres the people who want to present on the agenda and then we have a question answers from the committee and then we open it to the public, and then we regroup with the committee to make a recommendation and again we are not making decisions. We are making the recommendation go to the board vote on it at its next full board committee, which is early December, the first Wednesday in December and that's the way the process works. So we and if you have any new business, we will call the new business at the end, so without further delay. Since we have a quorum, we want to invite the revocable consent, the applicant for the revocable consent for a stoop and proposed stair to the basement, with guardrail and gate at 278, West 25Th street, and so, if yes, hi yeah, if Janine, if you can show that and if you want to start okay, something maybe we'll try to hold our question to the end, but it's always very difficult. Okay, thank you! So much my name is. Oh, can you hear me? Yes, okay, thank you. My name is Julie Torres Mosquitz I worked with Janine. Thank you for helping me with the slides and thank you all for letting us be here tonight. So I wanted to talk briefly, walk you through these Public Design Commission draft, because we're supposed to submit on Thursday to them, and we've been working back and forth with public design commission, as well as the DOT, the MTA and DOB lots of entities, and so these drawings that you're that I'm going to take you through right now are the public design commission presentation at the back end of it is the DOT drawings they're similar, but I thought you would like these drawings today, because they show more of the neighborhood context, which I would think community boards interested in, so that, if you could show the next slide, you need okay. So here's the area of work and the project is a row house and it's under renovation. Right now on the interior and we've been working since last March with DOT submissions and corrections, and recently we started working with the Public Design Commission. So the site is on the south side of 20 West 25th street, near the corner of 8Th Avenue, where there is a secondary subway. You know the main subway entry point is at 23rd and 25th does have some subway egress on the corner, so you are on the east side of 8Th Avenue. Yes, the East side right where that pink DOT is where so. This is between eight and seven, yes, between eighth and seventh correct. Thank you next slide. Okay, so here's the context of the house. It's the one with the white trim at the lentils, the white paint on the left, it's one of two sister building next to it that they both have tall fence around it and a tree that exists, the that's how it existed when the client purchased the home last August, so a little over a year and a few months ago. So with the renovation we helped them to renovate the interior. And then, when we did the survey we realized this tall fence was on public land. So it's not part of the property. We also noticed that, historically, we did different historic research and, as you see the where this, the door entry is it's a double height space with a lintel above, and it appears that in the past there was a stoop here once and so we started talking about. How could we bring the stoop back to the home so that you could enter from the parlor and then have a separate entry to the garden apartment on the far left side? And if you look at the plans at the top, this gives you a little bit of the neighborhood context you can see to the in red is where that the home is, and that's the proposed stoop with a stair also going down to the cellar and a fence that you know puts it. But we're going to see it later, so don't okay. So that is less of a projection than what the existing tall fence is in the bottom right corner. And then this block photo at the top is just good context, because it shows you the rhythm of the block and that there's a lot there's a language of stoops and stairs to cellars and little fences, whether it's an apartment building or some of the row houses on the block on the south side. So next slide please- and this is a the apartment building, that's to the East 266 West 25Th, 264, West, 25th they're, together with separate entries and then there's image. Three is looking down the street west towards the property and you can see the lumber yard sign, which is rate to the east of 278 West 25Th street, and then this is another series of row houses with stoops and fence that are just beyond 266 and 264. West 25th. Okay, if you don't mind the next slide, you need a few. Oh sorry, a little bit of lag time. So here's just further down the block, a little further east, where you see an more series of Stoops stoops with fences and area ways down to cellar, basement areas. Okay, next slide. So here's the existing plan I mentioned that there's an existing fence and you can see that the sister building on the right, which is to the west also has the same fence what we noticed when we started working with DOT because of the tree, the tree bed and tree that exists there, that the existing fence it leaves less than five feet. So that's too tight for the public to it's. A pinch becomes a pinch point. So we wanted to remove the fence and work with the proposed stoop. If you could show the next page a stoop that is projects less than the existing tall fence, but still accomplishes getting stairs into the home at the parlor level, and we sunk some of the stairs into the actual building to be able to make this work mathematically. And then you can see we have on the left side, stairs that go down into the separate garden apartment and there's a gate there, and we worked with Public Design commission to make sure that the stoop and the stair are aligned and the fence with gates are again in alignment and then from working with them. On the public's perspective that they are in keeping with the rhythm of fences and stoops on the block, and they also, it also allows for a it's, a five foot hold from the tree bed to the start of the stoop. So there's more space now at this in front of this property for the public right away. Next, please and here's an elevation on the left is the existing higher fence and on the right is the new stoop with shorter fence and the entry to the basement apartment next side. Please, here's just a close-up of that view and there's flower boxes at the windows at the parlor and we're bringing the windows down a little to what they were at so they're at the floor of the parlor level right now, they're infilled, with some siding in between the masonry facade next slide. This just shows a section. We worked with a structural engineer on the left, you're seeing there's. Actually an old coal shoot that we found when we were in the cellar. So we wanted to repair that with DOT and infill it we had to submit a separate application to the Vault department. Even though it's not technically a vault, it's just a shoot, an old coal shoot, but we wanted to take care of that and make sure that there wasn't any hollow space underneath the sidewalk. So that's what you're, seeing on the left, where it says coal shoot and then the you see just the section at the stairs and how it sinks into the home to get the last couple of steps in the entryway. Okay next slide, please. This is part of the presentation they ask for a rendered elevation, so it shows the materials we decided to match. The sistering building on the right had gone through renovation in the early 2000s and they have brown over their lintel like a brownstone brown and black around their windows. So we're we thought it aesthetically looked better to match what they had and also. We think that the stoop helps you know. A stoop is traditional for New York City, and we think that this block, but particularly the south side, has lots of stoops and we liked bringing that element back in to the neighborhood and, of course it also the owners wanted it to. It gives a more elegant entry into that. Are you newly done yes now going in a lot of details which are not of our oh okay sure, then I'm done I believe the rest of the slides are just I, think you received them this morning and they're just the DOT drawings. So if we could just flip through really fast, it's the same same information, but this was this you're. Looking at right now is just presented. The requirements of DOT, and the first component was what Public Design Commission had us prepare. So I just wanted to show you everything, but this is simply a repeat of the first eight slides, thank you, and so the consent is for what the consent is for the stoop and the stair to the seller with the fence and there's two gates to allow to use the sidewalk right. Yes, okay, so I see, Dale has his hand up. Okay, thank you for the presentation and at some point, maybe when we're done we'll just we forgot to go around and introducing recognize all the members of the committee, I'm the co-chair. So thank you for the presentation. Julie, a question for you. So the existing fence is is on city property effectively. Is that right? That's right! We discovered it. I mean they purchased the home and it wasn't a topic. But on the survey we saw that it is city property, so both the neighboring in this in an instance like this, is the continued. The continuance of the fence like a grandfathered thing, or do you? Are you obligated to remove it once you started renovations, I? Think what I asked a question similar to Nick at Public, Design Commission, because I was wondering also for the neighbors, because they're non-compliant I think it's only if someone is filing complaints against it, because most passerbys wouldn't realize that it right it's not like you're saying well, we have to knock this fence down anyway, so we're going to do this. It's that we are actually replacing what we could presumably keep this fence, this tall fence, which and we're correcting the slight a slight lack of clearance space between the fence and the tree pit. Yes correct, and that was the round conversation we've had with D.O.T. That was all right, so Jeffrey so just to either. Thank you and one of the images that I was hoping for side by side. There's one that shows the side cut. What you're doing will create a five foot clearance between the new stoop and the tree pit correct. The current condition is less than five feet of clearance: correct, okay, so it's like on the order of like 410 or something like that or four nine. Is that what it is yeah, it's a maybe about four and a half inches of too tight and the history looks like to me. Those fences are tall. Fences were probably there from the 90s I. We were trying to find all pictures- the tree's probably newer, but it is a thick tree, so I'm not sure exactly when it was planted, but yeah okay, we got it so the deficit is yeah. Okay, I'm hearing that I have a question which is what. So. Why are those? Why are this change done? Is it cosmetic or is it that the organization of the building inside is changing dramatically it? The organization inside? That's a good question. The organization inside for the families going to live on the first and second third floor and they wanted a rentable space on the garden level because of the elevations we couldn't. We could have proposed a stoop, or maybe the tradition where you go, underneath the stoop to enter the garden, but there's not that height we're on a slope and there, but there is a door right now right there, there's it outside yeah. There is a door now. The history of the building- it is a two-family house currently in the way past I, don't know in the when exactly but the 1900s it was a SRO. But what's what and so I think that they over the years the entry changed and it's so they made it this informal entry where you go down and there's a lot of hallways and we were trying today there are two: let me clarify that because I'm getting a little confused here, there are two entrances today right. There is a door and there is another door going under it right. So there are two entrances today and no I'm sorry, there's not there's one entry door right now and on the inside, you have to there's there were holes in one entry door. That's the answer! There's only one entry door and we're making two, so you are creating two yeah. The second question is: how are you accommodating the ADA compliance on both of those doors? Oh, we don't for single family, you don't have to do it yet I mean. What do you mean? You don't have to I mean as a designer, not a single family, because you're going to have three families, single family and two family count the same. I've been working with DOB on brownstone renovations and they counted the same. You don't you technically don't have to accommodate, like you would in, of course, in a multi-housing building or a three family, you would have to have ramps or means, but the way we design inside is you know for aging in place and comfort, and we always like around doors. We have the ADA, but many of these buildings, including the way it was configured before you have to go down steps. When you open that door, you go down five steps, so you don't go in and the you don't go in and have a you're on the same story you have to so I was under the impression that when you renovate the building, you have to be ADA compliant and not for a single family, but you are going to have three different families living there right, two different families. It's a two thing because you mentioned three earlier: no I didn't mention three. Okay, there's three stories and the family: it's a couple with two kids: they have a it's still one. Second I got it. It's still unfortunate that people who may want to live in the second apartment can not be. You know a garden apartment downstairs right, it's not making it available if they want to rent it somewhat and doesn't make it available to people with ADA, so I personally I. You know that that's the concern I have, whether it's the law or not. This is a concern. I have well, the clearances are there inside so that it's comfortable. If someone, let's say it's, not someone in a wheelchair, I heard you obviously, but you can get to it. So it's football, but you can't get to it right, but that, but even currently, as it exists, there's stairs down when you walk into the front door. There's five stairs down no but you're we're not talking, but currently we're talking about I. Think Christine's trying to say that the this current project is a is an opportunity to cure what is current, as you are curing the sidewalk clearance and recognizing that it's not required by code with a two-family residence right, yeah but I just to clarify so the elevation change that will be happening now outside with the stoops is currently happening inside there are internal stairs and I recognize that your the large stoop is partially beyond the it's partially indoors. There's two steps indoors: I, take it or two steps beyond the lot line. Yes, okay, Vieren, sorry here and right, yeah! No, it's just a quick couple of questions. Have you already been to dote or you haven't yet? Oh you know what we've been working with, that we had a pre-review in December 2019 and then we've been working with them since March through the pandemic, like we've had 10 rounds with them. We also took it to the MTA because we're within 200 feet of a MTA, and then we took it to DOB and then back to DOT. We also had to do a vault application for the to fix the coal shoot and then they just introduced us to public Design Commission. So we, after all, that it's interesting because I work with landmarks, a lot and we work with landmarks up front with the community board and landmarks. But in this case it was reversed, like we spent a lot of time on all with all these agencies, and then we were introduced to public Design commission. We just changed things in the last two weeks to make it more aligned and I. Think there are improvements for the public I think. So. My second question is: do you have the permission to keep the friends? Because, typically you may not be permitted if it is actually encroaching upon public sidewalk, so the fence we didn't, we applied for a renovation on the interior, we didn't. We started talking to DOT right away and they said that we, you know, we knew that we had to talk to D.O.T, to apply for the coal shoot in the fence issue and the fence wasn't compliant at the tree. So it started like a series of conversations with got, but so what's the answer yeah, the question still reminds me: both DOB and Dod will have to approve you continuing the fans to encroach upon the public sidewalk. Have they approved it, because this entire conversation might turn out to be moot point if they disapprove it? Oh well, we already have approval on the renovation I think if I'm understanding your question, the building next door renovated in the 2000s they added a floor, they made it a single family and they still have that illegal fence. So I think that DOB doesn't necessarily ask questions about the fence. It's the realm of it's unfair, so they assume I'm sorry, I, don't think you are answering the question. Okay, the question is about D.O.T and whether they will allow you to continue to use the fence, and you know it would be a good idea to go back and ask them. You don't have to have an answer right away, but it would be a good idea to ask that if they haven't asked you right now, they can even after construction starts, so you're really better off clarifying that with both DOB and D.O.T. Okay, David is next. You are unmuted yeah, it's D.O.T that would determine about whether the fence is allowed, but you know, as far as the ADA I completely disagree, that you know that they should be required to make this ADA accessible. The exception for single and two family homes is long established. There's no reason for us to go beyond that. So, and you know my guess is: it would be nearly impossible to do anyway, but you know it's a brownstone with stoop and it's not a multi-family project and no, it's not with stoop yet well to get down. I assume that you have to go down those stairs to get to the lowest level and anyway I, regardless of whether it's possible I, don't think we should be requiring it. Nobody was out, nobody was suggesting a requirement. We were just putting it in the would be nice category. I! Think we are here to discuss transportation right, so transportation, we're not here to discuss the design of the building, we're not there to describe the Uob, we're not here to discuss any of that thing. So you know from a transportation standpoint and an accessibility, standpoint, I, don't know the rule I just think that it's bizarre, it wouldn't apply. That's right, interior. This I was surprised on the agenda because this to me feels very land use. But when we look through the transportation lens, we are gaining three inches of the sidewalk. So I, I'm not suggesting a decision. I'm just sharing my concern. Okay, we have not written the resolution or anything like that. It's just that transportation. That's actually a question. In my mind, Jeffrey I mean I recognize the deficit currently exists, but, as Viren pointed out, it is possible that it may not exist any longer if they are required to remove that fence or bring it back to the clearance line. So I mean it's. It would be nice to look at this and say: oh, it's win-win because they get their stoop and we get their our clearance. I'm not 100 sure, that's actually the case, so we should raise that David, Warren, hi I have a, maybe would be nice question and that's regarding and it's a little off topic it's regarding the trash. If, where would, if you could put the trash, maybe there's some programs coming about where maybe put the trash in the street or underground in the sidewalk, because the trash takes away walkway space from the community, so I know this is not a law. This is a would be nice type thing just want to get your opinion or put it in your mind, she's the architect, she's, not the opportunity, well, my opinion actually the owner's on here, but he has a you found. One of those you know there's that company that makes trash receptacles for residences and it would fit inside that fence area, so he's been considering it so I thought another pro to the fence idea: yeah, all right, I, don't see anybody with their hand raised from the public. So what's the general sense here I mean I, think we can summarize it by Jeffrey. Did you want to go ahead? No go ahead! Dale and then I'll probably want to just comment and add something I think we can summarize it by saying, assuming that this plan corrects the current deficit in sidewalk clearance. We approve. We can say that we, while we recognize that ADA compliance is not a requirement for this specific project. We would like to see going forward as many units as many rental units as possible be accessible for persons with disabilities. Yeah sounds good, I agree entirely, but I think that your latter half is out of scope for transportation to a pine I. Think if this, if we were in Chelsea land use, they would have every right to opine. On this. To me, it's a question of scope and the scope for us is the public right-of-way, which is the sidewalk. We can always ask for more when it comes to transportation issues, I think it's squarely a land-use matter. If we're going to start saying single-family, you know we should change long-established ADA compliance for single and double family homes, I mean Jeffrey. That's a fair point. Yeah and I agree completely with that. This is a total land use DOB issue. This is not a transportation well, with regard other than the sidewalk is I. Think that it's fair, the sidewalk is transportation and I appreciate absolutely we're taking it up in that regard, so we will stay in our lane and only discuss the clearance. My recommendation is that we should get clarity about fans being retained along right of way. Yes, that's. That is the first clarification that we need and it comes pretty much from D.O.T. Yes, that is. Our recommendation is subject to that. Not that information right and the reason why I'm pointing that out is I'll. Tell you honestly, when you send, in an application like this to DOT, more often than not, DOT doesn't check if you're actually encroaching upon right of way, because they assume this is an existing condition improving upon it and therefore it might be okay, but it might still be caught at the DOB. Eventually, it's like passively grandfathered effectively exactly I think that clarification would be helpful to everybody, including the owner, including the owners, because it will save a lot of time, okay but assuming, but if we just go down the assumption that, like DOB or Drt, says you got to remove that fence and bring it back to the clearance line. Isn't that the line we're talking about? No, the line is the building yeah, depending on how much you know. On the other hand, they are going to put the garbage into that area. So you know it's one way or another. That area is going to be lost, so I'm not necessarily not necessary Christine. Now, if it is, if the area away is not within your property, so grandfathered, then you're not allowed to keep your trash cans also. So if you remove the fence, yes does that go for Veron does that go for a replacement fence, or only if it's removed? No, you can replace the fans if you're not encroaching upon the public way, and you have the permit from D.O.T all right. Consider that to be a grandfathered condition and approve it. That is their call, and then they can do whatever they want to do. That's all I'm saying I'm not saying this is illegal. I'm not saying this is not acceptable. I'm not saying the D.O.T will disapprove I think to stick with Jeffrey's guideline, which is we're doing transportation. Let's stick with that. I think the summary of Dale was pretty good. You know what we said. We're going to do it, we're going to put a sentence in there right, yeah I would wrap what Dale summary was into a motion for a letter and I. Wonder if we can add the irony that this is called a revocable consent and yet they are constructing a stoop. There is an irony to the permit that the city issues here that they would literally have to demolish a stoop yeah, that's a revocable concept. I just think it's ironic, because usually it relates to planters movable infrastructure, not a built stoop and okay Geoffrey. The reason why they are saying it is because they are acknowledging the fact that it is actually going to encroach upon public relations. Yes, so we have a say so do we have a second on that I? Second, it? Okay, all in favor, aye, okay, opposed eyes, nice, who is opposed. No I think it was all Robert Walker, President, Hollande, President, okay, so this passage Jenny and you got the count yeah just to double check. No, was anybody opposed? No okay, yeah, okay, very good, all right! Well, thank you! Julie and Jason. Were you part of that? Thank you we'll leave! No! Yes, you thank you can leave me the meeting promises to be exciting you're going to miss it. Okay! Thank you! So what's the next one, this is next one is open streets open street on West 22Nd Street. What do we have? The applicant is Melody Brian, yes she's over. Why is this a question because the city is requiring partners what no they're? Actually just somebody coming and asking for a permanent organization? Oh okay, I just wanted to understand. I mean I, know melody. Obviously, but I just was curious of the angle, we're looking at it from thanks. Okay, melody! You have, you are muted right now. We can't hear you either on your computer. No, you might have to unmute the microphone not only on zoom but on your computer I wonder if the headphones are the problem she's there how's. That, oh, is that better? Yes, it's a pc, I'm not used to pcs, but I can't hear you guys enough hold on wait. Turn you up: okay, excellent. Okay! Sorry about that! It's Murphy's law! The floor is yours, okay! So, first of all, thank you very much for inviting me to present on West 22Nd Street Open street program. I'm a 30-year resident of the block and I wanted my neighbors to be able to socially distance during the pandemic. Our sidewalks are narrow, with trash and dog walkers and scaffolds, as are yours Janine. My producer is going to show me some pictures, hopefully Janine. Yes, I'm sorry just give me one second, because they're all different links. So it's going to take a few like a few seconds in between each one so bear with me gosh yeah. We have trash. We have dog walkers, we have scaffolding. Can you move it pictures there's to the right? Are you seeing the photos yeah good enough, so people were already walking on the street and an open street I thought would make it safer. Thanks to my local block, Association this committee and the mayor, the program launched in April Janine, you can, if you can find the other links of people enjoying the street. Yes, so people immediately took to it and began using the space. The block became a drop-off point for Revels families came from other blocks to teach their kids to ride bikes. They thought the city was going to do this for all the blocks in Chelsea and they were really disappointed to find out that you had to volunteer for it. I tried but was unsuccessful to enlist the blocks west of me to join the open street program, but I was able to facilitate a restaurant open street to the east of me, and it's going very well from on sixth avenue. So originally I was the only volunteer, placing the barriers from eight a.m to eight pm seven days a week, because that's what I requested but I live in the middle of the block, so I needed help to get there faster. If drivers left the barriers open, so I made a sign janine, you can show the sign. If you want there, we go there. We go so I made a sign and that's when I found out how many people really love this open streak neighbors pitch in all the time some of these are actually residents are actually turn out to be drivers who park on the street, but they like having a quiet street that they can also walk on with a pandemic, making it dangerous to petition I created a qr code and linked it to a petition hosted by Ta and put it on the barriers so Janine. If you can find that there it is within a month there were 50 signatures and more every day. So this is in terms of actually reaching out. I've been late to the game, but I'm getting more signatures every day and to blue to boost the blocks. Open street constituency I created a social media campaign with people in my neighborhood, and so here are some of them neighbors chiming in yes, these are merchants neighbors dog walkers, you know so, on a normal day, this block has up to five trucks for ongoing construction. Don't ask this is the most insane street in the city, but there's always something going on. So, as you can see, the difference now is that the workmen are getting their work done in peace and quiet and they don't have to run out interrupt their work to move their truck for some impatient driver who has to go through. In fact, the truck drivers have actually been the most compliant about closing the barriers because they know it's in their best interest and here's the traffic that doesn't make it onto this block. Let's see if we can play a video, it's just a few seconds. There should be an arrow on the upper right, there's a little blue circle. Oh okay, yeah! It's loading and that's just one light cycle, of course, so we're not likely to ever be a car free street, because there is a garage on the block which I've learned also parks its overflow on the block itself. So we have a lot more double parking than we used to have, but even with that, the street is more pedestrian and bike friendly with winter coming, and the surge coming with more time spent indoors I think it's even more important for people to have this open street to be able to walk on and socially distance safely. Thank you thanks Janine, my producer you're welcome so yeah. So damn you're go ahead, so melody. Thank you for the presentation, the as it stands. The open street program is set to expire. You asking or is that a or I'm asking I just want to know the I want everybody to be aware of the terms right. So the terms change all the time the petition is actually linked. The petition is actually linked to keeping it open after October 31st. So and as you probably know, open streets came before restaurant, open streets and the whole point was to socially distance and then when the restaurant open streets came in, they became the priority and for some reason we were linked to them when they were going to close, and then we were going to close so right now it's open-ended. We are there's actually a bill before the City Council to make them permanent and expand them, but that is still in the works it you know, people haven't quite it hasn't been raised. Yet so I want to be ready for when that time comes. So it's an unknown end date at this point and you're asking you're looking to make it permanent, I'm looking to make it permanent and also I, have to say it's among us open streets, people, it's kind of common knowledge that DOT will take your street away if you're not doing something with it. If they see you're, not maintaining it and the barriers are not taken care of and they're not placed, and you know so, I just want to go on record as saying you know, we have something. That's really working here: it's I'm not going to be able to do programming even with a special event. There's nothing I can do about the garage on the street. You know I'm not going to be able to go much further than this. Unfortunately, for now, I'm still hoping that the blocks west of me will join in, but that's not happening just yet Jeffrey about the garage on the street. Only because I'm curious about willingness and agreement was there, objection I mean was: did you talk to them at all? Just curious, I have not spoken to them. When the pandemic first happened and they were I know they were really hurting. They were closed on the weekends. They had a sign up, saying if you're using the garage you can come into this street. You know they were very. You know trying to get people in which I understood it was fine. The interesting thing about this garage is that it says you can park your bike there, but you actually can't they don't allow it. However, Amazon is there with all of these cargo bikes so that I'm just thinking that there may be a way to work with them. You know in other areas, so I haven't spoken to them personally, I, don't think they were big fans initially, but now they have so many cars they're literally using the street as well. Bravo, yes, David, Warren, hi melody. This is terrific. What you've done! Thank you very much. I also signed your petition today when I saw it on twitter. You know a little one thing that it drives me crazy and I saw it on street. Blogs is on the Upper West side. They tried the same thing and, like you were saying, if they don't maintain it, but I mean they're having volunteers. Do this? That's almost like having volunteers shovel the snow of the street for the cost storage. You know this should be something that's maintained by data or the city agency. We pay taxes, I, think it's great, that you're doing it, but I think it sets in a set. It might be setting a bad precedent because you're relying on volunteers, you know take that funding and take it away from you know other things, but I mean like it's no removal for cars. You know they don't sell the cars. Okay, you got to clean your own streets, take care of your own street, so no you're preaching to the choir, but thank you for what you're doing it's great and I. Don't see anyone in the attendees raising their hands so and melody? Are you in this discussion? Should we include the requests for upgraded materials for the gate? You know I actually, like the barriers that I have the police dropped off originally I had a wooden barrier, which was really heavy I used to have to get up at 6:30 and do pt so that I could move it, but now I, don't they dropped off some metal barriers and I catched one from the D.O.T which wasn't using it and then I found a couple of others when that one got destroyed by a car. My only concern is: if something happens with these, will they be cooperative in replacing them? I'm not sure when I spoke to the community relations guy at the precinct, he said well, we'll see what happens. It was very kind of trumpian, so I don't know that's. My only concern is that I can't get replacement, because these things don't last forever. Jeffrey I think that it's critical, we included in our letter that DOT replace if needed, and also that open street partners like this, should be considered for other infrastructure. As this as may become available by the city, a la a planter, hopefully, some type of standard barricade they're going to design, because Scarlett would like that and I just it's. We should be asking for that. All right. That would be great. That would be great. I mean I, have oh ear licking, you know, I would love to have you know, vision, zero bulb outs and some real daylighting on the corners one corner has a fire hydrant, so we're not going to be able to do much with that, but that's already daylighting automatically. So you know, I'm all in favor of that there and you were Karen was yeah. This is a quick question. I mean I. Definitely want to take you know. We should all take this opportunity to kind of take over our streets at the same time. Are we asking D.O.T about only one street or are we asking neighborhood-wide number of streets? That's my well I would say that. First of all, we need to ask for the streets that work, because if you ask for streets that do not work, it's a non-starter right. Yeah there are streets where it doesn't work, it didn't work, it failed and you know bringing that back. I think I would like to focus on the one that worked and say: okay, those works. Let's keep make them permanent and then, let's figure, what else we need to do in order to make the other one work, because if we start with, we want everything, they're just going to say: look half of them didn't work. So, let's focus on the one in my mind, let's focus on the one that worked I know, but the question is: have we done that kind of overview of streets that don't work or the states that work? Have we done that because we're talking about our community right I mean it's not just one block in one street and West 22Nd Street works and I'll. Tell you why? Because I'm on 20th street and some of the folks on 28th Street were you know: we've blocked off because of the police precinct, so it has kind of de facto become an open street, but I found out that West 22nd is actually selected, because NYPD would like that so there's a kind of subtext to the whole conversation yeah, but I mean you know. I can't deal with that. Let me say we had I had a discussion with Jesse and Janine about the whole this, whether we should really review everything- and you know, make a recommendation for everything and my observation was: you know when the street says I want to change direction, we don't invite all the street and say: is everybody want to change direction or you know, and then, when one street say I want a loading zone for parking, we don't invite everybody and say: is it working? What's not working but also I want to say that each street has a very different story, so you go to 44th street at the end of the day. Didn't want to do it. You go to 45th street. They thought they wanted to do it and they didn't want to do it. 51St street Christina. I'm asking this question only because it ties back into the equitable streets conversation that we want to begin to have. So you know if we are going to make one case example point out other possibilities, I'm all for it right. Okay, I'm just telling you what no, because the issue is much larger, it's not about loading and unloading base, because that's a very specific condition that you know it has. But people wanting to walk and want to occupy streets for a variety of reasons and social distancing. Is such a common cause right, but you know I think we need to open up that conversation. That's what I'm saying yeah! You know I'm very shy right now about that, because we were all done the whole in four or five months ago when it seemed like it was a no-brainer right and the what happened is that at the end of the day, very few streets worked, even though we asked for a lot, and it seems that we have a big disconnect between you know, and especially the issue is opening I mean many opening and closing the street and I think we need to find a solution to that before we go and try to go across the board and expand on that. It seems that there is a big issue there and you know we testify on that was one or two months ago. So the point I'm making is that we have to keep hammering it so yeah, no I get it I think we can support this specific block and also, you know, develop some language to say. We would love to encourage this block to continue in its success with an open street so that others may follow suit to that degree as a model, because I agree with you veren it is, it should be larger, but you know that I don't want to say that the program was sabotaged from the outset. Although that is a dynamic, we see a lot with city programs that when there's like contested like conflict, they say well, we'll just make we'll make them do this, and none of them will actually get it done and then we'll kill open streets. I'm not saying that's what actually happened, but it's possible, but you know the hoops that everybody had to leap through to get an open street running and functional were were fairly high during a pandemic, so I, you know I would say we can develop some language in the letter. In our resolution that addresses your concerns, I think we need to repeat again that you know the how the streets are open and closed or you know it is an issue and they need to address it. Sorry, it's also an opportunity to claim at least one of the parking lanes for other states, even if they can't become open streets. Oh now, if you open the parking line now you are losing everybody, yeah I agree. The thing is that you know you want when you actually want to support something. At the same time, two more things being added to that list might not hurt, because I think it just makes a larger point that we really want to reclaim part of the street which should be reclaimed because there is actually a problem. You know we have we're talking about gap, you've been offense, we agree there and we agree. I, just think that, right now and I think Dale had a very good suggestion which says you know we want that to remain, because it has been a big success in our neighborhood right. We want to make sure that Ut is going to stand around and support the barriers and replace them etc, and we want to make sure they are going to continue to work to make the model work for more streets right and what other things are they going to do to work for more streets, which is less people intensive like when everybody doesn't have a melody right? This is, and it's only one block I mean West. End Avenue is a huge boulevard, even bigger than 34Th Avenue. You know without the median, so that's a huge lift, so these are huge lift and they need to. You know, I think they put their foot in the door, and now we need to open that door a little further as you are suggesting in our recommendation, so I mean I'm just trying to get this confused. So what you're saying is at some point, DOT or some city agency will maintain it also because, like you said earlier, not everyone has a melody in that. No. But if you go to like the union square right now, which is a shared street, there is nobody at the entrance right and there is no barrier that you have open to open and close. So you know we need to have stronger signage. We need to make it look more official right. It needs to say no to the cars you can't get in and then there may need to have a chicane or something like that at the entrance, so that the cars really know they can't enter and it make it difficult for that and those standards are not developed yet, but I think we should advocate for them. I mean in effect, there's a chicane with the different pieces of the barrier, fencing right, because they're kind of staggered out and I do have trucks that have to come through. I mean that's just the fact that they do have to be removed, but I had a question about I. Don't think it's the case, but I just want to double check. You don't have a turn lane a designated turn lane onto your block. Do you yeah? No okay, just I'm going to just bookmark this for future reference. I think there is a block that is an open street that has a it was the 17th street. Yes, maybe 26th 17th Street had their turn lane right. Yeah I, like the idea of also having like signage at the turn lane onto an open street. That says you know this street. That's what Jeffrey did he closed the turn right? What about having a swing gate, so they wouldn't have to lift up the gate and it would just open the car would open and then someone just has to sh it shuts again, I'm not talking about a large gate, but like I, don't know what you call it's like thin. You know they have them in different. Like places has something like that yeah, so I don't know that we can design the whole thing. Let's agree that you know the resolution maybe is about I mean somebody summarized the resolution. It's about. Do I, see anybody who opposes doing the the open street permanent everybody's in favor. So this is a matter of crafting a resolution that says we're in favor. We applaud it's very you know, people intensive, we need, we need better solutions and we certainly need better, more official markings and more official signals that tells the drivers not to go through. You know somebody makes a resolution with that. Make that resolution and add the idea would be like fit swing. Gate doesn't mean that you have to do it, but that would be the right concept, but I. That's I make a friendly amendment to your thing and I make the resolution we can second make it. We can I suggest that the angle be like a pr suggestion to DOT in terms of developing permanent infrastructure and elements for the open streets program and finance, Jeffrey and financially and official signage, because no right turn and no entry. These are the two things you need yeah as much as I, like your sign, melody yeah, I'm not an artist saying no one trained that in that street. You know whatever and cobblestone right. Oh no, let's make it very expensive right, just kidding. Who is somebody? So we have a motion, I'm not supposed to do that. But do we have emotion, yeah I hate that motion? Second? Yes, second, all right, all in favor, aye and melody Bravo for doing it tremendous there should be an open streets award for you, yeah, 34Th, Avenue and Avenue. Thank you for doing that. Thank you. Okay, I'll be jumping off in a few minutes. Okay, but we're on to helicopters where I also have a lot to say: oh she's, on the helicopter right yeah. So do you depart at Hudson River park to so that everybody remember? Last month we sent two letters, I think one to the governors of both of our states saying you know we have so many flights and it's unbearable. We know that Gail Brewer has been working on that and maybe in fact, in the attendees we have Brian Lewis. Do you want to give us an update on that? You want to bring Brian in Janine, I'm transferring. He should be awesome, yeah, hi everybody, so I don't have much in the way of specific details. Beyond that we are trying to get in contact with the New Jersey officials. We're also continuing to talk with the Faa about it. We will be resuming our helicopter task force. We don't have details about you know what time or day, but we are going to be resuming that, but at this point yeah, it's basically making sure that we have all the stakeholders ready to resume talks in these task force meetings and then the other person I just moved in is the co-chair of quality of Life Alan Uster, who has been working on that and I wanted Alan to tell us what he thinks. We should be how we can help at transportation. Thank you, Christine I wasn't expecting to be called in, but it's it. You know what it's more of a federal problem, it's more of our congressional representatives to get involved. These are fba flight patterns that the tourist helicopters from Jersey are using, as opposed to the New York City mandated flight patterns that the east side and the downtown teleports are using, which not cross over Midtown, not to say that they don't but they're different flight patterns. So we you know we need to get our congressional people on track. I. Don't think you're going to get anything out of Faa until the administration changes next year, so but I think they need to get on it in terms of getting the New Jersey tourist helicopters. I understand that nather has a bill in the works yeah, that's what we have. No, he has a bill in the world personally, I, don't think anything is really going to change that much until yeah new administration takes place, but they have to keep the pressure on yeah, so Sarah, hey hi. Did you raise your hand? You wanted to talk? Oh this was earlier. We kind of moved on to the top okay yeah I was just wondering like if there is in fact opposed to the council legislation we should like if we could just like, send a letter to actually like push our council member to endorse it. We did that last month, yeah but I mean if there's no fault, yeah no I, think the issue with the heliport and as concerned, you know, if we're going to stay in our lane as transportation is that the heliport, the 30th Street teleport, provides transit to and from airports. Mostly and some private charter flights to far-flung places like the Hamptons or Newport, and it is like when they land- and maybe melody- can speak to this a little bit when they land when they come in to the to land at 30th street. Sometimes they have to like based on the winds. They have to make some maneuvers that seems to either endanger, or otherwise like interfere with the quiet enjoyment of the park. That's you know that it's in so I think there was at some point a suggestion that the help would not be at 30Th. Street Jeffrey has some yeah I'm going to get Jeffrey to come, so you're done, Dale Jeffrey the heliport was supposed to close and move. You know when the Hudson River Park Act was signed. We have two I see it as two problems, and actually the trust is the Hudsonville Park Trust is part of the problem in the sense that the heliport is a tenant and the trust needs money and I can not fault them for needing money. It's their revenue stream. Their tenants are their key revenue stream, and so how can we break the lock between the trusts needing the revenue of the heliport which actually pays a market rent, as opposed to many tenants that actually the way you look at it kind of do not recognizing that Dale? There is no quiet enjoyment of the park in that area of the park because of the highway and also the heliport itself. There were proposals a number of years ago to actually put the heliport 100 yards 500 yards I forget what it was into the river actually and the helicopters would be landing in the river and then the passengers would be shuttled on a boat to shore. I, actually think that could work, but it could complicate Coast, Guard waterway issues. Second, from that, I think that what melody's neighborhood and I she keeps being called in particular just because we know where she lives I think it's had a lot more to do with NYPD helicopters in the past several months and news helicopters in the past several months then just hold on I'll acknowledge that in a second then just blade and the private charters from 30th in the river. So we have a double-edged sword. I want the park to have revenue to do park things. The problem is one of their tenants is a not appropriate park. Tenant, hey Jeffrey I have a question before you. We go the lease of the heliport. One is the renewal date. I will try to find it right now and come back. I'll come back to you, because that would be a time where we have leverage right. Where I mean there were the court cases right. There was numerous court cases about the heliports, and then there were stays on the court cases and a lot of the work got consolidated to Wall Street or the. What is it 33rd street on the east side? And there was it's important from the standpoint of what you're talking about is revenue of the park. The fundamental point is: where is you know? When is the renewal? If there is no renewal for 30 years right, then I mean we don't have any leverage. We don't have leverage there yeah. If we have a renewal in five years or in ten years, we need to start to line up stuff to do so that you know options etc and say: okay, are we, you know you need to get you. We need to tell them to get ready for that and put them on notice that possibly there is not going to be a renewal, and then we have a discussion with the governor about the money right, yeah, Christine, yeah. First thing Jeffy, you may want to check in your computer right now. There was an amendment to the to the act a couple years ago that I think Gottfried submitted, which gave the teleport renewable forever just about so that should you should be able to access that pretty quickly, but a couple issues with the heliport, the 30th street helicopters. From my experience do not fly over Midtown, they either come from Jersey from the airport, so they go up and down the river, so they're not really affecting Midtown. The issue that my dale brought up in terms of landing is a good question, because over the past year and a half I've been tracking the incoming flights, the idling times that I submitted a long time ago to I think to approximate at some point and also to the trust. So you have guidelines, I'm sure, from the Faa how you're supposed to approach a landing area, and you also have guidelines from the Faa as to how long you're permitted to idle on the tarmac there and over the years that I've been tracking him. You have helicopters that sit there for five minutes and you have helicopters that I live for 20 minutes and prior to the pandemic. You could have three or four helicopters on both sides of the trailer iving there for 10:20 minutes. Also, you have helicopters that come in at a 30 degree angle, as opposed to come in coming in at a 90 degree angle. You know straight into the and it doesn't really affect that much by the wind occurring, because they just do it all the time- and you know you have all this surf coming up over the walkways so a lot of times. This is helicopters, giving people a little bit of a show. They go over pair 66, the frying pan, so it's kind of a game a lot of times. That's going on with the with these things, so I think the first thing. What we probably want to do, I know if it's transportation or if it's wpe, we need to know what the guidelines are. What are they supposed to be doing? The other issue is a safety issue with the heliport, because you've got cars coming in prior to the pandemic. You had cars coming in and out into the parking area to a point where, on our suggestion, the trust went and asked them to put a flag person which they did for quite a while. So you know, there's a number of safety issues, there's a there's, an eight to ten thousand gallon fuel tank that sits at the southern end of the heliport that the gate is basically secured with a with a padlock. So I hope. No, you know. So there are issues in there that somehow, just you know just don't get addressed, don't you know nobody's up out there. Looking at back last year, when we had the U.N in session, they were t, they were ta agents, they were government agents, there were people checking cars coming in and out for who for an occasional delegate that would come in by helicopter. So if that's good enough for them, why aren't they checking cars coming in and out for for the people that use the park every day? So there's a lot of issues with the heliport. It seems that the east side and the West side heliports, because they're run by the city. Basically they provide more information. You can. You know right away how many flights are coming in and out where the flights are coming from. So the heliport, basically blade is running. Its own operation seems to me without any real scrutiny or or oversight. Alan I think that's really helpful information for us as transportation to frame our letter. As you know like looking at the heliport as a transportation asset and saying it is deficient in the as a transportation asset. It is deficient in the following ways and you know basically what you just outlined as far as like operating safely and operating within standards, and we can look to. We can look to try to find those standards, but I think that's our I mean we can do something jointly, but I think that's our tack as the transportation Planning Committee, which is to say, like you, are a transportation asset in our community and you are failing our community in the following ways: Dale I'll give you another one if I may interrupt yeah since the city does consider this part of the whole transportation network, why aren't they paying taxes to go to the subway system in the mayor's transit like that they're, taxing taxi cabs? Isn't there a tax on taxi cabs? Now they passed last year, sometime, okay, but now we're opening like a big can of worms because it opens to the other. You know the other heliports, so I think it would be probably better to just narrow it down to just the issues operational issues. What bill was saying, I'm just throwing it out as another question. I totally appreciate that point, but I think our purview is going to be like you are a deficient operator right Jeffrey. What did you find? Only the cost, not the term, yet I'm still looking, but just on Allen's point. There is it's the tourism flights and I kind of have an issue with blade, but at the same time they're, actually not tourism. That's actually in a it's a transportation use as much as I think it's a superfluous and luxurious one. It's the tourism flights that are the problem, but it's not. There is no tourism flight on this heliport, so, which is why it's almost that 30th street heliport isn't. The issue is that tourism flights can pretty much do what they want, based on those Faa guidelines from New Jersey we're not talking about the one coming from that's a separate. That's we've a separate issue right, we're just talking about who is landing and who is taking off from the 30th street. You know basically we're mad at all the helicopters and we've already addressed the tourist flights with last month. Is there a way to get any like a safety EIS study here and have it become illegal to operate a helicopter in an area so close to the greenway the highway? You know, there's? Is there a way we can throw a wrench, a very technical wrench in terms of secret or some kind of review, to find a way to actually block this carefree Jeffrey just write, one very quick point to that: I think the EIS is a very good point. There is an environmental issue with the Harry Potter and the noise. It actually is very bad and Hudson River Park. Trust knows this is very bad for the sea life below and the fish is trying to actually breed alongside the river and the Oyster Bay Parks I mean oyster bays and every all those cool things that they're trying to do so. There is a larger point: I think we will. We would probably have much better success if there's a joint letter between transportation and Waterfall, Waterfront and Park Committee, and get this environmental issues into play as well. So what should we? Let waterfront and park, discuss that first and then join them into a ladder, or should we have just the ladder here, which is pure transportation, saying this is not a good operator and what Dale said. You know that same enumeration of things and keep it that way and then, once once the waterfront looks at it from an EIS standpoint, but then you know waterfront is going to have the same issue that Jeffrey was talking about, which is they want the money and they want it gone and it's a considerable revenue stream yeah for them. My question back is like we need to get to know when we are going to have I mean I. Think Alan's point was good, so should we understand from the lease what are the guidelines of the operation right? There are steps, their stipulation and second, should we understand. When is the the next anniversary of the lease or whatever and I? Think if we have that, then we can have a bigger discussion, but right now could we could have just an operational letter which says these things are not good right, the only issue being that there's multiple operators at that at the 30th street terminal. No, but then there is only one lessee, so the people who would go to the it would go to who's leasing. This the airplane is the leaseholder, and then they have a bunch of sub-tenants right. I have the names? Okay. Can you just tell me again, just so I can put in my note, what's the name Air Pegasus, okay, but the name of the people who are on the thing they are in the press. You can find them. Wherein did you raise your hand again? Yeah? No I just wanted to say that this is also a quality of life issue in a major significant way, not only for humans, and we can keep talking about revenue for the Hudson River park, trust, but there might be other ways of channeling that and or finding ways so that they can. We don't think that just stop this operation tomorrow, but find ways to displace them and then place. Something else actually can help. You generate revenue. Nypd two-pound is going to hopefully come back to a sniper podcast and that would actually help them generate more revenue as well. Maybe that's where we could put the edit port. Also, you know I wonder if I can't go on top of a related building. I have another proposal: Jacob Jarvis Convention center roof. There is no oh yeah right. Yeah do you know there, but David has been waiting. Yeah differently end up for like 20 minutes. Yes, there might be some federal regulations dealing with the wildlife and the sea, and you know once Trump is out. That's what Viren no, but I'm saying so. What we could do is send a letter to just both U.S senators and to our Congress people to make sure that's enforced by the time that happens, Biden will be inaugurated and then they can handle it that way. So they, you know this takes a long time. That's how they got rid of the West Side Highway. Well, they found some fish. We were suggesting that it should go to the to the Parks Committee to discuss those things, because we are not the experts. It's not a transportation issue. A side highway fell down within the fish. No, but I mean they were going to rebuild it again and they got denied because, okay, so do we have to put it underground. It was going to be underground. So Dale, you made a very good summary of three items. Right: it was flight patterns. This was the air quality and the security I think we're going to address a letter to Pegasus to the lessee and also highlight the fact that they have sub-tenants who are operating outside the bounds of you know, safe and and and unobtrusive operations, and that they're deficient in the following ways: there have been reports of hovering or flybys and also the conflict with driver, drop-offs or pickups, and also the noise issue and say you know we as the transportation Planning Committee asked you to correct these deficiencies. Yes, okay, do we have a motion, somebody vote for that? So moved? Okay, we have a second, yes I'll. Second, it all in favor, hi, okay, opposed present non-eligible done, who commutes by helicopter the cops have so many and we have none. We have anybody who wants to talk as a new business in the attendees. Can you raise your hand? No, nobody is raising their hand, I, don't see. Yeah I, don't see the okay. He was struck. Yes, okay, do we want to have a motion to adjourned? Can I just send my new business to put on our radar for the future? We talked about this last month, but I really would like the committee to think a bit more comprehensively about the pier 79 Barry Terminal and the MTA M42 terminus site and thinking about do we want to recommend consolidation in the interest of creating more park space actually or how do we want to I would like the committee to think this through I, don't know who the appropriate guest would be to talk about it or guests, plural, but I do think it could be a good use of our recommendation. Given the improvements to the m42, the increase in ferry service, we will one day anticipate at 79 and you know I think many of our preferences to eliminate or dissolve the waterway shuttle system in favor of folding it into public transit. Okay, I mean is that would we have somebody here from D.O.T or MTA I think we first have to have people from the trust, because we need to understand what's happening there, don't we and how I guess those two terminals which are just a block of terminals, I, say loosely a block apart, how they work and now what's going on between them and what is the open space? And you know, what's the space occupied by what and it's all on parks on the trust space most of it I, don't think all of it is but I think you know a lot of. It is right, so I think it's multiple guests. It sounds like it would be the trust we would need city D.O.T, CDC had jurisdiction on that pier due T2 yeah I mean the list would be long so I wonder it's horrible, yeah I agree, but there's something to be said for consolidating that and finding a way to eliminate a redundancy and service there, and it would improve the conditions for access to the park for pedestrians. It would improve the safety of the greenway well and especially with the context of pier 76, also changing of use exactly now. You have a whole context here, which is not the same anymore right. You need to figure how this whole thing is going to work. I mean another question is, and this was brought up at a Hudson River Park Advisory council meeting was a request to do an entire study to redo route. 9A, you know from the battery to the uses have changed from the 80s and I know. You laugh at that Christine. No, I'm not laughing I! Think you're right, I'm just hey Jeffrey one of my studio that urban design studio at G5. We actually talked about potentially next 50 years time that highway is going to become a parkland with automated vehicles, partly moving up and down. So there are a lot of ideas, yes and I'm not going to be around to see that, but you know that's where conversations are actually going. Just one quick thing that I wanted to let the committee know my students currently are looking at Ps76 redesign, actually and Hudson River Park trust came and made multiple presentations and I think we should invite them to this committee for a presentation so that we understand how they are looking at these three different conditions that Jeffrey just described the two ferry terminals and ps76 right I. Well, you know I called Noreen the other day and said Noreen when you change pier 76, the access is going to be different and it's going to be very important that we understand how it goes. She was pretty. She was a little bit defensive. Let me just say there is on the line. The governor is very interested in making changes at pier 76. There is no commitment whatsoever to any money or any actual timeline. So it's great we're getting all the attention and all the press, but there's no money and there needs to be a lot of money to take down the pier shed. The tow pound is going to take a year plus to move once we even have a site. It's my understanding. We're we may be getting an update from the NYPD in December at health, kitchen land use about tow pound relocation. So there's ideas, but nothing is concrete right now and there's no money. That's the problem. Sorry quirks had a presentation parks had a presentation last week about the idea of when the peer shed comes down interim uses and just understanding what interim means the two concerns were. We don't want a sacred cow, a la peer, 40 and soccer fields that are too beloved to ever. Have any changes happen to the pier which is exactly what's happened down there and then a real commitment to ensuring that interim use is flexible and also understanding that any process towards the permanent park goes through the standard process that we always have had to develop: a pier, a La Pier, 7, pier 97 up in hell's kitchen and 64 and 84, and all that okay. So it wasn't a concrete plan presented. It was yeah, okay paint, but still I'm concerned from a transportation standpoint, because even if we have paint you are going to have more people coming right instead of cars, and so we just need to understand how that works, because this area is horrible, we know it's horrible. Do you think that we once there's an understanding of what the interim use looks like then? It's then we get to transportation, gets to say well, if you're going to have a track and you're going to have a kid's playground, you know whatever you're going to have. This means this, and so we have to suggest that that's what I told her and I said you know we better think about I said you really need to think about it. You know, where is your entrance going to be yeah? Where is it close to the buses? Is it close? To the other I mean this place is not designed for people, and so once you in you know inject a people use there. Where are they crossing the highway yeah, you know 38, you cross the highway. You go nowhere right yeah, so you are going to have to funnel people, even if it's with cones or something like that, it doesn't have to be expensive, but you have to think about it. I think it's remarkable. We actually are having the conversations on this scale for the first time and right so I think maybe Jeffrey your idea of saying. Okay, let's have a global discussion from pier 76 to 42nd street. For this whole area, at least from a transportation standpoint. The only thing is: I think that there's the 79 should come sooner than 76, because there's direct encouragement we can make as it relates to the ferry shuttles and the M42 consolidation in terms of sites. I, just don't want to know yeah I, don't want to preclude anything that should be done later. You know true, we just don't know what the interim use and then the development at 76 might look like, because 76 technically, as the law has been up a maximum half. However, one of the proposals is, for you know: 20 development 80 park space. So there's you know, there's multiple ways that I think it's going to be looked at, but no question transportation is going to have to be considered because of the use change. The massive use change in it for the better provided it's comprehensive, yeah, okay, ready to go I mean, let's tear that dead down. I sent you an invite for my studios presentation next month. If you guys want to join I, will share the link. Yes, please yeah, it's going to be online, some fun ideas. Students have looked at Ps76 in a very unique way: you're going to be falling off your chairs, but it's fun. The pier is huge and it will be it's incredible. How much space that will eventually be I think we should have a tropical forest. We could it's that big people go and hiking in there yeah pristine yesterday. Just so, you understand the scale. It's one and a half times a typical city block. I know it's enormous. All of that for cars, hey, okay! I'm calling you to adjourn motion to adjourn Janine. You have everything you need for votes, yep got everything. Thank you have a good holiday everyone. Okay, thank you! Everyone, transportation. Another great meeting, thank you for coming.
