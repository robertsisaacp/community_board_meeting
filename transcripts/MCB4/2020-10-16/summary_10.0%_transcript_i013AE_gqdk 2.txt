Everyone's going to stay muted throughout the meeting, except for whoever is speaking after the presentation committee will have an opportunity to ask questions or comment, and then members of the public who are identified as attendees on zoom can ask questions or comment.
We have been open throughout the pandemics serving the community 70 of the patients that come to our center reside in CB4 or around CB4.
If anybody you know anybody who needs pediatric vaccinations, please have them come to the center behavioral health integration, so ryan , Chelsea Clinton uses a collaborative care model where the provider, a social worker and a psychiatrist discuss the patient's needs.
We are part of the state's cancer screening program, which provides uninsured patients over the age of 40, with free cancer screenings, and actually, today we had our Mount Sinai Mammogram Van. I think we saw over 25 people over 25 patients receive mammograms in front of the center.
You know what we recognize is that assistance to addition to clinical services and primary care services we provide, as I'll point out later on the social journalists of Health Transportation.
Food insecurity are just important to somebody's health as them getting a check up every year, so we have identified that need and applied for grants or provided resource or obtained resources to help with patient navigation.
So, it's a screening tool to assess a patient's social determinants of health right, as discussed before our outreach team and our patient navigators connect the patients to community resources within their zip, code.
We work well with you, know, breaking ground housing conservation coordinators and make referrals for the services that the patients need.
We, also connect, folks, with health insurance applying through the marketplace and as well as I said before, Snap and pantries in the neighborhood other services that we that we provide include, transfer arranging transportation.
Know: immigration law, not criminal, law, also providing assistance and support, as I touched this before, from phones to referrals, to behavioral, health, nutritionists, employment, assistants and such go to the this And it'll give them the resources in their area that they're most interested in About, 400 or so searches, and the most popular things that people were looking for was connection to housing, food security as well as health insurance, connections.
So we've been able to reach out to people who've used that platform and follow up with them and see if they were actually connected to those services on site.
So she's, going to talk about community outreach right, now, So I mentioned this earlier today in our in our other meeting, but we've started a new collaboration with breaking ground and we've been using our mobile unit and visiting different areas of different hot spots in Midtown and kind of closer to Chelsea area So places where there's high rates of homelessness reported high incentives of substance use, as well as people who are accessing free meal services through local churches and other pantries, and with pairing with breaking grounds.
We have a mobile medical van that goes out and does all these also provides all these services, as showing said- You know he goes to Hudson guild breaking ground- We brought the Van to the people of bringing the people to us, and this is a great way how we can help the community beyond the four walls of the center.
You know what the next day was going to bring, but there are going to be throws of people coming to get tested.
Tell, your friends and family, get your flu shot, so we're going to We're developing a partnership with New York City Department of Health Mental hygiene, we're probably going to open up the center for about eight saturdays that we're not usually open and just do mass flu shots for the for the neighborhood so more to come on.
So right now we're about at our center about 21, which is kind of what that what the rate is for Manhattan, so in general, a little bit higher than for what the West side is so, but We, but, as people know, cover 19, has been disappointingly impacting individuals from communities of color individuals who have less access to things to overcome social determinants of health, so health center patients are more likely to have Covid-19 than individuals with private doctors.
We have psychiatrists that are 96, I'm, sorry 100th in Amsterdam, so we can make referrals up there , There's: a shortage of psychiatry and community settings, so Also you know-- are we do have a social worker on site once a day.
You know, that's a big issue for us in the community I mean we see we're seeing more homeless people or who identify as homeless at registration.
If, you know, people who lost their job and do not have insurance or need access or recently obtained Medicaid tell them to come to us if they live in the neighborhood.
If you know, people who need health, insur health care, send them to us or their nearest community health, center.
Parents, families, people who are living by themselves, I do get nervous that the state of New York is experiencing an unprecedented deficit in terms of funding, and will they reduce funding to health or social services in general?
There is a city testing site which I have the address in my office, not in my bedroom, the Chelsea center, it's on 28th and 9th thanks a little part of it.
Next, on the agenda, we have a committee discussion regarding homelessness, and, while I know Joe. You want to put the letter up so while we're, Actually, it's in the letter, but I- think I wanted to share anyway with committee, because I'm not sure.
If not more, we highlight the number of social services in Community, board, 4 and that have already existed, and then we add in the significant increase due to the relocation sites, and we talk about what our main concerns.
The idea that these temporary relocations happen in a very unordered unplanned way and when you put it in perspective, the city noted that it relocated approximately 10,000 single adults in shelter and to our neighborhood That is roughly 20 of the entire relocation it did in the city of New York, and that's why I believe we have our problems regarding this public safety issues, because it was not planned, not thought out and the building types that folks are relocated into for the providers and the shelter residents are just not adequate or properly programmed.
Like I know you guys- have done so much work Do. You want any of us to volunteer to help attend or cover that would be great We're supposed to start in October?
Ab meeting, meaning the Community Advisory Board meeting for all the shelters together and Jesse's going to be running that so having more than one of us on that would be excellent because the problem is there's so many hours in a day , I'm sure, with our letter, requested a meeting with the mayor and the Commissioner Steve banks.
I believe it was on 36Th, Street, and I know that they're going to be using be able to use like Metro Baptist space starting this month for some programming.
So the question is: Why has it improved and can that whatever work there can that be taken to other problematic shelters like 6Th, Street, great question, jd, something that actually Joe has discussed it and talked about it before openly in meetings?
And, I think, really sitting down with the mayor's office in DHS and coming up with a plan as to how we're going to manage this.
Has it in his power to assist in the density issue, to assist in working with DHS on these facilities, providing the services needed for the public safety of those residents and the other residents within the community, so Cory's office is there.
I just think that we're starting to get some ideas here at the next letter coming out of this committee for this month, and that is for a meeting of all the elected officials with the board to really sit and respond to us on the letter that we sent we're.
There were two things right and a chart showing the 20 of the city, which is an amazing statistic and also maybe like the 10 qualities that make for a successful facility or something So saying now that we've asked for this meeting with the mayor's office and the administration also meeting with our elected officials to deal with this, because we have to keep the pressure up to get people to engage.
People on 36th Street now on 10th Avenue is a little bit better, but who knows, as we have to get some standard practice on how things are managed, otherwise we're going to go down to a black hole, again wait!
We, are super clear on what the concerns are and it's you know around 36th and 37th street, and while I certainly appreciate it's a good idea to ask for a letter, I, actually think that it would be lovely and faster.
And I think if we just make a very specific proposal and ask them to sign on to it, as opposed to like come talk to us, some more because I we've done the work, we know what needs to be done.
You see that Maria the hands up and start bringing people in one at a time, I can not tell you what it is like to listen to this meeting and realize how profoundly you understand the issue that we're facing on 36th, Street, and I thank each and every one of you are everything that we hope for in a democracy.
The shelter at the doubletree, the homeless services pulls up in their Van. Briefly, and I want to go out and say: why are not you here, 12 hours before, when we have 40 guys standing doing Chin ups under the block, they are increasingly angry and increasingly they have not been treated, and so it's gotten it's very different now than it was in June, because they're desperate and that's why we see people assaulted.
I do not know what the community board continues to hear from the public, but I'm gauging it's a lot, but I got to say so much of what's going on our street constantly in a 24:7 hour period is not reported.
We have to have some hard discussions, which I see that the community board is willing to do, and I want to let my other fellow neighbors speak, but I would just ask that, when those conversations do occur, that a the community board is in the room, as I'm sure they would be, and I'd also just like to request that someone from 36th Street be in the room to give the perspective of what it's like as a resident to to be living on this block.
I'm just wondering if I need to start timing, people what I'm going to ask.
But it also is that the police department, my wife and I- have seen people arrested and literally back on the street three hours later, not even like nothing happened and the cops they come.
So I know New York, one and gothamist have had some information on what's going on around here, but there's far less buzz in the media concerning our neighborhood than there has been for the upper West side, which is has as everybody's remark, is a much less serious situation.
You know the police take their take their direction from the mayor's office, We could get more support and the Midtown south precinct is on 35th street.
Their driveway comes out onto 36th street on this block and they are not getting the direction or the support from the mayor to actually be able to do from a safety.
The issue is there's too many people, and so these little fixes here It would make 36th street safer to walk down like I.
The majority of affordable housing produced in our district is for that people is for 60 percent of AMI to 50 of AMI, meaning a family of four making less than like 55,000 a single person less than 42,000.
Maria Joe are not we one of the community boards that have the highest number of affordable housing or new developments coming up in or in the city.
We actually has the highest number of rent new rents of rent stabilized units and that's directly related to the affordable housing production that happened through the rezonings of West, Chelsea and Hudson yards, and it's really made a major difference, but I think it's time to help for the public to see.
You do not even feel safe, walking down the street just from Covid-19 I mean I, guess that could happen too, but just fearful of for my health I'm, going to give other people a chance to speak, angela.
You just want to know thanks all the residents for coming tonight and being serious, and it is very hard for all of us on this committee.
It's also about the culture that the nonprofit providers, have, and I, want to highlight the thing to me Is how this impacts the residents of the block, everything that they're saying I They're, not exaggerating, including from what I've heard from CB4 members who live in the community, including like, for example, someone told me.
I, do not walk down that street anymore unless I'm with my husband, So I, just want to highlight that this has serious impact on the permanent residents who live on the block, and I am glad and thankful, and appreciative of everyone who spoke tonight, keep coming back to our meetings.
You know when all said and done, and we hopefully come to some kind of resolution for this homeless crisis that we're having in your communities like 36th, Street and some of the other locations.
Keep these items still front and center that we've always advocated for the top ones from this committee have been very specific projects on affordable housing, but they've also been on improvements within NYCHA, and then we also highlighted a lot of issues and concerns for prevention of homeless services and maintaining programs that that keep people.
We vote for continuing support for these number of affordable housing developments and then continuing support on the expense side for the homeless, for the prevention issues and the mental health that we've asked for before, and then anything else we'll have one more go: right, Jessica to be able to add anything else new, or are we at the point where we really have?
, two months in a row, continuing support on the affordable housing and some of the services and then the new ones, just you can just put them in and we'll ask the budget Committee to try to synthesize.
