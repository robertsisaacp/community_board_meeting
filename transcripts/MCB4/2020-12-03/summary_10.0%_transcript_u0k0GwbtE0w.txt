I'm, just kidding good evening, everybody, temporary stand-in, welcome to the December meeting of Manhattan community board.
We did receive two names of people who had registered to speak at this particular public hearing, but I'm not convinced that they were registered for the right part of the meeting.
I'm, going to call the names I have for public session, but just make sure you if you've got the four names here, I'm gonna ask everyone to put their hand down, and then the newest person is Christopher.
I'm, not seeing any other people that are really wanting to come and speak on this issue, So I am going to close the hearing.
We'll present the letter at the full at the business board of the meeting and we'll have more discussion right.
Just, some simple, slides directing you to our site, showing you how to access things, Just, making sure folks are aware of the Copenhagen zones that were announced by the governor in early October, and this is the city's zone.
All's community board is not impacted by the zone by the state zone, right now, but people do work and go to school in other parts of the city and are.
This is really why we're here, today, I, think folks know from the news and from hopefully from the mayor and the governor being out there talking about it.
We can pause here if you want to take a look or go to the thank you Laura, You want to hop in and talk about the testing resources that we've brought to the borough, so far, yeah.
Chelsea, so I want to talk about test and trace, is really three programs.
It's test, trace and take care, and so I want to talk a little bit about the different pillars of the program.
Then I'll talk about the specific resources in community board, For, so part number one of the test and trace program is just that.
We now know that you know traveling to one part of the world or one zip code or one borough is not indicative of whether you're going to test positive for covalent and that there isn't just a single set of symptoms.
So again, mass testing, it's important, because we need to know where the virus is.
We need to know how high the threshold of transmission is, and we also need to make sure that people who are testing positive, have all the resources they need in order to isolate themselves so that we can break the chain of transmission.
That gets me to our second pillar, which is called trace, is the one that I think we hear about all the time.
There are different versions of trace that different countries have chosen to use the one that New York City uses is about identifying a person who tests positive, The tracer is not necessarily looking to see where they contracted the virus from because it's really hard to know you know.
Other thing, I think we can say about trace that we know at this point is most cases where people know how they receive how they were infected.
What we call like dining table: transmission, That is, you generally know when somebody in your own home has tested positive.
Is this suite of services that we want to make sure every New Yorker knows they have access to in case they test.
Alone, they're going to do it with the help of New York City, and that means helping you to evaluate.
The slide, just looked really crowded with it in there, so I didn't include it, but one of the links that Laura can drop in the chat or I can later is that advisory itself, and this is guidance because of the increases in hospitalizations and cases that we're seeing it's what we really need, folks to do, right, now.
Like I said this has been a terrible year and everyone acknowledges that, But this is what we need to do: to keep people safe and to protect lives.
Things like that, will really go a long way this holiday season and help keep people safe.
We have a flyer version, and this is also being handed out a little bit more of like a formal looking legal version at airports and at transit hubs, so that folks know as they're leaving and coming to New York.
For, the community board or any type of flu shot drives, as we've been seeing, people have please let us know we can get you those palm cards to pass out, because they're, small and cute.
You know I think the way to approach it is that there is no such thing as under testing.
You have attended any kind of large gathering, especially an indoor gathering, Please go get a test if you've just returned from New York, City and.
I, think three: data, guidance, Okay, yes, core, four, so really amplification of our core four and remembering to encourage core four plus testing and cooperation with contact, tracers.
But for businesses, If you own a business or run a business or manage one that is subject to the reopening requirements for under New York state, there is a requirement for almost every setting at this point, including schools and others that you have to report a case of your employees.
What we've done is we have this number that you can call and report a case directly as Laura was saying, Whenever there's a confirmed case in the city, we find out directly from the labs it gets reported into the you know: public health, infrastructure.
We know a lot of small businesses right now kind of well, particularly restaurants, who are familiar with the health department bristle at the word investigation and we've heard that a lot are really reticent to reporting cases.
We do get the direct reports of the cases from the labs directly, We don't want employers or businesses to feel that they're going to get in trouble for having an employee who may be sick.
An investigation does not mean that we're busting in the doors with health department, jackets on it, means that we're going to work with the workplace to like I, said, try to stop transmission in its tracks and get folks safely separated as quickly as possible and back to work as quickly as possible.
You need a hotel to separate in immediately, If you have concerns about where to get tested or you want to know the best place or the nearest place to get tested.
I see a question in the chat about formerly homeless residents in hotel, temporary shelters, Laura I, don't know about Dhs's testing protocol, but I think that's something that we can definitely follow up on and get back to folks with information about, what's happening for our New York residents in shelter, right, now.
Okay, so I think schools are actually a huge success story of reopening in general in New, York City.
If a decision you know to close a school was necessary, so I would say you know, I, also I, know Chelsea wants to say something on this too I see something about increasing testing in schools, I, I'm, just gonna, say: there's two versions of this question that I'll answer because I don't know which version you mean.
So, as schools start to come back online for in-person learning, we may have to move those resources around and the other thing is that cases were still being called into the situation room.
When we looked at which high schools we were going to put additional public testing in, but certainly you know, It seems to be a popular program, And. So I think you know we want to try to work to make sure that we can keep it going in some form.
If you're talking about testing in the schools, then that's a different question, I think Chelsea.
I, think we have really tried to build that up as much as possible to ensure that books have access to testing I also want to say.
It was a very like for me, heartwarming thing to see, because it means that even our you know, our youngest students in New, York City, were taking this seriously.
There are a couple other hands raised that I think may have school, questions.
So a couple of things, and thank you for that question because I know like we just surpassed I, think about this.
We just surpassed one million Covid-19 tests being done in New, York City, which means one million times.
We have fully moved to the short swabs, which I think that should be a relief for everybody, because I don't know if anyone here ever got a long swab, but it was not a fun process.
We need a consent, form, but I think it's also a good moment to talk to kids about why we're asking for people to get tested and why it's important and so again, I know that this is, you know, not a fun conversation and not one that people want to have, but.
You, know I, think it's an important one and just like wearing masks and all of these other kind of difficult, discussions.
There's, some kind of breakdown somewhere between the information that the state is giving and the people that you know the tracing folks that are basically making these calls, and it was a little disheartening because I actually have to point out that look.
You were talking, I'm, going to shoot a note to our folks who are doing the quarantine work to make sure that messaging is hammered out.
I do appreciate that you guys are addressing more testing, so you know putting more testing sites out, but the lines are really insane out there, especially in places like Webmd and 23rd street and very highly populated areas.
One of the things that New, York, Health and hospitals has done for their sites is they've started to put up there's a dashboard where you can click check, wait: times, And, they're reporting pretty regularly from the permanent sites about how long the weight is.
I would also say that I know a lot of people are really drawn in by the rapid test when at h, sites, I won't speak for other sites.
For folks who are just going to city Md, getting a rapid test and taking those results as kind of gospel, you know I would just say: buyer beware.
But you know just want to encourage everybody that a regular pcr test is what you have in Penn station and port authority, for instance, is great and Laura.
You know there's a question in the chat about reliability of testing.
I. Think the turnaround times have been good on pcr testing and people may have remembered this summer when wait times were 10 days, because, as I like to say, Everyone in the country is trying to bake the same cookies at the same time with the same ingredients, and.
Jesse knows this I want to talk also about.
If you guys have complaints about large parties happening, Chelsea, Second, Before about large gatherings sure, if you have complaints or tips, and you want to send them our way, the large gathering kind of like underground party busting general complaints are all being handled, centralized to the office of special enforcement, with participation from the sheriff and a ton of other city, agencies.
Covid-19 cases in New York City, once a month is not adequate testing for the shelters in the hotels, The men that are on West 36th Street are regularly out on the street without masks.
This is a group that has recently come together with block associations, businesses, non-profits and others to address the issue of homelessness in our area, specifically, The understandable need to, on an emergency basis, bring people out of congregate, setting, shelters and into temporary housing in hotels.
One thing I wanted to underscore is that hknc members would like a more consistent dialogue with the care providers and department of homeless services about the ongoing impact of our community, and many of us not only have worked in homeless in shelters but also volunteer in food pantries.
So I just want to reiterate that dialogue is important with the agencies that are providing services for the people temporarily housed in the hotels, but also we need to know the city's long-term plan in terms of how our neighborhoods have been affected.
I. Think, there's a growing level of frustration within Hell's kitchen that our politicians and our leaders have not been straightforward with us and proposing a plan to alleviate some of the pressure that we feel in our neighborhood, with us being inundated by a number of temporary homeless shelters, as you've heard expressed by Brian.
We, believe the income bans presented at the November 24th Clinton health kitchen land use committee meeting are much too narrow and need to be revised, and we ask that community board.
I want to share some information about Fit's virtual portfolio day on Saturday December 5th, for students from around the state and the world, and the city, of course, who want to enroll in fit school of art and design.
We work with the cohort of New York City residents, who are interested in looking at their streets and conducting street audits and with the goal of improving their streets that they live on right within their community.
Okay, then I'm going to hand this to our assembly member Dick Godfrey after well, good evening, Contact tracing for Covid-19.
I know, there's been a lot of discussion in the community about helicopters, particularly helicopter traffic on and off the heliport in Hudson River park at about 30th street.
Keep at it last thing on Covid-19 vaccination, we it looks like New York is going to get a relatively small allocation of vaccine fairly quickly.
170,000 doses may sound like a lot, but not when you realize that you know, we've got tens of thousands of people in nursing homes and I.
, don't know how many people working in our hospitals and other health care, providers, etc.
Well, I think, there's pretty widespread agreement that the priorities, at least initially will be a mix of people who are doing what we've come to be calling things like frontline work like healthcare workers and some other essential, workers.
Well, You know I signed on to Community Board four's letter calling on the city to try to reduce the volume in the 36th street area, which I think is excessive.
You, know we've seen in any number of situations where programs for people who are homeless or have mental health issues or all sorts of programs start out, often being pretty troublesome.
Think our other local elected officials have been working with board 4 on the agenda in board Force letter to try to get some movement there.
First of all, I want 36th street to know that you are heard loud and clear.
We are going to ask the technology department of the cities called: Do it to digitize their data collection process for street outreach teams, those teams interact, as you know, with both a hotel, shelter and other unhoused people on the street, and we do not have that data now.
The discussion that you know certainly George City of the assembly, the residents put into the Chelsea working group about the developments, both Elliott and Fulton, has been a model of discussion and incredible facts and data and outreach and compromise.
But right now, as we speak, there are 700 hotels in the city of New. York I, think it's around 60 that are used for homeless and not many tourists.
I did today go take photographs of the two 11th Avenue 12th Avenue, buildings, I'm sure you know them well, but I wanted to understand what the city was.
I. Don't know why they're not complaining in New Jersey, but they don't have 311 calls like we do, is off the sky so to speak.
In terms of 311 calls on helicopters, so we're going to try to have a New York discussion in December.
The public realm I keep talking about, but today's New York Times editorial is on the same topic, which is who is going to be in charge of our streets, and somebody has to take charge.
And, so we're working to try to get those 550 back right, now, The city, says: oh, You could just take the pre-k slot that doesn't help.
We have a lot of people who come to Manhattan to work who are low income, They need head start.
Listening to my colleagues, Give reports and I wanted to say that I am happy to know that the constituents of the 31st senatorial district, which is 13 miles of Manhattan from marble hill down to 2016 and 9th Avenue reelected me in the general election.
I'm, trying to figure out what are we going to be focusing on, especially when the democratic majority will be meeting December, 7th and 8th in order to look at whether or not we can go back and deal with situations that exist, currently.
As, you know, I, don't need to tell you about the whole pandemic and the impact is having on housing and food insecurity in health, care.
Obviously, you know why the Republicans were in charge of the New York State Senate.
Understanding, that January 5th, and this special election down there in Georgia is going to decide the faith as far as which way the Senate is going, and so I asked everyone to get involved in that, because what it means is the difference of whether or not the Biden Harris game plan can be put in place to save a lot.
And I know you signed it as well, and I was going to ask you the reason that you did that, but you just shared that so thank you.
Well, I mean I've, listened to the constituents there and what they have communicated directly to myself and my staff about the situations that they're living in and then, as you all know.
Our economic situation in New, York City is not going to get better and we need it, but to get better for everyone to survive.
Well sure you, As you may know, there was a hundred million dollars which is very little basically and that the governor had agreed in order to help tenants that are suffering as a result of this pandemic.
Leslie Hi, Senator Jackson I, want to thank you for signing on to the letter to provide relief down on 36th street regarding the temporary shelters, but I do want to make one point that I think it's important people, here.
There were four signatories on that letter, one of which was community board, for it has not escaped me that the other three signatories were our three elected officials who spoke tonight meant the borough, President Senator Jackson an assembly member Godfrey.
And I'll drop links to both those plants in the chat and lastly, one other thing which I know this sport is work closely on, especially the social Justice.
On behalf of congressman out there I want to discuss some of the results that the congressman's been pushing for the american people during this Congress, including 90 hearings, passing 78 bills, out of the committee shepherding 92 judiciary bills through the house of Reps and passing 30 judiciary bills into law.
Email blast will be going out and I want to particularly thank Joe and Maria and Mike and Elzora for their work.
The district court for the southern district of New York rejected the property owner's claim by ruling that the actions taken place by the council to combat Covid-19 and help New Yorkers were reasonable to balance the infringement of contractual rights versus public interest needs in the middle of a pandemic, and the speaker thinks this is a really major victory for small business owners who need protection from landlords during a very unprecedented time.
We worked with HPD to make sure those income bans went from 80 percent to 165 area means income, AMI and everything seemed to be moving along until last year, When the board was informed that the income bans would be for low and very low income levels, As well as a 15 set aside for formerly homeless.
We wanted to include something about the developer, working with the departments of parks and recreation as they develop the site and the park, and there's going to be a comfort station in the building for the park, which is great for the children and just a wonderful asset.
This is a message to HPD, who is essentially saying we know better than you do about the community in which you live or which you work, and that is a problem, because that is continually happening from this administration.
They will be gone by the time this Euler actually happens, Dolores, Sabrina, hi I just have a question just because I want to understand a little bit of the politics of it.
Well, We could actually cite Chris Lebron cited the reports that are given at the housing, health and Human Services Committee twice a year that showed production against the points of agreement and he just pulled those numbers out and spouted at HPD, and it was as if they didn't hear them, because the majority of units that have been built are below 60 percent of the AMI and the tiny minority are above are 80 and above.
It went to court and Joe. You know those people were put in jail, I, think Joe lived, there.
The community board has had an interest in this building for years, and there was a question in the letter as a result of the imprisonment of these owners.
The Clinton cure came about from this board, and that was if you're harassed, the owners of the building are gonna have to make up to that Joe. Because there was harassment, they couldn't get a permit, and the city of New, York and HPD worked with the board to come up with a cure for harassment in buildings like this.
You said these developers are that good they were going to want that park in the right, shape.
We have a ways to go on this, but wanted to lay out some considerations for what will be close to five acres of potential open space there, and this letter echoes a lot of what we heard from the folks who attended the meeting.
Indeed, the point that this was raised by actually the other Land News Committee in for budget request last year, which I think is still last made it into it.
Any questions on any of the BLP letters, I'm not seeing any hands I'm going to move on, ACES.
This would be a place for them to go and be able to have internet and do their school work there happy to take any questions, Yes, hello, everyone I'll, try to be brief.
So we're going to go to 16 housing, health and Human Services Joe. I want to thank Dolores for drafting this letter.
Sure and some of those heating lamps actually were prohibited up until a few weeks, ago, the propane heaters were prohibited to be used in New York City in this way, but can I just provide a we're right at, but one of the main points of the letter is we need people watching what's going on people from the agencies, not to be reactive, because you call in.
Any questions all right before I'm going to ask Leslie.
