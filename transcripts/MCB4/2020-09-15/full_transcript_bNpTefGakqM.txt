She's very effective for CB4 things, a lot of janine's going around doing a good work who thought that was such a common name right, hello, David, hello, Blake, hello, Jeffrey! Oh, he came up with the correct name saved the link. It took me long enough to set up my calendar, so I have the link saved each time now. Yeah, that's good, because I could not find the link yeah. I should have put it on my calendar. I will take your lead. It's always the same link, so you just have to click. Is it really yeah janine? It took me six months, hooray for technology right, hello, Chris, good evening, Leslie, you're muted. If you're trying to talk to us, so it's it is 6:32 and I suspect I should wait another three minutes or so. What do you think? I do not think Roddy's here yet? Is he I think he's just joining? I just joined us. Thank you. Yay, hey good, to see you all! You too, very familiar faces, some of which I have not seen in a while, but I'm glad to see you though, well all I see of you is a blue square. I will shortly on share my video. Give me a second here. We go: hey everyone, it's a little bit and I have hair now, but you know that is much better than a blue square. You're, never going to believe who's on. This call is that Jenny Lee. Yes, it is, oh, my god, hey Jenny, Lee, hey ready good to hear from you. I do not let me scroll and see if I see you as well, no she's got she's got a photograph of her and the dog, oh yeah, that is daphne my dog very own brand ratty, and I used to work together at EDC. So that's how we know each other but I'll put on my camera once I finish eating my dinner, but I'm the last on the agenda, so I'm just taking my time I'll take my time to, and you just message me when you're done chewing: okay. Well, we do have a quorum now. So if you'd like to start, you can are my EDC colleagues here as well co- chairs, just one question: I was wondering if we had space for any new business at the end of the meeting regarding use of park, spaces for the arts, marty's cheering marty and draw a new party, I think new business is proper to bring up. If you tell us what it is now, so we can be prepared for that conversation at the end. Yes, we do have what we think will be a full agenda and we punted quite a few things to October. Just so everybody's aware, okay, Fyi, so yeah very quickly deal with Clinton park is being used passively. There's a few fitness trainers that are selling their classes. There. I've learned that the city of Chicago is using their larger green spaces to socially distance and support independent artists, theater troops circles, things of that nature, music in safe distance and they're rather successful in it, and I was wondering whether or not we would be interested in researching that for our green spaces. If not now, then for the spring I mean I think it can become new business at the end of the meeting. Thank you so much marty. Can we hear you me no marty, the co- chair, so this happened to me. I had to log off and I logged back on. If you look there's like he can't hear us, it happened to me all of a sudden. The audio went out and if you see it's not the microphone with the mute, it's like a phone, that's with the mute, so he should someone should put in the chat. Something funky happened to me too. Well, I think that I'm going to have to call him to relay that message: yeah. Okay, you should sign off and sign back in everybody who else needs to be on from EDC, maybe they're under attendees. I can bring them over I'll start in the meantime. Reading the technical aspects of our memo, while we're waiting the re- arrival of our chair, I just need to find it because I was not going to be doing it this evening. My name is Jeffrey Lafrancois Welcome to Community Board, four's, waterfront parks and Environment Committee. I am one of the two co- chairs of this committee: we're holding this meeting virtually by executive order of the governor number 202.1. This meeting is being recorded and it's being posted and streamed to our youtube page for riveting community television. We'll run this meeting as follows: we're six months in so I think everybody's familiar, but besides the Speaker Presenter will stay. Everybody should stay muted, besides the speaker or presenter throughout the meeting. Members of the public who have joined through the online link will be able to ask questions and make a brief statement on an item after the presentation and after the committee has had an opportunity to ask clarifying questions after the presentation is over we'll inquire. If committee members have further clarifying questions committee, members will signify that they have a question by pressing the raised hand button on your screen for zoom or request to speak through the chat function. After all, committee questions have been answered, we'll take questions and statements from the public again with that raising hand function. A member of the committee will report on any testimony or correspondence the Mcb4 office has received. If there's, if we've received any on a particular item on the agenda. Following the public comment portion of the meeting, the committee will begin their discussion on that particular item and will conclude with the decision to vote on a recommendation or not. When the agenda is finished, the meeting will be adjourned. If there's any questions related to meeting software or to process, please use the chat, function or raise hand function. Now any questions on that and, first with marty, can you hear us yes, so I did. I did the technical part of the meeting with the memo and sort of got the boring technicals out of the way, so I'm going to kick it over to you to dive right into the agenda. Well, let's dive into the agenda and that- and that starts with the discussion of the Manhattan cruise ship terminal, and I believe Rudy is the speaker great. Thank you all. First, a few things. I just want to make sure that we are all perfect that you have the presentation. That is step. One great and then the second part is. I just want to make sure that my other colleagues are able to speak and I they're messaging me saying and not speak, and they are part of the presenters. So I just want to make sure that they have that access as well. Okay, are they in the in the attendee section? They should be, let's see if they're in attendees, they can't speak, but I can bring them over. Oh that's, good, okay, great, so we have nico. Let's see if I find the folks, so I can give you the names. Okay, three people, it's James, long with EDC it is nico and it is bianca. Let's see if I find myself, okay, they should be joining awesome. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Okay, so and then James Wong. Are you into I'm all set thanks, awesome, okay, great! So if we can just scroll to the first slide, think of starting it and then I'll give a quick overview and turn it over to some of my colleagues to introduce themselves and give you some of the latest and greatest. Is this the first slide? You have so we had okay, great okay, so there's this one and then great okay, so I started now, but first of all, thank you all for having us today. I know it's been a few months and a lot has changed in the world since we last met, but I hope things are well with you and your families and that everything is copacetic. So thanks for having us today we're going to talk about my hand, crews, terminal and NYC ferry afterwards. So what we'll do is we'll run through the first agenda item and then at the very end of that we'll take questions and then transition to the second point. First, I wanted to thank you all for all of your partnership advocacy and making sure that we have ongoing dialogue around the Mohanku sermon. I know you all your local elected officials as well, including you know, Senator Hoyman, Assembly, member Rosenthal, the speaker's office. A lot of folks have been very vocal and wanting to get an update on where the cruise terminal stands. This has been even precovered and where how we can look towards the future and making any upgrades and potentially doing some short power. Here I will say there were plans that were in the works, pre- coded and, of course, Covid-19 kind of put some re shaping to EDC as a whole, the city as a whole and how we and some of the projects that we are able to to advance immediately versus not immediately so we'll talk a little bit about that during the presentation, but just want to make sure that we are all aligned there with that. If we can get to the agenda slide, we'll do a quick round of intros of the crews team and myself, I'm ready Miranda, I'm with the government community relations team at EDC and I oversee transportation initiatives. Hence crews operations and NYC ferry niko be gone. I can I can go so I co- manage the cruise portfolio with Niko and I'm in the asset Management Department. I also oversee our aviation portfolio and a couple other items yeah, so nico Martin, I'm part of our Edc's Ass Management department, where I work on co- managers of cruise portfolio with Bianca and also work on our energy portfolio, and I am a Cd4 resident myself. So if we want, we can get into the next line and I can kick it off. Yeah go for a vehicle, so this is just I'm going to to give a quick overview of the Manhattan cruise terminal for in case anyone's not familiar. Basically, the Manhattan cruise terminal is located on the west side of Manhattan from I think, Pier 88 and pier 90 kind of below 38 is intrepid and then period eight is on 48th street and then above pier 90 is pier 92, which is also an EDC managed asset. It was previously used for events and trade shows and some ancillary cruise use and it's currently offline, so the so it's essentially just period in pier 90 and then the viaduct structure, which is kind of the West side. Linear line and currently the crew seminars leased to ports. America who's, our cruise from our operator, this contract began in 2017.. It was procured through an RFP, it's 12 and a half years with two five- year. Renewals, Ford's America, is also the operator at the Brooklyn cruise terminal also started on a similar timeline. Before we used to have two operators, and now we have one so it kind of creates a lot of synergies, but they manage parking security events, all those things and within the lease. So it's at least from the city to ports. America udc is the administrator. They have a 23 million dollar capital commitment in which they were going to build out. The apron appear 90, which is essentially just an extension of the pier into the water in the north end and then generally like cruise operations on a cruise day. So Pier 88 has two stories: the lower level, also to back up sorry, so, the cruise terminal, it's a home port, so ships start and end their voyages and in the Manhattan cruise terminal. So when a ship comes in, it has to debarge passengers, so they go on a lower level of purity aid. There's like provisioning. That goes in, they go through customs, they leave the terminal and then on the upper level passengers embark and if they drive to the terminal, so we have a big up market people will park on the roof so and then they get on their ship and then you know they sail either to bermuda Canada. We have a couple of itineraries and then Pier 90 pretty similar. It's just only one story, so the d- bars happen and then the embarks happen after that and generally just like the cruises sail year round to bermuda and then in the in the summer, in the fall they go up to Canada and New England to see some of the fall foliage. So that's a big, a big seasonal thing we can go to the so I think since Covid-19 happened. Obviously, like cruz was huge in the in the in the media at first and then I'm sure, as you all have seen, that the city is currently facing a nine billion dollar deficit. As soon as you know, March April hit EDC kind of stopped everything and pivoted to doing Covid-19 response. So we had the usns comfort in starting March 31st through, I think April 30th and it treated some Covid-19 patients EDC also began manufacturing, facials Gowns Bridge ventilators a lot of other things kind of to help the city get back on its feet. So I think in April all non- coveted construction design, all of our planning projects got paused. While we deal with you know like our current fiscal situation, so I think we were expecting about you know a million passengers this year. I think about 2200 ship calls but sailing stopped in Mid- March and since then the CDC has put a no- sale order so essentially banning cruise ships from sailing in U.S ports and that's been extended through September 30th, and then cruise ships have voluntarily cancelled all of their calls through October 30th. So we're not really expecting. You know very much crews volume this year and then, given you know, our big season starts in the spring, like it's unlikely so and we're. I would say that this is not unique to us all. The ports around the nation are suffering because cruz does bring in a lot of revenue. So currently, all of our capital improvements have been put on pause and we can go to the all right. Thank you, bianca. So I'll talk a little bit how access and security work at the terminal and why things are as they are. So as a port, the Manhattan cruise terminals, design and operations fall under Coast Guard jurisdiction. The Coast guard requires that a terminal have a facility security plan which is developed by performing a risk assessment at the facility, and those identified risks are then incorporated into a secure, fsp facility security plan. That plan is then approved by the Coast Guard, and any changes made must also be approved by them. There are several levels of security within the facility, for example, to actually go on to the pier itself, where the ships are there's a federal credential. You need for access, but the entire facility within the fence is the secured area according to the facility security plan and to facilitate keeping that area secure. The fence itself is substantial. It's constructed out of steel and concrete, as I'm sure, you're all familiar with cruise operations dictate where this fence goes. It's positions of the activities that take place during cruise calls like passenger flow, Bus, drop-, off processing of luggage and provisions can happen within this secured area. The security personnel of the terminal are able to control access to this area, thereby reducing the potential for any types of incidents and reducing the risk of anything happen, and I would also mention that it seems like there's a lot of space there when empty, but during cruise days the space is all put to use. We unfortunately do not have a picture of the level of activity, that's happening, but it is quite dense with buses and trucks and people moving about so the amount of space that's available disappears quite quickly to support those cruise activities. We talked earlier about how the cruise terminal is leased to an operator so they're responsible for continuously maintaining the facility security, as required by the Coast guard. There are times when large numbers of people have access to the terminal like cruise calls or events that we have at the terminal, but there's a commensurate security presence from our operator that facilitates that access and allows us to do that. In a safe manner, so again they're required when access happens at the terminal, it's required to happen and have a security presence that facilitates that access by the Coast Guard. In order to maintain the plan that that's in place- and I think the final point is that we require ports America to carry a certain level of insurance coverage and public access outside of the balance that are already specified in the terminals plan or the term usage could require changes because of the increased liability from changes in use so and I'll also give a bit of a brief overview on shore power and what's needed to support it. So short, power is one of the one of several current ways the cruise ships can reduce their emissions. The quick summary is that cruise ships use a lot of electricity, even when in port, and they usually run their engines to generate that power. A short power system allows them to shut down their main engines on the ship and connect to the shoreside electrical grid, thereby reducing the local emissions from the ship itself. There are three pieces necessary to accomplish this. The first is that the utility needs to support it and build out the infrastructure necessary to enable it. The electrical load of a cruise ship is quite substantial and building out the electrical good capacity to meet that load can require substantial upgrades in the electrical grid. This is more challenging, although certainly not impossible in area in an area where the existing electrical grid infrastructure is already constrained like Manhattan. The second piece is the onshore connection point or the plug, which is not just a plug. There are several other pieces needed of equipment on the terminal side, large pieces like transformers and switchboards, which take up quite a bit of space, there's also a connection point required on the pier itself, the actual cable that will run from the shore to the ship, which needs to be a flexible to accommodate different ships, and one of the something unique about Manhattan. The Manhattan cruise terminal is compared to many other cruise terminals in the country. Is that it is. It has finger purse, so the piers actually stick out into the ocean and just have a fairly small amount of area. It makes finding space to put this additional infrastructure challenging, although certainly not impossible, and then the third piece is actually having the connection point on the ship itself. So the prevalence of the technology at the moment is low, but growing about 30 of the global cruise fleet has short power connections installed. There are some lines that do better than this. Some are approaching 50 percent with their install base, but our estimates for the ships that call at mct today and that the cruise journal today in Manhattan are about 20 to 30 percent of the ships, have a have a connection installed. That said, having the connection having a connection in and of itself may not be enough. Some ships have it only on one side and if they come to the pier on a side with the that side away from the pier they can't connect to a system. If it's installed on the pier or if they have it in a location, it does not match up with the location on the pier. They also can't connect the system, as we have a shore power, I'm sure everyone is also aware that we have a short power system at Brooklyn cruise terminal, so the feasibility in Manhattan has always been a natural question in early 2020, EDC had intended to kick off a study to examine, modernizing the terminal in Manhattan and based on input from the community had included in our scope that we would study short power feasibility. Unfortunately, the unfortunately Kobe 19 and Ebc's fiscal situation have forced these long- term planning exercises to go on hold for the moment. That said, we're exploring ways to keep the process moving in the meantime that do not require the funding to actually to perform these studies, and I think we think there are potentials to do so all right. I think that's it for the moment. Great. Thank you. I think we'll open up for questions so folks Chris. Thank you. So much marty. Thank you for the presentation just want to review, so there was intent for a 2020 study to examine the modernization of the terminal. Additionally, this study was going to look into the feasibility of shore power technology. How does the EDC intend on doing that without yeah? How does the EDC intent on doing that without a vp of energy? Who has oversight on that and what's the group that will review any rfps for changes in environmental distribution of energy? So I'll start this and then, if you, when Bianca feel free to shine anybody, this would be something once we revamp the conversation to actually launch this study, it will be a bunch of different departments at Edc, primarily headed by our asset management division, which has folks that overview energy and all other aspects like that correct. You just lost your vp of energy. So how do you plan on doing that long term without any funding currently? And what methods are you thinking about using without having that senior leadership available to guide your juniors and your mid management team yeah? I think a few things right. I think one. Yes, we did lose our rvp there, which is a big loss to EDC. However, we do have other folks on staff with comparable expertise and we do. As I mentioned, this is not something that we're proceeding with at this very moment, so the intention would be by the time that we re- sparked this conversation respark. This conversation that would be right. You've lost about 35 years of experience globally in this individual, it's a huge loss for New, York City and from what I gather right now. Asset management team was in the middle of doing an energy audit for the army terminal as well. That has been halted clearly because of budget, but, like the core question, let me get this short is how can we trust EDC to do any work, environmentally speaking without a budget without seniority and within like the next decade? How can we trust you guys? I think the way to frame it is that we had that type. We had that person on staff until like last week, so we have prioritized having this type of expertise, in- house, so the goal would be to have someone else there and the frank reality is. This is not something that is happening at the moment, so by the time that we do respark this conversation, we should have someone in house that is able to lead us through that. But I understand I understand your concern that you know certainly having that level of leadership makes a big difference. So by the time that this conversation responds, we should have someone comparable or on hand to be able to guide us to yeah. Thank you because you know we have a terrible situation in terms of like air quality right now and so like looking at somebody with an energy background versus looking at somebody with a duke mba. Those are two apples and oranges people, and so we would love when you guys like do hire somebody and do start moving those wheels again to have them present. For a conversation like this with us. Well Chris, you have not said, and what you need to say, I'm putting words in your mouth. Please correct me is that the community would very much like to see shore power occur as soon as possible before ships come back into port, even if possible, before ships come back into port, but certainly as soon as possible because of the air pollution issue. So all the other stuff, you said, that's absolutely correct about the blockages to that to achieving that goal of shore power. Am I right? That's absolutely correct marty. Thank you, blake. Thank you for that presentation. I just had two questions. One is you know I use that running path and you know in front of the cruise terminal- and you know I understand that it's probably part of the larger conversation with you know the longer term planning once that gets underway, but I was wondering if there had been any you know even shorter term actions taken to support the pedestrian or vehicle your bike traffic on that area in front of the cruise terminal. You know even things like signage that might help the help with traffic flow. What are some of the thoughts around that you know making that path? A little easier for joggers runners bikers yeah is that a conversation. This is my first time hearing of this. Is it something that you engage with with DOT on by any chance? I know they they're very particular about the signage that we are able to put on around our assets, so wondering kind of where, in the conversation we are, if this is like the beginning of that or if you've already engaged with others yeah. Well, I guess the intersection is that you know I would imagine. The path is probably a DOT jurisdiction, but you know I do not know if there's any additional signage or additional public space. That is being, you know, considered to be made available, not that I'm aware of, but if you would love to, I feel like this is probably a longer conversation. I would love to have an offline conversation with you around, where exactly you feel the signage would be helpful and what they should say. Dot has been pretty collaborative with us, so if we, if we come to them with some recommendations, they've been for the most part able to help us make that happen. Okay- and the second question was you know if there were any businesses within that terminal complex that you know now are you know obviously closed due to the lack of use of that terminal, and you know what kind of concessions have been made. You know to support those types of businesses in that terminal, I'll, let Bianca or nico talk about the specifics of the businesses in that terminal. But I know at large EDC has done a lot of efforts to help businesses, specifically certainly on our properties and being able to work with them in terms of how to how to help them stay flow through this time and how to maximize their businesses, but even at large, it's helping the city with working with small businesses, with larger businesses, with employers overall and making sure that they have the resources, the tools, the access to pro bono, work that can help them really flourish in this time, or at least they float because we really understand this is a unprecedented time, we're in so we're doing a lot to try to help the city bounce back I'll. Let niko or bianca speak to anything that has happened on that actual property. But I know at large we're certainly working with a lot of businesses and just at the Manhattan cruise terminal. We have not really had this issue specific specifically because we do not have any small businesses or concessions inside of the terminal. Thank you, blake's. A question started about signs. He did not expand it to space. The next and space is a big issue for us. I know you may talked about space in your presentation, but I'm going to let the members talk about that Brett's Next and I have Leslie and Alan. Thank you marty. So one more thing, I'm sorry janine. Would you be good enough to stop the shared screens so that we can see each other? Thank you right, you're on okay, thank you. So we actually did in an exercise earlier this summer talk about potential opportunities to help with some of the pedestrian and bicycle transportation around the park, and you know we have identified that stretch that runs along the cruise ships area is among the narrowest areas where there is the bike lane. The Greenway narrows and the pedestrians are sometimes right up against the bikeway, and it's also been noted that, while we do understand that, while cruise ships are important, there's a lot of loading unloading, it's a very busy place, and obviously there is not it's really. We understand the safety issues associated with that, but by and large, especially like on weekends. When there's a lot of bicyclists and whatnot, we see a very vacant parking lot area on the ground level and we do understand there is a path that the trust has built by the cruise ships before 9:11 and homeland security closed that off. So well, I know I'm very interested in, and this is something that came up in one of our conversations this summer, finding ways where we can start doing security assessments and and with the eye towards being able to schedule that area to be open and accessible. So people can get to the water, the public, which would greatly increase the security safety of that pedestrian and bicycle area. It has the experience of the public and a lot of tourists that come by there. Obviously, this year is an exceptional year. You know, and just by way of background, I do plan a lot of justice facilities, courthouses gels, you know, so I do hear a lot of why we can't do things, because it's just the safest thing to do without understanding that the potential benefit of opening our minds and looking for solutions rather than looking for reasons not to do things are that's just my way of saying, I'm hoping I'm not going to hear a response of why we can't do it. I just that's, I think, that's the real interest of of I think what we want to open up is: how can we? How can we access the areas that are vacant, make it publicly accessible when it's not necessary for the cruise operations in a way? That's also still safe and will not present any security issues with border crossings and transportation issues. I'd love to engage in that, I frankly do not know the limitations and what the what all of those safety regulations would have to be in place or what some of the hurdles but would love to, engage in and see if there are ways that we can do something about. It have any suggestion about what the process on that might be. Alrighty send me an email, we'll work it internally at EDC, and then I'm sure there are other folks that will have to be engaged, but I think it's certainly worth looking into and the worst that can happen is others will come with big. This is not safe to have the public in here and whatever that looks like, but at the very least we can. We can check it on our end. That's awesome! Hopefully you should have my contact information. I know janine does and it will be in one of the later slides well just to throw in an aside. Leslie is next. Should we write a letter on this issue that will certainly be in it Leslie hi guys so, as I say, to Jeffrey onto text permission to update right Jeffrey. So just so people are in the loop maya. Are you on? I wonder, are you in the yes hi, okay good? So we talked about this a few months back actually in January with the 47Th Street Block Association, they were the ones that brought it up about the cruise ship terminals and the exhaust, and I was at that meeting and then talked to Brad Hoyleman's office. We were trying to kind of move it forward as far as getting shore power, and I'm sure you guys on this committee have heard me talk about this a few times, but we had a meeting with Khan Ed in June. It was a. It was a phone conversation, a phone meeting and they said that we were talking about the grid, what it would take, and they said it was totally doable even to the point where they knew exactly where it would come from. They would have to run lines. East West, not North South. They kind of had an idea of of where the main power lines would come from so they said all they need, though, from you guys is the site survey to start it off. There's no initial costs involved. They just want to see how much more power they would need for this to be done. So we're obviously looking down the line here, five, eight ten years, whatever it is, but it's totally doable. Then we had a follow- up conversation with you guys earlier today. So if you want to update people on that, if that we are going to have a phone call with Con Edison, now that the Good News is there that it can be done, which is wonderful and maya. If you want to talk about the possible legislation, I do not know- or I do not know what you want to talk about, but you kind of been in this with Jacob as well yeah. So I won't go into too many details on what we're thinking on the legislation angle. But we have been like looking at this since January and at what sort of state laws there could be to enforce this throughout the state and instigate sharp power both here and then also in cooperation potentially with New Jersey, so that we do not just move the pollution acrosss the river, so so I'll jump in there certainly great to have a conversation with you earlier. I think that was certainly enlightening for us and helpful. I think from my understanding what we've heard from Connect is that it would be a much more challenging conversation and it would be north south, but earlier you mentioned that they've been thinking about a east to west connection, which I think would be helpful, and you know just frankly from our perspective, if this is something that a site survey physically means people going out there and just having conversations and looking at what is possible. That is certainly something we can engage on and would love to do it. As we mentioned earlier, we are in very dire financial situations. So as long as the site survey does not mean funded the 500,000 survey with a bunch of details right, so I just want to make sure that, from our perspective, we can start that dialogue immediately and just see where that leads and go down that path and if they then start putting price tags to think, then we have a better understanding of what that looks like, but so far in terms of going out there and getting some staff there on the ground and getting some eyes there happy to do it great we're going to hold you to that absolutely and certainly appreciate you in the center's office as well as, of course, all the other folks on this call or elected officials not able to make it here that have been very vocal and advocate and advocating for this, and, as I mentioned to you earlier, I very much appreciate you understanding. This is not an overnight fix, and this is something that would take some years of planning to actually get it done. Hello. Thank you, Mario. Thank you for a very interesting exciting to into these peers. Hi Gwen, you mentioned money. You had funds available for doing a study. No, I do not, but what I was going to tell you is not all the ships are set up to cold frame yeah that was that was said earlier. Gwen, let Allen have an interaction and then, and then I'll call you after I call on janine and she's a few people down. I'm sorry, so the funds are available for a proper study to go ahead with this. The funds are not. That is what we began. The conversation with earlier that you know the city itself is in is in a very tough financial situation, and right now we understand so we do not have funds to proceed with a project and that level of study that we actually thought would be, but if Con Edison has other thoughts on how we can at least begin to pencil this out and figure out what this looks like happy to engage okay. So if, let's assume you did get a go ahead from either you found money for a study or kane came up with some idea of how to do this, just a guesstimate as to what it would take time- wise to get the first boat plugged into into an outlet yeah. I think you know Leslie brought up a point that this is not something that would be next year right. This is something that I think I think Leslie says something down like five years down the road or something is that, where you said this, I'm just curious in terms of the logistics you got to get people in you got to get bids. You know the whole contracting. You know blah that whole thing, I'm just curious. If you had any you know just okay, we take us four and a half years to get this done once you know we find a contractor so to speak. You know it'll, certainly take a few years. It's not a right. Just yeah they're, only like a five to ten year thing and also just understanding their other components. Right like there are, as Leslie and the Senator's office know, there are some ships that are ready to plug in with short power today, but there are good percentage of them over half that are not right. So folks would have to also retrofit their ships through this and be incentivized with enough ongoing reoccurring, departures to know that is an investment worth making right. So this is a lot of moving pieces that we would have to pull together, but I think certainly starting the dialogue on whether electrically this is a possibility. It's the first step now, just one more thing, because one of the articles that I read a while back when you know there was talk about the public. There was something about the course to the ships, and I do not know if it was about the Brooklyn terminals, but they were not using the the hookups on the pairs because it was too costly. Is that a do you think? That's a factor going down the road? Can you actually force the ships to actually use the power source on the piers or is that their option to which way they want to go force is a strong word. We can strongly encourage and Brooklyn is certainly something that we prioritize, because we have the capabilities there. I think that's what we look to our and I'll, let I'm sure the center's office would want to shine in because they're working, yes, some other ways to actually force people to do things sure so. Alan. On your first question about timing, just for some context, the Brooklyn terminal took about seven years to build so just to sort of give you a sense of what that looks like in terms of forcing cruise ships. That's legislation exactly so that is what we're looking at it would. Probably, it would need to be some sort of a phased requirement that would allow cruise ships or cruise companies to update their fleets. New York is so not the first place to consider this right. We are in some ways way behind on retrofitting for this kind of for power Hookup. So cruise ships are already updating their fleets in to dock in California to dock in Nova Scotia, so this would just be one other large destination, and that is encouraging these companies to make these changes over probably five ten fifteen years different requirements to get their full sleeves, updated, and now I'm just going to jump in just Alan. Just to put that point what she was saying: Princess cruise ships, a lot of the big cruise ships already have like up to 50 percent of their fleet are already fitted for electric because they're going to all these other ports. So I do not, I think, by the time we get there. I do not know if forcing the hand would be necessary. Do you know what I mean? I think they might already a lot of them might already have it. I think, to your other question about cost right, there's all sorts of ways to incentivize cruise ship companies to transition to this as well that sort of go beyond just the shore power Hookup, various like cap and trades type programs and sort of like discounts for compliance at different levels. In regards to their docking and pollution to sort of minimize the cost to cruise companies as well, yeah but Maya, you have to remember that we are concerned about having the ships turn off their equipment for sure Alan. You finished David and then Gwen and I'm going to jump in just because Chris you put your hand back up. I have been able to raise my hand, I'm co- host with janine this evening, so I do want to get. I actually, I saw your hand up there. Oh good! Thank you marty! It's not up now, but I I'll put you on the rotation. Go ahead: David, okay, to go back to Brett's point and the request for further dialogue with rowdy. I think that it's really important that we be able to look together at some kind of site plan or site diagram that actually quantifies the pedestrian and vehicle traffic lanes, what dimensions they are when they're, actually in operation, so that we know you know and can discuss together in a resourceful way what feasibility there is for returning some of that space back to public use. You know, of course, it's going to be more convenient for the cruise operators to have the space they have now forever, and you know security is always going to be easier if they just keep the existing barrier. But if we're really going to have a meaningful discussion of what might come out of it, I think we need to be looking at drawings. That show, as I said, the quantifiables and back that up. So I would simply want to include that in any letter that we write requesting further study or maybe a further presentation, are you saying drawings by EDC, I perhaps say they could come from the cruise operators, but you know it needs to, I think back up and he claims that x. Amount of space is needed during x time and there should be an explanati explanation that goes with that, and then maybe we can work together like a safety logistics plan that yeah, but also to you, know, resourcefully come up with what's feasible in terms of recapturing some of that space for the public. I'm sure most of us are used to riding bikes past it and just seeing a lot of empty space most of the time. Thank you. I have Gwen and then I have Jeffrey and then I have asset management folks, not sure if we have that, but certainly something that, if we do not, I would assume, are cruise operators or someone on that manages the operations there has a version of something, even if it's a rudimentary version of something that we can work off of. So I'm certainly happy to circle back on that right for the sake of the board, if I mean I mean you all know your process and whatever works for you if having a formal letter from the board is what makes the most sense and so be it. If it's an email from someone that says hey, I want to have a further dialogue around X, Y and Z also acceptable, so whatever you all deem appropriate. On that note, I just picking up what David said. We would certainly appreciate if you found preliminary drawings, even before we wrote a letter. That would be just wonderful. I have Gwen and then Jeffrey and then brad yeah. I did not have anything to say, then I do not have Gwen. I love you. Thank you. Gwen just scratch me off a couple of a couple of points. I'll start from where David was getting into the impetus for this came from public space and there is a impenetrable wall. You know along the cruise ship terminal that pits pedestrians against cyclists and that's all because we had to make a highway for vehicles which take up significantly more space than you know, than cyclists and people, and then we're dealing with the same trouble on the other side of that fence, because there's roadways there to make room for cars and parking. So I wonder, there's not money for a study and there's nothing to do a lot at all, but we need to think about flexible infrastructure. Those fences do not have to be where they are when a cruise ship is not being boarded when a cruise ship is not in port. You know we're a home port for drop off and pick up. Nobody calls this home port permanently because it's too damn expensive. So I really wonder, given the lack of funds, that EDC will be confronting for not just a year or two, but for quite a long time for projects like this, how can the agency begin to get creative around repurposing space around the reuse of space, and if it comes to security, which is a typical excuse, that's the easy way out. We have a way to get our federal and if it's homeland security, that the issue is, we have a way to get our federal. You know electeds involved and actually begin to have a conversation, because it is extremely dangerous to be going from north of the terminal south or vice versa, and that's because of this wall that rarely serves a purpose. Even you know, when the ships are up and running roddy, are there any examples you can think of where EDC has provided flexible use of assets or infrastructure, and maybe that's for the asset team, where that's been put in play, not that we leave for this ex for, like an extended period of time that I can think of. I know we do a lot of things over at the book at the Brooklyn army terminal for like large events, and they stay there for like a couple of months at most, but not something that I'm thinking of to that magnitude. But that does not mean it should not be right. Yeah, I think of and again this board knows that I detest vehicles, but I think of the Lincoln Tunnel and the Holland Tunnel and all of our bridges that shift for capacity lane usage in the morning more lanes are for inbound to Manhattan in the evening the lane expansion is for outbound. How can we apply that type of thinking to public space at a location like this, and I do not want to dwell on this, because I have two other points, but I would throw that out there for EDC to get creative because they do not have a lot of money and they're not going to have a lot of money anytime soon. Unfortunately, that's a valid point and I appreciate that and I guess it I think it comes back to the lease, because I would not expect EDC to be the managers of that. I would expect the leaseholders to be the managers of that, because it's their space, public access and then shore power, it's a multi- billion dollar industry. What does the city charge? How do how does the? How is the rate charged? You know at a typical marina, it's a cost per foot. If I have a 30 foot boat and I'm going to dock it for the day, I pay a fee per foot, whether it's you know for an hour the day overnight. That's how it's gauged. How does the city generate its rates for the cruise ship terminal, so we charge if we charge a fee per passenger either getting on the ship in transit if it's a kind of port of call or getting so if they enter or leave the ship we they get charged and then, if the ship stays for longer than one day, there is a what we call that's a what we call a dockage fee. So this is basically based on the size of the ship. For over a day, there is a rate that we charge as well. Do you know what the cost per what you charge per passenger? I can get back to you on that. I think that'd be really helpful and I guess this gets to the fact that the West Coast is literally burning and I live in an apartment that I'm lucky to overlook the cruise ship terminal distant, there's, trees in the way, but I see those ships and I watch that black smoke for days at a time below when there are not when they're, when they're, when there's barely a crew on board, it's a skeletal crew when there's not passengers on board literally bellow toxic smoke into the neighborhood, the immediate neighborhood. If the city is charging a reduced fee, when there's not passengers on board as that docking fee, we need to start thinking about charging for the carbon they're emitting because we do not have shore power. So Maya mentioned cap and trade right. What is the deal here that the city can come up with creatively if they're paying a fee to just chill out, create power and dump pollution? It needs to be bigger than just hanging out for the day because of the waste that they're generating we're not going to get shore power overnight. I do not think anybody had that expectation. We know that it's possible and I certainly think we all agree that the cruise ship industry should be a part of paying for it in a in a major way. The city should not be on the hook for that entirely, but it's laughable. You know we have building codes now that are extraordinarily strict. That came out last year for environmental code, everything from color to glass to texture. The cruise ship gets to hang out and dump pollution for no extra fee. I think we should be starting thinking about restructuring that accordingly, yeah that's helpful and I think that's also where the conversations with the senator are going to be helpful, because in part of legislation you can also incentivize by by making things more expensive for people. So there are different ways to do things and, as you mentioned, you know not all of the power is on the city, but I think we're able to support and make that I certainly do not think all the powers on the city. I do not think we want it to be those people on those ships bring a lot of waste and a lot of trash to our community, and they should certainly be paying to be able to do that and more so. These cruise industries should be paying to operate in more ways than just tying up to our infrastructure. They should be paying for the damage that they're making on our communities amen. Thank you, Jeffrey. I have a brad pasquerella and I do not have any indication of a speaker who wants to talk after that Red Jeffrey. I can't wait to go on your boat. I like the way you're thinking I wish I had a 30-foot bro you and me when I get it. So I would just like to say I think you know this rowdy, that this is the environmental committee right, not just waterfront, and I do not think we should be talking that it's difficult and it's seven years so I we will never going to settle for something like that, especially in this day and age, and for years we've been trying to at least I've been bringing up that every passenger should be charged a fee that the money goes to the park so to Piggyback, because Jeffrey said it very well, there could be a carbon emissions charge, but also there should be a fee that goes along with helping the park which could help incentivize us using that lane. Maybe the money goes to that. You know. You know, I think we're trying to utilize that area underneath the driveway and the third thing is while the terminal is down. Has anybody come to you or is any proposals out there to open it up to the community to have a barge to have the swell like they have in Brooklyn a floating garden for the year? You know: is there any incentive of just sitting there, letting it be vacant, not anything that I have heard. That does not mean it has not happened, but I would have to. I would have to go back and talk to my colleagues that deal with Pacific area more broadly well. What I'm getting at is. This is where it does not cost money to send out an RFP for temporary use. You know what can we be doing with it right now? You know, can we set it out there and have a fishing barge? You know, but it's just sitting there and it might take a long time to get back. So you know that does not cost a lot of money to have a creative idea to put it out to the public. Hey we have the space. Can you use? That's just the it. I have Chris who wants to speak again and he will in a second on the chat, there's a question on parking on the pier people driving into New York City go to a cruise ship provide no benefit for local businesses. I think that person wants people to park in New Jersey. I do not know for sure what is the issue with parking on the pier ready people do drive and leave their cars to get on board. I think who gets the revenue from paying to park on the pier? Is that strictly to the american ports company, the leaseholder, or does the city benefit from that as well? Looking at massive managers say again, please. I believe that the operator collects the revenue from 100 of the parking revenue goes to the operator it's for cruise passengers, yeah and then sorry. Just on the other point regarding the parks, we do pay 500,000 from cruise revenue to the Hudson river. Yes, but that's like rent what we're talking about is like if you go when they're redoing, an airport they'll, say every ticket everybody's being charged five bucks, it's going to the re renovation of the airport. We could definitely do something like that. The traffic that comes acrosss that way is horrendous. It totally shuts down the west side, there's no thought process and getting these poor people acrosss the highway. They stand there with their bags. It's a disaster. I do not want to get into that, but I think we, this could definitely be done and we do not have to wait years to get it done. I now see Sally wants to speak and Chris. I think you took your hand down I'd still like to speak. You just acknowledged me, so I figured I could take the hand down okay, you go for it and then sally okay. So I do not want to skip sally, but right now I'm hearing two distinctly separate letters that would be going out. One would be the EDC to consider flexible use, wait Chris before we start talking about structuring the letters. Let's come back to the let's keep, let's keep pushing the issues and I think sally may have an issue. So I just want to circle back to what Jeffrey was saying and direct this more to maya the idea of heavy fining for pollution for the polluters. It's one of the best motivators to move forward on getting them geared up to go electric asap and think out of the box as to how we can do this in better time than years and years and years, because, if they're continuing to pay heavy duty, fines for polluting that should again get them motivated to move a little faster thanks sally. I do not see anybody and maybe janine does. Is there anybody from the public? As I see it, there are 21, panelists and 13 members of the public. So it's their turn. If they want to add anything to the conversation, if you've got nothing to add, that's fine, I think we got the points that the panel members have said and as we talk about structure or a letter, you'll hear it again see marty party. If I make just one more thing, just a thought: you know they load those trucks up with all the trucks and that's a lot of the traffic. It's still a waterway and a lot of that supply could come from the water and could be docked. You know instead of incringing on our neighborhood again it's a massive waterway. It's been used for hundreds of years. Maybe they can get their product from a barge or from another ship coming in and not through trucks and allow us to maintain that roadway a little longer just a thought. I wonder if EDC had thought about that at all ready. Have you heard that before do we have barging capabilities or activities in there at all folks, barges run up and up and down that river all day long, I'm aware! No, I'm aware I'm wondering if we have them, I'm wondering if nico bianco, if we have that type of activity at the terminal. I do not know that. I do not know that there are I'm not sure if work. If we have the capability at the terminal, if they're set up for it with wraps and things, you would need to move things on and off the parts. Okay, let's look into it because I mean one: that's the first step right is that even a possibility there and then two is that I do not I'm not entirely sure of the process of connecting a cruise operator to someone that would actually do that service for them and what that means in terms of cost implications or their logistics and their planning, but would be, would be helpful to at least look into it from our end, if that's even possible to do that. Thank you appreciate that I have seen no hands from the public I'm going to go back to Chris, who is trying to structure a letter. Thank you, marty yeah. So please all amendments. If I'm wrong, please correct me: I apologize but letter one. I'm assuming would capture the bike lane mitigation, which would capture flexible use during peak in non- peak times. It would have a review of lease to see what this concrete metal barrier would look like in order to adapt flexible use, as well as a potential possibility outside of allowing people to just go and use the Underpass for passive bicycle use or other use. And then there there's also a second letter reviewing the lease for the potential for temporary permanent cap and curry trade on co2 emissions. While the EDC moves forward with an on- site survey with Con- ed on shore power, not just feasibility but timeline, and then there's also ancillary points you can connect them to whichever letter possible would be that any revenue collected going forward either from cap and trade or heads would go directly to hrp on top of the 500,000 being paid in renting for the terminal I'm worried. These are that this I'm worried one that we might need three letters because Chris, I those were all the points, but I worry. We need to separate cruise terminal operations and funding from cruise ships and separate that out from our interest around creating public space. I do not want to get those muddied together because I think one is easier than the other does that make sense? Certainly absolutely I know reviewing the lease is something that EDC can do and they can do it effect. You know like they have the manpower to do it now within their assets, team, Jeffrey, you're, absolutely right. I'm going to push back on both of you made three points, as I, as I see at the letter, is to EDC and with a copy to possibly the terminal operator, I'm not even sure, if that's the right thing to do, but that's ports America. I see a single letter divided into the three parts that you're talking about, but clearly delineated. Otherwise we are going to be in the situation where they respond to one letter and not the other, and I want to hit them with the whole ball of wax. But in possibly three parts. It's the space part it's the shore power part and it's the finance part. Did I get that I defer to institutional knowledge coming to marty on this one? If you think that's the most efficient way to gain responses from all parties, then we should do that. No I'm! Just speaking out loud, I would say it's my own gut and if it has nothing to do with what the board has done in the past, any comments no comments. So I take it that the panel would like to see a letter, a single letter in three parts or the first part, or I do not know how thought the proper order is. But I'll speak it space, a movable barrier, flexible use of space EDC get inventive here. It could not cost a lot of money, but if anything like that always does a second part will cost a lot of money and will take time. But the urgency of getting the smoke out of Jeffrey's living room is serious and immediate, and I think the second part of the letter has to talk about getting shore power and the third part of the letter, I'm not too clear about. I think we're asking for a review by EDC of what the finance arrangements for the term for the peers are, so that Jeffrey has picking on you again. Jeffrey has for a long time and Brad two by the way. Brad has been saying this loudly and clearly. Why do not? We have some kind of a per passenger charge to augment the funds that they are imposing their. This is a public meeting. They are imposing our their crap on us and they should they pay for the trip it's expensive, but there should be additional fees- and I presume EDC has thought of this already, but we would like to see a review of the financing that was moderate, but I think you get the idea yeah so EDC had already said there was a per passenger fee, as is we're talking about an additional per passenger fee on sanitation as well or upping the rates of the current fees that they have. That's correct, that's exactly we understand it. We know that there's a per passenger fee, that's how they get their money from when the boat goes in and they discharge, but those passengers could pay 10:20 more and given how much they're spending on the trip they won't know. Leslie, I see you, I would make that motion. I do not know. I do not know if we should say where who should pay the fee? I think we should leave it up to the cruise ship, the companies you know if they want to pay the fee if a person should pay the fee- and I do not know if you know that's our so you're saying that the letter should not, it should be the fee. But since the board had people on the board have for years been suggesting that passengers be considered as a source of revenue for these issues at least a partial source- and I heard I is Brett- are you trying to speak because I heard I heard Jeffrey make a motion? Are you seconding it? I would love to make a motion because we have much more on the agenda. Okay, I just one more thing. I think we can wait a minute, wait, a minute, wait, a minute, Brad Brett's up and then you the first two points. I think those are definite my concern about. The third point: is it's a little bit we're the lay people on the board dictating or making suggestions about? You know business decisions that are, I think, pretty lofty and I'm not entirely sure that it's all up to EDC anyway. So I would suggest that maybe that's a second letter- that's that's more directed at our elected officials for them to review that, because I think I think, that's probably the more effective path to make to make change. So we're expressing, I think, our observations about the current situation and are in, and we basically would be expressing our support for them to be able to put pressure on upping fees and things like that. But I think it's hard for us to make. You know to suggest what the fees should be, who they should be assessed to other than making suggestions to our elected officials to negotiate that because they have, I think, a better hand on the budgetary numbers. Jeffrey. Do you have any experience with EDC? No, I mean like yeah. I think I think Brett's point is a good one. The financial part of the letter should not be telling them what to charge, but I think us lay people have the right to ask EDC and possibly the cruise operators to provide financial information about the viability of their peer and of how they might envision funding these issues that we think are important to us, and so I do see it as part of this letter if it can only be constructed in that way and you'll see a letter and you'll comment on it, and I do think we need to come at this from an approach. If the conversation is is ongoing. There's a lease in play here and EDC. Just can't start inserting things into the lease, so we have to think strategically on how we can help EDC. You know extract this money from a pretty thick stone in terms of what this lease might look like. So this is, I think, step one, so everybody has an idea of, at least in vague sense. What the letter would be. Somebody will have to craft, it will be either Jeffrey or me. I think, and then you will you will. You will see it again. So, in its vague terms, is there anybody that I this is zoom it's harder to do anybody object to the letter anybody present and not eligible for this letter. Anybody abstain from this letter marty. Can I quickly clarify if I worked for EDC three and a half years ago, can I still vote on these letters? You're, fine, I'm fine! It's been a long time right. Yet is it two years or something like that or one year I do not know. I do not know the legalities but we'd love to have your vote. So we're not going to put you down great I'd, love to vote, and so I take that as a unanimous passage for all members present. Thank you very much. Thank you for the EDC presentation. You guys are tuning into our needs and are talking our language and we look. We look forward to continuing the conversation with you. Thank you. Thank you. So much so with that management. What's your hat very yeah for sure our asset management team, please feel free to leave the meeting, and then we will reengage once we hear from the Community Board, and we have some work to go on our and between that anyway. So and I will continue the next bullet, it should be a much shorter presentation and we are just going to provide an update because you all thoughtfully said hey, what's going on with this very thing, so we're going to just give you an update on where we are a brief overview of the system. Just so you know, everyone is on the same page and speaking the same language and then just James long is going to run through where we are today and when we plan to launch and any Covid-19 impacts and anything of that James Wong Gopher Great. Thank you so much thanks. Everyone for having us tonight, like I said or like right. He said we'll just do we have just two slides to talk about the overall system and where our route, the route, that's going to be started in Pearson d9. I do want to mention upfront. You know, we've definitely been spending a lot of time, working through lots of logistical issues on just making sure that we are ready to launch for next year. Originally, we did say that this was a 2020 route. This was pushed to 2021 with all the impacts that we're dealing with, but we anticipate launching next year and so we're looking forward to that as we go through in our planning process and as we are now squarely in the implementation process, we, you know we have been connecting closely with our partner the past. So you know we're very aware that we want to be addressing issues like concerns around Bus layovers concerns around how to ensure that you know our ferries are being good neighbors when we when we enter the space- and so that's definitely friends of mine for us and we're still working through that. We have ongoing conversations and I have some meetings coming up with the trust as well, so just to give people confidence that we're you know continuing to take into consideration letters that have been previously sentenced, not only by the trust but also by the Community Board and others who commented on the eis. So you can go to the next page. I'll talk just a little bit about our lesson. 30. for those who you know you can skip over this and just go to the. I I'm sorry to jump in and cut your presentation. We are well versed in the system as a committee and as a whole and recognize it's not on the west side of Manhattan. So if you can just provide the pier 79 update, we would really appreciate it sure thank you. So we can go to the so for the St George Route. This remains the route that we've presented previously, which will be starting at St, George and Staten island serving Battery, Park, City and Lowerman nine. On the West side, the total route time is about 35 minutes to get from Midtown to staten island with the stop. In lower Manhattan- and you know- that is the main crux of that of that route- would service every approximately 25 minutes in the peak. I will note that, as a result of Covid-19, we have changed a lot of our service levels. Just we are reacting as closely as we can to the amounts of servers. We are providing to ensure that we're basically putting out what is needed to keep the system to keep the system useful to riders, but also to not put out more service than we need. So it is not necessarily the case that will be exactly average 25 minutes at launch in terms of the implementation. This round actually only requires the construction of one landing. That's the St George Landing, which is on track and unscheduled, so that construction is underway. The vessels that were ordered for this route have been delivered, so we are prepared with the vessels once once, the landing at Saint George is created, and so things are moving along. One of the things that we did start taking delivery of were some of our tier four vessels, which are the higher efficiency vessels that are the first in the harbor for our ferries. So we're excited about those and then more locally, as it relates to battery Park, City and Midtown and pier 79. The actual work on the ground is pretty minimal there. So for us right now that means going through and planning for ticket machines that would be within this within the building and we're working with New York Waterway for to figure out where what our best options are going to be for bus access. One of the things we mentioned in our eis is that the right now we are still contemplating whether or not to leverage the existing New York Waterway Bus fleet, which we know that has its challenges in it, but is extensive or running our own shuttle bus, as we do at East 34Th street, where we use smaller smaller vehicles and provide small circulator service. That is still an open item and one that we are working through as we negotiate with waterway to understand exactly what what the best options are for us, but that is something that's in the eis which was completed with a final eis about two months ago, not even about a month ago. So the final Eis has been published and accessible on seeker. So if anyone had made comments, you know those are also responded to and available there as well. So that is the really quick summary of where we are with the St Georgia and happy to take questions, I'm going to turn it over to you, Jeffrey Thanks Marty. Thank you, James hi, my favorite topic. I will resist the fact that this route continues to be completely disconnected from the entire NYC ferry network. It continues to not provide real commuter benefit to residents of the West side. It's a boon for staten islanders decades over due there, and then I guess I, the main issue I sort of was hoping this would be on the agenda this evening was to one find out whether or not the service is on time, and I'm happy to hear that it is because, no matter what more public transit is a good thing, why would EDC entertain the idea of running an additional means of public transit, a la its own shuttle when the m42 should be utilized here and should be weaved into the system? There's a public bus that terminates here has that have there been conversations with MTA and D.O.T about that yeah? Absolutely we have for a long time been exploring what fair integration or fair acceptance on the two systems is going to look like. I won't pretend that EDC and the state are not. You know different organizations at that and that the cost is not easily split, so spending a fair through NYC ferry is different than spending a fair through MTA and so well. We are definitely still working with MTA on fair acceptance to understand how we can get to be part of the Omni program. They honestly have to finish out the work that they're doing very well with their existing system and their existing partners. We are in line to work with them for the future, but that's still probably about two years out and that's sort of how we're thinking about it. Let's get the physical elements organized first and follow that with the need, for you know, making sure that we can. We can connect to it in terms of a single fare. That is a real challenge. Just I mean being very clear. The fact that it's going to be two fares worth of transit for two different systems that are being split, makes it makes the economics of this more difficult, particularly when everyone is looking at slash, transit budgets. Yeah, I was not. I was not saying it should. Actually, I was not actually advocating for single fare, but it should be, but in this moment I'm just more worried about the lack of thought of increase in passenger getting off at that terminal and then rushing acrosss, the West side highway via car or on foot in which we already confronting greenway issues, and you know park population issues and all that kind of stuff, and so to better understand how EDC is approaching. The landings is important, so just so I just so. I understand I mean like I said so. The fact that the bus that there is one bus that's stopping over there is the ability to use that we're, certainly not precluding that, and we would be more than happy for riders to take that. But that's not a the only place. People are trying to go, which is one thing and b, it's also a cost for riders. Who would need a second fare. So we do the reason we're thinking about buses, whether it be through waterway or our own, smaller fleet would be because we want, if we were doing that, it would be to provide a connection that is for free for writers and then I know Rashi. I believe you're on from the trust, and I do not want to keep dominating because blake and Colin questions. The relationship with Hudson river park here is how it what who's paying, who is EDC a tenant of pier 79? Are you guys paying a fee to operate the ferry terminal there out of the ferry terminal? I can answer the economics if you want Russia, unless you want to jump in Go, Ahead James sure, so we are actually so. The mechanics of this is that the revenue generated by pier 79 is created by landing fees. So when waterway is going there, it lands, they pay fees for the right to do so. We will also be contributing in the same levels when we land that we pay per use. So every time we touch down at pier 79 we're paying for it and the trust is the leaseholder on that correct, rashi, meaning you get the revenue right. So the way it is working is that there is a lease between New, York, City and New York Waterway, and since we are obviously the park, is the owner, the land owner. So we hold the major lease, but this lease has existed since 2002 and it's administered by EDC. So even though we are not directly able to either approve or disapprove any ferry expansion, but since pure 79 is in the park, we obviously are very concerned about what the Fed expansion entails for, whether it's safety or for pedestrians or its operational issues or its design issues, so those obviously become important to us and as James mentioned, we've been talking continuously, and there are certain concerns that the trust has raised. These are very similar to what you've heard in recent advisory council meetings. So buses Layover, is a big one. Currently, buses serving the current ferry customers continue to park in the park property, including overnight, and this obviously is not permitted. So we want to make sure that going forward. There is some solution for that. Also managing the pedestrian and the vehicle conflicts at the bikeway is an important concern. You want to ensure that all the people who are entering and leaving the park are able to do so safely and so again, we've had previous conversations with city DOT and York Waterway, but we want to make sure that this is something that EDC is able to look at also. The other third concern is marine safety for kayakers and small boaters. So that's something that's really important to us. We have a robust non-, motorized boating community. We have four boat houses in the park, so this becomes very important for us and one additional concern is the potential impact that increased ferry wakes could have on parks what infrastructure. So this is something that we need more information on, so we flagged these concerns to EDC and we are going to discuss this further with them in the coming months before this service opens next year and just clarification and then I'm going to go to members of the committee rashid. The concern around wakes is that it affects the bulkhead and the marine wall and the trust is responsible for maintaining that correct yeah I mean that's something that needs to be looked at deeper. It has the potential to affect the peers, but we just need to look at it together and figure out. What would be the impact? Thank you marty. Do you want to run through hands, or do you want me to do that either way, let's go with blake hi. Thank you for the update. You know janine. Maybe you take down the map. Thank you. Go ahead, blake! I'm sorry! I interrupted no worries. Thanks marty, you know one sort of statement. I do not think we ever were able to review the ridership estimates requested for the Saint George Round. You know. I think that would be a helpful consideration and more of a question, as the second point is whether the continuing expansion has been evaluated after the covered pandemic hit. You know, particularly in terms of equity. You know where you know. Are we looking at the demographic of people who are, you know expected to take the ferry? You know given the sort of or what tends to be more, you know higher price real estate on the waterfront versus other means of transport. For you know, potentially people who are more dependent on public transport, especially given the difference in the amount of subsidy that goes toward each ferry, ride versus other means of transport sure so I can respond to so on the first, I'm sorry. If we that's, we will own if we missed a commitment to provide ridership, and that did not make it back to you. So I apologize, but we will make sure that we share that it is available in the eis, but we will also pull it out and send that out through writing to the community Board. So my apologies, if that did not make it out from the from the last meeting as it relates to sort of revisiting the plan or looking at this in term through an equity lens and who needs this. Why is this helpful? So, yes, we continue to take a long- term, look at ferries and have made a number of changes already to help improve sort of the operation of ferries. So we actually, we are planning for a nearly 20 reduction in operating costs next year, due to consolidated routes. So on our existing routes, we found more efficient ways to serve the existing landings, and that was a really important thing that we were you know. Covid-19 has forced us to look closely at these things and that led to some changes there. One of the other things in terms of you know revisiting extension, the this love this route, in particular benefits from the fact that it only requires one new landing. You know when we look at other routes that have several landings the cost to deliver those are much higher here. We actually are. We are leveraging the existing major terminals that are one of two of the four major terminals in Manhattan that were really designed to handle this kind of traffic to handle this kind of service, so we remain committed to it, and I would also mention that we are excited because this does serve staten islanders, who, as you pointed out, could definitely benefit from transit options. Not only you know, equity takes very many different lenses. One is the amount of time that we are asking people to ride, transit for and being able to get to Midtown in 35 minutes, which is about the same time it takes to get to lower Manhattan on the staten island ferry. You know those are two different options and there's obviously a value add that we feel strongly about so yeah I'll just leave it there, but I think that you know we are certainly committed to it. We're committed to driving this forward. We still you know stand by this is this is a good idea and we're excited about it, colin or sorry. Go ahead, come hi, everybody! Thank you. Edc. Thank you, James, nice to see you. I have two comments. First, you know I I'm a transportation advocate, I'm deeply concerned about. You know the crisis facing the MTA and I understand that you y' all are the EDC, but if you bring mayor De Blasio to the next committee, I will tell him to his face that I think that you know public dollars, I'm not sure. If a route, just the Saint George Ferry from the West side, is the most urgent use of public transportation dollars right now. But that aside, I also share Jeffrey's concerns about the network connectivity. You know you're talking about how this is a boon to the to staten island. You know a new new route for them to come to the West side. From the perspective of West Sider, though I mean I'm sure that there are one or two people who are trying to go to staten island, that St George's terminal, but it does seem like this route. Fro from our perspective would be vastly improved if it did connect to the hub at Wall Street. Now you it does not sound like you're asking for comments, it sounds your this route is set to go just fine, but my last comment is: can we get a like a you know, a CitiBike stand or something near the terminal on the West side, which it I just Google mapped, and it does not seem like there is one over there, because it is a little far from the train at Hudson yards, and it is a few blocks also from the 42nd street SBS. Those are my comments. Thank you for coming thanks. I guess I can. I can comment just briefly on the on the network thing it is. We recall that from the first letter and note that it remains, you know an open item, because it is the route is, as you said, what it is and, in a very like honest way, we've looked through the different ways to route this, and we do not find that there is going to be an efficient way to do this, that, in a way that connects Saint, George, St, George and Staten Island are obviously an important part of bringing them the borough of Staten island into the system, which is a very important element to us and stopping on the east side of pier 11. The travel time impacts of doing so are just detrimental to making it travel time competitive with anything else, which is one of the challenges that NYC ferry has always faced on the West side. Every planning study back to 2011 is going to say that it's competing with existing subway service, and I know that's not fair. If you live two three avenues away from the subway, but it is, it has always faced those challenges on the in the north- south spine. This is the first step for bringing NYC ferry to the West side. The time between start the 2013 study launching in 2017 finishing our first drafts in 18, starting in or having a new study in 2019 and launching those routes in 21. The piece of this is moving pretty quick, and you know I'm certainly not here to promise the future, but it is to say that having ferry service through NYC ferry is definitely a good first step in terms of the advocacy. That's going to you know, drive towards other things. That would connect it better to something like the east side. So in terms of CitiBike we'll absolutely reach out, I apologize. I actually thought there was a CitiBike station right outside pier 79, but I we'll go double to check. If there's not we'll be definitely talking to Dmt, I thought there's actually a pretty big one. That was, I believe, there's one just north of that over there. It's about four racks yeah! Oh sorry, if I was mistaken about that, thanks for pointing that out and just to flag James, we did ask for, for staten islanders benefit on the route into Manhattan to not stop at pier 11, but that all southbound travel does stop at pier 11 to accommodate the West side, commuter and sort of making it a distinct route. So that continues to be the request. Yeah I mean, and I that Jeffrey articulated it pretty. Well, that's essentially, you know what I'm asking for. So I definitely second that request all right. Thank you all Alan Oster. Thank you marty. Thank you, James just to follow up on blake's question. Do you have any sense in terms of dollars how this is going to affect the subsidy? So Covid-19 has definitely thrown a lot of things into disarray. We took a pretty big hit in our ridership, and so we expect our subsidy is likely to go up between last year, and this year we had gotten under ten dollars a passenger as of last year and we're hoping to go down, but we still anticipate that our long- term subsidy is going to be in the seven to eight dollar per passenger range. We hope that goes further down. We hope that the projections will be able to hold up, but that's with revised projections and, frankly, stat. The Staten Island route is a major contributor to helping bring down the long- term subsidy, because the ridership is expected to be strong due to the benefit that it's creating. So you mentioned, bringing down the cost of your expenses is the is it is the is the reduction in the subsidy driven more by reducing your expenses getting or is it a combination of that and getting more people than if you get more people? And do you need more ferries? I mean you know, is yeah so you're touching into a very complex game of you know how much service do we provide? How do how often are we willing to leave someone behind? If you know a ferry is full, do you run big boats? You run small boats, so in general, yes, both factors are very important. Matching the amount of service you have to the amount of ridership you have so that we can run as efficiently as possible when we have things like putting capacity constraints on vessels to enforce social distancing. That makes it harder to fill those boats up. So some of those things are working in different directions and we've chosen obviously to prioritize public health and ensuring that transit remains as an important element of how much service we ran. But at the at the peak of Covid-19 we were running about 50 of our normal service levels, and now we are back to about eighty percent of what we were doing a little more than eighty percent of what we were doing last year in terms of when you're going to see the change in subsidy, the there's kind of a clunky nature of when we report. So we report at the end of our fiscal years, so we're going to have a a new subsidy number, that's going to come out in the next month, or so once we finish, closing the books on last fiscal year, but a lot of the impact of Covid-19 and some of the benefit from cutting those expenses reflecting with those ridership, is also going to be reflected really at the end of fiscal year. 21.. Thank you, James! Thank you! Alan Brad! Yes, just wanted to bring up the last time we spoke. They talked about the engines in the new ferries because we are the environmental committee. Is that still happening yeah, so we're actually pretty excited. So there had previously been a lot of industry constraints, because our ferries are actually just too small to warrant most engine manufacturers, designing the tier four engines that we needed. We have been able to get our first two tier four vessels completed as because we were one of the first in line to get the tier four engines that were sized for our 350 passenger vessels. So the first two of those are now in the harbor. They are in operation and the rest of the fleet is a tier three fleet which is still the highest standard of. Certainly, the other ferries in the in the harbor, so yeah things are moving along is that it brad? Thank you, Sir Sally, okay, I'm still on that pier 11. What stop off and matching that to the ridership issue, the ridership numbers are something that we have been asking for a while, and I think I think this stop at pier 11 is really important, as I think it was Jeffrey. Somebody pointed out at least going south and I think, what's going to happen, and maybe it's part of why we have not seen the ridership numbers. Where were you to factor that in that stop? There would be so many more people needing the service of that ferry that you probably could not. You certainly probably would not be able to run every 25 minutes. It probably would be filling up every 10 or 15 minutes, or you would need larger boats and there would be all the domino implications of more service because of all the people that would wound up being wind up being served. I do not know if that's the case, because we have not seen the ridership, but I would suspect that would be the case that by servicing that peer and accommodating West side, siders you'd be needing a much larger budget, and that is indeed part of the calculation of not stopping there sure I do know. I mean this won't react specifically because to the idea that I think Jeffrey had brought up or Colin had seconded on doing it, not as every stop on the route when it's in route and it impacts the travel time. We actually see a reduction in ridership because it offsets so much of the staten island ridership. But, like I said earlier, I do apologize on not having shared the ridership earlier. If that was, you know, are bad and I apologize about that, but we will make sure that we get that to you, if not tomorrow. Certainly by Monday thank you Sarah on this kind of ridership and frequency point you know, peak service of every 25 minutes is extremely infrequent for peak service. Could you talk a little bit more about that, and also I do not know if it was on your slide. I'm not sure I saw what the off- peak frequency of the service is expected to be sure. So our most frequent service today is on the East River route, which carries about a third of our ridership and that operates at a 25-minute frequency. So ferries do not. Ferries are not the same and do not have the same maneuvering and like sort of travel time characteristics as buses in subways do so, there is just going to be a naturally longer period between them. In order to make that work, I think that waterway runs one of the most frequent services at like 10 minutes services. Yeah on there acrosss rivers, we've tried to match it with demand and the time that it's going to take to load and unload 25 turns out to be one of the higher frequencies that we're operating right now. So you know for us, it is peak frequency and knowing how I started in ferries many years ago and thinking fully transit planner. If it's not less than 20, it's not real transit. I have learned a lot about sort of how writers react with theories, which is very much people plan for a departure plea. People go for a specific departure. No people are not doing a random arrival and I have all sorts of issues with the literature that sort of just holds to that on the planning side. But we can have a separate conversation about that in terms of off- peak frequency. It fluctuates throughout the year, so in the summer off- peak frequency will I do not. I do not have it off the top of my head, but, for example, we usually just drop one boat during one of the three vessels that run in peak, we usually take one off, so it would be stretched out to maybe 45 minutes in the in the off peak. In the winter we do drop considerably. We run service in winter weekends, every 90 minutes, which is very infrequent, but it does provide some service to people who are looking for it so and did you have to beat a little bit of the ridership productions dead horse a little bit? Do you have a sense of how like the ridership projection is like what the various projections are for that off- peak service? That's quite infrequent, particularly on the weekends I do not have. I do not have off- peak off the top of my head, so I do not want to provide a number. I can say that the Staten Island route is expected to be one of or the excuse me. The same george is expected to be one of our highest ridership routes. Though, and that's even though this route is largely, you know, half duplicative of the Free Staten island ferry. It is duplicative only in the connection to lower Manhattan in some ways, but the as we said and modeling off of the trade- offs of how we, how we expect people to value the savings that they're going to get by being able to get up to Midtown. In the time that they are that yeah, that's the that's the expectation, okay, well yeah. I think I will point out also that it's using a similar methodology to what we've done with previous studies, where I might be one of the only people who is cranky. That's that we say you know. Oh we've exceeded all of our expectations. I would rather have been you know just right, the first time as a planner, but you know in general this the we are expecting strong, ridership out of this, based on what we saw in the in the planning study, okay- and there are two different studies- one is the 2019 expansion study and then there's the eis so we'll make sure that both of those are we'll send links they're both publicly available and have those ridership projections been updated postcoded. Where was that done? Those were all done. Pre- coded okay, yeah. Just if you would not mind sharing that and all of course just reiterate what other folks said that you know. Obviously this like is not very value-, adding for our community and so again pure11, but we're bearing a lot of the cost of it right and so again that pure 11, particularly on the southbound, would obviously be a big deal for this community and also making sure there's a solid bike connection. You know those are all things. I think we would definitely love to see all up on more information from you. Thank you. I have a I do not. I do not see any other hands correct me if I'm wrong and I have a question on the Q&A that I'd like to read to you it's more of a transportation question than a waterfront in parks. But let's see what you all say: can there be a podest? Can there be pedestrian bridges at pier, 79 and 90 to insist in crossing the highway? That's another question, not just I think you all on the committee may have ideas on that. Just from our perspective, I can share. You know that the scale of a pedestrian bridge crossing the West side highway is definitely beyond the scope of what we're looking at right now, which is not to say that we would not be supportive if that were to get some traction and find out how to do something like that. But you know that's a pretty hefty size infrastructure project, especially when we're talking about where we are right now- and you know me mentioning earlier that the benefit from this route is just having to build one landing. I've never heard any numbers on pedestrian bridges, acrosss the highway, there's only two and I think that's for a reason. Right now you got Chamber Street and you got 46th street and do not you have that much paper street has elevators 46Th street does not so imagine now the cost given requirements for accessibility, which, of course we would not ex. We would not allow to me. I do not think this committee would support building one. Were it not fully accessible? I think we're thinking too small. I think we should just close down the west side highway completely. Holland there's a traffic planner for you, Mr Chair, I'm not sure. Does anybody else in the committee feel there's a need for a letter or a motion here. I really just wanted to understand an update. I do believe the transportation committee is going to take up the bus issues separately in the next month or so because of the bus layover that happens from the New York Waterway, but that's transportation related. Do folks feel the need for a letter here. I think we appreciate the update and we should probably ask for an update sometime in the future James just finally, the staten island location is that staying as has always been proposed in at the location in St George. So it is. Are you are you familiar with the terminal it's to the west of the? I know I look at it upside down where we have talked about it previously, which is west around if you're looking at the water just to the left around the current terminal, yeah. Okay, thank you. It's a short walk and it's right there anything else. Folks on this before we move on to the next item. So no letter thanks everybody and thanks for the presentation, James great. Thank you so much. Thank you. I really appreciate it good to see all of you we'll follow up with some ridership information and some stuff. That's already up there about some other stuff as well and Jenny Lee good, to see you sorry to keep you waiting on while we were on the agenda thanks janine, so I know that janine has sent her forwarded on to the committee the letters that I've already written to the Department of Parks Cci CB4, as well as Corey Johnson. So basically, I'm a dog mom, a lot of dog parents in our community and they do it dog run resurfacing. Petition has been active since the beginning of August. Basically, in a nutshell, the surface is currently raw asphalt. As many of you already know, I have actually personally never seen a dog run. That was just asphalt and it absolutely makes no sense. So the surface is really not dog friendly. Not only my dog but many other dogs who are using the park have their paws are peeling are getting cut, they're bleeding, and you know you guys, might think that that's not a huge issue compared to you know the p79 and the ferry issue that we just discussed, but it's not a trivial issue because we're using this path every day it is certainly a high traffic park. I was out there, you know I always go out there, but I was out there serving and petitioning with the dog parents most of focused, and I would say in peak hour and counting the dogs that use a park in a day it it's almost 100 dogs on a good summer spring day. It's definitely not a trivial issue because, as you know, our streets are not clean. There is trash, there is glass, there is other fecal matter on our streets and when the dogs are walking on it with an open wound after running at this park, it's definitely not a matter of time where it's going to result in infection, parasites, disease and unnecessary bills. So gene you can switch to the so. Those are some photos of what happened to our dogs when we run get them to run at the dog run. It's also in a really bad condition. Overall, so I have never seen a park staff member as lovely as they are actually cleaning the place. You know there are trees that are ripped out and nothing has been filled in so the bricks are loose, there are leaves still from Hurricane Isaiah's that are just piling around, and it's just nobody cares except the fact that we're using it like really regularly every day, a lot of the phone call attendees, actually dog, moms and dads, who are supporting me right now, and I see them there at the park a lot. The park is inside Dewitt Clinton park, it's between 53rd and 54th and 11th avenue. So, basically, my points are two points. Really. We need to resurface. This dog run. It's absolutely overdue. It's confusing to me as to why the dog run was designed this way in the first place, all we're asking for is just one line: we're asking for a smooth and safe dog run for our dogs to literally run safely. You can go to the please, so I did the petition. I did an in- person petition as well as an online one on change.org, and so I have over 500 signatures. So I just wanted to point that out saying I'm not alone, I'm not insane we're all. You know suffering from this, and I think it's something small in the community that you might think you know yeah, it's not a big deal, but it's just high frequency, we're not going to stop going to the dog run and it's certainly a very popular one in the area and the alternators are really not real alternatives, because central Park is not contained. It does not have a fenced in dog run. The 44Th Street, P84, Dog run is also raw asphalt and also that's even worse, because it does not have trees and if you go anywhere after 9 A.M, the dogs are going to burn their pores running around. So if you can go to the all, I'm saying is the solution is quite simple. It's quite logical. All we want is the full resurfacing of the dog run. Our preference when I surveyed the 80 plus in- person dog parents, is that everybody wants artificial grass. That's our first preference. We would also love a new doggy pool and just really, I feel like we're asking for the minimal here. We just want better maintenance, like any maintenance at this dog park on a weekly basis, because it's not happening so I've already written my letters. I've done the best that I can. I would really appreciate the support officially from community board from this committee, as well as getting over to the full board, getting approval and then just support to the department of parks, who, I believe, has jurisdiction over this area. So that's all I got ta say thank you Jenny. I have some questions start with Colin. Please come right! Oh yeah. I just wanted to say I just wanted to commend the survey. I do not think that this is a trivial matter, because number one you can't get a dog in New, York, City right now it you know everybody is adopting dogs during as a result of the pandemic. I go to deway Clinton park all the time to work out. It's a very well used park. I see a ton of dog parents in that park all the time and I'm sorry that you know that this issue is happening with their paws. I agree that I mean just based on the fact that this is like a very highly trafficked park in the neighborhood. I think that this is definitely something worth our attention. So thank you for bringing it to our attention. Alan, I take it you're trying to unmute yourself, Alan Oster, oh thank you so being involved with dog, runs for the last almost 30 years down here in Chelsea my question. Maybe if the Paul is was this actually built for dog use, or is this an area that was taken over fenced off, put a couple of benches in and but you put a sign up there dog run. So that would be my question as far as the resurfacing goes. You probably want to stay away from artificial grass. You need to clean these areas and picking up dog poop, either from natural grass or artificial grass is a little challenging sometimes left over. So I do not want to be too graphic about it, but I think that there are surfaces absolutely and if you want to connect with Hudson river park, they've renovated door guns, they use a particular surface that is suitable. I would not call it an asphalt, but it does have a give to it a little bit and keeping it clean. Whether you have a group of dog users that can do that on a regular basis or the Parks Department. Does it that's very important, but there are surfaces, hard surfaces that are made specifically for dog runs. Thank you, Alan Chris, Lebron hi. Thank you marty and thank you for doing the survey I've been using this park forever and not just for like Little, League, baseball or high school baseball or just general pass abuse. I used to bring my shih Tzu's there, the last 50 that I had actually had a heat stroke. It was a hot summer day and I had to take her to the bed and within a year we had to put it down because the easter for so severe. So thank you for doing this work. I agree. We've done some work with dog parks in Chelsea. I think that the price tag for that particular dog run in a Chelsea waterside park was incredibly high. People forget that they're, scoping and Rp's. If there's anything, I can do to help start a friends of a dog run with you or get fundraising. For that. I would certainly offer my black book for you guys. So that way we get the ball rolling and also I echo just utilizing. The institutional knowledge coming out of hrp for their downtown dog runs not necessarily a doghorn. That's on 41st street, which, yes, is a terrible dog run and needs to be refitted as well, but anything that I can do I'm open any letter in support of this endeavor. I'm behind. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. Thank you here from the Parks Department yeah. I was just going to go there. I just heard Chris say that he was willing to help start a friends of the the dog run. Is there is not such an organization now is there? I do not believe so, and you certainly have enough names to organize. You have 400 names. Is that the number I saw or 500 names, so it looks like what Chris is offering is something that might order y' all might follow through on so is, if it's all right with you Paul I'd love to hear you Paul Evans from New York, City parks, I'd love to have you talk about what you know about this dog run and others in your district? Am I putting you on the spot? Sir? Are you there? I see you on the list, but I do not see a microphone next to your name. Does that mean that you do not have talking possibilities in the chat he's saying that he's having a problem with his phone? He said he wrote in the chat. Thank you. I did not see that if you, if you can, he would welcome a dog run. A welcome dog run group at this location and what I would have queried him about, and maybe we can get him the next time when his equipment is working, is to get a short report from the parks perspective of what's going on with dog runs in our district. Why a dog group matters to the maintenance care and general decency of of a facility in a public park, and why a group there matters or not? Well, you just started to answer the question right. The way you asked it was an answer in part that a group would be a very important thing. I'm going to answer it in part right. A group would be a very important thing from the point of view of keeping that dog run clean, not of course, I'm spending the money on getting it surfaced in an appropriate way, but it would also be an important thing from the park's perspective to know that there are a bunch of people that are out there concerned citizens that want to keep their eye on this dog run and thus keeping parks alert to that. This is one that they need to pay attention to, but I can't speak for Paul. He will get his chance when he I mean. I appreciate the recommendation for a you, know, friends of dog run and maybe even us. You know fundraising and trying to get this done, but I mean for the infrastructure part of it. As Paul mentioned in the chat we can not. You know the 500 people, you know I have 400 and plus online and then 80 in person. I alone can not raise enough funds to change the surface. The pavement of this dog run. This is absolutely in the jurisdictional path. So I expect parks to do that and then with the routine maintenance. Also, it's actually not private citizens responsibility, it's our responsibility to pick up our dog poop and enjoy the path, but we're all tax paying citizens of New York City. So that's my point but, however sure I know that the 44Th Street P84 citizens have like a cleaning Monday or something every month and they'll go in and spray it down, and things like that. We're happy to do that. I'm sure that there are a bunch of dog parents who are happy to do that, but in terms of the actual change that we are asking for right now, I do not know Paul if you've actually seen the letter that I sent over, it was to be CEO of Manhattan borrow as well as a cheaper stuff, that's already circulating. I have asked for a response from parks by the 15th of September, so we can't hear Paul now yeah so anyway, we are asking him on your behalf, to report to us to the committee about the con. The parks perception of the condition of the park of the dog run and Park's plan for the replacement of the surface, which is what you're asking for absolutely Leslie. Did I see you yeah? I do not. I agree with what Jenny said. I want to also echo Colin. I agree with everything Colin said as well. I do not think if she's coming and I go to that park with my dogs as well, and they have also gotten cut paws. So I know exactly what Jenny is talking about and I do not think we should ask her or anyone else to start a group to get this either funded or this or that I mean she's coming with a there's, a real problem here and I had a question for her though Jenny did you look into what's the best surface because I thought it was like a decomposed granite or like a mulch. I do not know where you or did you do research letter purposes? Absolutely so I'm not an expert, I'm not a landscaper, I'm not a civil engineer, but I did very basic lay person, research and there are so many different surfaces, and I did ask the 80 plus people in person. Do you want gravel and dirt mix? Do you want rubber? Do you want grass, artificial grass and everyone's preference was artificial grass? However, with the dirt and gravel, we particularly were worried about it, because that's what the 72nd and 104Th the upper uptown dog runs have and they're actually not very hygienic, because parks will not rotate out the dirt and the gravel. So what happens? Is dogs will poop there? You pick up the poop or some people do not pick up the poop dogs will run all over it. Then they lick their paws and they get Giardia and that's what happened in a lot of uptown parks. So that's why we just want something. That's smooth and safe also means hygienic, and I am just trusting parks who have done this for many years to make the right decision. For us, our preference is artificial grass. If that's not going to work and in their opinion, that's not good enough. Then fine give us another proposal, but all we want is just a change. We want smooth and safe. That's it yeah. We can definitely look into polish here. I think I think that the artificial grass also need an irrigation system, or something like that. I that's why I was under that impression, which it's a little. You know it would be tough like Alan said it would not. It might not be the the best thing anyway just for purposes. I do not think we need to design it. I think we have not heard from parks and we need to hear what their position is, and we certainly hear that there is an urgency. Is there a letter? That's coming out of this. I move to write a letter requesting specific support from the Parks Department, for the resurfacing of this dog run based on recent successful resurfacing of other dog runs in Manhattan. Thank you so much everybody I mean. I will caveat this. Having been worked on the political side of things, the government side of things of this oftentimes, it is an elected official who flags specific money to re- service dog parks. That is what happened at almost every west side. Dog run in the past eight years. Actually, is that specific earmarked money through an elected official to resurface, a dog run? So while we should be requesting parks to better maintain and improve the facility, we might want to flag this for our good Council member Speaker Johnson as well. Yes, let's not forget participatory budgeting too. So the letter that's written is going to be copied to at least Speaker Johnson. I I'm going to take the vote on this. I think I know what the answer is, but I have to do it and I'm going to do it the negative way I did it before. Are there any? Is there anybody opposed? Is there anybody? That's either abstaining or present not eligible, and if there's any of those we'll have to differentiate, I do not see anybody. I take it. That means that we are unanimous in requesting this letter. Thank you. Everybody very much last item is, I think I think Jeffrey. It's really yours to talk. This is short and sweet for the committee having been a former second vice chair who's responsible for the budget task force, we are facing a pretty dire situation and Jessica who's. Our current second vice chair is looking to the committees, as we always do to think through our budget considerations and how we want to highlight, promote and think through those for this year's budget cycle recall that this will be a process that we go through as a committee to think about, based on our previous budget recommendations, we'll have an option to look at all of those prioritize them see. If what order they're in, should we adjust the order? Do we have new budget suggestions to put on a list? Remember expense and capital are in play here. How do we look at that through the lens of Covid-19? How do we prioritize based on the fact that the city and the Parks Department in particular, which has taken one of the biggest cuts of any agency in the city? If I'm not mistaken, how can we prioritize and still get some wins out of this? Is I think what our committee should be thinking about, and then it will be the job of the budget task force to take all of the recommendations from committees really prioritize those and you know bring to the surface. Hopefully what we can advocate for given this constraints of the city budget going forward so no business on this tonight, but to think about it think about where our priorities lie now as a community, the lens of Covid-19, especially as it relates to parks- and this will be back on our agenda- probably for the next two to three months- questions for Jeffrey. Does anybody have a need in the district that is particularly burning that Jeffrey should know about since he's participating in this? Not at the moment I take it. Hey, I see Blake's hand, go ahead, yeah just more of a question for Jeffrey. You know, based on all the experience with this, you know what a good resource you to educate myself on the status of the budget, cuts and areas that were in you know the mayor's proposed cuts, because I know there was some movement, for example, on the organics program between when it was originally proposed to be cut, and you know how it turned out. Do you know what would you suggest is a good way to kind of get up to speed and all of that, it's hard to see a comparison, because the city does not put side by sides of at least when they release the new budget. They do not show you what last year's budget was, and they especially did not do that this year, given the drastic changes of it, there's a really significant couple of spreadsheets that show you know like agency spending on the expense and capital side. I can't think of a fast, easy public resource actually on determining that. Unfortunately, how about the controller's office the report side of the controller's office yeah, I just do not know if they report on like the specific cuts in the current budget, like that's a really fast thing to report on just so, it is a possibility. Okay, thank you. Yeah I'll, take a look at the, but I mean also like blake. It's funny. I was having to google like what the total cut to the sanitation budget was, which was 106 million dollars, and there are. There have been headlines that tell us like what agency took how much of a budget cut. Honestly there's like it's a quick google. It does not drive you to the spreadsheet for the specific data, which is what I think you probably really want, and we need so you can find big picture stuff, but digging in on it is really through, like just spreadsheets on the city's budget page. Thank you. Anybody else on this issue. So now we come to my favorite part of a meeting like this and that's old business and new business. You thought it was going to be adjourned right and I actually do have one new business. I know everyone's going to kill me, but I have one comment. I do not know if now's the time, but now is the time. Okay- and I flagged this for Jeffrey- and I guess maybe oh marty, you too so recently, Corey Johnson's office used discretionary funding to give Hell's Kitchen park. When was this Jeffrey like three weeks ago was who two weeks we found out about it about a month ago, yeah about a month ago, Corey's office gave 450,000 to repave and to spruce up Hell's Kitchen Park right now. Obviously we're the parks Committee. We love it when money is given to parks. I just thought it was an odd placed odd- timed, very big number- half a million dollars to it's a functioning park right now, but yes, it does need some upkeep. I do not know maybe Jeffrey or someone else can speak better to that. I just thought that we should flag it. I just thought we should ask them the thought process behind it. That's a half a million dollars in the time of Covid-19. Sorry what which park Hell's kitchen the one on was it 47th and 10th? So it was, it was a. It was a. It was an eye- opener even to some of the people on the block who love the park, we're like wow, that's a lot of money for the park was not that park recently renovated within the last. You know last, maybe two years or so did they do now. It was closed down for a while some renovation in the toddler area. Right Jeffrey, then that was the one where the set. That was the one yeah, but there was that was because we took down a tree, and then I mean it was a long time ago that the eastern edge of the park, but I do wonder we should look at participatory budget allotments. Was this through Pb. I do not know it was not through Pb. It was not okay, but I will say two things one. We should have known about it, two, it's a lot of money, but it's not a lot of money when it comes to renovating a park. Unfortunately, because to do a full renovation would cost a whole lot more than that and we did include actually Hell's Kitchen park on our budget request. Last year yeah. I think it was 51, though it was like 50. It was like the. I think it was like number priority 51 or something like or way down, 51 on the whole list of the whole budget. Yeah, I'm sorry, the whole the whole community right suggestion asking what the money was for. I think that's it. I think that leslie, if we want to find out, we have to ask them, and so that means better, it's an administrative letter Jeffrey. Maybe it's an administrative letter I was not asking for. I was asking anyone had any insight, or I mean, if you think it's to the level of an administrative letter. That's fine. It was more of a question inside I mean I can I can see the office asking yeah. I think that's an administrative letter. Why was? Was this a part of a particular reason of funding I do too and who requested it? We just where the source? Okay! Thank you. Yes, I had one new business thing, apparently d, with Clinton's being used as an outdoor gym, and I know the city has said: there's no youth permits being used, but I've seen in other cities thanks to the magic of social media, safe, businessing, use of public spaces for the arts, and I was wondering if we can investigate that alongside with ACES and come up with a letter that can help benefit the community that makes health kitchen and time square thrive. Very good Chris send me a send me a letter on that, but to go back to this 400 to 500,000, I know of a basketball court somewhere in Chelsea that could have used a few bucks whoa, let's not start territory, wars, because as a hell's kitchen resident and a health kitchen park user. I welcome the money. I do not. I hope we're not trying to reject this money, and I hope it is purely out of curiosity because again, a council member has a right to allocate funds at their discretion. It's called discretionary funding, and so I just want to be clear that this should be couched in. Thank you. We're curious why it would be my approach, because I think that the village gets a lot of park money and I want to make sure that it suddenly does not end up in the village because we become red, flag, razors. So absolutely you're, absolutely right, but you have to forgive my colleague for trying to get some money for the Penn South Park Basketball court, which we have talked about before. Well, we northerners really dig we're not in a competition game. We have projects all over our districts and the administrative letter should be just asking for information. I think that's appropriate to me and the letter, the cooperative letter that Chris was just asking for Alan, really had the right idea. Maybe you'll create a first draft for us anyway, and we can share it with transportation that Alan has something to do with and we'll go from there. I work with Alan on a lot of traffic. I use the bus, that's the only thing. I know I have any connection to transportation- oh well at least you're, not on the ferry ACES davey ACES. Well, just if I can speak on that issue. So this is a issue of arts. Well, just about alternate uses to the parks and in general, and you know the use for private the you know the you know, because, yes, a lot of our public parks have turned into the alternatives to the private gyms, because the gyms are closed, and I think this is just an exceptional summer and by and large people are kind of turning the other way, because people still need to be healthy in the parks. You know this is the open space, so I think it's. This is why it's allowed. This is why it's allowed nobody's making a big deal over, that I make a big deal out of it, because it's only a handful of people making money on these non- permitted like outdoor gyms and we have scores of new yorkers out of work in the acting field and in the arc who just are not collecting unemployment because they do not qualify, and so I think this would be a great opportunity. Okay, let me let me finish the point, so we, as a committee have discussed in the past this issue. We actually have been opposed to private gyms or private fitness people taking over space in public parks for profit without departments, and so we do have a record of being opposed to that and this summer I do not think is creating a precedent where, in the future, people can say well, we've used the parks, as our you know, alternative to our indoor gym and therefore we should continue to be able to have access to public gyms for private business. You know we you can get a permit for that if you want to apply, but you know that we have had instances where there have been applications for public art installments in parks. We we've looked at some of them. We read them, they've been presented to us, so the normal means for that is, it does go through the community. I you know I do not. I do not know if it's a good idea for us to be advocating for turning public parks into you know, usually we're talking about increasing yeah. I do not think it's going to hopefully last beyond. You know the next, what six eight 12 months so whatever it is. So if there's a short- term solution, I do not think it's about making resolutions. I think it's more about working sort of administratively and finding ways to make it work, but I do not know if it's what we're requesting. If we're saying you know this is not. This is not part of me. You're finished Brett yeah go Chris in Central, Park right. Why can't we do that at dewitt, even short- term, that help out 30 people or 40 people or 60 people versus three or four something that can be utilized by all generations versus a small niche? I mean, I think the Parks Department has a has a has a process for reviewing proposals to do something, whether it's in the arts or any other use of the of the public space. So I do not. I do not know what we're asking for. I think we'd ask for parts to start managing their spaces and start thinking about the implications of allowing private gym youth on public land. I think that there is a colin. You had your hand up. Sorry, yeah, oh just a quick comment. You know, I think that, right now during Covid-19 I mean the city is bending over backwards to cut bureaucracy for individuals and for businesses and to sort of do things differently in order to facilitate you know, people working out outside safely making money by you know, training or whatever I've been in the park. While these trainers are happening, I've been in the fitness classes. While these you know, I've also participated, and I just think that like right now, maybe it's something we could just leave alone, because it's not you know because it's covered, and I do not think it's really hurting anybody, but that's my opinion. I would second what you're saying Colin, but pick up on the conversation that should occur. Dare I say it after Covid-19 if there is not after Covid-19, everything is going to be so different that we're going to have to reevaluate what we're doing all over the place, and this is one of the areas and I think it's a slippery slope of the parks. Department already manages organized sports permits and scheduling, and all that kind of stuff- and I frankly have found it really heartening to see. What's happened to do with Clinton park and the change of use in light of Covid-19 and with gym restrictions in play, people need their public spaces, which are parks, and it just goes to show the value of us of us and the things we advocate for as a parks committee more than ever right now. I just want to throw in there that we have. You know I'm on the board of the the friends of Chelsea green. You know the new park on 20th street and we've had many requests from groups and private gyms to use our space, because people need a place. They were good enough to come to us. They went to parks left to Us parks. We talked to parks about it because we were not going to allow anything. That parks was opposed to they've, taken a very lenient look at it, just trying to turn the other cheek, it's okay with us, and it's not disturbing the neighborhood. We took the survey we've been allowing it everybody that uses it has been considerate and quiet and thrilled and happy to be there, and we all understand it's temporary we're just trying to help out our neighbors at our local businesses and people that want to work out. So it's worked very well for us. Nobody is complaining about it. Thank you. Thank you very much yeah. I I'm just going to be the voice for the artist right now and I'll yield. If no letter comes out of this committee, then I'll talk to ACES about this but I'll yield. The point you chris any other points. People want looking forward to it: yeah just real, quick martin, it's Brad, just as restaurants, are taking over the street and the parking as I have gyms, and I do not know, I'm asking have Jim's taking two or three lanes or two or three spots to have a gym class there and kind of built it out for their use, which I'd be all for. I do not think anybody in this group has heard of that interesting idea. I fully support taking away parking spaces so that trainers can train in parking spaces. I would love a letter that would say that so maybe we'd see the ship. Maybe we can buy that with the West side, highway yeah close down the west side highway and make it make it a giant open, gym, yeah performance space. They responded to the West side highway today. I'm sure Colin saw that right. Thank you and I think look the letter to Corey Johnson, the 500 thousand dollars. I know a dog run that needs some new asphalt, so I was not going to say it. Thank you Colin. I want to thank Colin, Sarah and Leslie for volunteering to write that letter. I do not know if they would want to work with me on the West Side highway letter. Anything no. I moved a West side highway conversation. Thank you write that letter Jeffrey. Is that what you just said? Yes, you guys saw you guys, saw the response today, right or yesterday in streets block no about the west side, highway, closing down a thing for the west side of something the West side highway, the governor's office. Where was the response? Lesbian? Let me look I'll look for it based on the public meeting we held on Tuesday night. Let me double check before I share. It then share it when you do, because I have not seen it anything else, friends before somebody moves to Adjourn and who is that somebody I make the motion. Thank you Chris, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for a very nice meeting, stay safe, bye, everybody bye! Thank you.
