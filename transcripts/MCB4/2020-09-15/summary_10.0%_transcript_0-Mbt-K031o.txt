There was a big one that we just kind of called the DOE approvals or the schoolyard approvals is a more appropriate term where we sent to schools, saying yes, you're approved for the schoolyard that you indicated in the survey that you already have and that you did not make any additional requests for a park or street.
Those were what we called our priority list and those were the schools that we basically tried to meet the needs for first and then gave parks and street some india, sorry, department of transportation, NYPD time to review the remaining schools, and We have acknowledged that you do not have existing school yards You did not receive your request for a park or a street, and in that list initial initially in week, one, there were 28 schools in that list, And. So it's been my job to basically give those schools a call ask if they have any additional recommendations that they would like to submit for review either a street or a park so that we can try to accommodate.
153 schools have been approved for use of a street and, as I mentioned, earlier, 12 schools are still on our list of no school yard and still we're still trying to find space for them to utilize for outdoor learning.
A lot of questions have been asked: around, are tints and how to use tents, or are schools allowed to use tents, we're actually working on a sub policy now, where tent guidance will be provided?.
And I know that we also have a general we're, also thinking about and working on, general guidance for safety, especially as it relates to areas that are at risk for crime, and so that conversation is being had-.
A lot of folks in this in this group have read about the pandemic that took place in the early 1900s and how outdoor learning was utilized during that time, and so we're definitely leaning on those examples and just having conversations with community groups, parent groups.
Folks, who have been doing outdoor learning before this was a necessity for all and gleaning some best practices there in terms of timeline How long we see this operating right, now, just to give you some concrete response, park permits and street permits, Are being dated for an expiration of november 30th of 2020 in terms of the first phase of outdoor learning, and that is just in response to how we predict weather starting to shift drastically and obviously with Covid-19 still rampant and still moving throughout the city.
Don't know how Covid-19 is going to impact our school year, and so the plan right now is to basically do this until november.
I'm, actually in conversation with the department of city planning, as an aside, just to start thinking through some design models for principals and schools that just don't have the time or the capacity to think about design for streets, schoolyards and so We've, been we've been in conversation about ways that we can even offer some type of curriculum.
There is going to be more flexibility for school leaders to use their tents in school yards and parks over streets, but the policy will cover all outdoor spaces in terms of the heaters.
Do they need to go through your office if they want to request some sort of police presence, or you know for them to come by on occasion just to keep an eye on things depending on where they're located or does that have to go through your office?
Now we are trying to encourage all schools to come through the DOE in terms of any individualized supports, so we're essentially like brokering these conversations between all agencies, and this is at the request of the agencies, especially some of some of like parks and rec's department of transportation.
Is schools were reaching out to agencies individually and trying to request streets or parks without a real, streamlined process, and it was for lack of a better phrase- chaos in some in some of the agencies and trying to trying to meet the needs of schools and want to make sure that they're, not you know offering a school one street that another school had already requested?
This pta policy you're coming out with, because, as somebody who was the pta president for many years at two different schools, I know that ptas, who do a lot of fundraising and have access to funds, often work with sort of fellow schools that don't have access to funds that you know, I, think that's a great policy of sharing and If. You can get an attempt and trying to get a tent, for you know a nearby school.
We've heard mention of noise concerns for students who are you, know, participating in outdoor learning and we've heard mention of the possibility of maybe the DOE reaching out, or I.
And I'm just wondering is that one of the partner issues that you're going to be working on or is that being left to somebody else, I'm thinking that will probably fall under sapos, which is like the permit office,?
Do we still hold space for students and teachers to you, know, exercise, teaching and learning, but then also be respectful for residents that are living in the same spaces, so that kind of falls in the bucket of an individual case right now, but I think that conversation is going to have to resurface as we get closer to the school year, because I do foresee We're going to commit things over to the public in just a moment.
So, that's not a part of the outdoor learning initiative and they would just need to reach out to parks directly and parks is already aware that we actually had a submission for that over the weekend for a school They have a special events, permit process for that.
They continue to use these public spaces during the cold weather months and then the second question was: Does the DOE have any guidance on how schools can mark the streets and sidewalks, I.e, chalk, stickers, etc?
The use should probably be restricted to entry and dismissal and not for actual outdoor learning, but they do still have access to the to those sidewalks in the same way that they would, during a traditional school year on the street side.
I know that was just an example that the questioner just probably threw in there, but I really want to make sure that school that those streets are as protected as possible and we've actually had some specific guidance around certain street requests that they used a certain type of barricade.
You may not have heard back from us yet because we're still working through the schools that apply before you, but we do also want to make sure that you are not being kind of like if we overlooked you for any reason, you would reach out using the outdoor learning email address.
If you have a question about anything, just send it to the outdoor learning at schools.nyc.gov and also know that you should at least give a week between the time you apply to hear something back.
Then there was the conversation of That's, probably going to turn some teachers off from even showing up to school, because that will then kind of force teachers to take public transportation when they may not want to do that, or they may not feel safe to do that.
We're, not sure if they're going to need even need a permit right now, because if the streets already closed off under the department of transportation and NYPD, they would essentially be kind of protected during the school hours to park.
Thanks for the questions, janine, looking at the clock and wanting respect for both of mr chambers time and the folks on the agenda who are coming next, would love to wrap this piece up in the next couple of minutes, and so chris you're going to get the last name, thanks.
And they're, asking the speaker's office the same thing , so I think this is a great conversation to have, because you know we definitely want to use the input from the board when it comes to making decisions around the budget, especially you know, as it relates to our schools.
You know our public libraries, our parks, public housing streets and our schools, and so we have five million dollars, and every year we work with city agencies and residents to identify needs, and then we try to address those needs with this capital.
We did start gathering ideas last fall so, but That's just a little background in terms of the the capital discretionary funding that we that we do have we just wrapped up fiscal year, 2021 at the end of June and so out of the five million dollars Just about 2.9 million went to our local schools, ranging from technology upgrade to playground, equipment, to bathroom repairs, to cafeteria upgrades to new hvac systems.
We would like to fund all of them they're all important, but we do begin that usually in december, and we have then until about March to really start making designations, but that really goes right up until the budget, which is you know the end of June.
We have lots of conversations with the pta the school principals parent coordinators, but we're really focused on the capital side of things, not so much on the expense.
We, also, you know meet with their office during the budget season Gail covers the Manhattan, the borough of Manhattan, so she has a lot more to cover, but we do want to make sure that we're doing as much as we can to support the school requests here in council district 3.
I, don't know, because I'm not really involved in that part of the budget, publicly helpful to know My second question We all recognize that there are tremendous stresses and limits now on funding for all sorts of things and an incredible need in our city, but as even in connection with our previous speaker from the DOE.
Where you know we wanted to see what could be done about rooftop access, So, I, guess, I'm, just wondering: Have you been involved with any recent requests and not sort of about gardens on the rooftop or something, but specifically about creating more usable space within school buildings?
You know on their roofs, and do you envision any money being available in the capital budget this year to help schools with that, or is it just too expensive?
In terms of you know the space that they find is underutilized, And, maybe they'll start school and say:?
Think that conversation we're going to have with our schools this year about you know How do we respond to this pandemic and how do we sort of look at our school space, whether it's indoor or outdoor, in a really safe way?
Is the school located in on city property, or do they have a lease, because some schools are operating under a lease of five years, and so they wouldn't be capital, eligible?, Josephine, hi matt, one area where we could definitely use your help is trying to figure out how to how to I guess, guidelines for ptas to share funds if they choose to, because right now in the chancellor's regulations, there really are no guidelines, and You can't just like one pat pta, can't just write a check and donate it to another pta.
There is one that's happening almost every day and with hundreds of cultural organizations throughout the city to talk directly with city agencies about assistance, so I would be happy to connect them to that conversation and yeah- Rent movement for associated nonprofit nonprofits throughout the city, including theaters and they've, been one they've, been looking forward to reach out to corey, to have a chat about the bills that are, you know in the state legislature right now about this I'd love to be able to set up a call separately just with lit and with indie space.
You know, I, really encourage you to think about, perhaps not individual schools, although I don't wanna it's up to this committee, how it decides it wants to handle things, We're in that we may want to put the most pressure on in terms of advocating for funding in this next budget.
In this past fiscal year, budget, Good, news, sir man kit: Is there any action that we need to take on the outdoor learning, presentation, good question that I'm probably going to kick out to the committee to get reactions to in a moment, but just quickly want to circle back to david pinkes's question and comments around opportunities for folks in the theater community He's from the little island, organization.
I know it's just sort of one opportunity, I'm guessing it's not a huge one, but it feels like everything counts in these times, so just wanted to flag that as something going on in our area.
I was going to say something similar to leslie and just say that I know that I'm very familiar, that this is a big issue for teachers and that they want space near the schools.
We, want you know space for the students to be prioritized, but I do think that that they're doing it specifically to allow for space for teachers to park nearby and that you know it's not gon They're, not impossible, they can park a block away or they can set aside somewhere where they can park a block away, because what they said was they needed people to monitor it.
So I mean I leave very little carbon footprint I know many of the teachers, at least at like my kid's school.
Think one of the issues is that the if you try and say we're gonna close down certain streets and allow no parking and that's for the schools And then we'll take parking on other streets and make it only available for teachers.
Just two quick points on the parking I think that if we were going to write a letter about the parking, we'd certainly have to hear back from more schools on teachers who want to do it, but I do know.
Yes, teacher would certainly like to drive, and maybe what they need is just some sort of you know something to put on their windshield.
I, don't know, but I think that we would certainly have to reach out to schools to see if it's really worth doing a letter.
There is a group of pta parents who have been trying to raise funds for headsets for students, so at least they'll have that to help with the remote learning, but the space and the wi-fi are two big issues that I think need to be addressed.
If it's more in terms of recommendations, you know things like that, then I think you do want to make a full board, making a full board letter all right.
