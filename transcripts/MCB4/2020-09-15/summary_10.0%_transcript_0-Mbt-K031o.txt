Specifically, we have asked some questions around outdoor learning, but we'll turn it over to him to give us a quick presentation on how going back to school on the 21st is going and then, as Alan said, committee members will have a chance to ask questions and we'll open up to the public to ask questions as well.
There was a big one that we just kind of called the DOE approvals or the schoolyard approvals is a more appropriate term where we sent to schools, saying yes, you're approved for the schoolyard that you indicated in the survey that you already have and that you did not make any additional requests for a park or street.
Those were what we called our priority list and those were the schools that we basically tried to meet the needs for first and then gave parks and Street some India Sorry Department of transportation, NYPD time to review the remaining schools, and We have acknowledged that you do not have existing school yards You did not receive your request for a park or a street, and in that list initial initially in week, one, there were 28 schools in that list, And. So it's been my job to basically give those schools a call ask if they have any additional recommendations that they would like to submit for review either a street or a park so that we can try to accommodate.
153 schools have been approved for use of a street and, as I mentioned, earlier, 12 schools are still on our list of no school yard and still we're still trying to find space for them to utilize for outdoor learning.
A lot of questions have been asked, around, are tints and how to use tents, or are schools allowed to use tents, we're actually working on a sub policy now, where tent guidance will be provided?
Think Let Josephine is one of our board members who you've been in touch with speak to us in more detail, but one of the things that we've been talking a lot about is safety and how these spaces will be supervised.
And I know that we also have a general we're, also thinking about and working on, general guidance for safety, especially as it relates to areas that are at risk for crime, and so that conversation is being had-.
We have a half of another person who are not half of another person, but his time is split that are working on managing inquiries, calculating data daily having daily interagency conversations with city, Hall, Fdny, SAPO, sanitation, NYPD parks and recs every day, every morning.
A lot of folks in this in this group have read about the pandemic that took place in the early 1900s and how outdoor learning was utilized during that time, and so we're definitely leaning on those examples and just having conversations with community groups.
Parent groups, folks, who have been doing outdoor learning before this, was a necessity for all and gleaning some best practices there in terms of timeline and how long we see this operating right, now, just to give you some concrete response, park permits and street permits are being dated for an expiration of November 30th of 2020 in terms of the first phase of outdoor learning, and that is just in response to how we predict weather, starting to shift drastically and obviously with Covid-19 still rampant and still moving throughout.
We do not know how Covid-19 is going to impact our school year, and so the plan right now is to basically do this until November 30th Restart This program again in the spring when the weather starts to improve, And then we're also, as I mentioned earlier, when we talk about looking at other examples of outdoor learning, thinking about temperature weather thinking about outdoor heaters.
Again, I'm not going to speak too much on the tent piece in general, because there is actually like policy being developed right now for that- Even in the school yards, I'm not separate from the streets.
There is going to be more flexibility for school leaders to use their tents in school yards and parks over streets, but the policy will cover all outdoor spaces in terms of the heaters.
Do they need to go through your office if they want to request some sort of police presence, or you know for them to come by on occasion just to keep an eye on things depending on where they're located or does that have to go through your office?
We are trying to encourage all schools to come through the DOE in terms of any individualized supports, so we're essentially like brokering these conversations between all agencies, and this is at the request of the agencies, especially some of some of like parks and Rec's department of Transportation.
Is schools were reaching out to agencies individually and trying to request streets or parks without a real, streamlined process, and it was for lack of a better phrase- chaos in some in some of the agencies and trying to trying to meet the needs of schools and want to make sure that they're, not you know offering a school one street that another school had already requested through another process.
This PTA policy you're coming out, with, because, as somebody who was the PTA president for many years at two different schools, I, know that ptas, who do a lot of fundraising and have access to funds, often work with sort of fellow schools that do not have access to funds that you know.
So yes, that that's happening, and actually one of the things that came up in the conversation earlier today was a concern around not wanting ptas to start to think of other schools as charity and needing that support in that way, Exactly considering, all schools are part of our overall community All students.
Just wondering is that one of the partner issues that you're going to be working on or is that being left to somebody else, I'm thinking that will probably fall under Sapos, which is like the permit office, the safety permit.
Do we still hold space for students and teachers to you, know, exercise, teaching and learning, but then also be respectful for residents that are living in the same spaces, so that kind of falls in the bucket of an individual case right now, but I think that conversation is going to have to resurface as we get closer to the school year, because I do foresee We're going to commit things over to the public in just a moment.
So, that's not a part of the outdoor learning initiative and they would just need to reach out to parks directly and parks is already aware that we actually had a submission for that over the weekend for a school They have a special events permit process for that.
It's still helpful for us to know what schools are using their pre- existing play street And so that one came from an anonymous attendee and there are two questions from the same individual apologize if I'm mispronouncing any part of your name, but it looks like Janine Keeley First question was for schools that are using the sidewalks and streets for extra space during arrive on dismissal.
They continue to use these public spaces during the cold weather months and then the second question was: Does the DOE have any guidance on how schools can mark the streets and sidewalks I.E, chalk, stickers, etc?
The use should probably be restricted to entry and dismissal and not for actual outdoor learning, but they do still have access to the to those sidewalks in the same way that they would, during a traditional school year on the street, side.
So when I send out like the data for the day or when we have conversations about certain needs that all happens within that one chain, Department of Transportation is on its city halls on it, and so that is the way that we'll be marking streets.
I know that was just an example that the questioner just probably threw in there, but I really want to make sure that school that those streets are as protected as possible and we've actually had some specific guidance around certain street requests that they used a certain type of barricade.
You may not have heard back from us yet because we're still working through the schools that apply before you, but we do also want to make sure that you are not being kind of like if we overlooked you for any reason, you would reach out using the outdoor learning email address.
Then there was the conversation of That's, probably going to turn some teachers off from even showing up to school, because that will then kind of force teachers to take public transportation when they may not want to do that, or they may not feel safe to do that.
We're, not sure if they're going to need even need a permit right now, because if the streets already closed off under the department of Transportation and NYPD, they would essentially be kind of protected during the school hours to park.
Thanks for the questions, janine, looking at the clock and wanting respect for both of Mr chambers, time and The. Folks on the agenda who are coming next would love to wrap this piece up in the next couple of minutes and so Chris you're going to get the last name, thanks.
And they're, asking the speaker's office the same thing , so I think this is a great conversation to have, because you know we definitely want to use the input from the board when it comes to making decisions around the budget, especially you know, as it relates to our schools.
Our, parks, public housing streets and our schools, and so we have five million dollars, and every year we work with city agencies and residents to identify needs, and then we try to address those needs with this capital.
We did start gathering ideas last fall so, but That be So that's just a little background in terms of the the capital discretionary funding that we that we do have we just wrapped up fiscal year, 2021 at the end of June and so out of the five million dollars Just about 2.9 million went to our local schools, ranging from technology upgrade to playground, equipment, to bathroom repairs, to cafeteria upgrades to new HVAC systems.
We would like to fund all of them they're all important, but we do begin that usually in December, and we have then until about March to really start making designations, but that really goes right up until the budget, which is you know the end of June.
We have lots of conversations with the PTA, the school principals parent coordinators, but we're really focused on the capital side of things, not so much on the expense.
You know everything had been suspended in terms of construction because of Covid-19, including school projects, so the timeline was delayed, but the last we heard that it was going to resume sometime.
Also, you know meet with their office during the budget season Gail covers the Manhattan, the borough of Manhattan, so she has a lot more to cover, but we do want to make sure that we're doing as much as we can to support the school requests here in council, District 3.
I do not know, because I'm not really involved in that part of the budget, publicly helpful to know My second question We all recognize that there are tremendous stresses and limits now on funding for all sorts of things and an incredible need in our city, but as even in connection with our previous speaker from the DOE.
Where you know we wanted to see what could be done about rooftop access, So, I, guess, I'm, just wondering: Have you been involved with any recent requests and not sort of about gardens on the rooftop or something, but specifically about creating more usable space within school buildings?
You know on their roofs, and do you envision any money being available in the capital budget this year to help schools with that, or is it just too expensive?
In terms of you know the space that they find is underutilized, And, maybe they'll start school and say: look.
Think that conversation we're going to have with our schools this year about you know How do we respond to this pandemic and how do we sort of look at our school space, whether it's indoor or outdoor, in a really safe way?
What's going to happen this year, because it's still sort of undetermined how we would how we would do something like that, because so much of it requires us coming together and brainstorming ideas, but one of the real things that we get out of that is community ideas.
Thank you, Josephine, hi Matt, one area where we could definitely use your help is trying to figure out how to how to I guess, guidelines for ptas to share funds if they choose to, because right now in the chancellor's regulations, there really are no guidelines, and I think it only says that you can share them under some sort of like extraordinary circumstances which we are under right, now.
I think that they're loosening guidelines a little bit, but you know just for other things like supplies, whatever it is, as you know that there are some schools in our district that can raise well over a million dollars, a year.
How could they share those funds with other families in need, and the PTA question came up and So Matt before we go sort of follow up on Josephine's request for some help on something I do not know if this goes under your auspices, but broadband service to students in temporary housing is that anything that you can look into?
It's been a really important idea, trying to activate you know the parks and neighborhoods we're actually want to talk with Bob Benefatto about you, know, working with bids to be able to maybe to activate some sales space in some of Sorry guys, but I did not get much of attraction with the Department of parks, so that was something we'd love to work.
Any action that we need to take on the outdoor learning, presentation, good question that I'm probably going to kick out to the committee to get reactions to in a moment, but just quickly want to circle back to David, Pinkes's question and comments around opportunities for folks in the theater community, He's from the little island, organization.
I know it's just sort of one opportunity, I'm guessing it's not a huge one, but it feels like everything counts in these times, so just wanted to flag that as something going on in our area.
I was going to say something similar to Leslie and just say that I know that I'm very familiar, that this is a big issue for teachers and that they want space near the schools, and so I appreciate your issue.
You know space for the students to be prioritized, but I do think that that they're doing it specifically to allow for space for teachers to park nearby and that you know it's not going to They can park a block away or they can set aside somewhere where they can park a block away, because what they said was they needed people to monitor it in case the motor cars move.
I know many of the teachers, at least at like my kid's school.
Think one of the issues is that the if you try and say we're going to close down certain streets and allow no parking and that's for the schools And then we'll take parking on other streets and make it only available for teachers.
Just two quick points on the parking I think that if we were going to write a letter about the parking, we'd certainly have to hear back from more schools on teachers who want to do it, but I do know.
I do not know, but I think that we would certainly have to reach out to schools to see if it's really worth doing a letter.
There is a group of PTA parents who have been trying to raise funds for headsets for students, so at least they'll have that to help with the remote learning, but the space and the Wi- fi are two big issues that I think need to be addressed.
If it's more in terms of recommendations, you know things like that, then I think you do want to make a full board, making a full board letter all right.
Think Kit was working with the superintendent on that to sort of organize that follow- up meeting like we did last year, which I thought was very for you, guys, was very helpful in terms of just sort of getting face time with principles.
