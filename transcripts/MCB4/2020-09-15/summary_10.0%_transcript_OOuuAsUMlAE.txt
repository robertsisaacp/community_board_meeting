At a time we ask committee members to comment after the applicant speaks If there are any members of the public who want to speak, let nelly know We have one more committee member, introduce yourself, please Everyone, morgan, mclean, okay, just a couple comments on the agenda:: what used to be items five and six on the agenda?
It was for a small cafe, right next to the very beautiful floral shop that raul has had in the neighborhood for years, and they wanted to do a cafe and they had applied for a full liquor license and that it was part of their concept.
Though I wasn't there, there was a concern about giving a full op to people who had never had a liquor license before And I talked some sense into them, and we came back the next month with with a beer and wine application, with the understanding always that you know After they've spent some time, they've proved themselves to the community.
What's accelerated, of course, is Covid-19 as its committee's well aware: I'm not going to get into how much that has decimated the industry and Made it even more difficult to do business, but obviously that's a But the applicants feel that, having been in the neighborhood now built this cafe So with that change, aside, we're not making any other changes to the menu to the hours to the very early hours to the nothing else, is changing so happy to answer questions.
It looks, sort of like a coffee, shop, bakery type, place, and I was just wondering: Does it change to something else at night or How's, it gonna work, so they've always had early hours.
You know it's never changed into a like a wine bar sort of scene, late at night.
We're not going to have like a full bar with the kind of way you'd order coffee in the morning Right exactly that's just technically a bar under the liquor, lawn, and I.
To kind of you know find out whether that came before this committee, And it was shot down or is there going to be any other space besides the actual, very thin, cafe?
There, and we do know that I think in April of 2018 you had approved 674 ninth avenue, which is right down the block, which was a dry cleaner for a license with a 4am close.
I. Don't think they went ahead with that, but this community board did approve that so as recently as two years ago, and maybe since then I just can't recall, offhand- You approved space on 9th avenue that did not have a license.
Inside Their application indicates that they're going to have dancing but donald- The space in the basement will be what we call like a little event room and things like that.
So, the point was, I didn't want to say we were not making any money in the basement, We're asking for the same exact that we've had before and to that point we have spoken to the landlord, and one of the reasons we are looking to leave is you know it's just a bigger space and in the covered world So this may expedite it because he wanted to build residential.
You know it's not like we're being put into a situation where they exist, So What's there first, So If I come out the back of either the first floor or the basement.
That's, going to go from 50th street all the way to the to the to the let's say the left side to the far south side of our property of our space.
But I, don't want midtown to be a place where everybody comes just to have more bars and nightclubs, and even though you know the you know, boxers say it's been It's still been a problem for the community.
There, are multiple 311 requests that have been over the years talking about queuing outside blocking 9th avenue the doors consistently on their friday night party are open, even though there's a vestibule.
A police officer might stop by twice three times, maybe in the in multiple years we have a very good relationship with the police department and we- We absolutely do our initial application that the stipulations have us allow to keep our french doors open until 10 pm every night.
We have 61 people that we highlighted in a couple days who signed who are right in their vicinity, including across the street next door, who are for this application, and it goes back to the same thing.
What we've said is we want to be in a non-residential building on the avenue And, we think ninth avenue is the best- And I know: there's been discussion on 10th avenue,, there's other locations that we've looked at that have run into some opposition about 10th avenue being opposed not being the next 9th avenue.
I know I just want to say that you know there's never a perfect situation for any bar, and I understand that and everybody'd rather have it in another neighborhood The reality is our current space is separated by 50th street.
Look at this place, they're going to look at our bar and say you know what I want to live next to this N't.
My understanding is that he is requiring adequate, sound proofing to make sure that you know his tenants won't be bothered, but it's sort of one landlord that controls that whole corner, but I'm thinking more indeed about the tenants than the landlord, and I'm just wondering whether there is some treatment that could be done in the front and in the back, and especially in the back, because I presume that's where the bedrooms are to isolate a little bit, the the noise coming from the terrace and bleeding over to that to those buildings.
Cafe, sidewalk, and we know the problems that have happened for some bars in that neighborhood we've had zero violations, Let you know that we've done we've been operating through this by the letter of the law like we always have under such heavy scrutiny, so I hope that counts for something I read right.
We have two new applications for local licenses: number three: We have at 371 west 46th street, that's between 8th and 9th avenue.
So, we're happy to answer questions that the committee has Max, I'm a little confused about what's going on outside, because we don't have any record of there being a sidewalk cafe.
If it was a ground stone, wall and And, you could like have one table there You know this is what the city's website says, I, didn't, actually check the zoning books, which is my sort of my bible on it.
So one day whenever that day is where the mayor's done, extending the the D.O.T program, you know we'll look into it further and If. We think there's a viable small sidewalk cafe we'll come back to you.
And, we're gonna be doing exactly what we've done elsewhere in the city, which is operating a cafe bar from 7 Oh, no outdoor, space, no terraces or anything like that.
Also like the idea of keeping that open, because we don't know what's going to happen in the future.
There was a piece in the times recently somebody owning a restaurant on little neck, saying you know, I can't open up my restaurant indoors, but my neighbor three blocks away across the Queens nassau line.
The big problem is that you don't know who is going to go to the restaurant and come back and have it.
You know the progress has been giving a little more space to the restaurants, because October is when the outdoor space is going to close.
I mean I'm, not going indoor to a restaurant, but some people might They need to have an outdoor plan along with it, because and as far as the you, know, sanitation and the snow, plowing, etc.
They need to have it as a plan, so restaurant owners and bar owners know what their responsibility is.
The restaurants are not going to be inundated with people, right.
If I were a waiter or something like that, You know, I'm not going back to work.
Don't know what that's also going to be cost right, because if you have heaters and it's going to be electricity- Like what happens when we have all the acs on during the win the summer time right, There's just concerns that I have had myself, but I do think that we need to send a letter and don't know how to ask those questions or imply them, but maybe what one do is say in some sort of a fund or something like that, okay, rob and anger.
Because if we're going to put restaurant workers at risk, you know how do we make sure that everybody who goes into a restaurant is behaving the way that they need to behave?
You, know I'm going to shoot myself again for many years and at some point, like the other day, I was riding down 9th avenue.
It's people get a little different with alcohol and with the density of this city , operationally I want to open, I get back to work, but I don't see it happening real soon, And so with the police, department.
If they're, saying how many tables, how many people you know outside inside, they can also turn around and ask you these questions.
I'm sure we'd like to bring back most of their people and considering the amount of restaurants are closed.
Don't we ask them to bring these people back They could turn around and check in on the restaurants that are opening up at 30 percent capacity and make sure that they're doing what they're supposed to be doing.
And, having you know, like a small poster at the entrance saying you must wear a mask, therefore put the owner of the restaurant in a much better position that if people come in and don't wear a mask, they can call the police- When we were before Covid-19 everybody had clear directions.
You know where the temperature should be taken and that sort of stuff But ninth avenue Two nights ago there were people having a throw down and the cops were rolled up because they were not going to wear a mask they're, not wearing masks, and if I have to deal with that as an employee or an operator, I, don't know we want to talk about specifically how I'm going to do it, but you got to have the cop you got to have somebody there in uniform, in my opinion, and I hate to say that, because the cops have better things to do, maybe so pay detail.
You, don't get a temperature gun in your head It's up to you if you wanted, if you want to enter and I've noticed in some of these restaurants, I, tend to be on the outside, but I've been inside a couple of times that the seating area and the tables very clear separated, and apart not more than like four people at a table because they have you know small tables, not huge party tables.
Only seated alcohol, service, I, like that service, right,, I, hate to say it, but there's no If I've had my first drink People are people, okay, and that I mean I have a thought which We are all talking about enforcement and who is going to do that?.
That comments only go to burton me and not the whole committee, because otherwise it turns the whole commenting process into a public meeting, but we'll explain that when we send it out all right thanks for bringing it up, you actually would need to have the letter in if you're going to do it for full board by October 1st, so that we can e-blast it out by October.
And, we'll come back next month and have it on the new business for us again, a discussion, because I think we've had a very good discussion right.
We have to have like community meetings and discussions You know not all 400 people will be there, but at the elections we're going to get 150 or so Who does this for other organizations where he has a voting function through zoom?
