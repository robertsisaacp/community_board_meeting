At a time we ask committee members to comment after the applicant speaks If there are any members of the public who want to speak, let nelly know We have one more committee member, introduce yourself.
It was for a small cafe, right next to the very beautiful floral shop that Raul has had in the neighborhood for years, and they wanted to do a cafe and they had applied for a full liquor license and that it was part of their concept.
I talked some sense into them and we came back the next month with with a beer and wine application, with the understanding always that you know after they've spent some time, they've proved themselves to the community.
What's accelerated, of course, is Covid-19 as its committee's well aware: I'm not going to get into how much that has decimated the industry and Made it even more difficult to do business, but obviously that's a But the applicants feel that, having been in the neighborhood now built this cafe So with that change, aside, we're not making any other changes to the menu to the hours to the very early hours to the nothing else, is changing so happy to answer questions.
It looks, sort of like a coffee, shop, bakery type, place, and I was just wondering: Does it change to something else at night or how's it going to work The idea from the beginning from when they first came to?
You was that, in addition to the lovely pastry menu and cafe menu that they have, they wanted to have a beer and wine offering You know it's never changed into a like a wine bar sort of scene, late at night.
It's, not a bar, we're not going to have like a full bar with the kind of way you'd order coffee in the morning Right exactly that's just technically a bar under the liquor.
To kind of you know find out whether that came before this committee, And it was shot down or is there going to be any other space besides the actual, very thin, cafe?
The timing that we open is from the cafe, opens from 7:00 A.M to 11 P.M and the store opens from 9:30 to 8 P.M, so we'll never really open until midnight , I like to keep it here, something that the neighborhood can come and have a drink, and you know socialize and things like that, but it was never my goal or my You know my intention to have loud, music or any of those things, I'm, not sure where that rumor came from, because we only had the license to operate.
There, and we do know that I think in April of 2018, you had approved 674 ninth avenue, which is right down the block, which was a dry cleaner for a license with a 4, am close.
Inside Their application indicates that they're going to have dancing but Donald- Bob. So this is sort of like the cellar, the ground, floor, little mezzanine, the the rooftop The space in the basement will be what we call like a little event room and things like that.
So I know you mentioned that space is not licensed You are because the space that already is licensed will likely be licensed again, so we'll have two instead of one I, think a mcdonald's or a bar, it does not really matter, are any of the Your money.
So, the point was, I did not want to say we were not making any money in the basement We're asking for the same exact that we've had before and to that point we have spoken to the landlord, and one of the reasons we are looking to leave is you know it's just a bigger space and in the covered world You know the rents are for that place in our lease.
So, there's no question that he's building them above, but the reality and even as the owner who's going to rent the apartments he's like looking You'll, be here anything whoever I rent to will be aware that you're there before we rent , you know it's not like we're being put into a situation where they exist, so Anybody, who comes into eventually rent, would be aware.
That's, going to go from 50th street all the way to the to the to the let's say the left side to the far south side of our property of our space.
I live in a community, I'm really wholeheartedly against this, and a lot of people are also a lot of people in my area have left because of the problems we have with the bars Maybe there's a spot in eighth avenue and stuff like that.
You know all sorts of shania immediately from there they're not coming or not, but the reality is this community is And, I, think it's time for them to start moving on, and you know to eighth Avenue at the residential area.
There are, you know, moving this bar from one corner to another is not going to solve this issue.
A police officer might stop by twice three times, maybe in the in multiple years we have a very good relationship with the police department and We absolutely do our initial application that the stipulations have us allow to keep our french doors open until 10 pm every night.
We have 61 people that we highlighted in a couple days who signed who are right in their vicinity, including acrosss, the street next door, who are for this application, and it goes back to the same thing.
Look at this place, they're going to look at our bar and say you know what I want to live.
My understanding is that he is requiring adequate, sound proofing to make sure that you know his tenants won't be bothered, but it's sort of one landlord that controls that whole corner, but I'm thinking more indeed about the tenants than the landlord And I'm, just wondering whether there is some treatment that could be done in the front and in the back, and especially in the back, because I presume that's where the bedrooms are to isolate a little bit, the the noise coming from the terrace and bleeding over to that to those buildings.
We operate, outdoor, cafe, sidewalk We know the problems that have happened for some bars in that neighborhood.
So I just want to let you know that we've done we've been operating through this by the letter of the law like we always have under such heavy scrutiny, so I hope that counts for something I read right.
We have two new applications for local licenses number three: We have at 371 West 46th street, that's between 8th and 9th Avenue.
Looking to open a caribbean restaurant on 46th street, a rather busy stretch of 46th street, which folks on this committee know better than I.
So, we're happy to answer questions that the committee has Max, I'm a little confused about what's going on outside, because we do not have any record of there being a sidewalk cafe there previously and my recollection of that block, Is that to extend their outdoor tables they're all within the property line, and no one actually has a sidewalk cafe.
If it was a ground stone, wall and And, you could like have one table there You know this is what the city's website says- I, did not actually check the zoning books, which is my sort of my bible on it.
You know, vote on a sidewalk cafe until we get DCA plans and see all the instructions and everything does not stop me from asking me Okay, with the outdoor table on the property line.
So one day whenever that day is where the mayor's done, extending the the D.O.T program, you know we'll look into it further and If. We think there's a viable small sidewalk cafe we'll come back to you.
These are basically just people who are you know in the aisle there's like one drag performer at a time.
We talked about live music, not past 12 o'clock and the sidewalk cafe is eliminated for some future date as a separate application right, And they're going to change the answer on the sidewalk obstructions right within that one seat within the property line.
Also like the idea of keeping that open, because we do not know what's going to happen in the future.
The big problem is that you do not know who is going to go to the restaurant and come back and have it.
You know the progress has been giving a little more space to the restaurants, because October is when the outdoor space is going to close.
I think they need to work on an outdoor plan for the winter, maybe through December, because we with heaters and something maybe it can work for a little while and New York does not get that snowy.
I mean I'm, not going indoor to a restaurant, but some people might They need to have an outdoor plan along with it, because and as far as the you, know, sanitation and the snow, plowing, etc.
They need to have it as a plan, so restaurant owners and bar owners know what their responsibility is.
Well, I, want to say something about the indoor plan Like upstate is can be 50, but I would not have up 50 in New, York, City,, I, think, third 25 or 30 percent, and just- I also am aware that we have indoor dining it's approved as of October, 1st or October 15th.
The restaurants are not going to be inundated with people, right.
If I were a waiter or something like that, You know, I'm not going back to work.
You know just like unemployment's going to be extended as well.
There's just concerns that I have had myself, but I do think that we need to send a letter and do not know how to ask those questions or imply them, but maybe what one do is say in some sort of a fund or something like that, okay, Rob and anger.
Ask a few questions: have you been out of the country have been out of the city, you know, or have you been in contact with anyone with cobit , I hate to say, but it's like the barbers had to go through worse to sort of kind of do this checklist, You know the people coming in, so you could sit in a chair to get a haircut.
Because if we're going to put restaurant workers at risk, you know how do we make sure that everybody who goes into a restaurant is behaving the way that they need to behave?
It's people get a little different with alcohol and with the density of this city, operationally, I want to open.
You know of a landlord that does that you have to include your landlord and perhaps amend your lease, and maybe things have changed since I was looking for a restaurant years, ago.
If they're saying how many tables, how many people you know outside inside, they can also turn around and ask you these questions really quickly.
I'm sure we'd like to bring back most of their people and considering the amount of restaurants are closed.
And, having you know, like a small poster at the entrance saying you must wear a mask, therefore put the owner of the restaurant in a much better position that if people come in and do not wear a mask, they can call the police- When we were before Covid-19 everybody had clear directions.
The city wants to get their money back, they have to start finding people and if it's going to be with police detail Or There's something on law and order about like security, police detail or peace officers or whatever it might be.
I do not know if that's in the car, but we can include an Ap party, say what would you say: No more than eight people per party I just want to say, upstate, you walk into a restaurant.
And I've noticed in some of these restaurants, I tend to be on the outside, but I've been inside a couple of times that the seating area and the tables very clear separated, and apart not more than like four people at a table because they have you know small tables, not huge party tables.
Only seated alcohol, service, I like that service, right,, I, hate to say it, but there's no If I've had my first drink People are people, okay, and that I mean I have a thought which We are all talking about enforcement and who is going to do that?
And, we'll come back next month and have it on the new business for us again, a discussion, because I think we've had a very good discussion right.
You know not all 400 people will be there, but at the elections we're going to get 150 or so, and we have a person from it does not matter where he's from Who does this for other organizations where he has a voting function through Zoom?
