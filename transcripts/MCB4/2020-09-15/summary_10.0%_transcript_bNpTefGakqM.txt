But I'll, put on my camera once I finish eating my dinner, but I'm the last on the agenda, so I'm, just taking my time So. If you'd like to start, you can are my EDC colleagues here I was wondering if we had space for any new business at the end of the meeting regarding use of park, spaces for the arts, marty's, cheering marty and draw a new party, I think new business is proper to bring up.
The Manhattan cruise terminal is located on the west side of Manhattan from I think, Pier, 88 and pier 90 kind of below 38 is intrepid and then period eight is on 48th street and then above pier 90 is pier 92, which is also an EDC managed.
So we have a big up market people will park on the roof It's just only one story, so the d- bars happen and then the embarks happen after that and generally just like the cruises sail year round to bermuda and then in the in the summer, in the fall.
So we had the usns comfort in starting March, 31st, through, I, think April 30th Some Covid-19 patients EDC also began manufacturing, facials Gowns Bridge ventilators, a lot of other things, kind of to help the city get back on its feet.
There, are times when large numbers of people have access to the terminal like cruise calls or events that we have at the terminal, but there's a commensurate security presence from our operator that facilitates that access and allows us to do that.
Quick summary is that cruise ships use a lot of electricity, even when in port, and they usually run their engines to generate that power.
There are several other pieces needed of equipment on the terminal, side, large pieces like transformers and switchboards, which take up quite a bit of space, there's also a connection point required on the pier itself, the actual cable that will run from the shore to the ship, which needs to be a flexible to accommodate different ships, and one of the something unique about Manhattan.
It makes finding space to put this additional infrastructure challenging, although certainly not impossible, and then the third piece is actually having the connection point on the ship.
So by the time that this conversation responds, we should have someone comparable or on hand to be able to guide us to You know we have a terrible situation in terms of like air quality right now, And, so like looking at somebody with an energy background versus looking at somebody with a duke mba.
Edc has done a lot of efforts to help businesses, specifically certainly on our properties and being able to work with them in terms of how to how to help them stay flow through this time and how to maximize their businesses, but even at large, it's helping the city with working with small businesses, with larger businesses, with employers overall and making sure that they have the resources, the tools.
But I know at large we're certainly working with a lot of businesses and just at the Manhattan cruise terminal.
You may talked about space in your presentation, but I'm going to let the members talk about that We actually did in an exercise earlier this summer talk about potential opportunities to help with some of the pedestrian and bicycle transportation around the park, and you know we have identified that stretch that runs along the cruise ships area Is among the narrowest areas where there is the bike lane.
We see a very vacant parking lot area on the ground level and we do understand there is a path that the trust has built by the cruise ships before 9:11 and homeland security closed that off.
Alrighty send me an email, we'll work it internally at EDC, and then I'm sure there are other folks that will have to be engaged, but I think it's certainly worth looking into And This is not safe to have the public in here and whatever that looks like, but at the very least we can.
We were trying to kind of move it forward as far as getting shore, power, and I'm sure you guys on this committee have heard me talk about this a few times, but we had a meeting with Khan Ed in June.
It was a phone conversation, a phone meeting, They kind of had an idea of of where the main power lines would come from So. They said all they need, though, from you guys is the site survey to start it off.
We have been like looking at this since January and at what sort of state laws there could be to enforce this throughout the state and instigate sharp power both here and then also in cooperation potentially with New Jersey, so that we do not just move the pollution acrosss, the river, so So I'll jump in there certainly great to have a conversation with you, earlier.
The conversation with earlier that you know the city itself is in is in a very tough financial, situation, and So. We do not have funds to proceed with a project and that level of study that we actually thought would be, but Let's assume you did get a go ahead from either you found money for a study or kane came up with some idea of how to do this, just a guesstimate as to what it would take time- wise to get the first boat plugged into into an outlet.
This is something that I think I think Leslie says something down like five years down the road or something is that, where you said: this, I'm, just curious in terms of the logistics you got to get people in you, Right, like there are, as Leslie and the Senator's office know.
And I'll, let I'm sure the center's office would want to shine in because they're working, yes, some other ways to actually force people to do things.
To your other question about cost right, there's all sorts of ways to incentivize cruise ship companies to transition to this as well that sort of go beyond just the shore power Hookup, various like cap and trades type programs and sort of like discounts for compliance at different levels.
I think that it's really important that we be able to look together at some kind of site plan or site diagram that actually quantifies the pedestrian and vehicle traffic lanes.
So I would simply want to include that in any letter that we write requesting further study or maybe a further presentation, are you saying drawings by EDC, I, perhaps say they could come from the cruise operators, but You know it needs to, I think back up, and he claims that x.
Amount of space is needed during x time and there should be an explanati explanation that goes with that, Then maybe we can work together like a safety logistics plan that yeah, but also to you, know, resourcefully, come up with what's feasible in terms of recapturing some of that space for the public.
You know along the cruise ship terminal that pits pedestrians against cyclists and that's all because we had to make a highway for vehicles which take up significantly more space than you know, than cyclists and people, and then we're dealing with the same trouble on the other side of that fence, because there's roadways there to make room for cars and parking.
You, know electeds involved and actually begin to have a conversation, because it is extremely dangerous to be going from north of the terminal south or vice versa, and that's because of this wall that rarely serves a purpose.
I know we do a lot of things over at the book at the Brooklyn army terminal for like large events, and they stay there for like a couple of months at most, but not something that I'm thinking of to that magnitude.
Think that's also where the conversations with the senator are going to be helpful, because in part of legislation you can also incentivize by by making things more expensive for people.
There are different ways to do things: and, as you mentioned, you know, not all of the power is on the city, but I think we're able to support and make that I certainly do not think all the powers on the city.
We will never going to settle for something like that, especially in this day and age, and for years we've been trying to at least I've, been bringing up that every passenger should be charged a fee that the money goes to the park so to Piggyback, because Jeffrey said it very well, there could be a carbon emissions charge, but also there should be a fee that goes along with helping the park which could help incentivize us using that lane.
You, know, I think we're trying to utilize that area underneath the driveway and the third thing is, while the terminal is down.
There's a question on parking on the pier people driving into New York City go to a cruise ship, provide no benefit for local businesses.
I. Think that person wants people to park in New, Jersey.
: That's the first step right, I'm, not entirely sure of the process of connecting a cruise operator to someone that would actually do that service for them and what that means in terms of cost implications or their logistics and their planning.
You can connect them to whichever letter possible Would be that any revenue collected going forward either from cap and trade or heads would go directly to hrp on top of the 500,000 being paid in renting for the terminal, We need to separate cruise terminal operations and funding from cruise ships and separate that out from our interest around creating public space.
I think we should leave it up to the cruise ship, the companies, you know if they want to pay the fee.
So I would suggest that maybe that's a second letter- So we're expressing, I think, our observations about the current situation and are in, and we basically would be expressing our support for them to be able to put pressure on upping fees and things like that.
Think us lay people have the right to ask EDC and possibly the cruise operators to provide financial information about the viability of their peer and of how they might envision funding these issues that we think are important to us, and so I do see it as part of this letter.
You know, we've definitely been spending a lot of time, working through lots of logistical issues on just making sure that we are ready to launch for next year.
One of the things we mentioned in our eis is that the right now we are still contemplating whether or not to leverage the existing New York Waterway Bus fleet, which we know that has its challenges in it, but is extensive or running our own shuttle bus, as we do at East, 34Th street, where we use smaller smaller vehicles and provide small circulator.
The main issue, I sort of was hoping this would be on the agenda This evening was to one find out whether or not the service is on time, And I'm happy to hear that it is because, no matter what more public transit is a good thing, Why would EDC entertain the idea of running an additional means of public transit , There's, a public bus that terminates here has that have there been conversations with MTA and D.O.T about that?
Actually, I was not actually advocating for single fare, but it should be, but in this moment, I'm just more worried about the lack of thought of increase in passenger getting off at that terminal and then rushing acrosss, the West side highway via car or on foot in which we already confronting greenway issues, and you know, park population issues and all that kind of stuff, and so to better understand how EDC is approaching.
You want to ensure that all the people who are entering and leaving the park are able to do so safely, and so again, we've had previous conversations with city DOT and York Waterway, but we want to make sure that this is something that EDC is able to look at also.
You know, potentially people who are more dependent on public transport, especially given the difference in the amount of subsidy that goes toward each ferry, ride versus other means of transport.
One of the other things in terms of you know revisiting extension, the this love this route, in particular benefits from the fact that it only requires one new landing.
From the perspective of West Sider, though I mean I'm sure that there are one or two people who are trying to go to staten island, that St George's terminal, but it does seem like this route.
We recall that from the first letter and note that it remains, you know an open item, because it is the route is, as you said, what it is and, in a very like honest, way, we've looked through the different ways to route this, and we do not find that there is going to be an efficient way to do this, that, in a way that connects Saint, George, St, George and Staten.
At the at the peak of Covid-19, we were running about 50 of our normal service levels, and now we are back to about eighty percent of what we were doing a little more than eighty percent of what we were doing last year in terms of when you're going to see the change in subsidy , the There's kind of a clunky nature of when we report.
You know that the scale of a pedestrian bridge crossing the West side highway is definitely beyond the scope of what we're looking at right, now, which is not to say that we would not be supportive if that were to get some traction and find out how to do something like that.
While we were on the agenda thanks janine, so I know that janine has sent her forwarded on to the committee the letters that I've already written to the Department of Parks Cci CB4, as well as Corey Johnson.
There is trash, there is glass, there is other fecal matter on our streets and when the dogs are walking on it with an open wound after running at this park, it's definitely not a matter of time where it's going to result in infection, parasites, disease and unnecessary bills.
You know there are trees that are ripped out and nothing has been filled in So. Nobody cares except the fact that we're using it like really regularly every day, a lot of the phone call attendees, actually dog, moms and dads, who are supporting me right.
Think it's something small in the community that you might think you know , we're not going to stop going to the dog It's certainly a very popular one in the area and the alternators are really not real alternatives, because central Park is not contained.
I. Do not think that this is a trivial matter, because number one you can't get a dog in New, York, City right now it You know everybody is adopting dogs during as a result of the pandemic.
City, parks, I'd love to have you talk about what you know about this dog run and others in your district?
A group would be a very important thing from the point of view of keeping that dog run clean, not of course, I'm spending the money on getting it surfaced in an appropriate way, but it would also be an important thing from the park's perspective to know that there are a bunch of people that are out there.
I'm sure that there are a bunch of dog parents who are happy to do that, but in terms of the actual change that we are asking for right, now, I do not know Paul.
The city has said, there's no youth permits being used, but I've seen in other cities, thanks to the magic of social media, safe, businessing, use of public spaces for the arts, and I was wondering if we can investigate that alongside with ACES and come up with a letter that can help benefit the community that makes health kitchen and time square thrive.
We actually have been opposed to private gyms or private fitness people taking over space in public parks for profit without departments, and so we do have a record of being opposed to that This summer, I do not think is creating a precedent.
Where, in the future, people can say: well, we've used the parks, as our you know, alternative to our indoor gym and therefore we should continue to be able to have access to public gyms for private business.
I mean, I think the Parks Department has a has a has a process for reviewing proposals to do something, whether it's in the arts or any other use of the of the public space.
Right now, during Covid-19 I mean the city is bending over backwards to cut bureaucracy for individuals and for businesses and to sort of do things differently in order to facilitate you, Know, people working out outside safely, making money by you, know, training or whatever I've been in the park.
Everything is going to be so different that we're going to have to reevaluate what we're doing all over the place, and this is one of the areas What's happened to do with Clinton park and the change of use in light of Covid-19 and with gym restrictions in play, people need their public spaces, which are parks, and it just goes to show the value of us of us and the things we advocate for as a parks committee, more than ever right, now.
You, know the new park on 20th street and we've had many requests from groups and private gyms to use our space, because people need a place.
I know a dog run that needs some new asphalt.
I do not know if they would want to work with me on the West Side highway letter.
