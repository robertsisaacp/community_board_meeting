She's very effective for cb4 things, a lot of janine's going around doing a good work who thought that was such a common name: Right, hello, david, hello, blake, hello, jeffrey Give me a second here.
Just taking my time, I was wondering if we had space for any new business at the end of the meeting regarding use of park, spaces for the arts, marty's, cheering marty and draw a new party, I think new business is proper to bring up.
While we deal with you know like our current fiscal situation, I think about 2200 ship calls but Sailing stopped in mid-march, and since then the CDC has put a no-sale order so essentially banning cruise ships from sailing in u.s ports and that's been extended through September 30th, and then cruise ships have voluntarily cancelled all of their calls through October 30th.
We talked earlier about how the cruise terminal is leased to an operator, so they're responsible for continuously maintaining the facility security, as required by the coast.
Quick summary is that cruise ships use a lot of electricity, even when in port, and they usually run their engines to generate that power.
There are several other pieces needed of equipment on the terminal, side, large pieces like transformers and switchboards, which take up quite a bit of space, there's also a connection point required on the pier itself, the actual cable that will run from the shore to the ship, which needs to be a flexible to accommodate different ships, and one of the something unique about Manhattan.
It makes finding space to put this additional infrastructure challenging, although certainly not impossible, and then the third piece is actually having the connection point on the ship.
How do you plan on doing that long term without any funding currently, and what methods are you thinking about using without having that senior leadership available to guide your juniors and your mid management team So the intention would be by the time that we re-sparked this conversation, respark.
So by the time that this conversation responds, we should have someone comparable or on hand to be able to guide us to You know we have a terrible situation in terms of like air quality right now.
Edc has done a lot of efforts to help businesses, specifically certainly on our properties and being able to work with them in terms of how to how to help them stay flow through this time and how to maximize their businesses, but even at large, it's helping the city with working with small businesses, with larger businesses, with employers overall and making sure that they have the resources, the tools, the access to pro bono, work that can help them really flourish in this time, or at least they float because we really understand this is a unprecedented time.
But I know at large we're certainly working with a lot of businesses and just at the Manhattan cruise terminal.
We actually did in an exercise earlier this summer talk about potential opportunities to help with some of the pedestrian and bicycle transportation around the park, and you know we have identified that stretch that runs along the cruise ships area Is among the narrowest areas where there is the bike lane.
While we do understand that, while cruise ships are important, there's a lot of loading unloading, it's a very busy place, and obviously there is not We understand the safety issues associated with that, but by and large, especially like on weekends.
Send me an email, we'll work it internally at EDC, and then I'm sure there are other folks that will have to be engaged, but I think it's certainly worth looking into And This is not safe to have the public in here and whatever that looks like, but at the very least we can.
We were trying to kind of move it forward as far as getting shore, power, and I'm sure you guys on this committee have heard me talk about this a few times, but we had a meeting with khan ed in June.
It was a phone conversation, a phone meeting, They kind of had an idea of of where the main power lines would come from So. They said all they need, though, from you guys is the site survey to start it off.
The conversation with earlier that you know the city itself is in is in a very tough financial, situation, and So. We don't have funds to proceed with a project and that level of study that we actually thought would be.
Something is that, where you said: this, I'm, just curious in terms of the logistics you got to get people in you, Right, like there are, as leslie and the senator's office know.
And I'll, let I'm sure the center's office would want to shine in because they're working, yes, some other ways to actually force people to do things.
Alan, on your first question about timing, just for some context, the Brooklyn terminal took about seven years to build so just to sort of give you a sense of what that looks like in terms of forcing cruise ships.
I, think to your other question, about cost right, there's all sorts of ways to incentivize cruise ship companies to transition to this as well that sort of go beyond just the shore power hookup, various like cap and trades type programs and sort of like discounts for compliance at different levels in regards to their docking and pollution.
To sort of minimize the cost to cruise companies as well, I think that it's really important that we be able to look together at some kind of site plan or site diagram that actually quantifies the pedestrian and vehicle traffic lanes, what dimensions they are when they're, actually in operation, so that we know you know and can discuss together in a resourceful, way.
So I would simply want to include that in any letter that we write requesting further study or maybe a further presentation, are you saying drawings by EDC, I, perhaps say they could come from the cruise operators, but You know it needs to, I think back up, and he claims that x.
Amount of space is needed during x time and there should be an explanati explanation that goes with that, Then maybe we can work together like a safety logistics plan that yeah, but also to you, know, resourcefully, come up with what's feasible in terms of recapturing some of that space for the public, I'm sure most of us are used to riding bikes past it and just seeing a lot of empty space most of the time.
You know along the cruise ship terminal that pits pedestrians against cyclists, and that's all because we had to make a highway for vehicles which take up significantly more space than you.
You, know electeds involved and actually begin to have a conversation, because it is extremely dangerous to be going from north of the terminal south or vice versa, and that's because of this wall that rarely serves a purpose.
I know we do a lot of things over at the book at the Brooklyn army terminal for like large events, and they stay there for like a couple of months at most, but not something that I'm thinking of to that magnitude.
Think that's also where the conversations with the senator are going to be helpful, because in part of legislation you can also incentivize by by making things more expensive for people.
There are different ways to do things: and, as you mentioned, you know, not all of the power is on the city, but I think we're able to support and make that.
I. Don't think we want it to be those people on those ships bring a lot of waste and a lot of trash to our community, and they should certainly be paying to be able to do that and more so.
You, know, I think we're trying to utilize that area underneath the driveway and the third thing is, while the terminal is down.
There's a question on parking on the pier people driving into new york city.
I. Think that person wants people to park in new jersey.
I'm, not entirely sure of the process of connecting a cruise operator to someone that would actually do that service for them and what that means in terms of cost implications or their logistics and their planning.
You can connect them to whichever letter possible Would be that any revenue collected going forward either from cap and trade or heads would go directly to hrp on top of the 500 000 being paid in renting for the terminal, We need to separate cruise terminal operations and funding from cruise ships and separate that out from our interest around creating public space.
Made, three points, as I, as I, see at the letter, is to EDC and with a copy to possibly the terminal, operator, I'm, not even sure, if that's the right thing to do, but I, see a single letter divided into the three parts that you're talking about, but clearly delineated.
I think we should leave it up to the cruise ship, the companies, you know if they want to pay the fee.
Third point: is it's a little bit like you know, we're the lay people on the board dictating or making suggestions, about.
You know business decisions that are So I would suggest that maybe that's a second letter- So we're expressing, I think, our observations about the current situation and are in, and we basically would be expressing our support for them to be able to put pressure on upping fees and things like that.
Think us lay people, have the right to ask EDC and possibly the cruise operators to provide financial information about the viability of their peer and of how they might envision funding these issues that we think are important to us, and so I do see it as part of this letter if it can only be constructed in that way And you'll see a letter The conversation is, is ongoing.
Issues, like concerns around bus layovers concerns around how to ensure that you know our fairies are being good neighbors when we, when we enter the space- And, we're still working through that.
One of the things we mentioned in our eis is that the right now we are still contemplating whether or not to leverage the existing new york waterway bus fleet, which we know that has its challenges in it, but is extensive or running our own shuttle bus, as we do at east 34th street, where we use smaller smaller vehicles and provide small circulator, service.
This would be on the agenda this evening was to one find out whether or not the service is on time, And I'm happy to hear that it is because, no matter what more public transit is a good thing, Why would EDC entertain the idea of running an additional means of public transit , There's, a public bus that terminates here has that have there been conversations with mta and D.O.T about that?
Wasn't actually advocating for single fare, but it should be, but in this moment I'm just more worried about the lack of thought of increase in passenger getting off at that terminal and then rushing across the west side highway via car or on foot in which we already confronting greenway issues, and you know, park population issues and all that kind of stuff, and so to better understand how EDC is approaching.
You want to ensure that all the people who are entering and leaving the park are able to do so safely, and so again, we've had previous conversations with city, DOT and york waterway, but we want to make sure that this is something that EDC is able to look at also.
We recall that from the first letter and note that it remains, you know an open item, because it is the route is, as you said, what it is and, in a very like honest, way, we've looked through the different ways to route this, and we do not find that there is going to be an efficient way to do.
You know that the scale of a pedestrian bridge crossing the west side highway is definitely beyond the scope of what we're looking at right, now, which is not to say that we would not be supportive if that were to get some traction and find out how to do something like that.
I. Don't think that this is a trivial matter, because number one you can't get a dog in new york city right now it You know everybody is adopting dogs during as a result of the pandemic, I go to deway clinton park, all the time to work.
I'd, love to hear you paul evans from new york city, parks Maybe we can get him the next time when his equipment is working, is to get a short report from the parks perspective of what's going on with dog runs in our district.
A group would be a very important thing from the point of view of keeping that dog run clean, not of course, I'm spending the money on getting it surfaced in an appropriate way, but it would also be an important thing from the park's perspective to know that there are a bunch of people that are out there.
The city has said, there's no youth permits being used, but I've seen in other cities, thanks to the magic of social media, safe, businessing, use of public spaces for the arts, and I was wondering if we can investigate that alongside with aces and come up with a letter that can help benefit the community that makes health kitchen and time square.
We actually have been opposed to private gyms or private fitness people taking over space in public parks for profit without departments, and so we do have a record of being opposed to that This summer, I, don't think, is creating a precedent.
We've used the parks, as our you know, alternative to our indoor gym and therefore we should continue to be able to have access to public gyms for private business.
I. Don't know if it's a good idea for us to be advocating for turning public parks into you, know, usually we're talking about increasing I, think it's more about working sort of administratively and finding ways to make it work.
I mean, I think the parks department has a has a has a process for reviewing proposals to do something, whether it's in the arts or any other use of the of the public space.
Right now, during Covid-19 I mean the city is bending over backwards to cut bureaucracy for individuals and for businesses and to sort of do things differently in order to facilitate you, Know, people working out outside safely, making money by you, know, training or whatever I've been in the park.
People need their public spaces which are parks, and it just goes to show the value of us of us and the things we advocate for as a parks committee, more than ever right, now.
You, know the new park on 20th street and we've had many requests from groups and private gyms to use our space, because people need a place.
