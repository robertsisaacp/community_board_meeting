I'm, going to use that environmental discussion at the segway to officially call our community board 4's waterfront parks and Environment Committee meeting to order.
As everybody, knows, I, think we've all been this before we are holding our meetings virtually in part and thanks to the governor's executive order, allowing for public meetings to take place.
We had proposed removing one of the trees that was located in an area of the expanded dog run, and we were doing that to accommodate the water play for the dogs in a more centralized location, and you asked us to reconsider that and take a look at preserving that.
Those are the areas that we had to really focus on in terms of incorporating your comments and looking at redesign and refinement next, so that included, the dog runs the picnic area, the entrance, the comfort station, some of the plantings and the synthetic turf field.
You, also see that we're maintaining circulation along the sidewalks, maintaining the circulation from 24th street into the park along the basketball, area, The, basketball, You can also then see that we have the stills have the three entrances into the dog run.
You get to see some of the thinking in terms of how we're going to be utilizing new trees, tree canopy to start to create and emphasize spaces I'd just like to chime in one of the things that we here at the trust really liked about this design.
We, obviously were looking to preserve as many of the healthy existing mature trees as we could, both within the park, as well as the street trees.
The idea was to have low ornamental plantings to really kind of draw you into the park and then once you're in there you're kind of like in a room in itself and Terry spent a lot of time on them.
When the plans come up, it provides flowering interest in the spring and then in the fall you may have seen it provides these little papery seed enclosures, which are a really lovely like fall interest, Then they also have the added benefit of you know a light, breeze kind of creates this sort of fluttering and noise sort of aspect to them.
To make note of is the Gleditsia up in the left hand corner that's a tree that we've selected to use in the picnic area, and that is primarily because it's got a light, open, airy sort of head right.
You know all of these kinds of parks and open spaces.
Your sight lines go straight, acrosss the park And, you kind of start to get a hint of the tree grove at the picnic area , We're looking to use granite curbing throughout the park and then just to the left of the main entrance.
You know, raised a bit we're looking at doing low fencing on top of those on top of those curves to help protect the planting.
We definitely intend to do furniture very similar to this, but the specific model we're still working through with their maintenance people making sure, like the specific model, is totally maintainable and what we want to use so movable furniture where you see it, but And, then this highlights the custom bench seating that we're proposing utilizing stainless steel for the supports and the arm What this bench really starts to do is to create you know a variety of options for seating.
They are also spaced at a distance that would deter someone from laying on them, which is you, know, an important way to help monitor usage in the park next, so the picnic area directly opposite the playground you've seen this before the layout has not really changed too much.
, we're looking to utilize, reclaimed, stone from the existing park and then seating and then.
If you go to the you can start to see what those tables are like they're, very similar to what is the existing tables and chairs that are currently in the park.
There is planting surrounding on the outside the stone walls, and then the one thing I neglected to mention when we were at the at the plan is that we are making some minor modifications to the play area directly, opposite, particularly to the entrance to accommodate stroller parking, and we are also planning to change that fence.
You start to see what the what the Festoon lighting would look like and how the space would feel just one quick thing that the trees are far along in this image.
You know that elevated seating that we talked about previously, which gives you a really nice vantage over the entire dog, run in order to accommodate that we had to shift around some of where we were locating the granite walls, and so we have done that so that tiered seating now backs up against granite walls, which will be those repurposed granite, walls.
Number four is the new location of the water play area in the large dog run And again we're utilizing that stone wall as a backdrop to that to one help protect from water spray from moving out onto the sidewalk there, and it also gives us the benefit of being able to kind of stack up some of the granite blocks to utilize for other water features in that area.
I may have missed something, so somebody else feel free to jump You look up on the West side, just adjacent to where number six is number six, which is the Sally port entrance that comes in from the park.
If you could stay on this for a second, the blue area is exploration, we're doing in trying to reuse a good quality of the existing granite stone to cut it and reconfigure it to create interesting patterns that are really durable for the park.
I would hope that the design is something that would discourage overflow You know, discourage the people putting in household trash in those bins and also have a place for recycling.
It looked like there might be a tree or something that would prevent people from the street from seeing them, And. So you know we just want to make sure that if there is a vendor there in the future that there's you know ways for them to attract customers from outside of the park.
Thank you for putting in more of those solar panels that and that it's going to light up most of the park.
I think the amount of space that you would lose to the park by creating the sight locks would be negligible.
I. Guess, if you can hear me, my response is: If we're looking for sustainability and we're trying to maximize solar energy to have open sight, locks, exiting entrances, is kind of counter to that Actually, just throwing hot or cool air out, But I, really in this day and age, not would not have exterior sight locks in a climate like New, York It does take up more space.
These are a nature of public space, acrosss, the city of New York as a part of our zoning code, think Plaza's on park, Avenue, think, sixth and a half avenue in Midtown, between sixth and seventh, fifth and sixth, and this corner of Ninth Avenue.
I do not know if everybody understands the history of the park and trying to put it together.
I mean the parkway was made because the builder of this building, I think it was a man named Hyman, Shapiro, agreed to do the park and then the plaza in front of the sheffield in return for the added walls that was in 1977, we can't find the original plan and we can't find with a city planning.
I think, reasonably continued this and when we when Bosley came in with a second part that was through well, Eric was the main thing, but so was whatever you know our speaker, but he was not the speaker than he was our local city council member anyway , Some of the chairs of the community boards in between have been more generous than others, and so it's been a struggle My mother also lived in the Sheffield before it became a condominium, and so I saw what it looked like in different phases until it got straightened.
Also, the Parc Vendome started their facade repair and they were working they're working on the 56th street side, so they have extended a shed, and I do not know if it's a whole building or What onto the park And that's closed the play area which always which has been in disrepair.
We do not want to really open the whole park and since we suspect that people want the parko open or some people do, we would like to propose a compromise where we open the kiosk and the seating area for the kiosk and that we keep it somehow closed at the other.
We've heard that people want the park open.
And she's, the one who really started the fact that the park needed repair so eric and The office was so helpful to us, because I mean Anita you're We try to work very carefully, and now we have the same managing agent that the Parc Vendome has and that we have so hopefully that's going to also help make things easier.
I'm just going to make you a little louder, but you know what the trouble with the grasses, not only the pigeons, but there are people who take their dogs on the grass.
You know I do not want to go back to my history there, but I'm just wondering curious about that, and also to get back to bank parking London.
It does not include money, because we have the scaffolding where the Sheffield was the first one to do the facade stuff and our scaffolding went slightly, I, think Affected Anita did it affect the parking lot went into our garden area You know it's something, that's what happens in New York, because the City, Council and I'm afraid I was on it and that local law 11 was passed.
You, know, I think it's notable to recognize that it would be a beneficial asset to everybody along that area, not just the Sheffield, but also the Parc Vendome.
We could work out a deal where the Parc Vendome maintenance people would take one power washing during the day or something like that.
We should discuss it more with our building managers and the boards right, because now what is happening is that there are people standing on the sidewalk feeding the pigeons from the sidewalk.
Just wanted to say when the park was open, people braised were brazen and just fed.
You might know this as well- is that it's essentially a public park, because it's on right on 9th avenue on 57th street, but It's, but it's maintained privately and the people who maintain it privately are not even really adjacent to it.
Now, because it's locked up or the maintenance is not as good as maybe you would see a regular city park because they just do not have the staff or the money or the constant, attendance, and I think that's a problem.
So I carl might be able to shed some light on how maybe that can be rectified through a you know: It's that private public kind of thing, Carl, I think, can I add one more thing.
There is not a compromise of doing half the park, you know be kind, of.
I'm, the person now who's back working on the park, so we should pull it together and discuss it, and when they we get the bids back, and I know exactly what, where the tripping hazards are, we should you should come and we can show you and Anita will be there too, so happy to do.
You mentioned that you were talking with your board about this, since it's such a huge cost to maintain You know wanting ownership of this park any longer, at least among some of your share of your members.
We've, offered it back to the Parks Department and the fact that we would pay for the maintenance, but so far they have not approved it, but that I think, would be a very good.
I just feel like with only 40 of the student body at that high school now attending, and we do not know what next year is going to look.
It's the same thing and we do not even know when it's going to be open.
Well, I can have the treasurer, explain it to you, but there is no specific responsibility, except that we have to maintain the park in accordance with a plan that you participated in years, a couple of years, ago, approving what it looked like, and that's I, remember being on the board.
When is the park actually going to be open halfway in a month as soon as we repair the the problems that are that we've identified all right, And you're, waiting on bids, and for that work to happen right, but Jeffrey, the public is asking, and we can't say well.
The only way to solve the pigeon problem is by opening the park.
It was quote mandated to get closed, so we did not go in to maintain it also because the Parc Vendome started their construction and they that really made us close off the playground, part and part of it, and I do not know if you want people sitting in the park when you've got scaffolding not too far away from you.
Know, maintain and open this park.
The park with the Health department person to kind of look at conditions.
I do not know if we have to go back to the city planning department or we have to we'll definitely be coming back to you, but I do not think that's going to happen until for a while.
If anybody has new stuff to add that can be considered by when, frankly, by the time I turn around the survey, I think budget task force meets Leslie, I'm kind of looking at you or Alan the 22nd The committee, needs to turn this around in the next two weeks.
I think you're 100 right that we're going to see some shifting in priorities of keep it clean, keep it open and the rest is sort of frosting from what we can get right.
