Let me take a look: eight plus the open dining, , I'm, Bert, Lazarin, Co, chair of the committee, and I called Zubiak, the other co- chair, If Chanco public, member, okay, So, on the agenda.
Is anyone who's been with us before knows what this committee will do will make a recommendation on whether to grant or deny a liquor license to the full board, which will hear these applications and vote on them again on November 4.
Now we're realizing the importance of having outdoor space that is open to the public, it's important, not only for us, but we believe for the public, not knowing how long this may continue, and also just an appreciation of the importance of having some outdoor restaurant space.
One is a change in method of operation to allow us to use that not just as amenity space But As a regular restaurant, that's serving meals, full meals, full menu with a service bar that will be open to the public and because we're putting in a service, bar.
We have approval of the license application by the state liquor authority, but we have not pulled it because the hotel's not opening right spring of next year.
Why, and then the anthony is like Ju is here, but I think his microphone is now working here now: Ah, here's, the second one: Okay, we we are applying for the restaurant y license for the transfer.
You know security plans I'm going to put somebody one of my employee stand outside Then we have a little space right in front of the store.
Are you going to be using the street space a parking space for the restaurant, the outdoor dining?
Yeah, we're going to use the street On the north side and the only street air road, roadside, yeah, broadway, okay, So you're, going to use the open the street space for extra tables, but not the sidewalk yeah, not sidewalk, , so you'll agree to a stipulation that the you'll have no music in the out any outdoor, space.
Yes, I mean, if you're going to use the street, I think the sidewalk, especially in those streets, should be kept.
Okay, no music and outdoor dining is only on the street, not the sidewalk, yes, you're.
25% capacity indoors is maybe you could have a reservation system where you have people only use open table and that way people know that they really can't congregate.
I, do not know if it's because there's too many people or whatnot, but I will talk a little bit about the general parameters of the proposed application and then certainly answer any questions throughout this discussion, but also I'd like to turn it over to aldi, Because, as I mentioned.
Interrupt me if I lose something, but basically I show that compared to a three foot distance where these measurements are made inside the roller cover we're going to be 50 feet away from the nearest residences, which is on the north side of the street.
After the music noise travels it's down to 59 Going inside an open, window.
So you that the only music that you'd hear would be when someone walks out the door to go outside out into the roller cover area, but I do not think there are any plans for any speakers or televisions, or at least speakers in that area.
I think it would behoove all of us to separate your second floor into the inside and outside, because the because all of those things we are discussing, no music blah et cetera.
On, page 13, there's a blueprint and the blueprint shows the bar on the inside, but on the other side of the wall it shows that there are seats there, Is that window going to be open and will that music be bleeding through?
The applicant agrees to incorporate all the recommendations in the revised report and all doors and windows from the inside space to the roller cover space.
We have about 15 tables and we're looking at sitting about 25 chairs, and it will be music that is going to be played on a sonos Now we do not have any outdoor sitting or so, but we're planning if everything works well with training and all we might apply for open restaurant to occupy the street seating.
We got one email from a community board member saying that there are already four licensed bars and restaurants on this block, they're concerned that this is a back door to opening.
Will applicants use a storm, enclosure, You, know enclosure which are at the door of the restaurant?
So that's definitely a mistake: online, all right, The second thing is that this discussion about the sidewalk sign.
We definitely have more than eight feet of space, for people to walk right, but that's not The rule is that it should be against the wall.
Definitely, no music and no sidewalk cafe if it's in the street right.
Yes, no sour cafe as well Right, no sitting on the sidewalk at the same time as you are sitting in the in the streets, that's correct!
I wanted to know who made the complaints from the community, because I am concerned, it's a residential building There are a lot of bars on this street.
We're not like a bar, we're actually still trying to be more of a coffee shop, So, we're happy to talk to more people and all that.
Any other committee people comments, questions that was that to know from you, tweet Okay, anybody from the community nelly, no one like to make motion.
Okay, now, like we got a late email from a community member Christine is not a storm enclosure issue, because the door it's inside, right.
My point is that once you put the the tables and chairs in the street, we want to make sure you are not putting any music there right and that new tables and chairs are put on the sidewalk, which no we'll not do that.
My window, I see the rear of that building and I wanted to address some concerns that we had with the previous restaurant, and I wanted to just you, know, discuss them and see what would happen.
That's in the kitchen, or that the base music was so loud that it would permeate into the apartment a lot of times the previous restaurant used to keep the rear door open because of airflow, and thus the music would leave.
Second thing is that late night workers, usually after the closing the restaurant, threw out garbage and did a lot of work in the back in the evening hours of like two and three o'clock in the morning, and then that would wake us up and that's another thing.
I was aware that there was like five tables outside not using it, but we're not going to use that.
And, like I said, I want to use the main room as much as possible, contain the energy and the noise level, and so it's I thought the application.
You know and have 4 am licenses going back decades and we only try to pair things back as people New operators come in And it's important to hear from people in the neighborhood.
Right, thank you and if grace, if you go to the Community board, 4 website, there's, what's called the Nuisance reporting protocol that you know tells you how to complain about noise and other issues to various agencies.
Yes sure they're, going to correct pages two and five of the stip form to show that there are some outdoor seats within the property line, not on the sidewalk, and those seats will be closed and vacated no later than 10 P.M weekdays, 11 P.M on weekends, there's recorded music, only there'll be no music in any outdoor space if they choose to use utilize outdoor space other than the front yard, The private property, that seating will only be on the roadway not on the sidewalk doors to the rear yard will be kept closed at all times.
Michael's, taking over the old spoon Fed space on 51st street, he's opening an italian restaurant with his family, members.
You tell us a little bit about your background in the in the restaurant industry, eventually because I know have a contractor, Yeah, I own, a successful construction company in the city and when I was a kid I started off in the deli in catering And, then I moved up to being in a bar restaurant, from where I grew up a bouncer there and kind of like a manager, and then I came into the city worked around a couple of places.
You know chiefly when it's open, or I mean how does that work with your construction, work or You know other people with Day- to, day, responsibility, Absolutely like a construction, company, there's foreman and there's managers and restaurants.
You know I'll, be there entertaining clients, but I'm going to make sure that my restaurant hopefully makes money in these unprecedented times and enhance the community with good italian food and a good crowd.
So I kind of stumbled on this interesting opportunity through getting to know the landlord And So either you or your cousin's going to be there regularly, yes, The street.
Let me know if these two are okay, the former operator at this location, bessem kukage, will have no involvement, whatsoever, financial or otherwise in applicants operations, whether it's owner management, manager, consultant or employee and besson, Cucad, has no involvement or connection with the corporate applicant, which I guess is 331 west 51St restaurant Inc. Will.
I just want to let you know, because these people do not seem responsible, so what's happening going to make sure all the garbage is cleaned up and eileen does not have that issue ever again.
It cost a lot of money to cart, garbage away and having a construction company making this investment into the restaurant definitely trying to save costs where we can If it's, if it's rubbish that can be picked up by the city, I'm That is not you know any kind of sheetrock or anything that would require permits or work like that.
Is: Are you going to use open street dining in the on the parking lane?
You know we did not discuss open, streets.
We would not have a Covid-19 situation If we do, and if it is permanent, then we would like to use it So the same stipulation you have heard before, which is you know it's on the in the parking lot on the sidewalk and no music whatsoever, that's an hour with attention.
One before that was a bar, though right And, you know, do construction on the ceiling We. We can definitely do that to help prevent the prevent the noise for eileen and any other neighbor that has ever complained, but we're not going to have loud, music.
It's background music and 10 11 12 o'clock, we're having people eating, not you know a bunch of kids rolling out of rolling out of wherever and coming to make noise.
I thought that more space you know, sort of room within a box within a box gives you more sound proofing, but maybe right.
I went to the previous restaurant a lot The second floor was never in use any time.
We can say that the lack of you know the lack of noise had because I do not think they ever had anyone well just as long as Michael is aware that it needs to be well sound proof because he does not want to come back and have to do it again.
In addition to the other steps, I read we'll say that the applicant agrees to sound proof second floor space ceiling using soundproof, glue and sheetrock on ceiling right all right, and I suggest we do what we did with all the other bessem places same thing , I'm, sorry, Bert and tell the SLA that you know we do not have the ability to investigate that does not that have there had been reported connections with bessem cusack to this space.
They will only use the parking lane and not use the sidewalk, and there will be no music whatsoever in any outdoor spaces.
I'm still going to follow Christine's motion and second Hopefully a cocktail and some italian food Any idea what you're opening, hopefully, when I, when I get this liquor, license.
Yes, you meant that's what your choice is, which block exactly okay, page five H5, you know , Have, you read the rear yard policy?
I read the rooftop policy, okay, and so that means you said Yes, outdoor space.
We changed the two answers on page five, that says: yes, there's no music and to extend you use any open.
I. Think that just like we're talking about you know outdoor space, maybe it makes sense to expand our outdoor space stipulation to include the open, dining and then ask the applicants to you.
The recommendation would be no music outside at all, and you know we have the choice between saying yes to outdoor space or not from the storefront or just no outdoor music.
So the question could just be what we're asking people tonight you know The context of this is that the open, dining they do not have to come to us This is these questions will be thrown out at an applicant if they're coming for a restaurant right license, and we will throw these out at them, not that they have to And, they want to go for open, dining.
You know the restaurant, which is in the parking lot so christine the question.
We do not want to ask and the one we are going to be asking is the outdoor music and the other guys Let's hear from other people, I think that the spirit of people not blocking a sidewalk is actually what I would.
It won't be a question that says: will you agree to not have live music it'll, be you know where you have outdoor music?
But today, on the today on the outdoor space, we have a question which says: do you agree not to have any music right?
Control, though, because you're going to have people not eating at the restaurant, wanting to stop and listen, no The other thing I had on 46th street, which is this entertainer, was like 300 feet down.
