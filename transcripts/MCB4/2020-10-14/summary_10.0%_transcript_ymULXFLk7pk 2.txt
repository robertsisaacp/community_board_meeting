The music noise travels it's down to 59 The voice levels after travel or Al Going inside an open, window, believe it or not, the sound level, drops.
Not, that they would just be inside and it would leak out when they would be basically hardly any sound from music going outside Now. Three feet,, as we all know from Covid-19, is basically like one arm's length: away.
Yeah, I mean,, you know,, because in order to open up,, you have to open large portions Maston, Sansom- And, it's not like you, can just open up a little window and hold most of the sound The purpose of the role of cover Chair: I did not make to make it a big issue.
I think it would be behoove all of us to separate your second floor into the inside and outside Christine Berthet- Committee Member: All of those things we are discussing new music,, blah,, etc.
Wait, down second floor inside second floor outside Christine Berthet, Committee, Member: Yeah thing that distinguishes it from the true inside space.

You leave a space if you use, for example, will insulation,, which is soundproof and fireproof and then, you know, Inge Ivchenko- BLP, Public Member: couple inches with the next layer of sheet rock.
Inge Ivchenko- BLP, Public, Member, I, thought that more space, you know, sort of room within a box within a box gives you more soundproofing, but Rob Walker, Committee, Member: Nobody it, BLP, Public, Member, Right., Rob, Walker, Committee, Member, Just basic app actually is good because it installation, as well as it stopped sound.
