Have not got delayed, we look. You missed a few minutes. Last youtube. Yes, for the first time today somebody told me they were late because of traffic. Did they want you to do something about the traffic? No, they said they were late to an appointment because of the traffic. Does it really all right? I count the Quorum Jesse and it's 6 33., yes, you're at a quorum. Okay, then, let's get started good evening. Everyone welcome to the October full board meeting of Manhattan Community Board, four, I'm Lowell Kern the chair and our first agenda item tonight is a presentation from the one commanding officer of the four precincts that cover our district. That was not reassigned in the last month, so I am pleased to introduce Deputy Inspector Stephen M Hellman of the 13th precinct. The 13th covers a small part of community Board 4. in accordance with the working group that we formed in our back in June, we're asking all of the precincts to come through on a regular basis to try and establish better relations between the Community board and the NYPD. So I'm going to turn this over to Deputy Inspector Hellman, and it's all yours, sir. Thank you for joining us inspector. Can you you're having some trouble there? Or can you join us, because we can't hear you, let me try to find a way of getting in touch with him. Okay, because it does not sound like you heard the introduction either. No, I do not think he did. I do not think he has actually audio. That's the part of the problem, not sure what to do about that he's here. Well, if you do not mind going continuing on, I will let me get on the horn and I'll talk to the community. Okay. Well, then, let's do something. What should be simple? I will entertain a motion to adopt the agenda. If someone wanted to do so, I see Jd raising his hand as they grow. Second, from christine and from Paul all those in favor of adopting the agenda. Please raise your hand. I is there anyone opposed. Is there anyone opposed to the agenda? Okay, the agenda is adopted. Let's talk about the minutes. Are there any comments on the minutes? For the meeting for September katie go ahead, let me just pull it up real quickly. Actually it was just under the the section about Derrick Ingram. It says oh darn. I have to pull it up quickly. Here we go. It says something about the fact that his apartment was rated, which it was not. So I think we just have to take out those few words, but otherwise the rest of it was great. So I'm pulling it up right now, Mike, are you getting this Mic or Leslie? Oh, I am, but let me tell you when I use words like rated, I'm quoting him. He told us that his apartment was ready and therefore I copied it see. Okay, so right now the minutes read the in the first sentence like it says during which his apartment was raided by police squads, attempting to arrest him on a warrant that apparently never existed. I would just say during which police squads attempted to arrest him on a warrant that apparently never existed, but his building was rated right. They came into his building, but not his apartment or you can just change the word apartment to his building. If you wanted to mike you're okay with that yeah, that's what I'm going to do, because, if we're going to reflect what he said, I'm not going to put the word in there. Okay is rated. That's fine! Anyone else! That's fine! Katie! Did you have anything else? Could anyone else have comments on the minutes? I'm looking to see if I see hands, I do not I'll entertain a motion to adopt the minutes. I heard I see Paul and Jeffrey Ii Jeffrey, not if you'll. Second it. Yes, all those in favor of adopting the minutes raise your hand all right. Does anyone oppose? Is anyone opposed to adopting the minutes? The minutes are now adopted. Thank you very much. Jesse did we connect with the deputy inspector? Yet I believe you so I think he's got audio capabilities now: okay, Deputy Inspector! Hellman. Are you with us I'm here I did it right. I thought I did a very nice intro and you missed all of it so, but everyone else heard it. So I'm going to now turn the floor over to Deputy Inspector Stephen M Hellman of the 13th precinct all right. Thank you. I'm sorry, I missed your introduction. It looked good. Thank you for having me I'm glad to be here, have to do my crime Spiel just to go over where we're at right now, which I'm pleased to say we're down for the year 11 percent in crime. That's 167 crimes that that's a good place to be, and when you look at the 28 day period, which is where we in the NYPD we live in a month, so to speak, to look at crimes, patterns trends and we're down again 20 percent down in every category, except for Grand Larceny of vehicles. Nine versus seven needless to say, does not mean that we're not seeing look. I walk out there, I'm walking on the streets every day. Do we see issues yes and I'm hoping when I'm done talking to hear any complaints and issues you want to bring to my but yeah quality life concerns, definitely seeing it. The homeless, the homeless type committing random low- level assaults up to like 21 random assaults for the month unprovoked. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt, but yeah I see it I'm open to addressing it, which we are addressing it. We are working with department of homeless services, consumer affairs with the vendors I'm not going to lie. It's been an uphill battle. We go, we move them, we address it, they come back, so I'm empathetic. I understand, I'm glad we're down in serious crimes, but I understand there's. Definitely some quality life concerns in the confines of the community board, as well as the 13th precinct in entirety. So with that being said, please anyone that wants to talk to me address anything. You know I'm here, please inspector. Can you remind us what part of the 13th precinct is within our Community Board district area? I was hoping you could tell me that Jesse. Can you I'm not sure exactly where the boundaries are we are from. We are from 14th to 26th street from 6Th Avenue West yeah, okay, yeah 14 to 23, so we cover so that's from 14th to 23rd, from 6th Avenue to the south side of 7th avenue, that'll be the confines of the 13th precinct. Okay. So it's that little corner. So does anyone have any questions either about that little corner of our district or, more generally, for Deputy Inspector Hellman? I do go ahead: Mike, yeah, hi, Deputy inspector. Thank you for coming. Thank you. I wanted to ask you a question. Generally speaking, you know with so many so many shootings happening in the city. I can tell you from firsthand experience that I've been able to help in that regard in sense that I've had two shootings right outside my window, one in May. I was the only one to report it and one a few days ago, the only one to report it and the detectives who contacted me said that if it were not for my call in May, they would not have a suspect that they're pursuing. So I thought about this and I said gee there's so many people hear these gunshots. There's so many people walking around with guns- and I see the numbers are astounding numbers. Has anyone given any thought about? You know like a crime, stopper sort of thing you know getting out to the public and saying hey. Look. If you hear shots, you got to tell us about it. That's the only way we can pick up bullet Frag. You know bullet shell casings, which is what they did. They would not have had them in May had nobody called, and you know that sort of thing and the other night they you know I'm up early. These things happen at like three four five in the morning, so you know maybe some sort of crime stopper announcement should be made to the communities, because there's too many people out there firing weapons, yes, Sir! Well, thank you for the question. Where may I ask them where you live because we have zero shots, fired calls in the 28 day period? So where are you I live? My window faces up 25th street between 9th and 10th, and both these shootings were right. Underneath my window huge shots huge. I know I'm familiar with that by the development, correct, yeah, exactly yeah, that is the 10th precinct, but that does not mean I can't answer your question right. Yes, it should. I do not know the statistics as far as shots fired calls in the 10th precinct, but I'm sure I actually, I know for a fact. So, let's just say hypothetically, I did have a shots fired called in a 20-day period and whether it's the overseeing borough or downtown comstat or just a zoom call with the executives at one police plaza, a shots- fired call is treated like an actual shooting, like someone's, actually being shot for. The reason being is we have to know why the shots were fired. Are there any ballistic evidence and a very big? How do I put it result of a shots? Fire is retaliation. So that means, if there's shots fired this day and they were shot at somebody. Are they going to come back the next day and someone else is going to try and retaliatory shooting so up most important, a shots fired, even if someone's not shot to answer your question? Yes, 100. You should a call 9-, 1-, 1 and b, what you're saying when you? What was the term you used for you? The question was: if you, if someone, oh shots, a crime, stop crime, stoppers is always active and always takes into account. Someone calling so crime stoppers does exist right now. I could talk to the CEO of the 10th precinct, which I think that just who's the sealed attempt. Now it is now captain gold, Rob gold, just became the commanding officer of the 10th precinct, a 10-year guy. I could let him know about this question and I could assure you that he's looking into every shot's fire call, and I would hope that people are calling when they hear shots fired. I know I would 100 well, let me tell you one other thing: the detective who called me the other night remembered my first name from May: that's how isolated these calls into the precinct car or to 9- 1- 1. He remembered my name another. I listen, I'm just speculating right now. Another you know thing that might be people could be that live in the developments that you know the players over there and I'm speculating right now and be hesitant to making a call you know on their own. But that's what the NCO philosophy is all about: the NCO officers in the 10th precinct. I know they have a very good program. They go out there. They discreetly will reach out to witnesses, complainants give out their card and they get comfortable with people and they get people more comfortable which they might have to do in this instance. If you're really hearing continuance of shots and try and get people to be more proactive with reporting it all right. Thanks for your question, Mike Paul because his hand up hi officer thanks for coming and joining us. I asked this question of CEO coleman when he was with us last month and I think it's not as prevalent an issue with you, but I'd like to see if I can get a conversation going amongst all the cos where the precinct lines into a crossover so particularly up here at 40 39th, where the 10th, the Midtown north and Midtown south those corners where the intersections are the drug dealers all know where those lines are and if they're on one side of the street and they see an officer on the other side of the street. They know they're not going to be bothered and I'd like to start to see a system where officers cross the street, even though it's not within their precinct, rather than calling the other precinct to get some action and maybe setting up something where it's every Tuesday and Thursday the 10th crosses over to the 13th and then wednesdays and fridays. The 13th crossover, but some way that the officers on the streets can actually take action against criminal activity. If it's not in their precinct, acrosss the street. That's a hard thing to do, but no that's not a hard thing to do at all, and you know if my officers are on one side of the street and people are committing a crime on the other side of the street. I better not find out that they did not go acrosss. The street I'll tell you right now, yeah! Well, what we're finding is they're calling the other precinct to bring the other officers down should not happen, and that- and you know it's about communication- you bring that issue up. I was the executive officer of Midtown North. I was the executive officer of Midtown south as well I'm familiar with the area you're talking about. I mean it's about communication, it's about talking to your commander, whether it's the new, I think it's Megan, O'malley, now Midtown north and it's after Rob o'hare. Let me tell you a real go- getter. If you know him from the sixth he's, not letting anyone deal drugs in his prisons. I'll tell you right now, so I to be all serious communicating and there should be never an instance where you go to an or no that's, not my priesthood over there. That's unacceptable I'd want a phone call from my personal phone. If that was to happen, but not just putting a better to work on, I talk to regularly. You know was Rob O'hara in the six, whether it was coleman in the 10. John O'connell, and I we've had a new shake- up of commanders. Forgive me if I do not rattle anymore right, communicating and talking about the guys. You know the the corridors that we share because a lot of times they can commit a crime on my side they're going into there and we're always communicating. But that sounds like a quality life issue where they, you need an omni presence and you need proactive, cops there. So you know like again 43rd street on that corridor. I can raise that to megan as well as Rob. That's not a problem appreciate it. Thank you. You're welcome, spend some time with us. Thank you any other questions from the board for the CEO Sarah Appleton go ahead, hi inspector thanks for being here tonight. I'm sure you've seen that in recent days there's been a lot of public discussion and media coverage on mass adoption among NYPD officers. I think this is an issue that you know at least my opinion was always important, but has certainly become particularly important with coping cases ticking up around the city and officers being charged with enforcement of mask wearing and other social distancing rules. I'm sure that I'm not alone on this board and saying that I've seen you know dozens of NYPD officers in our district mask- less on our streets throughout the summer and fall, maybe noticed a couple more. You know every time I go out, but for the most part most of the officers I'm seeing are still not wearing masks and obviously that's not only a public health problem, but it further erodes trust and goodwill. I think you know among our community and members of the NYPD. So can you just talk about what's being done at the precinct level, to encourage, mask wearing and hold officers accountable, 100, and I agree with you totally perception's reality. You know we where we wear these uniforms, we're representing something and not only what actually the mass does protecting ourselves and other people. You know the 13th precinct just to let you know when Covid-19 hit, 65 percent of my workforce all had Covid-19. At the same time, we one death Covid-19 is very serious. We do not take it lightly. This we know this. Is you know the question you asked is made it all the way to the police commissioner on down, so we do have the internal disciplinary action or oversight where you know we're telling the troops we're checking up on the troops. You know they have to wear their mask. I do not know, will you walk and see an officer? You know with his mask pulled down. Probably do we know what happened five minutes before? Was he chasing a subject? Is he short of breath? I do not know, but I have to tell you the masks are important. We have to wear them, especially when you know social distancing can not be used if it's lack of a better term. So there is a disciplinary process going in from the brief on down and that that's where we are that's what we're doing? Can you describe that disciplinary process? Briefly, I would not say it comes with a like. Oh if you're caught without your mask, we're taking this many vacation days from you. That's that has not been implemented. I think right now it's at the importance level of me as a commander to my supervisors and to my staff, letting them know that you are going to be reprimanded whether it's loss of vacation days, loss of assignment you know, am I going to lie to you I'm going to. Am I going to say that every individual case is going to be taken into account of officers in the park and he just chased the perpetrator and he could not breathe and he's by himself in an instance like that, would I look to be disciplining one of my officers? No, but if an officer is pulling over a car of several cars, he pulls a day and he's and he's doing summons enforcement, and he does not have his mask on. I think that's egregious so a situation like that. What would happen is we'd write. What's called the command discipline, which is like a paramilitary term for like a gig or a rip and then would go to a panel and we think about that individual basis. That would be the significant punishment. Has anyone been through that disciplinary process yet zero in the 13th precinct? I'm sorry, could you repeat that none of his officers Sarah? Thank you very much for your question christine. Thank you. Thank you officer for being with us. It was interesting that you said if they are, if he's pulling a car and talking to a driver, it's a big deal, but you know they are a lot more pedestrian than drivers so when they are walking next to pedestrian, that's also even more so dangerous. I was just using that as an as a specific example. I know I know I'm just pulling your leg a little bit, but that's I did not mean to make light of another situation where you're right. I was going to ask you a real question. The question is, you know we understand there was a change in direction from the city about your interaction with the homeless people, and it's at that point at this point, it's very confusing to the population of what you can do and you can not do right and you know so. The first question is: can you steal pet patrol in streets where there are homeless? You know homeless, hotels or homeless sites? Yes, and do you continue to patrol and at what at what intensity? I'll explain to you, so every 9-, 1-, 1 and 3- 1- 1, call and complain I receive in the 13th precinct is addressed by my personnel. When I say addressed by my personnel, we are responding okay. So when we respond, what do we see? We see intravenous drug use? We see, no, I'm being I'm hypothetical crimes committed right in front of us guess what we're going to do we're going to arrest them? Okay, take the next scenario: there's an encampment. So now, if there's an encampment where in the past, we did take immediate enforcement, but what we'd do is we would reach out to Department of Homeland services we'd offer them services we'd. Do we would not we're in the past? We would take immediate enforcement. We would not. So in that situation we would not- and let's just say there are homeless people congregating on the corner. Unfortunately, it's not a crime to be homeless. So, once again we reach out. We try to get them help social services do we can, but unless there is well so to answer your question: we're responding to every 3-, 1- 1, every 9-, 1-, 1 and every complaint to homelessness and we're responding there, we're assessing it and based on the egregiousness of what we're seeing if it's a crime being committed, intravenous drug use, open alcohol container. Anything like that we're arresting summoning whatever action we have to take, but if it's a quality of life homeless, person living on the street, we're going to make every effort to reach out to social services, get them some help and try and see if we can help them that way. I hope that I sort of answered your question right. I guess that helps. I just have a follow- up question, which is your NCOS or your petrol people? Are they patrolling the streets and how often because I mean I think there has been in some streets and they are not euros by the way, but there has been a sense of the absence of officers in the street. Not visible. Are you talking about addressing homeless conditions? Huh? Are you talking in general or at? Is it the NCOS patrol their sector, followed by? What's called the steady sector? That's so the NCOS are sort of the outreach people they're, the ones that are contacting you they're, following up on crimes, they're working with the community, as well as the Detective bureau, and then we have steady sectors. So the steady sectors stay in that area following up on cases with the NCOS give them as well as answering 9-, 1-, 1 jobs and then backed up by them is the response orders. The response auto the order's just going around answering 9- 1- 1, calls and basically doing what your traditional patrol was. So to answer your question. We are out there if you're, seeing an area that you think is lacking and needs more attention. Of course you know I get it all the time. I think it's in your dad. I hate to bring this up. It does not help me but 23rd to 24th street on 6Th Avenue I mean you have the vendors over there. You have a homeless condition over there. I put the light towers up. I make sure that we do his directed patrols on the hour. So that's like a problematic area where they're not really committing crimes with this quality of life issues. So I'll, add my cop, my officer and personnel as much as I can. So if you see a problematic area, I do not know what precinct you live in, but you should definitely be reaching out to the NCOS, your commanding officer, and he could definitely you know, do some deployment in that area. I'm going to jump in here. I want to remind everyone that all the precincts have community council meetings and the officers at each precinct are available. The community affairs officer- and whoever else is there for that meeting, and so it's not only through this forum that you can ask questions of the NYPD inspector hellman. I've got one follow- up question on the mask issue that someone posted in the chat. Can civilians report mask violations of NYPD officers not wearing masks, and how would they do that? I believe they do it. I think we get it through 3- 1-, 1 yeah, three, what they've done three one? Okay, so there's? If you see someone an officer not wearing a mask, you can report it. If you want to I've got one more person who wants to ask a question of you and then we'll. Let you go is that okay, yeah, of course yeah Carrie Keenan Europe hi. Thank you so much for being here I'll make it very quick. I've been asked to ask what is the role of or mandate to the police in our community for ensuring the safety of the people who are exercising their right to vote on November 3rd, to make sure that the polls are safe, you're, saying yeah? Well, we're going to be, we are. We are in meetings and plans, we're going to really be beefing up the personnel at the polling sites. I think we're all going to be going. I mean it's still. I think every officer in New York City is going to 12-hour tours. So we have more coverage but we're in meetings constantly about that and we're going to make sure they're safe. I feel very confident. Is there anything specific? You can tell us just uniform presence and deal. You know right. You know and handling the process as we do every single day, they're actually protesting Union square park as we speak, so we have it down very well. I mean we went from. You know the Covid-19, then we went into the looting and the riots and then to the peaceful protest process, and we, I think we handled it better than any department in the country. Basically right now, you're seeing the rest are much less much less people getting hurt right now, where initially, when it was when it was off the hook, it was really problematic in June. If you do not, if you recall so, I think we're going to have a strong, uniform presence. I think we're ready and we're going to keep everybody safe and make sure everyone votes all right. Thank you very much for joining us. Deputy, Inspector, Stephen Hellman of the 13th precinct since we're doing a rotation he'll be back with us sometime in the next few months. Whenever you want and you and honestly you could just whenever you want, you can email me, I'm it's! When you go on, it's Steven.Helmet.Nypd.Org call me my phone's attached to me all the time, any anything I could do for the community. Thank you so much, sir bye, all right we're going to move to our public session now. Jeffrey are you here. I am here Mr Chair. Thank you all right, Jeffrey, Lefrancois, First, Vice, chair, we'll run the public session good evening. Thank you, everybody and thank you for the Intro Mr Chair we'll be doing as we always do. Our public session members of the public, who have signed up in advance or signed up online before 6:45 this evening, we'll have two minutes of time to speak on a topic of their choosing I'll, be timing it and giving a 15 second warning: I'm going to call three names at a time. So that way our board staff, the amazing team on board staff can pull folks over from the attendees into the panelists. We start this evening with Joseph Selman, followed by Ryan Brodsky and then Amy Todorov. I do not believe I see Joseph in the attendees section, but Ryan is here. So I'm going to add him now excellent hello. Can you hear me we can go right ahead, yeah, so I'm I'm here for Astros Dog run, which is a little tiny slice of land in between 39th and 40th street. Where you, you pick up the key from pay 30 and pick up the key from the Committee Board office, which is, I guess, non- existent now. The dog run has been closed for a month and a half or two months, and it's very hard to get information about it, how it's run? Who runs it? Well, I know who runs it he's never there and I'm wondering just what's going on with. It was closed for construction that never happened. I live at five, ten right next door, and so there was no never any construction and now there's a listing on the door that says it's closed indefinitely and to email, Tim Aussie, who is the president of of Astros Dog run, but there's no other information. The community board has not been able to give me information submitting to Tim does not give her information, and I was there. I've been a member for more than a year and was there three times a day for more than an hour at a time, especially during the pandemic, and I've never even met him. So I'm wondering: does the community pay for this spot? How is Tim the person that runs this dog park elected or chosen, and and how do we find out more or get the dog park back open? Thank you for all. That sounds like a relevant ask through which we would take it through our waterfront parks and Environment Committee Mr Botsky. If you would not mind following up with the board staff, we could go from there. Okay, how do I? How do I do that we can? We can follow up with you, ryan we've been interacting with you, janine and I have been specifically janine from my office- has been interacting with you, so we can follow up and get that online and we can obviously follow up with the port authority regarding any construction issues that that are outstanding. Excellent. Thank you so much. Thank you. Next Speaker Amy Todorov Jesse. Did we find this person hello? Can you hear me hi Amy go ahead, hi. Thank you for allowing me to speak today. There's an important vote coming up before the city council on October 15th, on open culture. It's no secret that New York City is facing an uncertain future, while managing potentially massive budget shortfalls and these bills offer a creative community- based solution for many of our biggest challenges, as we look ahead into 2021. so quickly. Those bills are a pair of bills. It's 2068 and 2034 that work in tandem to create a streamlined way for arts and cultural groups to activate outdoor public spaces in much the same way. Restaurants, access open streets and we'll create an interactive map that lets new Yorkers, see what is happening in their community. So we know outdoor activity is better for the health of new yorkers. During this Covid-19 crisis. We also know culture not only increases quality of life, but it can revitalize economies. Every dollar spent on small cultural events has a 24 higher rate of return than the average dollar spent and that money stays within the communities supporting small businesses. We hear an oft echoed concern that New York City streets no longer have the foot traffic that fuels economies and these bills solve that by getting people into their community in a safe way, still beholden to all the safety protocols, and we also hear from parents who need safe outdoor activities for their children. These bills offer alternatives to screen learning through outdoor readings classes, small scale, performances and these activities, unlike dining, do not require anyone to remove their mask so allowing artists, poets, visual artists, cultural teachers to activate public spaces creates an unofficial city workforce of caretakers for these public spaces as well. The bills require that the culture, the cultural groups, ensure the spaces are clean and well maintained after use. That's a partnership! That's a welcome relief for over burden city agencies, so we are asking for your support on these bills. Whatever you can do, write a letter reach out to your council member, which is Corey Johnson. Thank you again, thanks Amy next three speakers. Sorry, I can't control my alarm next. Three speakers Guy Jedwab, Nancy, Swala and Curtis swala hi. Can you help me hi guy go ahead? Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I'm also here to speak on behalf of those bills that Amy was just discussing those open culture bills, part of the need for being able to do. This is because there's a number of cultural institutions, things like small dance venues, theater venues they currently do not have the ability to operate at all and there's still many of them on the hook for rent every month. This community board covers the most dense area in terms of cultural institutions and venues, and so providing the ability for public performance in a safe and respectful way is going to really help some of these organizations survive. I also see that Senator Jackson is with us tonight, and I want to thank you for your support of the rent relief bills that are currently in Albany we'd love. We thank you for your support on that, because this this crisis has already closed. The number of cultural venues permanently and many more are struggling to survive. So we thank the Community Board for any support you can have for keeping these cultural spaces able to engage with the community. Thank you. Thank you very much. Apologies for my dog barking in the background nancy followed by Curtis. Do we have them Jesse? We have Nancy. Yes, I am here, I'm actually curtis had to leave. So I'm going to speak on behalf of the both of which is that's. Okay, thanks nancy, you have two minutes starting now. Thank you so much just a quick introduction, I'm from the guardian angels, the guardian angels, we're unarmed volunteer community patrols, comprised of women and men we're in 13 countries, 139 cities. We started in the Bronx in 1979 and we have patrols throughout all the boroughs and we want to reach out to obviously everyone in Chelsea, because the goal is to form partnerships with everyone in the area as we're doing the community patrols. So since the lockdown began, the group we've been asked to start patrols in Chinatown when people were being Asians were being attacked because of the coved and upper West side, where we reside because the increase in crime quality of life issues and now in Chelsea, we have several members who actually live in Chelsea and they asked they want us to reach out and start the group in Chelsea. So now we're starting a group in Chelsea and they were speaking of problems in the corridor along 8th Avenue between 20th and 22nd street, like relating to hard drugs being dealt people shooting up, arguing fighting. There have been a lot of complaints, obviously of like break- ins, attempted break- ins throughout Chelsea and packages being stolen things of that nature. So where our group is patrolling and again this is like just to give a you know an introduction insight to everyone who may not know, but where we're at it's like between 14th street and 30th and then 7Th Avenue and then to the West side highway. So you know we're in the area and obviously you know when people reach out. Sometimes they say. Oh, they want to sort of form. You know figure out. Oh, why are you here? What are you doing? The nature of the organization is individuals reach out, but obviously you know you want to give notice of your presence to people who are active in the area. So that's really the purpose of ten seconds. Okay and we meet at. We meet every Thursday 7:30 P.M and on saturdays at 1, Pm 14Th Street 8Th Avenue, but you know I wish you all well and keep safe everybody. Thank you, Nancy. Okay, thank you. So much, sir next up, Brian weber, followed by Jeffrey, Rowe and Alan Mark Brian, give me one second sure brian should be over hey. I think I've just crossed over. Can you hear me ryan all you two minutes starting now? Okay, thank you! Thank you Lol and Jeffrey. So my name is Brian Weber, I'm a resident of West 36Th, Street public member of Community Board four, and I am now the interim co- chair of the newly formed West 36Th Street Neighborhood Block Association, I'm here tonight on my behalf and behalf the Block Association to support item 12, which you'll be voting on later, which is a letter out of the HHHS committee addressing the hotel shelters in the West 30s. Simply, we need to reduce the number of the temporary shelters cited in the hotels on West, 36Th and 37th street by relocating at least one or more of the shelters immediately. I think this is the fourth Full board meeting I've been at speaking about this issue. There are too many shelters too many shelter providers all trying to operate in too close of proximity to one another. This is on top of West 36Th and 37th streets already existing social service providers such as Barber House and Fountain House, Needle, Exchange programs, methadone clinics and our neighborhood's already significant street homeless population in large part due to our proximity to pen and port authority. Earlier today, I read that the city will be extending its contract with the Hotel Owners Association of New York for another six months. At this point, it's hard for us to see past the next six days or six hours on West 36Th street. We can not continue like this. What we are experiencing is daily and relentless. There is so much more going on here on a constant basis that is not even reported or documented. We just can't keep up with it. We jump ahead. We are all legitimately fear for our safety and health. Every time we walk out the front door, we walk in the street in traffic to avoid conflict on our sidewalks, which, if you are familiar with West 36Th Street, is really challenging. Thank you Brian. I really need more than two minutes guys. As you noted, it's not your first time. Speaking on the topic, we're taking up the topic this evening as well in the form of a letter. So thank you for respecting the time limit, Brian Brian. If you want to reach out to me afterwards, if there's something that we're not aware of I'm happy to speak with you about it, okay, I'll forward my testimonial to you, thank you Lol. Thank you. Mr Rowe is not here. Alan Mark is the next speaker. Please hi. Can you hear me we can the floor. Is yours two minutes all right? Thank you. I live in the West 30s. I am here just to obtain support from everyone here, because life in the West 30s is unattainable. The number of homeless shelters here has been a such a safety issue for the children and the elderly, and everyone that lives here. Drug use has become rampant. My next- door, neighbor was just assaulted. Yesterday we're getting so little help from the mayoral office. The density of the shelters on West 36 is there's more shelter residents than there are actual residents. My real my reality, my realtor won't even sell my apartment. He does not want me as a client anymore because he said it's impossible to sell anything because the number shelter is here. I am asking all of you to please help us on West 36Th Street to decrease the density of shelters. We have so many will everyone here please commit to helping us decrease the density of the shelters on 36Th Street. Please thank you. Mr mark you're welcome next Speaker Randy Barksdale followed by will Schwartz. Can you hear me there are those people in the attendee list this Mr barksdale? Can you hear me you are here? Yes, sorry go ahead. Yes, I'm on West, 36Th Street for 22 years now and it's it's never been anything like this. We've had good times and bad times, but this is really crazy, because it's like running the I'm sorry I think we've lost you yeah. We lost them, I'm sorry about that hold on. So if we bring him back, we can yeah. Let me let me get him back in one second, and is our final speaker of the evening. Mr will Schwartz on the roster. Oh he's, not! Okay! Let me see if I can get our friend back I do want to. I know we had a 6:45 stop time. There is two people I want to acknowledge: one who had their hand up before that time and another as well Alexander my Telly and Lisa Wager, I'd like to add to the list. Randy. Are you with us? Yes, I'm here: okay, sorry about that, your name you're calling to a different name, and so that's what was confusing. Oh okay! No I'm just saying that you really can't do anything on this street and especially on the weekends. It's like ambulance after ambulance. You constantly hear people screaming Yo Kevin, Yo whoa. I mean it's like all the time, so it's very hard to even think, because I also work out of my apartment and it's just like non- stop day in and day out. Can we please do something about the density there's just too many people here, you do not feel safe, walking down the street. You have to walk through groups of guys that do not have masks on they're all smoking cigarettes or force or pot or drugs. You can see them exchanging drugs constantly with money. It's just it's just crazy out here and the public officials are not responding to 18 seconds. Just please help and please do what you can to help us on 36th Street. Thank you. Thank you very much. Alexander Vitelli did we bring that person over he's over great hi good evening? Everyone. Can you hear me? Yes, two minutes starting now, please. Thank you very much. I will be brief. I appreciate the opportunity to speak here tonight. I'm also a resident of 36th Street, and the speakers who have who have presented before me have really upset it all. This is just to just to echo that sentiment and to kind of really hit home the this situation that has just deteriorated so rapidly in such a small amount of time. My wife and I my wife, especially long- term, a long- time resident of New York City. We are new to the 36Th street area, but we are not new to the city. We've lived in different parts of the city, including other boroughs, and it has just been a rapid deterioration with absolute little to no response from the city, the NYPD more or less. I have seen them make arrests and I've seen that person walk out three hours later, because I live right near Midtown South. It is an unbelievable situation. Everyone here has said it. Brian weber, I know it has been, has been screaming at the top of his lungs. We really need as much help as we can get from as much of the community as we can possibly get to reduce the population of the homeless shelters. It is not it's because it is not just the residents of the shelters, it is the activity that just unfortunately follows that situation. I'm not going to sit here and say that this is that it's a homeless issue. This is more than that. It is a mental health issue. It is a drug issue and the city has absolutely closed, turned their back close to their eyes closed their ears are unwilling to help and it is having a such a dramatic. Second, it is having such a dramatic effect on on the residents and the quality of life in the area. I appreciate the time tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Next event, on Speaker Lisa, Wager, Lisa Okay great article in the Daily News Jeffrey Am. I starting two minutes is yours thanks, so I'm Lisa Wager director of government community relations at the Fashion Institute of Technology SUNY college on 27Th street, and this month I'm going to talk about achievement, glitz and pathways to higher Ed Fit Alum Genesis hides who graduated with the BFA in fine arts in 2016 began her term on October 1st, as one of four artists in residence at the studio Museum in Harlem this 11th month, residency awards each artist, a stipend of twenty thousand dollars and their work is exhibited at the museum during that time. Although this year it's going to be online at Studiomuseum.Org, Miss Harez's work, it reexamines her early childhood growing up in public housing in the Bronx in a traditional dominican household, it's beautiful, I hope, Jesse puts the link in the chat. She participated in Fit's educational opportunity program and won four years of honors for her high gpa. The Eop is a state- funded program that facilitates and supports access to higher ed for individuals from historically disadvantaged and underrepresented groups, providing expanded academic and personal support services, while they're in college and Fit Cop program is the highest ranked of any in the SUNY system. Glitz dressing, Queen, Bae Beyonce, the ultimate fashion icon, is a holy grail for designers and a sign of unparalleled validation. So, of course, on her recent movie, individual item, Album Black and Queen Bay wore many pieces designed by seven different, fit alumni and maybe Jessie's putting that link in the chat. Continuing Ed our center for continuing and professional studies is offering pre- college programs for high school and middle school students and also adult credit and non- credit courses and certificate programs in the creative workforce for the future business in the areas of creative workforce for the future, business and technology, art and design. Liberal arts and graduate studies exhibition and experience design, they're all taught by F T faculty everything's conducted remotely this fall semester, registration's still open. You can look at the website which I hope Jessie's putting in the chat if you're interested or you know, someone who might be. Thank you very much. Thank you Lisa Record time I think actually yeah. Well, I can't bagel you off to the side. Well, with that Mr Chair, I declared the public session closed. Okay, thank you, Jeffrey, and thank you to all our speakers. I want to just say very quickly in response to the people who spoke about 36Th Street, the letter number 12 tonight that we'll be taking up is either the second or third letter that we have sent on this issue and we recently joined a letter sent by Gail Brewer Senator Robert Jackson, an assembly member Dick Godfrey that was sent to the department of homeless services about this. So we are very well aware of your pain and we are working as diligently as we can to find some sort of resolution. This second announcement I want to make is addressed to the board members. Can we please stop using the chat function for side conversations? It's there for the sharing of information. Only can we cut off the side conversations please thank you from here we're going to go to the Repo. Our local elected officials, Senator Jackson, has been waiting since the beginning of the meeting, so Senator Robert Jackson, if you are still with us. Well I'm. Where is yours, I'm here for the entire meeting? So if anybody wants to go ahead of me, you're up first well, first, let me thank you for coming in on your meeting and obviously my staff and I we have met virtually by zoom with residents of 36th street and we had a scheduled appointment with the commanding officer of Midtown south last week, but it was you know we rescheduled and is scheduled for tomorrow, to meet with the commanding officer and discuss with him the issues and concerns in order to bring about the type of resolutions where the residents can feel that their safety and security is being considered. But right now, they're at in my opinion, based on everything that I heard tonight and the conversations that I've had with them, they're at which ends on the fact that the concentration of so many individuals that need a home, whether they're in the shelter or not, and the issues the concerns that they're dealing with the drug abuse. These you know can't really walk down the sidewalk to their home without being walking into smoke, clouds and or comments being made by to the women or the children of the residents there. Obviously, this is what they have expressed to me. I have not witnessed any of that stuff personally, because I have not been there, but I truly believe them and I've always said, even if it was in my neighborhood of Pm Washington heights. The safety and security of our residents is number one. If I can't feel safe in my home and my neighborhood we're in trouble, and so we I am going to meet with the commanding officer of the Midtown South tomorrow, and I will let the community board know what, if anything has come out of that so either Lowell or Jesse. I will be in contact with both of you about that, but there is to the concerns have been expressed to all of us on a continuous basis and what they're only hoping for is to have it's a type of environment where they can walk in the streets going to their home and also feel safe and secure. Thank you so, but let me get that to about 30 60.. So I wanted to say that on all the other issues, let me tell you what's happening. We met with Chuck Schumer. As far as on the zoom call two nights ago, when I say we broadway Manhattan dems and also I had a discussion with our majority leader about what's happening with the budget. What's happening with mayor borrowing, money from New, York City, what's happening with the possibility of early retirement incentives in order to reduce the head count without refilling them, and it seems, though, everyone both the governor and the state, is hoping and waiting and praying for the federal government to act. And all of you know that the Democrats put forward a reduction of the three billion dollar three trillion dollar package to 2.2 trillion dollars, which was you know, rejected by the Republicans and even trump tweeted that he wanted them both sides to come together and come up with a package. I hope he really meant that some people do not believe he really meant that. But I surely hope so, because the impact is devastating not only in New York City but around our country, and we know that so obviously we're hoping and waiting that the federal government would act. But you should know in the state legislature the budget director had he could have come down with a report of the budget was not in balance at end of April end of June and now December and nothing has been done and, as you know, all they had to do was tell us like. The budget is two and a half billion dollars in a hole, and here are the proposed cuts that are going to be made. We, the state legislature, has 10 days 10 days to either accept that or to reject it, and if we reject it, we have to then replace it with cuts. In essence, we have to determine where the cuts are going to take place and that's just a bloodbath. In my opinion that would occur. So everyone is waiting to see what happens at the Feds and obviously, if they fail to act as the Congress fails to act before the election day, and I do not believe they will. Then we are hoping and praying that the Biden Harris ticket wins in order to when he takes office and he will deal with it and hopefully he will. But the city of New York, obviously the mayor initially came in when we were up in Albany, going back with the seven billion dollar budget budgeting situation. That's now down to five and some people said to me: they went to a meeting with Liz Kruger and Liz Kruger said it's two billion dollars, and I said it may be two billion dollars for the first year, but the mayor's requesting five billion over three years and unfortunately many people do not believe the mayor as far as that he's telling the truth or they do not trust him or that he won't be there in the year or two years. When other situations are there. In essence, he will be out of office after December 31st 2001, along with almost the entire City Council, but Scott Stringer. As you know, who's running for mayor, but Scott Stringer, the state, the city controller, must agree on any borrowing that the mayor puts forward and, as you may know, Corey Johnson had indicated over a month ago that that a resolution will come forward from the city Council, basically approving or going along with the borrowing and the mayor. As you know, it basically said to the unions, who was supposed to have layoffs around October 4 that he's putting off on that with understanding that the money that we receive from borrowing would be able to forego the layoffs. So from a budgetary point of view at the state level. That's where we are waiting for the feds. No one wants to act first, and I can't blame them quite frankly, because it's devastation there will be thousands and thousands and thousands of layoffs not only in New York City, but around the state and in fact, rochester have already laid off teachers. Yonkers has already laid off teachers as a result of 20 percent of all education budgets have been put on hold and money that state legislatures have legislators, have allocated to Cbo's and other organizations, there's a hole on that so they're not even approving those everything's on hold. As far as funding for organizations that we've allocated money to so we're, that's the jam that we're in quite frankly, and as I said, the most important thing is: we have to have enough to sustain the people of our city and state. While we deal with this whole pandemic and the result of that- and so that's where we are, we ask everybody: please wear masks, please social destiny. Please wash your hands, do not stand too close to people, because if not, then we all who do not follow that it's going to make the situation worse, for not only our city but our state and our country. Thank you so much senator legislation you should all should have received my newsletter that came out no more than about three or four days ago, which has legislation that we passed legislation that we're hoping to deal with when we come back on housing, so forth and so on. Thank you so much senator. We appreciate your time. Yeah, I'm going to stay in the St with the state legislature. Now I'm going to go to Assembly member Richard Godfrey Well good evening good to be here with all of you. Let me talk quickly about a couple of things one you know Lowell mentioned earlier, the the situation with homeless in Chelsea and Hell's kitchen. You know in our community we have. We have welcomed an awful lot of programs for homeless people and people with a variety of needy conditions. What we always find is that what is needed is a strong program of services and and security and where we get that in place from the provider from the city, things tend to work out a whole lot better. I think I do not think we have seen that in the community from the homeless, in the hotels and the providers that are supposed to be on the job, and I think we need to make sure that the providers in the hotels and the city are providing the services and security that we need. One quick thing about the election and I'm not going to I'm going to try to avoid expressing partisan opinions, but you know we've all focused a lot on voting by absentee ballot and that's an important thing to do. But my message is that if you are at all able to vote in person whether it's through at an early voting site, where presumably the crowds will be a lot less and social distancing, will be a lot easier. If you can vote in person by early voting or on election day, that's enormously important, because the absentee ballots are going to get counted but they're not going to be showing up in the count until a week or two or more after election day, it's going to be very important to the security of our country and to the security of our of the election that the votes of Chelsea and Hell's kitchen show up on TV on election night in the national totals, because if the national total is not the right way, I think we will see massive disruption of the counting of ballots to follow so having a strong vote from Chelsea in Hell's kitchen. I won't talk about how you ought to vote. Having that show up in the national totals on election night is going to be really important. Last thing I want to talk about is taxes there's no way we're going to get enough help from Washington? I do not know if we'll get any help from Washington, no way that we're going to get enough to dig us out of the Coronavirus hole or to dig us out of the austerity budget hole that we've been digging deeper and deeper into even before the coronavirus evolved. In order to do that, New York needs to enact a strong package of increased taxes on ultra high wealth. I do not think anybody listening tonight is likely to be in the group that we're talking about taxing, but unless we increase the taxes on really ultra high wealth, we're not going to be able to fund health care and education and housing and transportation and a host of other needs, and I've been working with all of our local elected legislators and those from around the state to press the legislative leadership and the governor to do that. We've been fighting to get that done for months now. It's really got to happen. That's my message for tonight. Thank you. So much Dick I again want to thank Senator Jackson Assembly member God Freedom borrow President Brewer for joining that letter on 36th street that we joined. So, thank you all again. I'm going to stay with the state Assembly member Linda Rosenthal is here with us tonight. Linda, it's all yours, great hi. Everyone good to see you all before the events later on tonight. So I had carried a bill about the pink tax, which is the practice of charging pink products or products targeted for women more than the same products that are targeted at men, which has been a long- standing practice, and so it was included in the budget and now gender- based discrimination in products and services will no longer be allowed. So the pink razor should cost as much as the blue one and the dry cleaning should also cost the same amount, so it went into effect the other day. So I'm happy about that. I do not know if any of you saw the ruling on mechanical voids. Many of you know. Mechanical voids are those empty spaces that developers have begun, inserting in the middle and lower levels of buildings, so that they can increase the height, because mechanical spaces are not counted toward the total. Far a judge named Arthur and Goran, who maybe many of you know, ruled in beautiful language that this is done so simply to circumvent the zoning laws and he said it was illegal and he also said gave made them all right. I thought I froze, but it appears that assembly member Rosenthal froze. Am I right about that? Can everyone else hear me she's in one of the voids yeah, I think Linda just got lost in one of the building voids yeah. It's on her side of things I can't get. I can't get her back yeah all right. Well, then, let's move on and I can we can come back. We can circle back to Linda. I want to go to the Manhattan borough. President Gail Brewer. Next, you know Linda comes back. She should just continue, but I want. I also want to just say on this letter. I understand that we wrote the letter. Thank you for everybody who signed on including Community Board. Four and I understand. Commissioner, banks has said that he is going to set up a time with DHS to discuss all these issues, but, let's make sure it happens soon. I will stay on it and I want to thank Peter Johnson's office because I know we've been working with the skyline, also etc. So the whole issue of homeless NYCHA working group to the credit of the city every Tuesday night before pandemic, we met at usually at the one of the fulton or Chelsea elliot to discuss what is going to happen with those buildings in terms of rat. So those means are continuing. Now they will be virtual, but it is helpful for me because it sets the tone hopefully for other rads and we have many of them in the borough Manhattan. You probably know that there are some no new commanding officer, so I went to the I think the 10th and the 13th and the 17th were the only precincts last Tuesday last night, where there was outdoor activity now activity was quite limited, except for the 10th, and I want to thank both Chelsea elliott and fulton because they had members residents and pd there to talk about issues of concern. So the 10th precinct is always wonderful and the new commanding officer gold is fantastic. You should know that regarding the Hudson river park you got ta go see Pier 26.. It is phenomenal, it's quite a story that goes with it. It's brand new, but we have an appointment. As you know, three total I had put my friend Douglas Durst, but he decided to resign representing board four because he's one of yours and I'm really honored- that Lowell Kern has agreed to be the Hudson River Park Trust representative from the CUNY board for area. So thank you very much lauren. I know you'll be a great addition, and you should know that when I went to the opening of the pier they're all very excited that you're going to be the representative, because they know you care about the park and you care about the community and that's can't get a higher recommendation than that even from people who are complaining about everything. They're very excited, we're always focused, as you know, on the 8Th Avenue Link stations. It's a very long story, but much thanks to you and Brian Lewis from our office. We've been meeting with do it and they are willing to talk to us about some of the challenges of putting in or disabling the particular stations that are problematic for all the reasons that you know. So I just want to say thank you and it's ongoing. We also, you know we put out a list of all the places that are public to go to the bathroom. There are a hundred public restrooms in the bar Manhattan, I'm not saying they're all in great shape, but I will say that this is not just a problem for those who are homeless. It's a problem for just everyday new Yorkers and it's a problem because almost every bathroom, understandably of what was available is now closed due to the virus. So it's you may not. I have many of you know individuals who brought this to my attention and it is a huge issue. They've talked about the elections. I just want to say about the census. We know we have more time. What we've been doing in board for is two things. One is, I think I might have mentioned. We still have that 35 000 person listing from the June primary of those who moved out temporarily and we mailed to them with illegal women. Voters there's some good news. People have been calling from Connecticut Long Island Upstate. Am I supposed to fill it out again? Yes, you are. We took out ads in Connecticut, Upstate and long island, big huge ads, saying the same thing fill out with your Manhattan address. At the same time, working with 32bj and redmi we've been working with probably 150 large buildings for some reason they did not get focused on even though enumerators went they could not get in. We can't do the self- reporting, because people are not there or they did not do it. They can't get in, but I can tell you: the management is being very helpful. They can at least tell us that in apartment 62, for instance, there are five people who live there. You can't do the self- reporting, which is a really best number, but at least this you know eight percent, which is what's at stake with these larger buildings, will be able to tell us something about the demographics, and that is what we're doing with those large buildings. The school is ongoing. The biggest problem somewhat in district 2, but definitely in the other districts, is the issue of devices in some districts. It's 600, it's 500, kids, who just do not have a device, and you know I do not want to get into all the specifics, we're putting it. In a letter we've been in touch, we have money from 2020 that was in our budget that we just got permission to spend. Do not get me started on that topic, but it's going to take eight weeks. So if I'm a principal- and I say I need 200 devices, it's going to take eight weeks, so that's almost the entire semester given where we're. At the same time, the city says we have the devices. Where are the devices so ongoing? Also we're always pushing, as you can imagine, about social workers, but the first day of school. We had hundreds and hundreds of volunteers. We covered almost all the schools in Manhattan, giving out packets nicely put together by wonderful interns with sanitizer masks and the core census information. What a challenging time. I also want to thank a community board for, because with the speaker's office and with the board, you've been doing cleanup cleanups and it really makes a difference. I think, if there's a silver lining and there is not for the pandemic- and it's not good- that the sanitation department got a 65 cut for weekday service and, of course, a weekend cut of 100 or maybe a little bit less with some restoration, but the volunteerism from one part of the borough to the other has been phenomenal. I know that the jail is not in your area, but it is of interest, I think, to everybody. If we end up with a jail there's a lawsuit, we may not end up with a jail where the detention center is now in 3D Board one. But just so you know, according to the lawsuit that community folks want to stop it. We as a community can not put a shovel in the ground, but ongoing can be discussions with stakeholders and then and on the next one is October 14th at 6:30, it's all virtual and if you're interested, let us know I'm also just. Finally, I'm a big supporter of the shed it's you know it's controversial. Everything in Hudson yards is controversial, but I do think they have a really good focus on diversity in art and so on and so forth. So they're opening on the 16th of October and it's free for at least first few days, and if you have time to reserve, you might find it really fabulous. The border president's office has been working with the city Commission on human rights, in anti- bias, trainings on all different topics and we're going to set up a whole bunch more during the month of November. You know the deputy brokers and aldebar is leaving to go to a foundation. He will be a great asset there, but we will certainly miss him, and I know you will also thank you community board for congratulations on everything that you're doing. Thank you, boro President, Brewer, Linda Rosenthal seems to have solved her computer problems and rejoined us so Linda will. Let you finish up all right. You know I'm really such a tech expert. I just logged out and logged back in. That's always the first answer anyway. So I was talking about the mechanical voids, I'm not sure where I froze, but those are spaces within buildings in the mid and lower parts of buildings that developers have been leaving mostly empty. They put the you know the HVAC and other mechanicals in there, but then most of it goes empty, but what it does is increases the height, because those spaces are not counted toward the far and so Justice Arthur and Goran ruled that was illegal and he also stopped the he put a stop on the construction, Senator Jackson and I have the bill that would outlaw these kinds of tricks because every developer has to out tall the next one. So it's all circumvents zoning and what's the point of zoning, if developers are going to find a way around it, so we're working on that for next session and I think there's when developers go back to building they'll be back to their same old tricks and it's not the right way to go. I know you guys have been talking about the Dewitt dog run. We spoke to parks about it, and I know that the CB4 Waterfront Clarkson Environmental Committee, is writing a letter. We wrote a letter as well supporting your letter and the efforts of the of Jenny Lee. If you have a dog around, it might as well be used. Otherwise, what's the point so hopefully they will find the funding to fix the parts and I've offered to help out with that this weekend I was helped clean, West 51st street. It's a gross job, so hats off to the sanitation, men and women. But you know I guess these times call for a thousand points of light, but I do think that some sanitation money needs to be put back because it's not just unsightly it's. It attracts the vermin and it's just generally a bad idea. I'm having a flu shot day on October 20th for those of you who need flu shots or they're, not the senior high dose. Those are in short supply. But if you are anyone you know of who needs a flu shot, they should email or call my office. It's October 20th from 10 to 3, at Lincoln, Square Neighborhood center at 65Th, Street and it'll, be all done outdoors under tents with Mount Sinai and goddard Riverside, Lincoln Square Neighborhood center. And the last item is the aforementioned vermin, we're having a rat academy on November 17th with various block associations, etc. So if you're interested also call my office- and that's it thanks for having me, thank you so much for joining us, I I'm going to go next to Congressman Nadler, but I want to just I just have to say this, because it's getting a little ridiculous. I've gotten six texts in the last 10 minutes, reminding me there's a debate tonight that some people may want to watch. So I'm going to ask everyone who speaks whether it's the rest of the electeds or Jesse when he does the district manager's report or any of the other board business we do if we can keep this as tight as possible, because evidently there's a lot of people who want to watch TV tonight. So with that congressman Nadler, I'm sure you've got something to say about the debate. Yes, indeed, I'm happy to be with you all this evening, the night of the debate- and I want to start by saying hope- everyone is continuing to remain safe and healthy and taking precautions to keep themselves. That way. As you may know, the house last week passed an updated heroes act which was a modified bill from the legislation we passed back in may. The legislation once again provides economic relief for american families by providing stimulus, checks, restoring and expanding the weekly 600 federal unemployment payments through next January bolstering housing assistance through direct rent relief, increasing food stamp benefits by 15 percent. It supports small businesses by improving the paycheck protection program, providing the hardest hit small businesses, nonprofits and entrepreneurs with second loans provides state and local governments. The funding they need to help whether this crisis, New York state itself, will receive 21 billion dollars in New York City about nine billion dollars. It provides essential support for transit infrastructure, contains substantial assistance for the MTA which will allow the MTA to continue operations into next year. It fully funds the postal service and provides states with new resources to safeguard the integrity and security of our elections and ensuring the integrity of the 2020 census. I'm very proud that this package contains two pieces of legislation that I sponsored the restaurants Act and the save our stages act. New York City will provide to New York City Additional, targeted assistance for independent restaurants and live entertainment, venues and theaters, many of which have been devastated by the economic impacts of the pandemic. We will keep fighting to ensure that Americans and our institutions get the relief and resources they need during this trying time. I'm also pleased to announce that the House Judiciary Committee's anti- trust subcommittee released the findings of its more than 16 month long investigation into a state of competition in the digital economy, especially amongst dominating companies like apple Amazon, Google and facebook. Our investigation demonstrates the need for Congress to take action in restoring competition, preventing these companies from further exploiting their power. It shows the necessity of amending the anti- trust laws in order to regulate monopoly and have effective antitrust. I do not want to take up too much more of your time, so I'll leave it there and please do not hesitate to reach out to my staff if we can be of any assistance. Thank you so much congressman Nadler. I think that's the last of the electeds who were here I'm going to go next to Carl. Wilson from Speaker Corey Johnson's office. Thank you lol, good evening. Everybody. Let's just get right to it. A large bulk of our time in CB4 this past month has been meeting with several of the shelter providers that are in our district. We've been working very closely with our partners in government, which include the other local elected officials in CB4, and we had a series of meetings we shall, with the shelter providers and DHS for the ones in our district. We recently met with 36th Street to just operate on 36th Street, to discuss their operations and some of the complaints we've seen. We understand that each of the shelters there are adding two full- time: security members who focus exclusively on the outside of the shelter, and we expect them to start soon before the end of the month. One of the problems we also identified there was the lack of programming space that is inside the small budget hotels. So we've been in touch with Metro Baptist church to find some programming space for both Nika and Bbsj. Who are the providers there? It's looking promising and we were scheduled to walk through for next week. We've also been in touch with some of the general contractors about scaffolding. Work work on those our neighboring buildings that have a lot of scaffolding erected specifically at 315 and 327. Both contractors told us that they are nearing the completion of that work and expect to have it down by the end of the month, and we've offered assistance with DOB and clearing any of their final sign- off hurdles and then, finally, on 36th street, we have also instructed ace, which is a supplemental cleaning service, that we provide funding for to service. That block four days a week which they do from 8 am to 4 pm. The skyline hotel is another spot. That's had some problems up in Hell's kitchen, we've had a series of meetings with their director in DHS with each of the school principals, as well as some of the local business owners to establish some clear lines of communication. They have a large interior space which they have begun using and we've been helping to identify some volunteers that want to help assist with some of that programming and there's also recently, a station security guard out front five days a week and they're looking to fill a slot for an additional to bring somebody on to cover the additional two we've heard. Some things are improving there from constituents in the area and the local Block Association that I attended last night. But you know it's one of those things we have to remain vigilant about and we want to stay in touch with everyone on this issue and then, finally, a site on 45th street. We met with residents in the Block Association and we were able to help set up some additional security patrols and sanitation services there, and that was. We were not really running into any problems from that Block Association either. As Gail mentioned in September, we had a community cleanup day in partnership with our block associations in Community board, 4 and Acrosss District three, and also, if you've been down 9th avenue. Recently, you may have noticed some of our new trash cans. We purchased several new new silver cans to replace the wire baskets on each corner along 9th Avenue between 42nd and 57th street, and that is really it for me on some of the main points from the past month, thanks so much Carl Luke Wolf from Controller Scott Stringer's office. Last but not least, hi everyone, Luke Wolf from City Controller Stream's office. I'll. Try to keep my remarks brief as well just want to touch upon once in the work, we're doing a small business and then also some of our back to school efforts on small businesses. We know businesses are struggling right now. One estimate that one out of every three might be gone after the pandemic, which is why we launched our save main street initiative to help New York City small businesses. It says three parts as 25 total points of the plan, but I'll just run some of the main ones. The first point is about struggling businesses right now, so for that we want to provide tax credits for independent businesses to help cover the cost of reopening. The idea is to create a New York, City Tech Corps, to help small businesses, adopt digital tools and develop an online presence. Another idea is providing legal assistance to businesses that are right now involved in rent disputes. The second plank is about supporting new businesses and entrepreneurship, so creating a single point of contact if you want to launch a new business and waiting some of those initial business fees over the next 10 months. Similarly, we want to create a re- entrepreneurship program. So if you are a business owner who wants to get rid of your business have a marketplace where a new entrepreneur would be able to take that over so we're recycling, the business and it stays in the neighborhood. The third plank is about building stronger neighborhoods support those businesses so continuing to think about how we can repurpose our street space. So it's the best for community and businesses and think about that moving forward, and also how can we make sure that if there are vacant spaces, do not let them stay vacant? So you have an entire vibrant streets, get for the community, so I'll drop that plan in the chat and feel free to look through all 25 points whenever you have some time back to schools also top of mind right now, so some of our work around that, as we put together back to school guide, which I will share it's available in chinese English and spanish, and has a lot of great information for parents and school communities as part of the back to school work that we know it's been so challenging for so many people. We also called in the city to make public schools more inclusive for non- binary and gender non- conforming students. So right now they do not. The option is self- identified as they would like on the city's online platforms, so we think they should be able to express themselves through the city's online platforms in that way, just to kind of end. On a positive note, we were able to return over two million dollars in stolen prevailing wages over the course of the pandemic. Two workers acrosss the city. We know that every dollar counts, especially now, so we'll continue to do that work, but we're really proud of our efforts to donate, to get back the 2 million so far and make sure that ends up in families, pockets, acrosss, the city so much luke. Next up on the agenda, I'm going to go to our district manager, Jesse Beaudeen, who tells me he has a 30-page powerpoint to go through right now, move to veto. Second I'll, be very quick everybody, so just starting off with I just wanted to highlight one of the email blasts that we've been doing on sort of on a on a recent regular basis, which is sort of a kind of a complete kind of robust email about homeless services and what's happening out in the district, specifically about street homeless. Something that I have asked and gotten in the past on a regular basis from the homeless. Outreach is a monthly report, and so, with the help of the speaker's office, who have been holding more meetings twice a month, we've been getting these reports twice a month, and so we've been sending those out along with a tool kit and an additional fly. You know flyers of information, and I just want to highlight that, because it really does give a great report back to the community what the outreach programs are doing, how many times they're interacting with people the hot spots that they know of the encampments. They clean up the folks, the number of folks that they house and get off the street, and so I think it's a really good understanding of what's going out going on every day and all of the hard work. It also provides flyers for the public to be able to provide folks out on the street. You know flyers to health clinics and things like that, all sorts of stuff, also the speaker's donations, is running a donation drive, so things like that for folks from the community to help and feel that they can engage and do something helpful and useful. We also include our toolkit, which we've always had on our website, which lists the services in our area and what you can do to help and to provide assistance. So I just want to highlight that. I also then just wanted to remind everybody that they really need. Oh, this is specifically just for full board members. You really need to fill out your voting sheets at the end of the night and at the you have to really do it immediately after your your roll call vote, we've been running into issues lately in which we do not. We have to chase folks down for their vote sheets. People want to correct them afterwards or something like that, and that's just not allowed it's just like if we were holding our in- person meeting and now I'm screaming at the end of the meeting to hand in your vote sheets, so you really have to do get it in. You have to have to get it in tonight as the meeting goes and then I do want to end on a positive note, with due to the generosity of brookfield properties and a great assistance from CB4 member Josephine Ishman, the CB4 district office was able to help deliver five thousand dollars to the ptas of Ps33 and Ps51 for their reopening needs, and so that was a good. You know is really helpful. Principals have got a lot on their shoulders to try to figure out, and some of these and some of the schools do not, as some schools have very well- endowed ptas and some do not so this is a real help and josephine was very helpful in help getting that the money to the right people and things like that. That's really it, I will just say so. Monday the office is closed due to October 12th and therefore the ACES committee has been pushed to actually reschedule to Tuesday October 20th budget task force will be meeting on Thursday, October 22nd and for now right now the CB4 Nominating committee is tentatively scheduled for Monday October 26th, while other committees meet at their regular time. Thank you, Jesse speaking of the Nominating committee, Paul Devlin is going to give us a report from said Committee Great Jesse. Do you mind sharing screen for my powerpoint presentation? If that's possible, just kidding, everybody is broken. Somehow this is the month that we bring in all our suggestions. As Jesse pointed out, we'll have our nominating committee meeting later in the month to do interviews at the November meeting, we'll report out all the nominations. December is when we'll vote on the officers. As of this point, all the sitting officers have all agreed to run for re- election. We may have some other candidates for some of the seats, which would be. You know a little bit more fun to have an election that people actually have to vote in, but we'll have a full report at our November meeting for our December vote. Thank you remember to vote. Thank you. Paul, I'm going to go to Jessica Chait Next. She is our second vice chair and the chair of the budget task force and she wants to talk about the budget task force or whether she wants to or not. I want her to so thank you lol as we shared at the last meeting where in this process right now, where we really gather feedback not only from our committees but also really from the community, about what our priorities should be in terms of advocating for the budget keep in mind. This is next year's. This is 2022 budget. So I encourage everyone to show up to their committees in these next this next few weeks and to really go through that process. Look at what we put together previously, as well as think of new topics that may be have come to light as a result of Covid-19 and what it is brought to our city and then some in addition to that, we've also created a very brief survey. It's super easy. We've already had 120 requests, which is or excuse me about, respondents which I think is great, but I really want to encourage all of you here to circulate that and really, let's try to use this opportunity to get as much feedback from the community so that we can put together a request that really reflects the unique needs of our district and I'm assuming we can drop the link in the chat if you did not see the email yeah now Jessica and it's also on our website on our home page, great and I'll just say one other thing which is we'd like respondents responses. Excuse me by the 16th, but since you're all here right now, it's super fast. You can do it or send it out to people to do it as soon as possible. Thank you Jessica for the rest of the chairs report. We continue to meet with DHS and others regarding the 36th street situation, which I'm sure comes as no surprise to anyone. We I've attended God this Carl referenced. The speaker's office calls regarding skyline hotel we've continued to it. We've attended those meetings. We have continued to attend the bi-, weekly, cbl meetings about harm reduction and the street homeless, Initiative to try and deal with that issue, which has been exacerbated by Covid-19. The NYCHA working group has continued to has restarted meeting and continues to meet, and otherwise it's been business as usual. Trying to get things done around here. The one thing I need to point out personally, as the borough president mentioned, she appointed me to serve on the board of directors of the Hudson River park, trust to be the CB4 Rep to the board of directors of the trust, which means that anything coming up before this board about the Hudson river park trusts going forward. I will have to recuse myself and we'll figure out how to do that. Since Jeffrey is the chair of the committee, I'm not sure he's going to take over that or whether Jessica will, but I will be recusing myself from any hrpt matters going forward and I think that's hang on. I got I got a note here. I think it would be good to mention that Midtown north was kind enough to notify us of a recent street closure. Yes, in response to what we've talked about, thank you Dale and there was sensitivity to street closures, Midtown north closed 54th street for a day or so, and then notified us again when they reopened it. So they've heard our request to keep us in the loop on that. So thank you to Midtown north and with that I think we are done with the chairs report, so we're going to move on to the business session and I'm going to start with the business licensing and permits Committee so Frank and Bert take it away. Hi everyone. Can you hear me, I'm not sure. What's going on with my zooms yeah? Yes, we can hear your bird okay, so we have four items to vote on, plus a fifth for ratification from exec I'd like to bundle them all. Okay, there any questions or any of the BLP items motion to adopt. Well we're going to we're going to do it in one single vote. I think, like we've been doing so as long as there are no questions we'll move on hearing, none we'll go to the Waterfront parks and Environment Jeffrey Martin. One question: yes, Leslie go ahead on the item which is boxers. Can that be pulled out separately? Well, if you want what we've been doing, if you want to vote against that letter for whatever reason, assuming that's the case, when we get to you on the roll call, you can say no on four and you know and yes, on the rest, we did not get any comments from the public on that. So I do not think we need to have a separate roll call on. That was exactly my thinking level that, since if there had been public comments on boxers or any of the other items, I would have pulled it out, but since there was no one here to speak, I said: okay, let's bundle. Yep Les you'll still have your ability to vote against the letter. If that's what you're intending to do, but I do not think we need a separate roll call on it. Great thank Jeffrey. You marty, WPA two letters. I think fairly straightforward marty. I'm not sure if you're here intend to bundle them. Unless there's are there any questions on items? Six and seven, the cruise ship terminal and the d with Clinton dog run. There have been some edits on the cruise ship terminal, but they are not significant, but it's a better letter from the input that we've had says the same thing: hearing no questions, we'll move on to transportation christine and Dale. Yes, I'd like to bundle these three items. Are there any questions on items? Eight, nine or ten? There is a small change in the letter. Nine, but it's not you know it does not change the it's. A small style change. You just have one question: go ahead: Bert on item 10, the concluding sentence, and it sounds really good. A fiscal crisis presents opportunity to allocate resources from department, transportation and sanitation for greater public. Good sounds really lovely. Do you have any specifics behind that? Or is this just like an exploration? Well, we did not. We have specifics, but we did not want to advance the specifics until we had much more discussion in the Communi in the transportation committee, so we left it pretty open in general. Will you be coming back then in the future, with some more specific? Yes, okay, thanks christine okay. So no further questions on the transportation matters Jesse. What did you just ask me right? Okay, the NYPD pedestrian access letter, we've gotten a request christine that it be addressed to all of the commanding officers of the various precincts since they're all new, okay and copy to commissioner Shea, then well, the request was to include them. So maybe you address it to them and see c shay. Okay, we can do that in the past. It has not been successful at all, but they were all new, so maybe it's worth a shot. At least that was the request. If you're, okay, with that okay, we can do that. Okay, thank you. No other questions, Chelsea land use, Paul and Betty. I'm going to take this one. We have a letter, one letter on a historic building on West 23Rd Street. They had previously asked for Fibrex they're now asking for all wood they'd previously asked for arched wind not to they previously asked for squared windows. We had asked them to do. Arched windows, LPC agreed with us last year, so we just restated our position that we want all wood and an arch top window. So that's pretty straightforward and clear any questions. Hearing none we'll move on to the housing, Health Human Services Committee. This is the letter on the Alto hotel, shelters in the West, 30S Maria and Joe, so I'll, just sort of set the stage that Maria will take over the letter and I'll take the questions. At the end, we have put together a very comprehensive letter about all the shelters and the issues of the very poor management by the administration of dumping, the shelters without proper thought. We really laid out the context of our community, the facilities we have for homeless and supportive housing and ask in essence that there be a sit down and a plan developed to basically correct a bad decision to have so many people with so many social service issues located in one area, and it is, we have gotten a lot of response back from committee members. A lot of changes happen to the letter a lot of tweaking. So that's pretty much about it. I turned over to Maria. So exactly what Joe said. Thank you Joe. I too was reminded about the debates this evening, so I have some notes and I'm going to even make I'm going to make them just a little shorter. If anyone has not read the letter, did you say something we're not pressed or not, as pressed for time as I thought we were going to be so make sure you can make your points, because this is an important letter. Yeah. Thank you, okay, so it is an important letter and I was going to suggest if you have not read the letter, I would urge you to re take some time to read the letter. Even if you just go over it briefly. The letter itself is 11 pages and that's excluding the attachments and basically I'll just give you a quick rundown of the letter. We open the letter that, as a result of the density on 36th and 37th below 42Nd street, is now public safety crisis. Although basically you know, we all know because of Covid-19 emergency relocations from congregate, kinds of settings into hotels was necessary, but on 36th and 37th street there are 812 beds and basically we're saying that it was a poor polity. This policy decision and we're requesting four things: reducing the density on 36 we're asking DHS to hold the nonprofit providers accountable. Number three is dedicated street outreach. Number four: is coordination between DHS street outreach and NYPD public safety enforcement? We talk a little bit about the background of CB4 in terms of the number of homeless, shelters and other facilities that house people who are temporarily housed people. We have a table, so that's a table in itself in the ladder, as well as the number of supportive housing we have in the community. That's in a table in the letter and in the letter as well, is a table of the reduction density sites. Dhs calls them reduction density sites and the numbers all together of all the beds, is over a little bit over 4 000 in CB4, and much of that is in Hell's kitchen further in the letter we have we talk about, we have a table for the number of attendees at the committee meeting that we had from June through to September those two months alone, it more than doubled. So that tells you that's significant. We also discuss in the letter the we give examples of what residents on 36th street permanent residents on 36th street say they have experienced. We highlight that this is not NIMBY- ism. This is a common sense request for a reduction, and I want to make that really clear for everyone that it's not NIMBY- ism, we're asking for common sense requests. Okay, and I want to also highlight right here- and I do not know if we highlight in the letter if we did not joe, we need to also put in the letter that some of our electeds Gail Dick, Gottfried and Robert Jackson also wrote a letter specifically about 36th street, that what else is significant for you to know in the letter, even with the moves from out of the district, and I mean we had two congregate kinds of care settings in the district and the wj being relocated still on 36th and 37th street, we have over 40 percent of the density right there and on 36th street alone is 518 beds. I think that's worth knowing so basically we're saying in our letter. This is beyond a quality of life issue. This is a public safety issue. We try to also highlight the very real likelihood that, as a result of this poor planning decision that there may be resistance to future potential social service programs in the community, we have an Appendix a b and C and we're going to be attaching an Appendix c. It's going to be a map of all the locations in the district Appendix. A is just the questions by the committee and the Public Appendix B is the main comments by each public member who spoke, and I need to fix that and we're attaching our letters from June and August, which were about this issue specifically about the density that was on 51st street and all three letters are including 36th Street. The other thing I just want to add is thank you to everyone who provided feedback so far and yeah. That's it Maria. I would suggest adding Gail's letter an attachment as well, okay, which one you signed. I just want to jump in here, because I've been working with Maria and Joe on this on the NIMBY point, because that seems to be a concern of a lot of people just for perspective. I think you're all probably aware of the brouhaha that erupted on the upper West side, that was about three hotels in a ten block radius. There is chaos going down on now in CB1 about a single hotel, that's being moved, we're talking about three hotels in a one square block area on 36Th Street, and we have offered repeatedly to work with DHS to relocate this hotel within our district. We are not looking to ship this out and say we do not want to deal with the homeless. We are more than happy to work with DHS to do that. It's just it's too much for this block in this neighborhood and that's what the letter emphasizes. If anyone has any questions, Joe will answer them. Any questions christine. I saw your hand first. No, I just had a comment. It's a fantastic letter and a lot of work there and so on, but I would recom recommend if we could move up the ask to the first, the very first christine already anticipated it, and I was about to offer that. Thank you, and then I mentioned that to Mariah. Is that even though we all know it's not NIMBY and we know the history, I would also put some sentence about that at the beginning, because if people do not read the less the rest of the letter, you know I'm sure you put it there, but some people are going to read. You know the first two paragraph and that's it so I would just put it there. That's a friendly suggestion. Excuse me, I have a question actually about the letter, I'm wondering if we should be adding into the letter, because I do not think we put in the letter the efforts that we have been making in terms of having meetings almost weekly and even meetings that I'm not participating in that are occurring around this issue. I think that's a great idea. I mean in some way. Yes, we actually have it there. We have not gotten the numbers from Jesse yet about that right, but I mean saying that the NIMBY thing should be really way up there in one or two sentences, and then you go into the rest of it all right. Thank you, christine Josephine. Just on a point that actually you made Lol is that actually in the letter that we're sort of recommend not really recommending, but if there's an option to have them move somewhere else and see before that, this committee is open to that. Is that actually, in this letter that's been in our last two letters, we should probably reference it. It's in our last two letters, though so I'll note that Josephine okay, my only concern about relocating in general, is just the domino effect that it causes and, as we already know what happened with the skyline right, I still can't trace these families at so many kids that were going to our schools. So you know my concern is what I do not want to see is that you know one of the budget. Hotels is located to it and then pushes out a family hotel, or something like that like I just do not want to see that happen. We won't let that happen. That's not the intention already yeah they're, well aware of what we're thinking for the board's information and Jesse's tracking this down. We are either number three or number four. In community boards, out of 59 with social service facilities for the homeless in the city, so that is a pretty good record right. There, Twig Maria had just said in passing that she was going to fix Appendix B, so I was just wondering how that was going to be fixed or changed. Thank you Thuy for asking. So actually I had to listen through the entire. The meetings are recorded, so on Youtube I go back to youtube and there's also closed captioning. So that helps. But I listen through the meeting all over again. That's what I actually did and also I do remember I should point out yes joe. It actually is in a letter about the meetings that we were doing. Almost weekly. Okay, Mike Noble Christine already covered my questions, but I just want to say this is probably one of the finest letters I've seen in all the years, so I think they did a great job. Maria Murray is smiling. She says. Thank you, katie stokes, you know yeah. I think it is an awesome letter. I just had a couple quick well, two quick sentences I wanted to mention. Maybe could be improved and then I also really want to reiterate Lowell what you said and what Josephine said. I think it's really important to put in the letter that that we have we're not like the other places we're offering to let them move it into. You know somewhere else in our district. Okay, should I give you my little two sentence, things right now or yeah. If katie, if they're, like minor, like wording, we could probably just deal with it over emails, faster, perfect I'll. Do that? Thank you, Katie Sabrina, an overall or a comment is there, and this has to do with my work experience and working with shelters. I wonder if, as a community, is there any way that we can hold accountable? The shelters in this case are covered shelters that they have social services. I think one of the biggest problems is that they say that they have it, but they really do not well they're, not really doing what they're supposed to do. So I just I'm curious. Just you know an accountability. I know the attest is the is the agency that is in charge of them, but who is supervising them? Who is there any way that we can find? Okay? Well? Where is a record that these people are being you know, sent to see mental health or all the all the requirements that they need to have, and I wonder, are contracted our contractors of DHS, whether they're for- profit or not- for- profit and they have voluminous reporting requirements. The problem we're having is they have also said informally in meetings we've had with DHS that the physical buildings are not set up to do the kind of work they would normally do in the congregate shelters. So that's why I was mentioned earlier. Well, I found a really hard time to think about that right because well, maybe they can not do it in the building, but they can outsource it. No, they actually have the staff that do this work, but they do not have the counseling rooms, the recreation rooms, the activity rooms, but they can not source it. They have not been. We think for a moment that this has been planned. There has been no planning here more than six months. Yeah, that's the point of our letter. Therein lies the frustration right there. It should not take six months for the council member staff to go to Metro Baptist church to say: could you find some rooms for counseling indoor activities and or the various things you need to do? This is not planned and the root of it is DHS is just not taking it as a serious matter as long as they can have people separate it and they're safe. That's it and the consequence is, you have all of the street issues and the decompensating and the stuff that happens when people are not engaged with mental health and physical health. That's what's happening around us, we're watching a system breakdown and it's happening in our neighborhood. We can talk Offline and tell you a little bit about my experience, because I really this is exactly what I do. I connect folks with services with my most of it for mental illness, and I know what the problem is, but yeah as we've said multiple times. The answer we get from DHS is that Covid-19 is a crisis, and this is an emergency situation and they've used that as an excuse to not do the kind of things you're asking about Sabrina, but it should not be an excuse. Well, it should not be good. They they've lectured us and let us know we're in a pandemic as if all of us would not be aware or in a pandemic. This has struck me over and over as craziness any other questions yeah rocks just next hey. I had a quick question about who this letter is addressed to so mayor, DHS and electeds make sense to me, but I was wondering what the purpose of addressing the police commissioner and NYPD was. Is there a specific ask in this that NYPD is going to respond to or that we want them to play a role in the neighborhood between the shelters just wanted to know what the ask was specifically for the commission on line 57, it's to coordinate the DHS street outreach and the NYPD public safety enforcement. Okay. Thank you any other questions from the board about this letter. Okay, thank you. All for your time item 13 is a basically a pro formal letter under our bylaws. We are required to vote in person because we can't vote in person. We will be having the board elections in December online. We are advising the borough president that we're doing this, so we can get around any legal requirement that we meet in person under the governor's executive order. Any question Jesse go ahead and just add that this is any boards that are running their elections during this time and doing it virtually are all doing sort of similar resolutions and letters. So this is the start version of that. So to so. If people ask how, for why was our election done in this way? We have a history and an understanding of what the purpose was. Any questions on that. Okay, that are those are the 13 items that we are voting on. I'm going to turn it over to Mike and Leslie to do our roll call same way. We've been doing it.
