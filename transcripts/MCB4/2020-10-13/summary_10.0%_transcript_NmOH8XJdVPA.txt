Welcome to the September executive committee, meeting for Manhattan Community board, for I am the Chair Lowell Kern, and we have an agenda that I'm going to run through here.
Online CB1, is with the who's, the first actually in the in our borough, and so it was decided as recommendation by Gail's office, that just to cover all bases in case anybody claims that the election was done improperly or not in the regular format that we acknowledge that the executive order allows us to have non- person, non- in- person meetings, but that are that are that are the com that the boards themselves are.
By way of background back in June, I created a social justice working group to deal with the issues that arose in our district, specifically following the murder in Minneapolis and the subsequent protests here in New York and the rise of the black lives.
It was thought that, aside from just creating the social Justice task force as an ongoing entity subject to open meeting laws, we should put some guard rails in place as to what is within their scope and what is not within their scope, since it's not very clear as it is for something like waterfront parks and environment, so they met.
The bylaws require only require that the chair consult with the executive committee before creating a task force, but I'd like to put this to a vote tonight, based upon what viren and katie present so everyone.
So, as you may recall, back in July, we made up about a dozen or fifteen recommendations that people reviewed and then voted on and approved, and one of them was to continue the work that had been started by the group, in whatever format you will deem reasonable, and one of the recommendations also was that we include, in the name of whatever format, goes forward sort of anti- racism or racial equity or something We really are addressing the issue of race as well.
It was important to our group in our proposal for all of you that it be focused that the efforts be focused on our district, What we've written in this mission statement is that the mission would be to engage the community to understand their concerns regarding racism and discrimination and to take a proactive role in facilitating measurable progress towards social and racial equity and equality in our district.
It would be called something like social and racial equity task force or whatever format you guys want to approve us and again, it's really.
You may recall, the things that we've already said that we're interested in focusing on in those recommendations, included, sort of police, accountability, issues and figuring out ways to facilitate more community outreach and involvement and intersectionality between the police and some of the youth groups, and also seeing how we might be able to help some of the young people get access to sort of mentoring and job training and things.
You know we are not interested in being an end run around any other committee and that if an issue is brought to us- And, it falls clearly within the purview of some pre- existing CB4 committee- that we would forward it on to them or if it seems like.
And, I think, like I, think you covered most of it, but exploring the overlaps with standing committees and the issues that might come up to those standing committees that may sort of be referred to the social Justice Task force or whatever name.
It's not like this group- is going to sort of start policing every agency in the city or everything that happens in the district.
It's about addressing whatever comes up either true social justice Group within the sort of this task force or two other committees.
Think those are the sort of generally speaking, the kind of issues that people have brought up and last, but not least, is education, and that is sort of right.
We certainly do not think that we are going to be solving racism anytime soon or that we are doing it at all and that we did not want it to just be like a committee that makes sort of grandiose, lovely sounding statements and does not do anything.
We organize some voluntary training seminars for anybody on the community Board to do if they want to about anti- racism- We identified the speaker, and then we arranged it and we offered it, and some people took it and look.
But we can't implement any of those directly and just like any other community facilitates people to come and talk to us to the community and get communities, input and then sort of propose thoughts about whether it translates into a letter that gets written to particular agency through the board process or similar to what we did with derek ingram situation or in many cases it might not even be something that the task force does.
It might be an issue that actually gets referred back to the land, Use Committee or the Housing committee, or you know any of the other committees, which is where it has a sort of So That's the kind of a background with which the task force is going to it kind of becomes the kind of platform where people come and you know find their sort of frustrations, their opinions and their rights.
If sort of the group collectively thinks that needs to be referred back to either the committee or there's something that we can directly engage with in terms of okay.
You know youth and our community, So we wanted to sort of push for expanding that and making sure that people had.
In particular, I, like the focus on engaging with the community, and I, think that's the real opportunity for a move like this by our community board, is to have the dialogue that we've often ignored or not created space for as a society, and I'm one of the people, who's excited, that's starting to change.
, that's the question that came up numerous times during the sort of working groups, meetings, You know when it comes to community Board, for I might be totally wrong, I'm, actually relatively new, compared to everybody else, here, but define community.
As you may recall, you know, we were originally formed with the name, the Social Justice Task force right, which is sort of a broad, really big umbrella, but we were formed in response to some very specific events that were racially motivated, and so.
You know racial violence and murder, and so it was very important to us to use those words and to be explicit about it, And so, in fact, for a while, we were just saying: okay, we're going to focus on anti- racism , We also include that, and so that's why we then included sort of the broader term discrimination, because otherwise it was going to get to be very long.
We have a charge that everyone who kind of comes by is our constituent boards are parochial by their nature and that's a good thing, because it gives the community voice right and people are not shy when they go to a facility or something like that as part of our community I'm really concerned about the academic nature of some of this discussion.
Is people come with ideas or concerns and then refer it out, but do not reinvent the wheel, because certain committees are actually engaged with various organizations that can help what's going on so really academic down, discussion about words, less just clear, thoughtful as a form for people to come and speak, that's good, and then we, but let's not promise the world when they come and speak either, because that's another problem, so we do not create false expectations.
These are very personal to people They're hard to talk about, and you just need to see, and I think the community itself needs a safe place for it to come and talk about these issues and it'll grow into something Or It may not.
If and it's local That's what we want a place for people from our neighborhoods give them some kind of focus and structure to express something N't at this point, think well in six months.
It's, not that at all, but I think when there are white middle class people leading a racial or a social injustice group and kind of directing that conversation, I'm not saying that they do not know, but they do not know exactly, and I would just feel more comfortable if there was a stronger black and hispanic voice.
Perhaps maybe we should look at that, so it does not have that implication that we're going to be solving something or or giving people some sort of implying that we're going to take care of something which, probably you know you do not think we're going to be able to take care of this, maybe their own personal need to speak and to express themselves.
Perhaps, it's not a specific task force that coordinates with the committee, but perhaps it's a group, A working group that liaises with issues we're already dealing with that are on agendas of committee.
We made 15 recommendations, the so- called proposals and they actually been sent back to the working group members for them to sort of pick on one or two items that they want to pursue further and further define and in terms of actionable items.
There is racism and, let's acknowledge it and then, and just to clarify- And I, think I misspoke when I said people coming into the in in our community- The point I was trying to actually make people who live here and people who work here.
Think it's really important that our community board publicly make that statement that we have a group whatever we're called that is committed to having that space, an interest in dialogue on these topics.
Whatever committee meeting that we wanted to raise with, because I think frankly, that does not allow us to be as sort of proactive and current with concerns raised by our community.
Let this group know that we signed on to a letter from Gail Brewer's office that was joined by Dick Gottfried and Robert Jackson, basically reiterating everything we have been saying about the homeless situation on 36th street.
Some of them just finding ways to collaborate and partner with other folks who are looking to help, and one of the things I would like to do is think about is doing a drive, a Kimber board for member drive for one, the shelters with families.
You know, a clothing store or something like that, wants to sort of be the main place where members can go and purchase it, whether online or in person.
If we want to try to do local businesses, I'm completely open to that once again or even presented as alternatives, If people know stores that would be- would love to sell all their socks and their underwear and toothbrushes or something like that, then I think that would be lovely.
You know they're working at in our district, While I think we have many people on our board.
We've asked committees to come up with two to three items that are new and sort of Covid-19 specific again recognizing that these are not things that are going to be acted on right, now, but maybe Covid-19 has revealed as issues that need to be addressed in the next budget cycle that this survey information may help us better prioritize that, if we, if we feel you know that every you know, I'm sure we'll feel everything's important, but hearing from the community directly may help us better parse that out.
You have two feet, you're lucky well, 12 feet would work and is the suggestion that people go out onto the street to certain ambulate was that the suggestion want me to take that part We voted on that in July and the idea is to say you know.
