You can go my chair good evening. Welcome to the September executive committee meeting for Manhattan Community board, for I am the Chair Lowell Kern, and we have an agenda that I'm going to run through here. There are a couple of items that need votes. There are a couple of items that are just for discussion. The first item of business is that our bylaws provide that voting for the Executive board officers, the executive officers of the board- that's the chair, the first vice chair, the second vice chair of the two coast. Secretaries must be done in person because we have one year terms. We have to run elections every year. The current slate of officers is not term limited and I believe everyone has submitted for. No, that's not true, I'm not sure where Mike stands at this point, but I have submitted Jeffrey has submitted. I believe Jessica and Leslie have submitted Mike. Are you standing again to be secretary? It's in limbo, it's in limbo. Let's see if somebody else wants to do it, and I will kindly give up my spot. Okay, Paul is the chair of the Nominating committee and he's raised his hand, so Paul yeah. I'm glad to see that Jessica has, I do not recall seeing Jessica's application come through yet, but that could just be because I was not paying attention and we do have another candidate for co- secretary, that okay, all right, somebody else, okay, but the point of this is that the bylaws say we need to vote in person. Well, can I but sorry lol not to interrupt? He does not say in person. He just does not allow us to do it anymore, remotely yeah. So we are. We would like the executive Board to approve a memo for the full board to approve a memo to the borough president's office, explaining that we will be voting remotely as we have done since April, including on these nominations. I'd like to make that motion is well before Paul makes a motion. Does anyone have any questions about any of this one? Second, one at a time. Please go ahead. Okay, what's going on for us? Is it also going on with the other boards? Yes, can I do you mind if I jump in here long go ahead, so yeah? This is the sort of performer so other boards, few of them not many, but other boards have had their elections. Online CB1 is with the who's, the first actually in the in our borough, and so it was decided as recommendation by Gail's office, that just to cover all bases in case anybody claims that the election was done improperly or not in the regular format that we acknowledge that the executive order allows us to have non- person, non- in- person meetings, but that are that are that are the com that the boards themselves are. Okay with running elections, the same way, so the executive board would vote on this tonight. If it's approved we'll take it to full board, the full board will ratify it and we will send it to probably to Gail's general counsel for safekeeping before we vote or on this, can we just make sure that everybody that's here has renamed themselves, because if we're just going to ask for folks to say Yay or nay they need to, they need to be identified on the recording and saying who they were. So I see a couple still coming right. The Ic2 mcb4 meeting, please rename yourselves. One is Jean Danielle and I'm not sure who the other one is. I do not worry. I will think oh jd already fixtures and yeah Betty. I will fix you, do not worry about it and christine yours doing that. Thank you and varan and Katie are with us for the next item on the agenda, but they are not voting on this because they are not exec board members, but they're joining us for the next item. So Paul I'll take your motion now attack and I will second the motion. Mr Chair, I move to every second all right, you mean that's a motion to adopt correct, there's a motion to adopt. Yes, okay, christine you have a question on the motion: no or you're just voting already all right, everyone in all in favor. Please raise your hand or say Aye Alan. I think that's everyone, Frank did you were you? Okay? Yes, Frank's, okay, Mike, hi, okay, it's unanimous, then all right next item on the agenda is the social Justice Task Force again, just by way of background back in June, I created a social justice working group to deal with the issues that arose in our district, specifically following the murder in Minneapolis and the subsequent protests here in New York and the rise of the black lives matter, movement, etc. The task force came up with a set of recommendations that were adopted by the board at the end of July at our full board meeting. One of those recommendations was that the group continue in light of the 45th street situation, where we had that letter that we had very long discussion at last full board. It was thought that, aside from just creating the social Justice task force as an ongoing entity subject to open meeting laws, we should put some guard rails in place as to what is within their scope and what is not within their scope, since it's not very clear as it is for something like waterfront parks and environment, so they met as a group. They have come up with a mission statement that would help guide what they will take on and I'm going to turn this over to katie and veron now to walk through what their discussions were within their group and the way they see this moving forward. Just for transparency, the bylaws require only require that the chair consult with the executive committee before creating a task force, but I'd like to put this to a vote tonight based upon what viren and katie present so everyone. We know. You know that if we are going to move forward, it is with a full boatload of support, so Katie and viren the floor is yours great. So thanks everybody for inviting us to speak briefly this evening. So, as you may recall, back in July, we made up about a dozen or fifteen recommendations that people reviewed and then voted on and approved, and one of them was to continue the work that had been started by the group, in whatever format you will deem reasonable, and one of the recommendations also was that we include, in the name of whatever format, goes forward sort of anti- racism or racial equity or something so we really are addressing the issue of race as well. So we also heard from so many of you the importance of having our meetings be public and having them be, you know the public meeting laws apply and having them be regular, so we met in September and we announced it ahead of time and it was a public meeting and one of the things we did was that we came up with a proposed mission statement for your review. Viren. Are you able to pull that up and show everybody or Jesse? Do you have it? I'm not sure who has it. I think Jesse would be better yet I'll bring it up great. So I think that will come on the screen in just a moment. There we go and, as you can see, it was important to our group in our proposal for all of you that it be focused that the efforts be focused on our district, and so, as you can see, what we've written in this mission statement is that the mission would be to engage the community to understand their concerns regarding racism and discrimination and to take a proactive role in facilitating measurable progress towards social and racial equity and equality in our district. Just a tiny correction, I think we're going to add, instead of in our district, it's going to be affect our district. That's right! That's right! So, instead of it being in our district, the last three words it would be affecting our district, so we're placing the word in with affecting you're right, thanks, Baron, so and also frankly, one of the recommendations is that it would not be called the it would not continue to be called social justice. It would be called something like social and racial equity task force or whatever format you guys want to approve us and again it's really. The goal is to be a place where community concerns can be raised, dealing with racial or other forms of discrimination. As you may recall, the things that we've already said that we're interested in focusing on in those recommendations, included, sort of police, accountability, issues and figuring out ways to facilitate more community outreach and involvement and intersectionality between the police and some of the youth groups, and also seeing how we might be able to help some of the young people get access to sort of mentoring and job training and things. So anyway, there was a list of sort of 15 things that we've already suggested. We're interested in focusing on. Another thing that obviously came up is the importance of us being able to support and collaborate with existing committees, and we made it very clear. You know we are not interested in being an end run around any other committee and that if an issue is brought to us- and it falls clearly within the purview of some pre- existing CB4 committee- that we would forward it on to them or if it seems like it would also involve our group. Then we would say: hey we'd, be happy to do a joint letter or a joint statement or whatever. But it would you know. Our goal is to be supportive and collaborative and to exist as a space within our community to address these concerns and again to facilitate measurable progress. Baron over to you anything to add. No, that's just a couple of things. The recommendation for renaming the group was the recommendation that came from the group itself was to call it anti- racist task force and we sort of are kind of keeping it open in terms of what to call it. So it's been brought to you and, I think, like I think you covered most of it, but exploring the overlaps with standing committees and the issues that might come up to those standing committees that may sort of be referred to the social Justice Task force or whatever name we come up with. We are sort of open to that possibility and the area is very simple. I mean housing is housing. Affordability is one idea that sort of accountability as katie mentioned, and it's only the police accountability. It's also sort of multiple agency accountability. It goes into that sort of rem if potentially possible, and only the issues come up. It's not like this group is going to sort of start policing every agency in the city or everything that happens in the district. It's about addressing whatever comes up either true social justice Group within the sort of this task force or two other committees. So that's the accountability, part of it and the last part, is the public space and sort of streets and equity. In our kind of you know what we call spatial justice, so in other words, you know that sort of ties back into the accountability issues in terms of how we are surveilled, how we are sort of monitored how our sort of mobility is either restricted or not restricted in our own district, and I think those are the sort of generally speaking, the kind of issues that people have brought up and last but not least, is education, and that is sort of right. Now it's pretty unclear as to what what some of those issues might be, but as we I mean one of the things that we sort of discussed. Is that a lot of what we will do, either if you're still getting defined and refined as we go. So that's just pretty much what I had to say: yep, oh well, you're running it to myself. One thing I will add is that this task force will report to the executive committee as all the other committees do. It will not be reporting into any specific committee. So there's no committee oversight over the task force. It will be executive oversight over the task force, so they would basically have the standing of a full committee without being a committee, so it does not. We do not get into in numbers game with people serving on too many committees or not enough committees. Are there any questions for viren and Katie Betty? I saw your hand go up first in blue. Go right ahead. Jd is next well anyway. I think it's wonderful that you're doing this. I think it's admirable and I think if you're changing the name of the task force, we should participate in what you choose for the different name and oh, if the thing went off the screen, but I thought that the measurable progress seemed like a very aspirational goal and that measurable progress towards social and racial equality and equal equity and equality is a terrific goal. I just wonder if you guys have thought what measurable progress would look like, in other words, what data or what milestones or what would that be? So that kind of was a question mark with me, and my other question was: would any of this deal with economic equity and homeless people? Those are all my questions. Thanks, buddy. In fact, we had quite a lengthy discussion at our last meeting about measurable progress. I think one of the sort of main issues was that we did not want this to look number one. We certainly do not think that we are going to be solving racism anytime soon or that we are doing it at all and that we did not want it to just be like a committee that makes sort of grandiose, lovely sounding statements and does not do anything. So we talked about the fact that we want it to be about steps that we help facilitate that are yeah that are steps and that go towards progress. So, for example, if we help the police Athletic league get active in our district and help there be sort of you know, activities between the police and youth. We think that would be measurable progress. We could show that we helped facilitate the meetings where those were planned. If we organize some voluntary training seminars for anybody on the community Board to do if they want to about anti- racism- and we would set that up- and we could say see- we identified the speaker and then we arranged it and we offered it and some people took it and look. That is something that we can show that we did as a so. It was really talking about sort of actionable steps that are helping sort of move things forward. It's not any different than what most of the committees currently do. We are an advisory body, we're not actually, and we can propose solutions and sort of ideas towards solutions, but we can't implement any of those directly and just like any other community facilitates people to come and talk to us to the community and get communities, input and then sort of propose thoughts about whether it translates into a letter that gets written to particular agency through the board process or similar to what we did with derek ingram situation or in many cases it might not even be something that the task force does directly. It might be an issue that actually gets referred back to the land, Use Committee or the Housing committee, or you know any of the other committees which is where it has a sort of you know better chances of you know turning into an action level plan. So that's the kind of a background with which the task force is going to it kind of becomes the kind of platform where people come and you know find their sort of frustrations, their opinions and their rights. Their sort of concerns about issues that relate to social and racial justice and, if sort of the group collectively thinks that needs to be referred back to either the committee or there's something that we can directly engage with in terms of okay. Let's just think about drafting a letter to such and such agency. That's what it is eddie. Your second question about economic justice issues we have talked about and if you look at the list that we had recommended in July, the sort of 15 items that we're interested in more than one of them had to do with sort of economic justice issues, including, for example, like the Youth employment program, was first cancelled and it was brought back, but it was greatly reduced and that had a big impact on you know youth and our community, and so we wanted to sort of push for expanding that and making sure that people had. You know job opportunity, job opportunities, and so that's one example of looking at economic justice issues through with the racial lens. All right, I'm going to keep this moving. Jd was next yeah. I I'm sorry. I am unable to wrap my arms around this. I understand you want to do good and fight injustice, but to engage the community to understand their concerns regarding racism and discrimination to me opens up a huge, a huge undertaking, which I feel this community board has nothing to do with. If you find in community district 4 in our board area. A lot of discrimination in racism great. I do not see that in your mission statement. I see your mission statement wanting to ask people about racism and discrimination and I'm sure people are going to have a lot to say. How is the Community board supposed to deal with this and as to taking some of these issues to the other committees? First of all, I would suggest maybe you should visit some of our communities. Committees like land use, land use committee in Clinton, health's kitchen. We are mandated to deal with development in our neighborhood, it's kind of specific what we have to deal with, I'm kind of stunned that you would assume that you're going to you may bring issues to other committees again. I did not join this community board to solve the problems of the world and I understand I think we all are against racism and discrimination all our lives. Oh did Judy leave Judy left. Okay, all right, you can close my door Eddie! Please go on mute, but frankly, and with all the respect I have for what you're trying to do, I can not understand how, as a community board member dealing with a specific city charter mandate, we are supposed to deal with these huge issues. I like the idea of specificity. We did do a study about fulfilling the needs as and delivering the services of those in our community that are underrepresented, that do not come and speak before the board. We studied those we want to reach out to them. We want to help them elderly homebound, youth at risk. That, to me, is social justice in our district, but as to inviting people to say this is racism. I'm discriminated blah. How on earth are I'm afraid, we're opening up this huge thing of incredibly complex issues, so I wish it were more narrow. I wish it were more focused and if you want to open up economic issues- oh my god, oh my god, so that's all I got to say. Thank you, Jd Kit. I guess I see this pretty differently from Jd. I appreciate the work that you katie been put into this with the rest of the folks on the task force. In particular, I like the focus on engaging with the community, and I think that's the real opportunity for a move like this by our community board, is to have the dialogue that we've often ignored or not created space for as a society, and I'm one of the people who's excited that's starting to change. I do have a couple questions. I was curious: how we're thinking about equity versus equality? Was there conversation about what each one of those means and why we're differentiating between the two? So we have started talking a little bit about it, but we, you know as varane- and I were talking about earlier- we're at the beginning of this and trying to figure out how how we can address these issues and what seems most pressing to our community. So, in fact, veren is the one who said that he thinks it's really important, that we focus on sort of the differences and the importance of each of those words. But we do not have more to add right now than what our group has already discussed and when we were coming up with the general Mission statement. But I think kid it's a really important point and something that we're alerted to just to clarify. I mean it's pretty much. What we all understand about equity and equality quality is, you know what it means, but equity is sort of creating opportunities of not really creating the opportunities but understanding what stake the community can have in various walks of life. I mean if we do that routinely in the committee work when we talk about new projects being proposed and we say make sure that there is a sort of some sort of employment component to it and then make sure that you know people of color to the minorities x, y and Z issues are addressed in terms of you know: their stake in the activity of whatever you know, whatever the sort of financial or economic activity that takes place in our district, so the equity it's a little more than equality- is that we are all equal and we all understand it and everything is hunky story, but at the end of the day, what's in it for me and that's the question that came up numerous times during the sort of working groups meetings, so you know, for example, I'm going back to Jd's question. You know when it comes to community Board, for I might be totally wrong, I'm actually relatively new compared to everybody else here, but define community. For me. Is this a community of people who live here? I thought people who work here also belong to the same community and people who come to come to school to this neighborhood. They also belong to this community as well. So you know it's a much wider net than we pretend we tend to sort of cast in terms of who is part of the community and who is not part of the community. If I live in Bushwick and if I walk into Chelsea, do my rights matter as well or not? Am I at least going to feel protected by the community district in some form or the other? But this is not so much about that. I think the fact that we have in this conversation is what the mission is actually much more than what it solves and what it sort of comes up with in terms of conversation, and it is what is probably going to lead to solutions and they might not be direct solutions, but they might be pathways to solutions. I do not know, I'm not quite sure, but you know, in every walk of life. You know the fact that it's it is open- ended, makes it much more inclusive. So I totally agree that having the conversation is bad, I do think it's worth the group taking on defining what equity and equality mean and for our purposes, because I do not think that we all agree on what they mean. In fact, you know there's 20 of us on this call and I think we would all define those words probably differently if given a blank piece of paper, but another question I had was we're very specific about racism and then we say and discrimination. There are a lot of other challenges that we have that society as a community would like to better understand why we did not call out some of the others. Like massaging xenophobia, why were we sort of big umbrella discrimination and then very specific racism? Can we also discuss that? Because, as you may recall, you know we were originally formed with the name, the Social Justice Task force right, which is sort of a broad, really big umbrella, but we were formed in response to some very specific events that were racially motivated, and so, as our group was talking about what we wanted to address, as a group, you know we were sort of called out and told like hey. Let's be really honest about why we're here and what events motivated are gathering, and it was very specifically, you know racial violence and murder, and so it was very important to us to use those words and to be explicit about it, and so, in fact, for a while, we were just saying: okay, we're going to focus on anti- racism and then others said well, I mean there are obviously other things and do we can't. We also include that, and so that's why we then included sort of the broader term discrimination, because otherwise it was going to get to be very long list. But we wanted to be explicit about the racial reason that we gathered, and that is definitely one of our focuses or foci or whatever the right plural is, but we did not want to exclude the many other challenges that are faced by people within our community. So that's for the general answer all right. Thank you. One more thing. Oh sure, you have one more, I'm sorry that was super helpful, as was imagining but appreciate you walking me through it one plug for not calling it. The anti- racist group is the last several years. This sort of thing was called diversity, equity inclusion, the last couple months. Now people are calling it anti- racism. Six months, 18 months from now, it'll have another flashy trendy name. I would encourage us to keep it. Open- ended and call it social justice or something more all encompassing and not be performative and just latch on to whatever the buzzword of the day is thanks. Thank you, Kit Joe, Rastucci yeah. First, I think we need to lose the mission statement, part of it if it's a task force, basically all of our committees or task forces on our website will say what that group does. What that committee or task force does having a mission statement somehow elevates this to something else. This is just the normal, like the committee charge, so I give this to lowell as a question. I think it's really not the right way to say mission state, that's my forum question. So if you can think about that on how to properly just put it out there, okay, we can we can. We can take that under advisement show. But the main thing I want to talk about is, I think, to veron. First and foremost, we are local, that is our charge and our land. The city, is the city of neighborhoods. We look through our local lands. People come go to school visit, whatever community boards are made up of people who live or work in the district. So that's our point of view, and that should be our point of view when we make comments, for example, on citywide rezoning like for inclusionary housing, that happened a number of years ago. We took our lens and talked about how it should work citywide and put it out there. I do not want us ever to think we have a charge that everyone who kind of comes by is our constituent boards are parochial by their nature and that's a good thing, because it gives the community voice right and people are not shy when they go to a facility or something like that as part of our community, they come and they speak right. I want to caution, though, some of the members I'm really concerned about the academic nature of some of this discussion. This is where Community Board seven goes all the time and gets lost in a black hole of talking to navals. Okay, our board is known to be thoughtful and active and clear and specific: let's stay on that platform, guys because the more we get into like the broad stuff like, for example, what just hit me was when you said, have the pal work with kids, so there's more, the pal in our district. Does that already and has 300 kids going to the school program and a whole process and the police are deeply involved in it. Do you know that? Are you involved with that? Just speak to that committee right because do not try to. I would say the idea. Is people come with ideas or concerns and then refer it out, but do not reinvent the wheel, because certain committees are actually engaged with various organizations that can help what's going on so really academic down, discussion about words, less just clear thoughtful as a form for people to come and speak, that's good, and then we, but let's not promise the world when they come and speak either, because that's another problem, so we do not create false expectations, do not want to promise the world absolutely. Thank you! Joe Dale! I do want to echo Joe's point that it's you know our mission be district specific. I agree with that and actually, although it's high level because of the you know the request to broadly define our our purpose, this actual discussions that have been ongoing have been pretty district specific and I appreciate Joe you bringing that that kind of case, study or model of like we have a specific instance of like inclusionary housing. But then we have broader recommendations for the city at large and I do think that's the way the panel or working group has been dealing with stuff. You know, for instance, the Derrick Ingram situation is right in our district. Now I do want to say this. I want to remind jd that the members of the panel are all community board members and sit on two committees and some of us co- chair jointly committees, so we are fully aware of the work you know, as a group collectively we're fully aware of the group of the other committees I feel like. I do not need you to respond to my concern. My question was asking: I do not need you. Okay, I'm going to cut it, I'm cutting it off right now, I'm cutting it off right now, Jd made his point. Dale you've made your point move on to your next point. Thank you. My sense also is that when Jd characterizes this as like, can we please refrain from calling out other board members in this discussion? I'm talking to a specific point that was made. I do not have to mention the person by name, but a specific point was as if this panel or this working group is going to stir up racist sentiment within the district by virtue of its work. That is absurd, and that goes to an idea that, like that you know it's almost like a denial of the existence of racism in our in our in our society. Please, I'm talking he's not saying he's not saying you did. This is not specific. This is a conference that we're having a conversation, no one's going to talk over each other and no one's going to going to talk down anyone else or I'll cut you off and move to the next person. All right. Thank you so just to just to reemphasize that there are, there are members on the panel. There are members of, I think, just about every committee standing committee at CB4 and many of us many of the committees that we serve on actually meet on a monthly basis, and many of most of them are chaired by two people. So there's a diversity of views and interests and leadership, and most of us actually take a great deal of input from community members in terms of hosting small meetings and getting a lot of feedback and so on. So that perspective is in the very bones of the working group, all right. Thank you, Dale Mike Noble. I just wanted to get to one point that veren made. You know we're not going to go out policing the neighborhood. No, we should not go out looking for instances of injustice right waiting for people come to us. That's what usually happens, and I would hope that, as this task force moves along that it does things in baby steps right, let's see how things work. Take the small issues see how we work them out. Let's not make some grand effort and fail at it. Let's do it slowly. Let's all get used to how we're going to do this. We're going to redefine this whole thing as we go along and I think that'll be fine. Let folks come to us and we're going to take it in little bits and pieces. That's finally, coming all right! Thank you, Mike Allen! I might be repeating what Mike just said, but this is a first time gig for us, it's going to be a work in progress, the focus. What goes on or discussed or gets talked about, will change with what is happening all around us, but I think the important thing is to have a place that these issues can be discussed. This is not trying to figure out what the zoning is for something, or can we get a bus going down this street or that street? These are difficult issues. These are very personal to people they're hard to talk about, and you just need to see, and I think the community itself needs a safe place for it to come and talk about these issues and it'll grow into something or it may not. I mean, but it's a work in progress and I think it's a place it's a time and a place that needs to be have its own place and in our community board. Thank you, Alan Bert, you had your hand up, I mean in terms of functioning, I mean we could use, I'm not all for the words I think, as Joe had said, we can eliminate or de- emphasize all the words, because what are we going to do we being the board? What is the task force going to do when it comes down to feet on the ground, and I think Alan you had said small steps provide a forum, provide an opportunity, a place, a metaphorical place or even a physical place in some structured way, starting out for people to air whatever they want to say. If and it's local and it's from our neighborhoods, that's what we want a place for people from our neighborhoods give them some kind of focus and structure to express something and then what we do with that, we being the board we'll find out if we can't at this point, think well in six months, we're going to do this and in 18 months we'll do that one step at a time, and the first thing is: what kind of opportunity are we going to provide people in our neighborhood all right? Thank you. Veron, you had your hand up, I'm going to come back to you and katie at the end, so you'll get one last shot dolores I'm going to skip over you because I'm going to take the exec board members first and then I'll. Let you speak so Leslie you're up next. I just have one comment on this actually, and it has nothing to do with what the makeup is or what the objective is of the task force. I would feel more comfortable if there were more black and hispanic people on this task force, and I know that's kind of we we're dealt with what we're dealt right with who's on our community board. I just feel when we have white middle- class people leading a, and this is nothing to do with the people on the task force, because I know it's in all great intention. It's not that at all, but I think when there are white middle class people leading a racial or a social injustice group and kind of directing that conversation, I'm not saying that they do not know, but they do not know exactly, and I would just feel more comfortable if there was a stronger black and hispanic voice. If we're going to do it, we're going to do it right and that's my comment. Leslie I can tell you anyone who asked to be on the working group was put on the working group. There was no selection process. The only selection process was that I asked for veren and katie to chair the working group and that those choices were made very specifically given their backgrounds and who they are. It's just a philosophy, not specifics. Okay, a general philosophy all right before I go back to Alan for round two and then go to dolores has anyone know who has not spoken who's. A member of the executive committee want to weigh in here once twice Alan back to you. So maybe we need to drop the word task force, because that implies that we're there's a reason for why we're we've come together and that there's going to be some sort of a goal, something's going to happen and it's going to be disbanded. So perhaps maybe we should look at that, so it does not have that implication that we're going to be solving something or or giving people some sort of implying that we're going to take care of something which probably you know you do not think we're going to be able to take care of this, maybe their own personal need to speak and to express themselves alan when you said that the thing that came to my mind is the budget task force is no way going to try and solve the city's budget. So I'm not sure that it would be taken that way. I understand your point, but we have to call it something. I do not want to make this a full- fledged committee, because I do not want to run into problems where we have quorum numbers on other committees, yeah. No, I'm just saying make it a committee, but I see your point all right, dolores. So I'm just listening to this great conversation that we're having and based on a little bit of everyone's comment. What it sounds like to me makes the most sense is that as a specific body that focuses on issues within our district and tries at every point to be conscious of these, I these areas where we can improve or where we can advocate more for those that may not have a voice. Perhaps it's not a specific task force that coordinates with the committee, but perhaps it's a group, a working group that liaises with issues we're already dealing with that are on agendas of committee. So, for example, if we are talking about, let's say a an issue with education and it's already on the agenda since, as Dale pointed out, there are members of the task force that are already on almost every committee that exists. If those members are representative of that lens, the lens of social justice, the lens of inequality, the lens of equity and brings that to their committee, then it already is embedded within our process. I think, by carving out this separate group, although the conversations have been extremely helpful for those trying to figure out how to deal with this moment, but also how to define we as a community of being vocal and being in being proactive. What it's also done is just raised awareness overall. So why not have that awareness be embedded within the committees that we have and not be separated out where there is a quote-, unquote mission statement that gives off the impression that we actually have a solution or that we have a path forward. But if we make it as specific, as Joe said to what we already do, it also allows us to be taken much more seriously as a body compared to other community boards that try to take on herculean tasks that do not have a solution for it. So just the thought and again this is all coming out of this great discussion that we're having now not something that I brought up previously at the task force as it did not come to mind Matt Amber Tay. I think that you know, because it is so complicated and it is new and it's difficult. Each committee is already dealing with complicated and you know difficult issues in their space and having one year person. Liaising is not enough to make the weight of that issue stand. I think people will revert to their business as usual solution, so I think having. I think this is a good idea, dolores a good idea, but I think it's premature. We are not there here in a state of maturity that we understand enough of those things plus. This group wants to take some proactive actions which are not being taken in other committees, and I think we should let them run with that for a little while and see where we are at the end of the day, and I think the lies has to happen, but it can not be the only thing right now, because it's, I think it's not enough. Thank you. Christian, I'm going back to veron and katie to wrap this up. If they have any additional comments. They'd like to make, let me make one more comment: there, I'm sorry Mike. I did not see your hand go ahead. Okay, I got ta start getting a camera working here. I'm sorry guys for doing it. This way. Now that was my fault Mike. I thought you had. I thought your hand was in reference to your first date. No, it's my fault for being too shy with a broken, lousy camera. Anyway. I think that and the point that the dolores made. First of all, I have this sense that, with the same feeling that I had after 9:11, I want to go. Join the arm go back into the army. The next day, I was ready to join up we're all we're hurt by the things that are happening here today. We all want to jump in and do something pro. I want to be activists, okay. I think we should be aware of things and we should respond to things as they come as they present themselves to us. We've got to be a working group, that's aware of social injustice, okay, we're more or less an advisory, a body within an advisory body right. Can we do that? Can we be a working group rather than a task force? We sound more like we're. Just you know, laying back and thinking about things and advising as those moments come around well, we've got to say something you know do not look like we're. You know stormtroopers going out there and you know solving all these big issues because we can't you know so, I'm all for a working group and I'd like for us to be an aware working group right rather than one that's just going out and trying to do something all right. Michael, I'm going to address that we originally formed it as a working group. The distinction between a working group is a working group is not subject to the open meeting law. They can't have open meetings, but they are not subject to it. A task force is subject to the open meeting loss and we want this group to be subject to the open meeting law. So that's the difference between a task force and a working group in this regard. I'm not that sorry yep all right, I'm going to go back to Varen and Katie now to wrap this up and then I'll entertain a motion urine over to you. First yeah. I just want to quickly sort of cover a couple of points very quickly. Michael you mentioned about baby slides, I think that's the intent. We made 15 recommendations, the so- called proposals and they actually been sent back to the working group members for them to sort of pick on one or two items that they want to pursue further and further define and in terms of actionable items. So that process has not happened. You have to remember that we were off in August and after the July meeting we were sort of waiting for the next steps, which is what this executive committee is actually telling us so moving forward. That's the intent to sort of refine and define the scope and couragency of what this group will do and it will not be simply decided within the group, but it will be brought back to the book so that that's pretty much what we are sort of focused on right now. Going back to kids point, I think it's the same issue. It's equity! It's one of the sort of proposals, one of the recommendations that some members of the group feel strongly about, and yes, it needs to be further defined and the distinction between activity and equality has to be sort of put on the table. It's important. I know Joe says that he's too academic there's nothing academic about racism. There's nothing academic about trying to get back to your house on your blog and being stopped while two other guys right in front of you walk right through that's, not an academic joke. So let I'm not going to get too passionate about it. But there is racism and let's acknowledge it and then and just to clarify- and I think I misspoke when I said people coming into the in in our community- the the point I was trying to actually make people who live here and people who work here. They we pretty much are part of our community and the working community. People who come and work in this district form a pretty large chunk of it, and I think we need to sort of acknowledge that. So with that clarification, I'm going to hand it over to katie thanks Baron. So I agree with everything Baron just said, and I think it's really important that you know, as we've said, whether we call it a mission statement or anything else. We have a very specific goal of creating this space for dialogue on these topics, and I think it's really important that our community board publicly make that statement that we have a group whatever we're called that is committed to having that space, an interest in dialogue on these topics. But one thing I would say I know a couple of you said you know you think it's really important- that that we just wait and only respond to issues that are brought to us by the community, and I would just point out that is generally the plan. But that is not what we did with Derrick Ingram right. We heard through multiple press reports about something that had happened to a member of our community and we did not wait to see if he would reach out to us, but instead we reached out to him frankly to his lawyer first and then to him, but to say that you know we were very concerned as a community board about the way that community member had been treated, and we think that this raises bigger issues for everyone in our community, about accountability and sort of a variety of issues. As you know, we discussed them at our last meeting. So just to be clear, we have not so far seen ourselves as being limited to only addressing issues that are brought to us. We have also felt that it was appropriate to address issues that we have heard impacted members of our community, and we think that would hopefully be that we would be allowed to continue to do that. Not in like a way that we're like reading the paper every day and hoping to look for more issues to go off and solve. But when things very clearly and directly impact our community members about these issues, we want to feel free that we can. Let them know that the community board is here and interested in addressing those inequities. And I do think it's really important that we not that as a group, that we not be sort of liaisons to committees and not be allowed to have a voice and not be allowed to draft our own letters or make our own recommendations to the executive committee that, but that we would have to sort of wait a month and wait for the next. Whatever committee meeting that we wanted to raise with, because I think frankly that does not allow us to be as sort of proactive and current with concerns raised by our community. As we would hope to be all right, thank you. Katie Jessica, I'd like to make a motion to adopt. Is there a second, I see Kid sand, I see Christine's hand all right all those in favor of adopting the mission statement of the working group. Please raise your hand and hold it up until I say your name, because I want to make sure we get a good count on this. So Bert Leslie, Christine, Allen, Maria Katie. Are you voting on your own motion? Oh, you can't vote you're, not a member of the executive committee, I'm right: Jessica, Betty, Dale, Paul, Kit, Joe, Frank, Mission, Statement, Lowell, I'm sorry, removing the words mission statement, yeah, okay, Jeffrey! Are you here, Mike, noble, yes or no? Yes, all right. Anyone voting, no John Danielle, not seeing any others that passes all right. Thank you all very much for erin and Katie. Thank you for your presentation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Everyone all right we're going to move on. The next item is a review of the agenda and the committee schedules those have been in the dropbox. If anybody has any problems with the agenda for October full board or for the October committee meetings, please let Jesse know if Erin did you have a point? No, I just want to ask: can I leave now? Do I have to be hi? Thank you bye thanks. Does anyone have any issues with the schedule that they want to bring to to Jesse's attention? You can do it now or you can do it privately, all right. Moving on small meeting report from me, a couple of us attended a meeting with the shelter provider at the skyline hotel, where there were reports of violence, Midtown north attended community stakeholders attended and hopefully, Skyline is being run a little bit better now than it was. We also continue to attend bi-, weekly meetings regarding street homeless, that is being chaired by the speaker's office. Eric's, really running that initiative. The NYCHA working group has begun to meet again after many months in hibernation, that's Joe, Betty, Alsora and Mike Noble Jesse, and I met with the Cia the commanding officers of the 10th and the Midtown north precincts, and immediately thereafter they were bothered. So we will be meeting with the ceos of their replacements in the cos of Midtown South and the 13th. Those are the four precincts that touch CB4 and trying to maintain and continue a relationship between the Community board and the precincts Jesse. Do we have 14th for full board? We reached out to the 13th precinct to come and speak on the full board next week. I'm waiting to hear confirmation. I thought we would give Midtown north and Midtown south commanding officers a little bit time to get comfortable in their new position. Of course, 13 did not change. 10 Midtown, north Midtown, south all have new ceos now and then finally not really a meeting, but I wanted to let this group know that we signed on to a letter from Gail Brewer's office that was joined by Dick Gottfried and Robert Jackson, basically reiterating everything we have been saying about the homeless situation on 36th street. There was a lot of the other electives refused to sign on simply because we ask that residents of some of the shelters be moved. We said they would should be moved within our community district and that we would work with DHS to help find suitable locations in our district. Dhs has acknowledged it is not a NIMBY issue, but now we've got Gail support, Dick support and Robert Jackson's support on this and Stephen banks acknowledged the letter almost immediately after it was sent and said he would be setting up a meeting shortly. He said after Yom Kippur, so we're hoping that it'll be this week, and you know we will be major players in that, since it was only the three electives offices that had the courage to stand up and actually say, move one of these Hotels District Office report, Jesse hi, everybody so very quickly. I think Lowell actually gave a pretty encompassing summary of the election process at this point in where we are so Paul Devlin has agreed to be co- chair, I'm next. Our co-, chair, chair of the Nominating committee and we've received just Responder Paul's. We did receive everybody's desire to run again for all those folks who had sent it in and we do have one individual who's met stated that they're interested in becoming a co- secretary, and so that's where we are with that we'll well, through the month of October, the nominating committee will hold its meeting and meet with all of the candidates and create a slate and make that recommendation in November and then the election will be in December. Anything you want to add Paul okay office space. We are in the final home stretches of getting approval from the legal, the New York City, City Hall's legal department and the Deputy mayor's sign off. I have confirmed that OMB did provide us with an approval letter for our funding prior to all of this, so they can't take it. So that was my big concern. So as of right now we still have funding for our office space once the final licensing agreement is signed off on so then I'm hoping for an October date, but we'll see the committee schedule and agendas were put on the agenda. I mean you guys have already been sent them earlier today. The only thing I wanted to highlight is for ACES committee will be meeting on the 20th, which is not their normal date due to the city holiday on their normal date, and then the way the month falls. The month creates a little bit of a little bit of havoc with people's committees, but they all fall on the same day. They usually do they just sort of jammed to the back of the month. There's very little flexibility in that there's a couple things I just wanted to bring up that one thing I was looking to start to do and I would hope I wanted to bring it to executive committee to see what they thought was that we're going into the fall season, we're going into the school season, and it's clear that the temp, the hotel shelters, the ones that have always been here in our district and then also the new ones, are all going to need support of some kind. And so I would like to I've been working and speaking with some of these providers on for a number of different reasons, some of them quality of life, some of them just finding ways to collaborate and partner with other folks who are looking to help, and one of the things I would like to do is think about is doing a drive, a Kimber board for member drive for one, the shelters with families we have about four or five shelters with with families: children, I'm sorry with children, so they're, not adult families, but children, families with children in our district and they're all run by the same provider akasia and then there. I thought it would be also to include one of the other providers, one of the newer providers, who has has two different shelters in our district, who, I think I've found to be extremely responsive and really actually a really fantastic provider, which is black vets for social justice, and they have two shelters, one on 36th street and one on 57th street. So I've been speaking with them. You know the stuff that they are needing for their their clients and their residents are not outside of the ballpark of the stuff that we've heard before socks, underwear, sometimes sneakers for kids, backpacks things like that, and so I, the idea of maybe putting together what a lot of the providers can do, is to Amazon prime wishlist, where all those things are listed out the height and the number of items, and I was hoping the idea to send that out to our board members and their and their folks to help us support the folks locally Dale Sorry Jesse. That sounds really great, although I'm a little bit like hesitant with the Amazon wish list like would not it be far better to like, have a like local businesses to support instead of like funneling, more money to Amazon for this effort. I I'm completely fine with that as well. It's just, I thought that might actually be more and easier for folks on the board to do, but I think the the obviously the other option would be to for board. Members to you know, do their own purchasing and things like that. I think the products that we're talking about will, I think, maybe we can, if we can, I'm completely open. If someone knows once I get that list and if we want to work with someone, if someone wants to help me out, do a little research and we have a local provider, you know whether it be a pharmacy or a you know: a clothing store or something like that- wants to sort of be the main place where members can go and purchase it, whether online or in person. That's fine it. I will say the difficulty with Covid-19 and everything does create an issue of just you know: where does the actual products get stored? Where do they go? You know who are we sending them to, and so that does become a bit of a an option, but I'm if we want to try to do local businesses, I'm completely open to that once again or even presented as alternatives yeah. No, I think that's a great idea and if peop once I have the list- and I can shoot around to everybody here and if people know stores that would be- would love to sell all their socks and their underwear and toothbrushes or something like that, then I think that would be lovely and I think that would be a win- win for everybody christine. I do not know whether I missed it, but did you say so you would do a yeah a drive? Would you open the drive to the public? I thought it would be nice to do for CB4 members. Since I mean we're not a small group, we're 50 members and everybody has family of some sort. You know friends or family that are, you know they're with, and so I thought it'd be nice to say it was just CB4. I I'm open to doing it, but I think it'd be a nice thing for us to do as a as a board. Specifically, I think, for the you know the shelters with families with children. Who are you know this is I mean, I'm sure everybody's read the most recent. You know New York, Times, Article or the or the podcast there. It was pretty powerful and so they've in the long- standing temporary shelters in our district when we've always attempted to help them when we could so. But I think this is particularly hard this year, Betty you're on moot Betty. She knows there's a couple of thoughts. I think it's a wonderful idea. I also kind of like local businesses. I know that Metro Baptist church every school year does do some kind of gathering of backpacks and school supplies yep, and I wondered if anyone has asked the people who are the families that are in the shelters, what they most need and also my question was: how would these items be given to the shelters? So I'm working directly with the point, was to work directly with the provider and the provider is the one that run the shelters, so it would that's sort of the direct relationship, we're not going to go through the agency and the agency knows that and they're comfortable with that, and so again that's the discussion. I think I was having with Dale earlier, which is, I think in one way. The wish list thing online makes it very easy because it automatically is set up by the provider and the provider provides the list of things that their clients have asked for the most, whether it be clothing or board games or books or whatever, and then it allows you guys much more quicker access to just you know. Most people have an account, then you can just click again and then the items are sent directly to the provider. Yes, the provider then yeah directly right exactly so, it does not go through DHS or a city agency. It does go to the provider. The providers obviously know from my conversations that if we would be, you know we're particularly interested in the shelters that they are, that they're. You know they're working at in our district they're. So this is, you know, while I think we have many people on our board, we again we do not think we could provide this. You know the socks that need that for every temporary shelter in the in the borough of Manhattan, or anything like that. No, okay, thanks all right, Brian weber, put his hand up. I think when I was talking about the gail's letter, so kid has his hand up to him all right I'll come back to kid. I want to go on and get to Brian because he is a public member, and I think this issue passed him by and Kit then I'll come back to you. Can we give Brian an open Mic? I'm sorry yeah, I apologize go ahead, Brian hi, thank you, Lol and I again want to thank the board for signing on to Gail's letter. I'm again wish to express my disappointment in both Corey Johnson and Brad Hoyleman for not joining in that letter. The 36th street is a perpetual crisis. It's been this way for close to four months now, and in my continual correspondence and dialogue with Corey Johnson's office, they seem to think that throwing more security and policing at it is going to solve the situation. This is a density crisis and Jesse to your point about black veterans for social justice. In my limited dealings with them, they seem very responsive and willing to work with the community. However, they are here on 36th street also and they contribute to the density and one of the things that black veterans for social justice had committed to was patrolling and addressing all issues on our street, as is nika supposed to do, and that is clearly not happening on a daily basis. There's a steady stream of ambulances going to black veterans, there's a steady stream of ambulances going to Nica- and I know I've had some conversations with members Offline about this, but you know, I think we need to continue to hold black veterans for social justice accountable rather than you know, saying, hey and we think you're one of the better providers in our neighborhood and reward them. So I I'm all for the drive, but I just I just caution that it sends perhaps the wrong message on 36th street, because I'll tell you right now. Residents on 36th street are not feeling very charitable. We are fatigued and just distraught on as to what is going on here on a daily basis, and I hope I do not have to keep returning to community Board for to discuss this issue. I hope our electeds are able to move this conversation forward and I would also just like to discuss perhaps afterwards with Lowell and Jesse, if I can join the conversation with commissioner banks and give him some residential perspective on West 36Th street. That's not up to us, though Brian it's Gail's meeting at this point, because the response was to her letter, but believe me, I understand where you're coming from you know that this board continues to push for a reduction in the density on 36th Street, and we will continue to do so all right. Thank you, Brian Kit, I'm sorry! I did not see your hand before and I had seen Brian so come back to you now. Oh definitely, no apology necessary just a quick idea, Jesse that we might want to loop in Superintendent, Chumley and or the principals on the push to get supplies to folks living in shelters. Often there are efforts either at the school level, led by principal and or by ptas, to do similar things, so we might want to just let them know that we're planning to do this and see if they have suggestions and there are redundancies we might want to avoid. There's no reason why we double the amount of notebooks that we actually need. So I think that's a very smart idea, all right. Thank you. Mike, noble yeah, just one comment about you know Brian's comment: there we're sending stuff to family shelters. You know not to these shelters that have adults only! That's right! No, that's not we're doing I was I was recommending. We do both yeah, okay, that's something else again. My suggestion is we deal with kids. You know family shelters. The adults can take care of themselves a lot better than family shelter. Anyway, all right, thank you. Michael! All right that covers the agenda. There is a piece of new business. What Jesse? I'm sorry? I did not. That was not my the end of my report. Oh I'm sorry. I thought it was. I just wanted to touch base about budget process, so we you know we're halfway through for committees wise. You know, and this is what I, when I'm talking about budget, I'm talking about the Fy 22 statement of district needs and budget requests. I sent that an email earlier to exec and just of the the budget borough budget consultations were done today. The final set of ones were done today, so you and I sent you a link with all of the agencies, questions and their answers. The only one I'm waiting on is NYPD because they never send us anything in writing so, but all of the other ones have so I would recommend them. I think this one we really all of the and this so people understand these borough. Budget consultations happen every year, mostly, the district managers are the ones from all from each borough, put together the questions and and send them off back in back in July, and then there we have these meetings in September. We really did focus on the impact that obviously the the cobit has had on the budget, the one the impacts we already know and the impacts that we think are going forward. So I would recommend you know many times. Sometimes the answers are not that helpful and it's a lot of Jargon and it's a little complicated. But I think this year, the first at least the first half of each of the agency's responses are very specific about Covid-19, and so it does provide some real insight and, and particularly around department of sanitation, was one for sure. Nypd was one as well once I get that in writing, but DOT was today and it was really helpful and the other one I was thinking about was obviously is HPD, because the funding for all of those programs in terms of affordable housing programs have been pushed out. You know a couple different for a couple different budget cycles, so you should have had the link sent to you earlier and but they will be also in obviously in you had them from last month in your budget in your committee packet. But you'll have it again with the most recent editions of the each committee each agency in this upcoming month and then Jessica. Do you want to talk about what the budget task force real quickly was working on in terms of the survey and everything sure, so I think, as maybe, was shared in an earlier communication. The budget task force, in addition to getting the feedback. That, of course, will be prioritized by individual committees, has decided to deploy a survey really as a tool to just get as much kind of in the spirit of the earlier discussion that we make sure that we're getting as much feedback as possible, recognizing that this feedback may be outside of a specific or may be outside, of an influence of a specific budget request, but will allow us to better take the temperature of our constituents to understand the issues that they view. As most concerning during this time, and particularly since we're getting new items, we've asked committees to come up with two to three items that are new and sort of Covid-19 specific again recognizing that these are not things that are going to be acted on right now, but maybe Covid-19 has revealed as issues that need to be addressed in the next budget cycle that this survey information may help us better prioritize that if we, if we feel you know that every you know, I'm sure we'll feel everything's important, but hearing from the community directly may help us better parse that out. So we delores and Alan have generously offered to work on that survey, and I know they've shared over a draft which we'll work through and hope to get out before next week's board meeting. And if you have any questions for your task forces, you know, I guess I would just encourage all of you to continue prioritizing your list and gathering those additional two to three priorities. Jesse anything you'd like to add to that. Oh yeah, so take himself off mute. It was such a. I did. I said it so well too, and I'm going to mess it all up. No, I'm the only to add that we're per Jeffrey's suggestion and actually taking a cue from christine we're, I'm looking to put together a way of for the co- chairs of the co-, chairs and chairs of the committees to submit their revised budget requests online, so it and it would show up as an excel spreadsheet on our end and make it a lot easier for us to do it. So it would be a ranking. It actually would look like a survey and it'd be a ranking of the existing ones from last year, a way of putting in additional ones new ones for this year, including Covid-19 specific in addition and then Cobia specific. So it's still in its you know draft form, but I am working with my extensive I.T committee. I mean my I.T staff of janine and katya to put together something for each of you guys for that will be committee specific, so you'll. It should look exactly sort of almost like what you would see from the Excel spreadsheet, but just through a survey form- and I hope to have that ready sooner than later. Okay does that cover everything Jesse from the district office perspective, so, okay, I have one announcement of kind of a personal nature. As many of you know, Douglas Durst was the CB4 designated representative to the Hudson River Park Trust and he resigned. Gail Brewer has appointed a replacement to be the CB4 Rep to the Hudson River Park Trust, and that is me. That means going forward that I will need to recuse myself from any issue that comes before this board relating to the park, which I'm a little sad about, but I'll have a different voice on what goes on now. So I just wanted to let you all know that, and then we have one other new business item, I'm going to turn the floor over to Mr Lazarin. Okay, just give you a little context. Why we're asking for a vote from exec tonight, two weeks ago, at BLP, this was on our agenda. We had a discussion about the resumption of indoor dining and it turned out that the next day the mayor announced it without us even doing anything. The mayor, the governor, announced indoor dining with a bunch of procedures going forward in our discussions at the committee we included, which is what governor did not have. We had a suggestion about reservations and we also the committee was very thoughtful about employees. Restaurant employees, not every restaurant employee, might be able, for health reasons to go back to work in indoors and as it is now, if someone will call back by their employer and say I can't do it, they will not be eligible to collect unemployment insurance because they were turning down employment. So one of the committee's recommendation- and it's in this letter on indoor dining side- that's some accommodation be made for this exactly what we do not know, but it would be an economic accommodation. Can we change the unemployment laws? Can they do that so quickly? We do not know, but we want that to be take. We want the employees to be taken under consideration. At the same time, we, the committee said: well, you know outdoor dining street dining is supposed to be ending October. Well, why do not we suggest it continues to the end of the year? Well, a couple of days later we come out with these proposals to extend not only through the end of the year, 12 months, a year, permanent outdoor dining permanent street dining. So coming up with this letter, this letter now has two parts: one indoor, dining and one street dining outdoor dining and the reason we're asking for a boat is that some of the implementation of the street dining is going up before the City Council tomorrow. So we would like to have something from us in the hands of our council members tomorrow, just on the street dining some of the things that we incorporated on the street dining year- round, already adopted I'll, remind everyone in July. A number of those items we've already adopted, but we emphasize there should be a safe separation of pedestrians and dining area, clear enforcement, maybe in the future, going forward an evaluation of the whole program right now we need eight feet. We are suggesting maybe 12 feet unobstructed on the sidewalk. This already we've adopted and both indoor and outdoor we're suggesting the possibility of grants loans. However, they want to work it one for the indoor upgrading, the ventilation systems that people need that and for the outdoor Heaters heat lamps, Propane heat lamps that which are used only on the sidewalks would be only on the sidewalk, an electrical on the street to facilitate that this would not be forever, but this would be wall. The emergency is proceeding no music on the outdoors and looking towards the future. Two big items, one and this I'll remind everyone we adopted in July in a letter from the transportation committee that in the future, even though it's outdoor is both street, you know the lane that first lane in the in the street or the sidewalk can have both currently we're suggesting as we go along into the future, and the emergency is over, it's one or the other, and our preference and we've already adopted this. Our preference is for this sidewalk dining and that the street that first lane in the street be used for pedestrians. Also in the future going forward not now because permitting would be free with the DOT, but in the future, whenever that may be a good look at an appropriate revenue generation. Some money coming from this, because this is the use of public space, and there should be some money generated on that. This is all detailed in the letter. As I said the letter initially, our thought was: we have time to put this out and then we found out well we're having into a dining beginning tomorrow and outdoor dining. As I said, the City Council is having legislation tomorrow. Frank help write the letter and so did christine if they want to add anything, and if anybody has questions, frank or christine first, I do have a my hand raised there. I know I understand but frank as co- authors, I'm letting Frank Christine. They want to add anything. First, I think Bert covered everything from my perspective right christine did you want to add anything. I think we added a bird said that, but we added a concept of saying you know in the future. We need to be mindful that the transportation may I mean the mission of transportation for the sidewalk and the parking lane etc needs to be preemptive over the dining and therefore there should be some. You know claws into that law to help that happening. Okay, Mike, noble yeah, the the letter is in some parts I guess redundant right yeah, so I think we can reduce a lot of the wording here. Just address. What's got to be addressed tomorrow, you know all of it. Why go through this whole thing? People are not going to read at all. Let's just get to the end. You know we want the unemployment thing taken care of when people get some help with the with the propane heating and all that sort of thing, and you know other things with respect to the outdoor stuff. But you know it's long. The letter is long. It's too long. My comment right Bert did you want to respond to that? Or should I just move on? We thank you Mike. We struggled we struggled because it evolved the letter evolved and we're covering two issues: indoor dining and outdoor dining. Too long, I do not think it's too long, because the cover is what we wanted and we tried to do it and I think we were successful in a fairly logical one upon the other upon the other, and if people can't read sorry about that. Well, if we're going to fix this letter, let's ask the person who's up next Betty, Mcintosh, Jd and Dale. I do see your hands, I'm kind of running down the order I will get to you guys go ahead Betty. When I raised my blue hand, I was not thinking of editing but to follow up on Mike Noble's comment. You might put some bullets in the first pair right after the first paragraph, with the main things about keep it permanent help out the employees who may not want to go indoors, the propane, etc. You might just do some quick that way. The city council, people who do not have a lot of time to read it might just get those points, but that is not what I wanted to ask. I online 27 and 28. I totally hate the idea of seating by reservation only because well I love what this has done for Chelsea all these outdoor places with their colorful umbrellas, and I like looking at them and I like making a decision with a friend where we're going to eat based on how it looks and are the people far enough from each other and all that sort of thing. So I really would like you to delete Community Board force strongly suggests seating by reservation. Only the reserve, the reservation only is for indoor, not the outdoor. Oh, I misunderstood that. We suggested that as a way of control. Okay, I understand that sorry at all, okay, my other, my other two thoughts were who enforces and could this letter go to the hospitality organization either sent directly or copied and if there's any other restaurant organization, I think that should be involved and it's I've seen some things where it's not exactly proper and on the outdoor dining, and I was wondering who enforces this: it's enforced by DOT, so you're supposed to file a 3-, 1- 1, and then it goes to D-, O- T. Oh, has anyone ever done that I think the board has raised some issues with duty and but directly, so you can do the same thing as you do with the board with other issues with 3- 1- 1, and then you send it to. You know the board office and there is a follow- up. Yeah, for example, the waiter or the or waitresses are not wearing masks, for instance, when they should be that kind of thing anyway. Okay, I think that's enough from me: Betty Jd, yeah, good job Burt, just three quick questions is this letter coming out of the committee, but they did not have time to vote on it. The letter was coming at coming at it and it was going to go to the full board, but because the City Council is meeting tomorrow, we want you to come to exec first, so we would send it out with an exact vote. Thank you, Bart, two quick questions. I misunderstood about the recommendation for eight feet or maybe 12 feet up on Eighth Avenue, Ninth, Avenue, tenth Avenue. You can not. If you have two feet, you're lucky well, 12 feet would work and is the suggestion that people go out onto the street to certain ambulate was that the suggestion want me to take that part yeah. So we voted on that in July and the idea is to say you know. Eight feet is not good enough. We know that and we want more and we said 12 feet as a as a reference. If you have 12 feet minus the tree, it gives you eight feet and then in discussing with the hospitality you say it would be easier if the dining was either all on the sidewalk or all on the on the parking lane right. But in some cases the parking lane is on the other side of the bike lane. So the hospitality was saying you know we would rather be on the sidewalk and then get sidewalk extension like we have seen on 8th avenue and we have a big sidewalk extension on in the street, and so, if the hospitalities using the sidewalk, then there would be a sidewalk extension which could be very big and very free, completely free. So that's the idea, thanks christine anything else, jd, I'm opposed to taking the sidewalk. I really feel that's something we need to be careful about, but nothing else thanks all right, dale, thanks for this letter and for the input we, you know, we had the opportunity to provide some input. I just I do not know if this is really this. If there's space in this letter for this, like if it's part of this, but it's this is kind of a lament for the fact that we are going to be like restaurant. The restaurant industry is going to be on mass heating outdoor space with propane devices. It seems like an environment, a small scale, environmental catastrophe. To me, it also seems like there might be some safety issues. I mean I do not know how to address that, or you know reconcile that except to say, like maybe we can even talk to like the city, like a city agency like the EDC or even the restaurant association, to find like a less you know, a less a solution with less negative impacts than running propane heaters outdoors in the winter months on Mass Jesse very quickly. Nypd does not allow propane at all. It's going to be it's going to be electric most likely, maybe some other form of that. But it's going to be that this came up at borough service cabinet. Just so you know- and you know, Gail is trying very hard to get all of the agencies coordinated on this, because they know it restaurants going to be sent in every direction and getting having to jump through so many different hoops to try to figure this out and there needs to be a coordinated response. So I'll just leave it there. There is not one also. I just want to say in terms of supply. There are very few propane heaters around people. Sorry I thought there was language specific to propane in the maybe it just came up in the discussion in the law. First of all, the propane is already approved to go inside our cafe, but the installation is pretty complex, including the fire department, so that whole, if that whole process turns out and Bert, is right as far as supply. I do not think I think it's going to be naturally self- limiting understood. Okay, thanks for clarifying all right. Thank you, Dale Alan. Thank you. I think the length of the letter is fine. I was going to speak on this propane business myself, but I was just curious since it's already been mentioned, and perhaps it could be in a letter about our wish to not have propane. Why would propane be okay? If you know why would propane be okay on the sidewalk and electric out on the street? Is it just a matter of the set how easy it is to set up electric at on the street, and why would not they just say you know electric both places, I think part of the reason is, and then we did not mention this in the letter. Is that some of the proponents of the street dining, not the sidewalk, dining the street dining are talking about the possibility of tents. Hence do not ask me the material that the tents are made out of, but tense and there's a you know. It's like how many angels dance on a pin. If the tent is open on two sides, it's still considered outdoor dining and they want the electric inside the tents. I guess it's a fire issue there, maybe it's easier, but if the, if the tent is almost completely closed and it's going to be considered indoor dining, it gets a little crazy if a wind come the wind comes by and closes the flaps on the tent. I do not know what happens then, but I think that's the reason, alan. If they're thinking ahead in terms of tense and just would not go in a tent okay, I think it's a great letter definitely plan to support it. One suggestion sort of circling back to what Dale was bringing up and connected to what Allen had a question about as well. Would it be possible to include some language around studying or quantifying the environmental impact of adding outdoor heaters and circling back to what guidance the city will provide in the future? I bring this up because, as a city like we are late to this party of outdoor heating and restaurants and cafes, you know it's existed around the world in lots of places for a very long time and places like Paris have actually gotten to the point where they were going to get rid of outdoor heaters because of the environmental concerns. They pause that due to the pandemic, and I think we absolutely need to support restaurants, make outdoor dining possible this year. But I worry about a world where it's made possible in perpetuity, without even a plan, to understand, what's the environmental impact in the long term. As a matter of fact, I'm sorry go ahead. Okay, as a matter of fact, Betty is telling me we have the word propane somewhere in the letter on line nine on page two, and we should probably remove that. Okay and then bird. Are you willing to take kids suggestion as a friendly amendment that they study the impact? I find it very friendly? Yes, okay, Jessica yeah! Thank you, I'm just. I recognize this is not a concrete comment, but I am struggling just recognizing that the city's at 18 unemployment, that this is primarily among restaurant workers and gig economy. Half of our vacancies are former restaurants. I hear these concerns and yet I know that, like I mean you guys know, I work in emergency. Food like this is where people are really running like. If we do not do something more to help this industry, not only will there be more people who need our support and the city services, but that you know the city is the less compelling place to be. Quite frankly- and I know you acknowledge that in the letter- but I am just struggling with the absolute nature of like no music- no, you know this when I think we have to continue to be flexible or this city is really going to struggle, and I know that's hard to do in one letter, but I am I'm just feeling like. I do not feel like the assurance that we need to provide some commitment to our restaurants, and I do not know that I feel like that's there just because some of that is the evolving nature of the letter. The reason BLP came up with the letter in the first place was to support restaurants and urge inside dining and extending outdoor dining, and that was Bert's first draft of the letter and as the city sort of caught up with us and agreed outdoor dining and agreed to indoor dining, we sort of added more and more restrictions, but so the balance may have gotten off a little, but the original intention was clearly to urge indoor dining to go forward for just the reasons you said, it is helpful to hear that Frank, because I think in reading the letter their times are different voices, and I get you know writing by committee, but it feels like that theme is high at the beginning and maybe less so further down. I think we can smooth that out, but literally we trade emails with every announcement, saying: oh the letter's, going to change again as recently as I think yesterday sure I think I think to explain you. I think you're 100 right and the problem we have is that the law that is being proposed right now is being proposed in the context of Covid-19, but to survive. Covid-19 and that's a problem because you know there are a lot of things. We want to do as part of kovi to help the recovery. But then, when we are after kovi, then we are in the long term. Some of those things should be really addressed differently. So I think what we may want to do, or to separate that saying. You know during coffee, blah and then after Covid-19 blah, because I think that's really where the letter is getting a little schizophrenic. In a sense, though, I would also just add that the recovery is this is a many year recovery and so some of the things about the definition of what is indoor and outdoor and how many sides a tent needs to have to be categorized as one versus another is much more around keeping us all safe and not about the economic recovery. But the economic impact of Covid-19 is going to be felt for years and so making sure that restaurants can recoup the the income that they've lost over the last seven months and going forward is also something to be balanced, but I appreciate that you all will think of that and if that can somehow be smoothed in the letter, or I also think that bullet points might actually help help smooth that out, but I would feel most comfortable if that can be. If our support for the restaurant industry can be even more emphatic all right, anyone else I'll entertain a motion kahoocho. I move to adopt a letter with the changes jd seconds it all those in favor say aye all right. Anyone opposed may not be our first. Anyone opposed present not eligible abstentions. That passes. I will entertain a motion to a adjourn, see y' all thanks for coming. Okay, bye, guys, bye, everybody Brian all right. He left okay, good night Jesse. You.
