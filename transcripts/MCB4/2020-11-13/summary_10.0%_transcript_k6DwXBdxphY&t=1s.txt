Sure we'll hear from you a little bit later, but with that I'd like to pass it over to madeline at the Hudson River Park Trust.
So before we get started, I'm going to call on our chair, commissioner sagos to say a few words great thanks, Madeline Jeffrey, Lowell Martin and everybody on CB4.
That's really the question today, we'll get into this great presentation, see some of what the team has been working on, which is I, think very exciting, but, as also importantly, you'll, see that they're very the uses are very interim in nature.
I know from speaking with many of you, so we're looking forward to working with CB4 on this great partners already and certainly great partners all across the board, with the Park trust.
As, you know, the Hudson River Park Act was amended in 2013, and in that amendment it was made clear that the city had to use best efforts to relocate the tow pound off of pier 76 and that it would be at least 50 recreation and.
What has changed this year is that in the budget bill in April, 1 2020, the New York state Legislature had passed a bill and the governor signed it, which said that New York City had to cease using pier 76 for tow pound or pay the park.
This budget bill has enabled us to really think about not just the long-term plan for pier 76, because, as you know, from going down the road with us on Pier 57, with all you know, with all the process that takes place and the planning and euler and the eis.
Some wonderful, uses, that the park has done on an interim basis that you've all come to know and love in the past, and we could again start using the pier for these interviews.
We have spent the better part of the last year with the task force, thinking about the long-term plan, at least in concept, and this has nothing to do with planning the peer without community Board, for this is just a concept of how we might be able to move forward.
Next now, I'm, going to hand it over to Carl Weisbrod, who will talk about the park and its future funding gap thanks, madeline first.
The task force was really looking at how to how to get to the point of a stabilized park that maintains the quality that we've seen in the park so far, most recently on pier 26, and in order to do that, we really need to ramp up, in the long run, new annual revenues to fund capital maintenance, not to fund the finalization of the park and the build out of the park, but to maintain it in a high quality.
But what we wanted to do was look at a whole range of potential revenue, sources, starting from the most public to the most private, which is ultimately piers, 40 and 76.
All of these are potential sources, but the goal we always knew was: How do we try to maximize the open space on piers, 40 and 76, recognizing that we're going to need some development and revenues from them in the in the long range.
Next, and so this is just meant to acknowledge that long-term planning and that option actually either of the options, would require legislative changes and that would include you know a series of different things, including potentially even a sort of physical swap of a portion of the pier to the south, to the north.
We do not know how long that will take long-term development of the pier that will require an RFP process, environmental and regulatory approvals, repairs of the peers, design, construction.
If we can put an interim public open space on pier 76, we can span this period of uncertainty and the period of even moving toward permanent development of the peer and permanent use of the peer to bring the peer into some public use in the immediate term, and with that, I will turn it back.
So I do not need to really tell anyone who's part of Community board 4, but I think that one of the reasons you know with the focus on Pier 76, outside of the fact, of course, of this immediate opportunity with the potential relocation of the towpound, is also just that community board.
Those two things, along with a desire that we heard loud and clear that the sort of interim uses be intentionally interim to ensure both that the long-term planning of the park would happen, but also just given funding, etc, and so.
You know all sorts of things like that, just public access and being able to sort of go out on the pier in a big space like this, especially during a time like this is incredible and the upper images from a project that we worked on in Seattle, where you can sort of see this idea of just a very minimal pier.
It's sort of a you know, blank slate for many different types of activities and events to happen, there's also some really interesting opportunities for art, community-based art, as well as potentially public art.
These are other activities that are a bit more active things like potentially Roller rinks or dance floors, learning to bike, which is something that Hudson river park has done, where you can sort of do that.
Next, and also things that are a little bit, you know more geared towards specific, whether it's children's and education and kind of play just sort of relaxation, or even things like outdoor fitness.
It gives you lots of opportunities to do lots on you know what would be a kind of resurfaced, pier next, so we wanted to just share a couple sort of quick ideas and put some things out there really also for scale.
These are all just pavement, markings, furnishing Et, cetera and then on the end, an idea for a kind of dance floor and or roller rink, and so the idea here is that you know multiple different types of activities could coexist just given the scale and the magnitude of the pier and that they actually could be interchangeable in many ways, with a sort of relatively flexible surface next, and that any of these scenarios could also be you know the seating or things could be folded and put away and could actually be.
You're, seeing a kind of community art display maker space, with a series of tents and potentially different types of you, know, displays that could be changed throughout the year.
It's showing a beer garden in the middle, which could be a really incredible kind of place to sort of take in the Hudson river, as well as the views and, at the end, a kind of more passive relaxation zone where you could sort of have hammocks and lounge cafe, tables and chairs, etc, and potentially even a space for some of the education and public programming that Hudson river park does along the estuary as well as with children.
Actually, where you can see the statue of liberty next so I think just as a way to sort of prompt a conversation, and we wanted to kind of put a couple of different bubbles up.
I think we wanted to hear both any concerns about particular interim uses and or ones that this community in particular feel like would really benefit the people, and you know, I, think that one of the things that is really exciting about this opportunity.
You know permanent park planning process, which we have a great relationship working with the trust on getting pierce, pier 97.
The trust has done this sort of interim use before they did it very successfully at pier 26 before that was converted over at pier 54 when it still existed, and at our own, pier 97, where we've held events, pride events, the blues and Barbecue festival, other things that the trust does on an ongoing basis, because we are hopeful that construction is going to start on pier 97 soon sooner rather than later.
You know coming in to build pier 76, which would have to be funded by the commercial uses.
You know, there's a reason that it would require a change to the law that created the Hudson river park, the original act, and that is because the idea of the park that it was that it would be about open space if I may David pierce 76 has always been identified as a commercial revenue generating peer, and while the original sentiment was that no more than 50 of the pier would be occupied by development.
Fifty percent of that huge peer that you could cover with say an outdoor food court or with I, do not know any kind of commercial purpose that is not as uninviting to the public as a hermetic office building and use this as a time to test out what might work and still not do something.
The interim uses are going to be on a pier that already needs work in order to keep it to keep it in play, and the whole.
Please remember that this peer is really very large and the kind of the kind of open space, and on this pier it would be one of the largest pieces of park in Hudson river park.
We have not quite gotten to the end of that conversation, but where what we really want to do is focus on what uses you would like to see on this pier.
I think, as the commissioner just said, that it seems very much so that the governor wants this to move along quite quickly and that that their conversation is going on in the chamber about this.
The intention here is to have this move as quickly as humanly possible, good yeah, and just ask that if I can jeffrey right, the intent really is to get the shed down and bring the community board bring the park open space as quickly as possible.
I think we can all agree that it's better to have it down in the interim rather than up if the ultimate goal is to get people outside breathing fresh air moving around a little bit and ultimately getting excited about it and behind a long-term transformational, vision.
So the state has already committed to funding for pier 97, and we just want to know what the timeline is for that.
Can, you put some sort of videographic stuff down under the water, so you can see it above the water, a whole lot of stuff that goes into doing the Marine Museum, and that is an interim use, but I also thought and here's where I'm crossing the line, sorry that it might be a long-term use of the pier if there is funding for a marine museum of some kind.
You, know brisk business during normal times, but something along those lines, I think, would be a great use of the park.
I'm also incredibly excited to hear other members of this committee after me, bringing it up two months ago about public use of park space to support our independent theaters.
Some, very good ideas coming out tonight and going down the road but down the road, as we think about what specifics we put in as interims.
Allen right, okay, madeline I was just going to reiterate what I had said before about the peers, long-term viability, and so it you know, I, think we could get quite a few years out of it.
Think of you know going eastward to times Square, but you know I'm wondering if the pier could have you know more of a West side feel, and you know, support local businesses for the concessions.
The I wanted to ask of Carl just a couple of questions about the long-term plan, which I know is not the focus of tonight.
We think there will be it for sure, a need for long-term revenue on pier 76.
Pre-Pandemic and the economics are certainly right now in flux, but the goal has always been from the task force perspective to try to find as many alternative uses as possible, alternative income sources as possible, so that we can maximize the open space on Pier, 76 and minimize.
The only conclusion we really can make right now is that in the long term, when the park is built out and stabilized, we will as much as we can maximize alternative revenue sources, we're going to need permanent, revenue, ongoing, stable revenue from Pier, 76 and Pier 40.
But we've had a lot of political concerns in the development at pier 40, and so one concern I would have for the interim use is essentially what Jeffrey said before, which is you do not want to become too beloved once you put it down.
We can have a discussion moving forward about how that what that looks like what kind of uses can reap enough money on the smallest footprint versus taking up more park, space.
I, know how much you like that beer garden right, not just a dog, not just a dog park, but a beer garden with a sort of.
I really just wanted to sort of like be on the record to say that I think moving forward with an interim plan is really great and maybe somewhat related to the beer.
I think this is extremely exciting that we are entertaining a public use of pier 76, tonight, interim or otherwise, and the options are great.
