Okay, great good evening, everybody, my name, is Jeffrey Le Francois I am the co-chair of the Waterfront parks and Environment Community Committee of Community Board for welcome, thanks for being here tonight, I'm joined by my co-chair marty decat, who is somewhere on one of the squares and, as we've been through this routine before we are holding this meeting under the governor's executive order, 202.1 as it relates to holding public meetings via the azume, we are we'll be running through the presentation this evening. There will be questions and comments from the committee. After that we will take questions and comments from the public and we'll bring it back to committee for further discussion and take it from there. Like I, said I know we have Quorum. We've got a quite a good attendance this evening, and so we'll take this, as we always do asking folks to please use the raised hand function. This gives janine the opportunity to bring the public over when the time comes, and for us to make sure that we have a efficient and respectful conversation. We have a number of guests with us this evening for the presentation regarding pier 76 that the trust is going to give us, but I want to recognize commissioner Basil sagos and Commissioner Eric Coolestade for joining us tonight. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here. I'm sure we'll hear from you a little bit later, but with that I'd like to pass it over to madeline at the Hudson River Park Trust. Thank you Jeffrey. So I was going to introduce the team here and, of course we have our chair, commissioner, sagos and also another board member of the trust commissioner kulasay from the office of Parks recreation and historic preservation, and we are also joined by Lisa Switkin and James Tanihaus from James Corner Field Operations James Cornyfield operations has been working with us and the task force for the for the year working on the project that the governor had given us, which we'll get into in a few moments. So I think this is the first time you're meeting them. Lisa is also the lead designer on gansevoort peninsula and that's how she's with us tonight and during this year of task force meetings. We're also joined by someone I hardly have to introduce call Weisbrod from Hrna and Tina Peparelli, who have also worked with us on different financing options for the park and during the task force we'll review some of this today, but before we start and who's running the presentation tonight, janine will drive so they'll just say for her to advance it. Okay, wonderful! So before we get started, I'm going to call on our chair, commissioner sagos to say a few words great thanks, Madeline Jeffrey, Lowell Martin and everybody on CB4. It's great to see you all, so you all said it right in the beginning. This is a meeting about pier 76. Just a few comments up front. As you all know, we are totally committed to the long term of pier 76, it's ultimate and hopefully perfect, build out and doing so in very close conjunction with with CB4 on a really exhaustive design process recognizing that will take a long time. So the focus now is really on the immediate term. As you know, the law that the legislature and the governor put in place this spring requires the city to vacate the tow pound by the end of this year. So this the state would get possession on the first of January. So we're proceeding along that track right now and the question then is raised: what can we do in the interim once we tear the toe pound down the shed itself? What interim uses can we put in place immediately upon removing the shed? That would create that? You know that sort of that blank slate, if you will so that, once the more exhaustive planning process takes place for the long term, what can be done for the short term to bring much needed open space to CB4? So that's really the question today, we'll get into this great presentation, see some of what the team has been working on, which is I, think very exciting, but, as also importantly, you'll see that they're very the uses are very interim in nature and that's a very important thing. I know from speaking with many of you, so we're looking forward to working with CB4 on this great partners already and certainly great partners all across the board, with the Park trust. So thank you all and look forward to seeing the slides. Thank you, commissioner. So janine. If you're ready, we can get started. Thank you next. So this is the agenda for tonight next and if I have not thanked you already. Thank you all for being here. As you know, the Hudson River Park Act was amended in 2013, and in that amendment it was made clear that the city had to use best efforts to relocate the tow pound off of pier 76 and that it would be at least 50 recreation and the balance of it would be used for par commercial uses so that the trust could continue to maintain and operate the park at the level that you've all come to expect it next. What has changed this year is that in the budget bill in April, 1 2020, the New York state Legislature had passed a bill and the governor signed it, which said that New York City had to cease using pier 76 for tow pound or pay the park 12 million dollars by the end of this year, starting February 1. They were to pay the park three million a month for using pier 76 as a tow pound and that they could have their fees waived if they showed evidence of an effort to relocate the toe pound next. So that has this budget. As commissioner sagos has said, this budget bill has enabled us to really think about not just the long-term plan for pier 76, because, as you know, from going down the road with us on Pier 57 with all you know, with all the process that takes place and the planning and euler and the eis, it takes a very long time to get to a permanent project. However, if it won the tow pound leaves, we do have this wonderful, almost six acre site that is needed and wanted by the community, and we could have- and you all know, some wonderful uses- that the park has done on an interim basis that you've all come to know and love in the past, and we could again start using the pier for these interviews very quickly. However, we do want to say that we are very cognizant that what the community wants is a long-term plan. We have spent the better part of the last year with the task force, thinking about the long-term plan, at least in concept, and this has nothing to do with planning the peer without community Board, for this is just a concept of how we might be able to move forward next. The assignment that the governor gave us was to both figure out how to get the maximum amount of open space on both piers 40 and 76, and to reach a consensus also about how we could get there. How we can raise enough revenue from these two peers as well, to help operate the park and to give the governor these recommendations by May 1, obviously because of Covid-19 we never got to formal recommendations and that was put on hold next. We wanted you to get a look at who was on this task force I, believe we had six meetings of the task force since January and, as you can see, your board is well represented, as well as your elected officials. Next now, I'm going to hand it over to Carl Weisbrod, who will talk about the park and its future funding gap thanks madeline first, it's I'm happy to be back before Community board. Four again, it's been quite a while and particularly happy to be back on an issue regarding Hudson River park and as Commissioner Sago said, the focus tonight is really on the short term here. But, as madeleine said, we should also bear in mind the long term and, as she indicated, the task force was really looking at how to how to get to the point of a stabilized park that maintains the quality that we've seen in the park so far, most recently on pier 26, and in order to do that, we really need to ramp up, in the long run, new annual revenues to fund capital maintenance, not to fund the finalization of the park and the build out of the park, but to maintain it in a high quality fashion. Once it is built out and as it is built out, and unless there are additional resources over time, we won't be able to do that and we'll see essential capital maintenance deferred and a reduction in operations and services. So the ground rents for to Hrpt for this redevelopment really will require in the long run, revenues from pier 40 and pier 76. They are the most reliable revenue sources and they are probably they are in fact essential to help close the gap. That's going to be needed to maintain the park please, but what we wanted to do was look at a whole range of potential revenue sources, starting from the most public to the most private, which is ultimately piers, 40 and 76 producing some revenues. We looked at what other tax revenues we could get. What other city and state grants might potentially be available. We looked at a park, improvement district. We looked at the sale of air rights in the park as the park did so successfully on pier 40 new park concessions in park revenues that could be boosted sponsorships private fundraising. All of these are potential sources, but the goal we always knew was: how do we try to maximize the open space on piers, 40 and 76, recognizing that we're going to need some development and revenues from them in the in the long range? And next I will turn this back over to who madeline Lisa? Yes, thanks Carl and thanks Madeline and hello, everybody at CB4, so I just wanted to take you through some of the work that was done towards the long-term planning that we had talked about at the beginning, which was the goal of the task force to begin with, and this is just for context. Many of you are probably familiar, of course, with the site, but note the sort of scale of the period is. It is very large and the relative heights of the sort of surrounding context, so you can see the 110 feet as well as the 150 foot height for the sort of top of the Javits Crystal palace that you see in the in the back of the image. Next. So as part of the work on the task force, we sort of came to two different scenarios, and these were really not meant to be the only options. They were rather meant to sort of look at two alternative ways to achieve those primary goals of both financial sustainability for Hudson river park, as well as the maximized open space and the image to the left really showed what the act required. That sort of minimal 50, open space, recreational condition and the image to the right was an alternative, and this idea consolidated the development to the north, where you have the more commercial uses and therefore allocating much more open space. I think this was close to 80 percent overall and also a much more visible and inviting entry so that when you actually came to the site, it would be a sort of very clear signal that this was open and public and a lot of the feedback really gravitated toward towards that second option. Next, and so this is just meant to acknowledge that long-term planning and that option actually either of the options, would require legislative changes and that would include you know a series of different things, including potentially even a sort of physical swap of a portion of the pier to the south to the north. In order to allow for that consolidated development to the north. Next Carl back to you yeah. So as we all knew well before we finished our final report due at the beginning of May Covid-19 hit, and that has changed the immediate term economics of how we can, in the long term, stabilize the park and stabilize the park's revenues and get the revenues we need for long-term high quality maintenance of the park, and so we do not know. Obviously, at this point exactly how and when the economy is going to recover, how fast it's going to recover. We still are optimistic about the various different revenue sources we presented in March and February as long-term options, but in the short term, we really have begun as again as the commissioner said and as Madeleine said, to shift our immediate focus to your 76 and see what could possibly happen in the short term. Please and the long-term timeline clearly is the long. The long-term timeline is clearly an economic recovery. We do not know how long that will take long-term development of the pier that will require an RFP process, environmental and regulatory approvals, repairs of the peers, design construction. This process again, we can't put an absolute time frame on it, but let's face it is going to be a while, and even though that is the long-term goal we wanted to see what could possibly happen in the shorter term, assuming the toe pounds leaves. So if we can put an interim public open space on pier 76, we can span this period of uncertainty and the period of even moving toward permanent development of the peer and permanent use of the peer to bring the peer into some public use in the immediate term, and with that, I will turn it back. At least that's the concept, and we think it's a good concept and with that I will turn it back to you lisa great thanks. You can go to the so I do not need to really tell anyone who's part of Community board 4, but I think that one of the reasons you know with the focus on Pier 76, outside of the fact, of course, of this immediate opportunity with the potential relocation of the towpound is also just that community board. 4 really has a dearth and lack of open space. This is showing the rings on this. Drawing shows a five minute: walk a 10-minute walk a 15-minute walk, and you know the sort of need here, as you well know, is incredible, and so it provides a real, a real opportunity in that context, even more so next. So a couple different assumptions just for the interim use, obviously that this requires, first and foremost the relocation of the toe pound by the city, as well as the demolition of the building. And then you know this moment really allows for a great opportunity to allow access to happen sooner rather than later, and but that this all is sort of based on two primary assumptions. One is that there is a sort of limited load capacity, so the existing structure, you know, really can support asphalt. Temporary lighting seeding surface improvements, things like that, we're not talking about large quantities of soils, trees, etc and two that there will be an overall limited lifespan depending on the marine border, destruction, which is really what happens to the piles as they sort of get invaded and over time can erode, and so those two things, along with a desire that we heard loud and clear that the sort of interim uses be intentionally interim to ensure both that the long-term planning of the park would happen, but also just given funding, etc, and so those three things have really helped to kind of. You know frame the different uses that we're going to put forward tonight for discussion, and hopefully for you to add to next, so we wanted to share just a couple. Hopefully inspirational images. You know the ones on this page. Three of them are actually here at Hudson River park, as madeleine alluded to there's been a number of really successful interim uses that have already happened. The idea of having things like outdoor dancing, food, festivals, food and wine. You know all sorts of things like that: just public access and being able to sort of go out on the pier in a big space like this, especially during a time like this is incredible and the upper images from a project that we worked on in Seattle, where you can sort of see this idea of just a very minimal pier, it's sort of a you know, blank slate for many different types of activities and events to happen, there's also some really interesting opportunities for art, community-based art, as well as potentially public art. You know these are just some ideas again working within the sort of limited load capacities, Et cetera, but that can really enliven the space and also provide great inspiration and activation next. These are other activities that are a bit more active things like potentially Roller rinks or dance floors, learning to bike, which is something that Hudson river park has done, where you can sort of do that in a safe environment, different types of sort of food and beverage sitting, hanging out, etc. Next, and also things that are a little bit, you know more geared towards specific, whether it's children's and education and kind of play just sort of relaxation or even things like outdoor fitness. So again, these are sort of just meant, as both prompts and inspiration. You can go to the that's fine. So just a reminder. Looking at the pier it's about 725 feet, long and 300 feet wide, so that's actually more than your sort of standard, Typical, New, York, City block quite large, which again is a good thing. It gives you lots of opportunities to do lots on you know what would be a kind of resurfaced pier next, so we wanted to just share a couple sort of quick ideas and put some things out there really also for scale. So you could start to see like what these types of activities could actually look like what you're seeing to the north. The sort of t that's on the north side is an outdoor gym on the south side is some sort of a series of tents and or picnic tables in the middle there's, a kind of more passive zone as well as we show a couple of different lanes, for example, for learning to bike. These are all just pavement, markings furnishing Et, cetera and then on the end, an idea for a kind of dance floor and or roller rink, and so the idea here is that you know multiple different types of activities could coexist just given the scale and the magnitude of the pier and that they actually could be interchangeable in many ways with a sort of relatively flexible surface next, and that any of these scenarios could also be you know the seating or things could be folded and put away and could actually be. The same surface could be used for a large scale event, whether it would be a pride celebration or a concert series or an outdoor movie or a food festival, etc. So it's not predicated on the fact that you know any of these scenarios would not prohibit you from actually doing potentially a series of large scale. Events on the pier as well next and then again, we just wanted to put out something else. It's not like these are meant to be final designs in any way, so just to again give you a sense of skill or a different way that the pier could be potentially configured to the north here you're, seeing a kind of community art display maker space with a series of tents and potentially different types of you know, displays that could be changed throughout the year. There's a series of these sort of pods that are showing children's play so sort of kid zones where you could have markings on the ground or different types of movable seats, maybe even a sand table. You know things like that. It's showing a beer garden in the middle, which could be a really incredible kind of place to sort of take in the Hudson river, as well as the views and, at the end, a kind of more passive relaxation zone where you could sort of have hammocks and lounge cafe, tables and chairs, etc, and potentially even a space for some of the education and public programming that Hudson river park does along the estuary as well as with children. Next and then, once again, the idea is that- and you know this type, any sort of format that would happen would not prohibit a larger scale event. You know throughout the year if there was a calendar of events that could happen next, so these are just some fun I hope, inspiring renderings to sort of show that the kind of liveliness and excitement of the pier and the scale of it could be really great. This is that first scenario shown actually we included a kind of running track around the edge of the pier at different modes and just for context that track I, think I calculated and it's about 534 meters. So 400 meters is a sort of standard track. If you just do the three edges, so you know that's close to you know almost a half a mile, so that's pretty great and you can see like passive zones as well as the idea of the dance floor, roller rink on the end, and these are kind of just delineated, based on pretty simple pavement markings and different types of furnishings, etc. We're also showing temporary lighting along the edge solar lighting as well, next and again, the second scenario again showing the kind of beer garden in the middle, the kid zones at the end and the kind of more passive area towards the end of the pier, where you really get the sweeping views all the way. Actually, where you can see the statue of liberty next so I think just as a way to sort of prompt a conversation, and we wanted to kind of put a couple of different bubbles up here, this tonight's really about a kind of deeper dive into potential programming opportunities for interim use, and we kind of thought that there are these different general sort of ways that you could think about programming, whether it's education or food or relaxation or more active uses, sort of creative zones, potential pop-ups, as well as family activities, and we just tried to sort things in that way. And of course, there are probably others as well as a number of things that you know maybe are intentionally left off this list right. So I think we wanted to hear both any concerns about particular interim uses and or ones that this community in particular feel like would really benefit the people, and you know, I, think that one of the things that is really exciting about this opportunity is, of course, not only to provide access soon and use soon, but also that it really have a high impact. And so that's sort of some of the ultimate goals of what we're hoping that this can achieve so again, I'll turn it back to you jeffrey you're, an amazing mc and I'll. Let you figure out how you want to start and initiate the conversation sure thank you for this Carl Madeline. Thank you for walking us through this and getting us to where we are I. Think everybody will say that we are really excited, but I do just want to frame the conversation before I hand it to lowell our board chair to say a few things. Also. We love that the idea of interim is on the table to create this public space, but we are very cognizant of the fact that we do not want the interim to be too loved and to be too good, because we do not want it to become something that we can't make better through that permanent pro. You know permanent park planning process which we have a great relationship working with the trust on getting pierce, pier 97. You know in the scope of our future, and so that's a big part of what we're sort of thinking through and certainly I, think that came across in our competitions at the task force as well. Lisa I noticed a lot of rainbows, so thank you for that, and so with that, I want to pass it over to lowell for a couple of comments before we begin to go to the committee committee members, if you have comments, you can start by raising your hand and I will take them in order Lowell. Thank you. Jeffrey I want to just point out I. Think most of you who are here know this I am both the chair of Manhattan community board for and a member of the board of the Hudson River park. Trust I am here tonight in my capacity as board chair, so I am not speaking on behalf of the trust. I am speaking on behalf of the community board. The trust has done this sort of interim use before they did it very successfully at pier 26 before that was converted over at pier 54 when it still existed and at our own, pier 97, where we've held events, pride events, the blues and Barbecue festival, other things that the trust does on an ongoing basis, because we are hopeful that construction is going to start on pier 97 soon sooner rather than later. We that's not going to be available for those type of events. So that's the kind of thing we were thinking about to move to pier 76. I'm also going to address a question and get this out of the way before anyone asks. Okay before anyone says, when is the toe pound going to move? We are working on it on a parallel track. We have been meeting with the city regularly about this. We expect that the NYPD will be coming to the Clinton health kitchen land use meeting in December to talk about some possible locations to move the towpound to, but that's the extent of what we've got right now. So it's really beyond the scope of tonight's meeting. So I hope I've answered that question for everyone in advance and we do not have to worry about. When is the toe pound moving we're trying to look ahead here is to what can we do with not out a lot of money? You know coming in to build pier 76, which would have to be funded by the commercial uses. In all likelihood. What can we do now to give something back to the community that has waited over 20 years for pier 76 to become a park thanks, Jeffrey Thanks, Lovell, David, hi yeah thanks, you know regarding the office building option that was presented. I hope, that's not entirely serious. It's antithetical to the open space that parks are all about. No one would ever propose putting an office building in central park. You know there's a reason that it would require a change to the law that created the Hudson river park, the original act, and that is because the idea of the park that it was that it would be about open space if I may David pierce 76 has always been identified as a commercial revenue generating peer, and while the original sentiment was that no more than 50 of the pier would be occupied by development, the point of that was to be to offset to pay for the open space and provide a revenue stream for the park. I think the distinction, the distinction that I'm making is, does not have to do with commercial space versus open space. It's office, space versus other commercial space. So if you look at bryant park, which I understand has not taken public money since 1997, they do that by virtue of having a restaurant and lots of individual little concessions. Food venues even advertising on canopies for the food carts to me. That's something that draws people into the park and allows them to enjoy the open space. It's closer to the open space ideal of a city park than an office building which is enclosed, massive space. It's what Midtown is made of, not what parks are made of David again just on the parallel there bryant park also has a business proven district with a with a guaranteed assessment, I think of close to 15 million dollars a year. So the struggle is, we do not have guaranteed revenue streams for Hudson River park, Pier 40, pier 76, a couple of the other smaller commercial revenue generating peers exist, but this is sort of boards for board force shot in the arm. If you will lowell Jeffrey, if I could jump in here, I understand your concerns David, but we're specifically not focused on that. Yet we've basically decided to push all of those discussions downstream to the point where the economy recovers and what can we do then? So, whatever your concerns are about, what will go up on the pier eventually is beyond the scope of our discussion tonight. I'm getting to that for the interim I think that it would be useful to look at those concessions that were mentioned as an alternative and see what can be done with them use the interim period as a laboratory to see what kind of income potential those concessions have you've got. Fifty percent of that huge peer that you could cover with say an outdoor food court or with I, do not know any kind of commercial purpose that is not as uninviting to the public as a hermetic office building and use this as a time to test out what might work and still not do something. That's so appealing that people would never want to reverse it so that we could perhaps avoid ever having office buildings there. Madeline David I just want to address and I do not want to get off onto a conversation. That really is meant for the for the future, but we are not like Bryan Park. We are up here sitting in the Hudson river, so there really is no relationship to brian to a swath of land sitting in the middle of Manhattan. This pier will have to be rebuilt if we want it in the future. The interim uses are going to be on a pier that already needs work in order to keep it to keep it in play and the whole. The hope here is to be able to get a number of years for interim use, but eventually, if you want to see a long-term plan, it's going to require having the peer totally rebuilt, which is costing a very large amount of money and somehow that is going to have to be paid for. So it's going to have to be a little push and pull here a little give and take. But that really is a conversation that we're happy to have with you going forward, but and it's complicated, and that was why the task force was created, because it is a complicated issue, not simple about how to generate enough funds to be able to do everything that this community might want to have in the future. But also, please remember that this peer is really very large and the kind of the kind of open space, and on this pier it would be one of the largest pieces of park in Hudson river park. It would be quite spectacular, no matter what it is, but in order to get there, there's going to have to be a compromise along the way thanks man. Does that mean that we're expecting office buildings all right, I'm going to shut this down right. This is not so. The scope of discussion this evening is about interim use and so based on the visuals that was put forth really just thinking through what we might like. What is not going to be too good to not get rid of to create a permanent park, that's on par with the rest of the peers that we know and love is really what we're focusing on tonight. The time will come when we talk development, but that's not for tonight. So is there any comments specifically on interim use. I would just continue that use this period to test things like events and concessions and see how much can be earned. I think consider it considered an interim laboratory. That's my final comment. Thank you. Brad did I. Are you Wpe committee member, yes, hi Jeffrey go ahead, hi, brad, I'd like to thank everybody's time today. It's a long time coming. How do we madeleine? How is it going to be funded? Is the money coming from the state for the interim use? Are they going to help with this? We have not quite gotten to the end of that conversation, but where what we really want to do is focus on what uses you would like to see on this pier and then we will continue to have conversations about how that's going to be paid for and two questions. Thank you, Marilyn I'll. Let Jeffrey follow up with that. If he's got more so that means the car club's going out during this interim phase would not that be some revenue. Yes, the car club class car club does pay revenue pay to the trust and that's an exploration that we're having as well so they're we're really at the beginning of the investigation about all of this. So there is not. You know a firm answer on that, but we do like having classic car club there and and, as you know, revenue is always a plus for the trust, I guess so my madeline I would think we try to keep. You know we demo the middle, keep that one wing so there's some revenue coming in interim and on the other wing. We build the wall there and that could be another way to bring some income while we have the whole middle open to us. Just the thought and I know we're not talking about future, but we are the environmental committee and I've been saying this for a while be great to have a commercial garden company there thanks brad, it did note on slide 18 that the interim used by 76 would quote be publicly funded. So is the anticipation that the state would step in here, commissioner segal circles, and I'm not sure on that angle, but given the thrust to make this happen in term or not, it still costs money to maintain it. So I'm wondering what that looks like sure, I'll take that and pass it over to eric. If he's got any thoughts on that, I mean, as Madeleine said, I think we're early in this I mean we still have a major barrier in the way in that the toe pound is still there we're in discussions with with our friends in the chamber to see you know if we're to make advancements in the removing the physical structure. You know what sorts of funding might be available in the near term. I mean all of that is in flux right now, but really important to continue the six meetings that we've had so far get back on with you all. So we can start to plan I think the idea is to not miss a beat on the planning side with you, so that when we're ready on the budget side and everything else, it all comes together fairly quickly. That's the goal. Okay, Jeffrey have one more thing, sure the money is short and we all understand that madeleine. Do we have to tear it down and turn? Can we just open it up clean up the inside and I know it's enclosed, but it's still a big open space while we're waiting to get the funds like, let's say the topo moves out, then we got ta, wait to demo it, or can it just be used the way it is just big and open and we can still get creative there just a thought. You know that could be a conversation. It is very dark in there it's a it's an old building with a with a bad roof, and so it will require funding to keep the building operating. But you know if you, if you all thought that was a good option. We could certainly think about it, but it would not. It would not feel like it would not feel like as much like public space, because it is a very dark long space and I do not even think that the kind of lighting we could put in there would make that feel much different. I'm just wondering, though Marilyn. If we do not have the money and they move out, is it just going to sit there for three years? You know I'm just trying to I know we do not have a tote. I know the chair said. We do not know, I'm not bringing that up, but I'm just wondering yeah. We should have a trigger saying if it's going to take longer than two years or three years, we should be doing something with this empty space. I think, as the commissioner just said, that it seems very much so that the governor wants this to move along quite quickly and that that their conversation is going on in the chamber about this. How to how to fund this. How to get this moving. But the whole point here is that we are trying to ascertain from you what you would like to see there and you know we're no strangers to you. So we do not have to have a formal meeting to have conversations that are ongoing about how this is progressing. But the intention here is to have this move as quickly as humanly possible, good yeah, and just ask that if I can jeffrey right, the intent really is to get the shed down and bring the community board bring the park open space as quickly as possible. So we can talk about the safety of the building. The you know the maybe the dangers that it poses to having use within the buildings. I think we can all agree that it's better to have it down in the interim rather than up if the ultimate goal is to get people outside breathing fresh air moving around a little bit and ultimately getting excited about it and behind a long-term transformational vision. Thank you. Thank you, commissioner. That's great thank you thanks, Brad Leslie, thank you. Jeffrey I, second Jeffrey Lisa I love the rainbows such eye candy for the park, so we have a great need. Also in our district for the arts, we have a lot of independent theater companies. They are begging for outdoor space, for some performances, and if this is so big, maybe I do not. This is just if you guys would consider an interim use of, maybe I do not know collaborating with some of our independent theater companies and maybe they can put on in the spring. Obviously, in the summer some shows, or some performances and I think we probably would be one of the only places in Manhattan that would be able to do that right now. I know it's a big discussion. I do not know if you guys would consider that and can I just switch gears real, quick Jeffrey. If the chair would allow me to speak about another pier since I. Have commissioner sagos here really quickly sure so the state has already committed to funding for pier 97, and we just want to know what the timeline is for that if there is one muting, let me turn that over to to madeline. If she's got details on that. Well, we're in we've done we're past 60 construction drawings, and our intention is to keep moving forward and to and to hopefully go out to bed in this winter for a spring start of construction. Great madeleine great, thank you so much appreciate it guys. Leslie Marty. Thank you good evening. Everybody I want to be respectful of the restraints that were put on David, but pick up that thread for interim uses. I did not notice anywhere in the interim uses the possibility of some kind of marine such a large pier. There should be a little section for environmental studies of the Hudson river estuary and I say that as a interim, and we have to noodle it around. Where would it be? How much would it cost? Is there a construction necessary? Can you put some sort of videographic stuff down under the water, so you can see it above the water, a whole lot of stuff that goes into doing the Marine Museum, and that is an interim use, but I also thought and here's where I'm crossing the line, sorry that it might be a long-term use of the pier if there is funding for a marine museum of some kind on the pier that would bring in money, maybe not as much money as you would like, but enough money to support the pier a marine museum is missing in this part of town, and some work on that I think would be really well received. Marty it's! If you go back to one of the renderings and earlier renderings at least it was the intention that we showed some tents that had our Hudson River park. River project on that. So was that the tent on the north side of the track. That was that was it marty, but I mean. Obviously we have a very strong education research team I also want to. Let you know that we just published our first paper on microplastics. Would you share that with our committee? Please, certainly we're very proud of that was published. I think this at the end of last week, so was certainly happy to share that with you, hot off the cross, entirely hot off the press. Yes, it's four years in the making, but we have a very active group. We have. We do monitor the waters as you well know, we do have plans for an estuarium. We also will have a site in pier 57, which you'll hear more about in the shortly so we're going to have a presence for the river project, really very strong in community board for as well as in other parts of the park- and you know a lot of those pro projects will be unveiled not only shortly, but there's no reason that we can not have a pretty robust program on Pier 76, whether it's interim or future. Thank you thanks, Marty Brett, thank you yeah. So, given the location near the Javits Center, not too far from the the aircraft carrier, the intrepid and all that I see. This is a good location to continue. The trend of this is where we have our tourism and our entertainment in our district along the waterfront and kind of following David, somewhat I, do not mind having an interim use, that's so beloved that we do not have to debate later on whether or not we're going to put an office building there or not. That's all I have to say thanks, Brett Colin, Jeffrey, Thanks, Commissioner and Miss wills, great presentation and I think it's. You know this is a very exciting process. That's happening, I'm I do not really have any specific suggestions for interim use of the park, but following up to what Leslie said earlier, I hope that you know in the interim time, especially now that we have so many non-profits in the city that are really struggling right now that a portion of the park could be set aside for low or free use of local non-profits, whether that's to fundraise or to put on you know, theater programming like Leslie suggested, or you know some sort of blank space that could be set aside specifically for that purpose. I think would be really helpful to a lot of nonprofits. In the city, you know we would not, we hopefully would not cut into pier 60s. You know brisk business during normal times, but something along those lines, I think, would be a great use of the park thanks, Colin Christopher. Thank you Jeffrey. Thank you for the presentation. Everybody I've been on this committee for almost five years now. I did not think this is going to happen, so I'm incredibly excited. I'm also incredibly excited to hear other members of this committee after me, bringing it up two months ago about public use of park space to support our independent theaters. I'm really glad that Leslie and Colin got on board and we've had this conversation also in ACES. So as this begins to snowball into something larger, and we recognize the scale and scope of this pandemic as it affects the arts. I do hope that we can set aside space and that we can have a larger conversation on this committee as well as on ACES and on the board, is how we can be friends to our no to our neighbors and independent in the independent theater companies. That's all. Thank you very much. Thanks Chris Allen good evening, thank you and thank you for a great presentation. Nothing specific I think there's some very good ideas on the presentation and some very good ideas coming out tonight and going down the road but down the road as we think about what specifics we put in as interims. Depending on as you do, your inspections of the pier once you demolish the tow pound that perhaps we think about picking items that might be able to be reinforced and remain on the pier as we go into that far off permanent situation. So we do not have to reinvent the wheel so to speak and maybe cut down on the final installation of the piers so that some of the things that we think about today remain on going forward into the more permanent sort of an adaptive reuse element to your thinking. Allen right, okay, madeline I was just going to reiterate what I had said before about the peers, long-term viability, and so it you know, I think we could get quite a few years out of it now, but in terms of having a long-term peer, one that would last at least 50 years as other Hudson river park peers are built, it would likely need to be rebuilt in a more modern fashion. Madeline can I jump in for a second jeffrey. Where are you going to go to blake I know, you said more modern fashion now I know the answer to this, but it may be helpful to explain what's holding up the pier right now and what you mean by a more modern fashion. So the pier consists of 500 wood piles, which are about 12 inches wide and modern piers are not made of wood, and that is because and you've all read about this. You know about this that the worms are eating. The wood and most of the peers that have existed in hutt's river need a need to be jacketed, but when you have 6500 piles that need to be jacketed, it is far more money to jacket those piles than it is to build a modern, pier with concrete or steel piles. That would probably be- and I'm not going to give you a real number, but probably a third of the number of piles that currently exist and ones that will be much easier to maintain moving forward. So that is the state of play. Nobody will build a wood wooden pier anymore and as long as the Hudson gets cleaner, the more that those the marine borers will work harder to infest those wooden piers. So it's a sign of a healthier river that our peers are being eaten. That's right in a sense, got it blake yeah. Thank you Jeffrey. Thank you for the presentation. One point I wanted to raise was you know just a suggestion about supporting local businesses on the pier and you know giving the pure a bit more of a local character. You know I think a lot of the people visiting the city come to the javits center. Think of you know going eastward to times Square, but you know I'm wondering if the pier could have you know more of a West side feel, and you know, support local businesses for the concessions. You know maybe theme it around something unique to this particular district, and you know I think that also is manifested in the our fees arrangement with the kinds of concessions that are you know on the beer. You know. Obviously local businesses will be coming out of the recession similar to the state and local governments, so ensuring that, while the trusts can make some money off of it, you know it also might be an opportunity for struggling local businesses as well. Thank you thanks for that, blake I think a key point to include there for sure is type of concession and from where any other members of the committee who have not spoken have anything to add at this point or questions to raise, seeing none I'm going to go to the public janine if we can bring over emily and Susannah Emily hi. This is emily from Assemblymember Linda Rosenbaum's office. I did not raise my hand or have a question, but I'm just here listening gotcha I thought: I saw your hand up, but we're happy to have you over and the panelist side. Suzanna, hey guys. Thank you. I am on the board of the Hudson, the friends of Hudson River park, and I'm also on the board of Community Board 2. I. First of all, I wanted to thank you for the I. Have some comments about the interim use and a couple of questions about the long-term use. I wanted to congratulate you on these beautiful visions for the interim use. I grew up when these peers were just empty peers and we had a lot of recreation on them when they were just big sheets of asphalt. So the idea of of enhancing that is very exciting. I'd be interested in spending as little money as possible on an interim use. So the way that you have conceived of just these painted surfaces is incredibly exciting. You guys in CB4 are better at addressing what your community needs are from this interim use. I mean I think that the track is incredibly exciting. Spaces for skating and bike riding are very exciting and, of course, what you talk about: the arts, performances and local businesses. Maybe a flea market all makes a lot of sense. The I wanted to ask of Carl just a couple of questions about the long-term plan, which I know is not the focus of tonight but I. This is all a new subject to me in your study. Do you know what the anticipated revenue is from development once this peer is built out as it as it will be? We do not and again I as I tried to say the goal is to see how we can find as many alternative revenue sources as we possibly can to reduce the need for long-term revenue on pure 76. Although we think there will be it for sure, a need for long-term revenue on pier 76. We just do not know how much and obviously we did some work. Pre-Pandemic and the economics are certainly right now in flux, but the goal has always been from the task force perspective to try to find as many alternative uses as possible, alternative income sources as possible so that we can maximize the open space on Pier, 76 and minimize how much revenue we'll ultimately need from that yeah. That makes a lot of sense. I asked because obviously pure 40 and pier 76 are sharing a load together and for pure 40. We've had many discussions over the development and we did have a target revenue figure and I'm guessing that. What you're saying is that there is no such thing developed at this point for pierce 76 or for the tag team of pier 40 and pier 76. I. Think the only conclusion we really can make right now is that in the long term, when the park is built out and stabilized, we will as much as we can maximize alternative revenue sources, we're going to need permanent revenue, ongoing, stable revenue from Pier, 76 and Pier 40. How much we do not know- and hopefully you know less is less- is more in terms of better yeah and just one last thing, because I recognize that when it comes to creating commercial uses that will bring in that revenue, you know we can't really dictate those uses. We really have to work with a private market and what the market is willing to pay for, but we've had a lot of political concerns in the development at pier 40, and so one concern I would have for the interim use is essentially what Jeffrey said before, which is you do not want to become too beloved once you put it down, it's very hard to take it back up, and so you know, there's a there's a part of me that would love to just see a part of the pier closed off so that you do not have to have that battle down the road, but that's just one point of view anyway. Thank you. It's very exciting plans. Thank you, susanna, thanks for thanks for those comments in the input, sally, we'll go to you and then gene. If we can bring the next two members of the public over Anthony barely and Joe rose, but for now sally the floor is yours. Okay, thank you. I was just wondering with all this discussion. Do the peers are the peers, autonomous or con income from 40 help out 76, or vice versa? Although 40 is the really large peer, but if pier 40 has enough income down the road, does that help 76 or 76 has to stand on its own I'll answer that so we need the look. The park I think I hope you would all agree that the park has never looked better. We have put a lot of resources to making this really a world-class park. We, as we are expanding the park as we open, pier 26, as we open, pier 55 with lyland, as we open new esplanades moving up to pier 97. All these spaces require more maintenance, money, more operational, more security and in order to keep this park going in a manner that, hopefully you agree, you would like to see it in the future. We are going to need, with no exception, to maximize whatever open space on these part commercial peers, but also maximize on the smallest footprint as the commercial space as well. So we can have a discussion moving forward about how that what that looks like what kind of uses can reap enough money on the smallest footprint versus taking up more park space? That's all for a future discussion, but we will not find a way to continue to satisfy the needs of the park and its constituents without continuing to find more revenue for this park in the future. We're about on the road to finishing about 20, more public park space over four mile park and the alternatives there are to share the resources we currently have or to find new resources. So pr 76 is part of that equation to find new resources, and we do not look at the revenue from each commercial, pier as only maintaining the the land around it. The it's one bucket of money. It's one budget. We treat all parts of the park equally in terms of our maintenance and operations, and it all go. It's all pooled and it's all used to maintain the whole park thanks, Ellie and just as a matter of fact sally. So you know the vast majority of revenue the park gets is made within community board four, so we do float the a lot of the funding that goes to supporting the park and board two and board one. Thank you and it was a wonderful presentation and there were so many great ideas, I, I'm looking forward just to the interim. If you ever get there thanks sally Anthony hi, I'm Anthony Borelli, I'm a resident of 35Th, Street, 35Th and 10Th. I'm also a member of the friends board, but I am I'm definitely talking as a local resident and a planner by profession. I think Pier. 76 is a tremendous opportunity. Obviously you know it's important to the city. It's important to the region. It's really important to the park, but I do not want to lose sight of the fact that it really does need to serve community purposes. First and foremost, I do not like the idea of having it be Taurus oriented, for example, and I. Think our neighborhood in Hell's kitchen in the 30s in particular, really deserves community oriented spaces like so many other parts of the park have particularly to the south. So that's. My main point is that I do want to make sure that the uses that are there on an interim basis really are about serving the community first and foremost, not to neglect the financial responsibilities and the idea that programming should be should generate certain funds, which is why I really like the idea of sort of like raising it and creating a blank slate for many types of flexible uses that could be just for fun, can be for revenue generating can be for celebration. I think it's a it's going to be an amazing space, and so that's generally personally, I really want to see a dog-friendly beer garden. Anthony I was going to say, I know how much you like that beer garden right, not just a dog, not just a dog park, but a beer garden with a sort of yeah. Okay, that that's right, we will have babysitting for dogs. I was going to say, I, take a challenge. I! Take that as a challenge can I design a beer garden picnic table for dogs. Please that's great! Thank you very much, for that. Was there anything else. Besides that niche request at the end, that's really good to know no I really just wanted to sort of like be on the record to say that I think moving forward with an interim plan is really great and maybe somewhat related to the beer garden. I mean if we had a beloved interim use. You know, I would not hate that so much I mean you know we as much as I know. The things have to change beloved uses have lasted a really long time in other parts of the park and I think the west 30s deserve a similar opportunity to enjoy the park in its own way. Thank you, Joe hi, there, everybody I did not realize the dogs drank beer, but I think this is all extremely exciting and I'm so Joe rose, among other things, a member of the the task force on behalf of friends. I get. This is a question. I know you're having a presentation from the pd in December and I heard the commissioner and chair talking about how important an agenda item this is for the for the governor just a timing question in terms of what we're up against here, because you know here we are in the middle of November. You know: are we talking weeks or months in terms of our ability to your our collective endeavor, to get something in place? Because if we, if we really are talking in terms of weeks, I'm not talking necessarily January 1st, and we have we sort of got to be working around the clock on this. So just is there a sense of just some time frame that we that we collectively have to get to the interim planning when I weigh in there I would say. Look let's proceed best case scenario, recognizing that we see before may not be unified in what it wants to see. If there's the sort of the best case scenario, where we get the toe pounds soon, we get it on the deadline. Then we launch this process for taking the shed down. I mean better to know all that at the outset better to know what this is going to look like once we finish it again, we're not to everyone's points. We're not talking about. You know, designing something magnificent and large and permanent. These are largely interim uses, so I mean even this conversation tonight has me feeling like we're fairly close to what we could be putting in place. You know the dog beer garden, the the track. The space for theater I mean there's a lot of space. There I think it's all about. How do you move those puzzle pieces around and we're going to look to you all to hopefully give us that vision by the end of this year when we're expecting to get the tail pound so I just wanted to add to that I mean I. Think one of the things that is hopefully a little comforting in the process is that I think any of these sort of scenarios that we put out there that you're adding to you know they require a couple things right likely, obviously, the top being relocated and the shed being demolished. But then it's really about you know a sort of minimal resurfacing of the pier some stabilization along the edges of the pier for safety. Some temporary lighting. These things would be required, no matter what the end sort of use surfaces so there's a lot that could sort of happen to prepare that quote-unquote blank slate. You know, while the uses are being confirmed afterwards and I would like to add to that, to remember that it's interim and all the uses are interim and they can change overnight. And if you just look at on a in a normal year, what Hudson river park would do. We have over 400 events in the park over a summer and you will see ballroom dancing, salsa dancing. We draw 3,000 people on a weekly basis in a normal year to our salsa dancing. So we have exercise- and we have you know even on pier 84, we have tai Chi, we have jazz. So there are so many. Besides the events, you could have a bike riding and then at night have salsa so I mean everything here. Is interchangeable and- and that's really the beauty of interim is that if you do not like something we can change it. Thank you. Madeline Lowell, all right now, I'm just going to put on my community resident hat because I'm going to follow on what anthony was saying at the corner of 30th and 10th, when Hudson yards was being built, there was one summer that there was a combination, beer garden that was ringed by food trucks. That many of you may remember, I think that would be a great use. I'm going to give away my age here, a little bit. I also grew up going to concerts at pier, 84 and I would not mind something like that happening there, because the only residents are you know the Hudson yards residents and they're 80 stories up, so they won't hear it anyhow or they're in the hammock right or they're in the hamptons, where they live in China and I was going to say, or they do not live there on a permanent basis. So I love those two. You know kinds of ideas: yeah we had wonderful. We had a wonderful couple of years at pier 97. If you remember, we had a you know: terrific concert series there with live nation and I think that was very popular as long as the speakers are facing New Jersey and if you'll notice in Lisa's renderings the attendees faced Manhattan and the speakers faced New Jersey, so they had it set out correctly. We learned that lesson early on good I want to be cognitively Jeffrey. A lot of people noticed that thank you for that. Tony I see your hand up, though, before you said, to not acknowledge your hand, so janine can you bring tony over, but with that I want to encourage the committee. I do not see any more hands coming from the public, so encourage the committee to be thinking through what will be next phase of discussion tonight for I have some summary points that we can come up with for consideration and recommendation. But let's get to a point of of a letter here that, as nice as broad strokes are actually gives the state and the trust some real guidance here, Tony there he is tony. Are you here? All right, well, oh Connie, is that you I do not see Connie logged in though hey yeah I am hi, go ahead. Connie Lol actually just asked what I was going to ask, and that was some of the best events that have happened over the years in Hudson river park, since the very beginning were because we had these giant empty old, ugly, big piers, that you could put thousands of people on, and you know that's how a lot of the current activities got started. So you know that's how blue's barbecue started. That's how the movies started. That's how the dances started and slowly a good thing happened, which is they all got developed into parks, but it's would be great to have something that could be flexible enough, that you could do those things again, at least in the interim yeah we have. We I think we all or most of us agree on that, and you know we have these wonderful events like the volleyball finals, and you know the pride dances and food and wine there's just and with pier 92, not being available for a lot of these events. This pier could certainly be an alternative to that, while wendy and noreen and Susana and Lowell recall the day's past about concerts. What is useful to see is that it sounds like that is something we would be interested to entertain here, both on in on an interim use and potentially considering how that can be folded. In long term, though, we're not there tonight, if there's no other comments or questions from the public I want to bring it back to committee for what sounds like it should be saw that wave susanna thanks for being here a fairly straightforward discussion. We can use the ray's hand function again, but just to summarize some of the comments I heard to allow for interchangeable uses across the board concerts performance arts, perhaps with direct connections to the small theaters and production companies in Community board. Four community minded uses that are reflective of the West side and also meet the needs of the community on the West side, spaces for celebration for recreation, in particular the track on the perimeter of the park of the pier. There was also consideration that if we do need to keep the struck keep any semblance of structure, we still should work to open up the middle as much as possible, and you know marine use as well. Some type of connection education aspect tying the pier to the river, which we've always been you know interested in did I, but besides a beer garden with for dogs and people did I miss anything. Or does somebody want to add something a bit more specific to this list: food trucks, food trucks or food options, because blake mentioned concessions and how that could tie into West side businesses. Yeah foreign talk about funding in this, but maybe also that the state should provide all needed funding for 76 97. Whatever else you want to throw in there, they provide funding for the interim use yeah it's up to you. I do not know if this is the appropriate place for it. When has the Community board maintained a level of where to insert themselves into things here so Jeffrey? What about sorry? Go ahead? Yeah I have a comment, but yeah I had my hand up, but yeah. So everything you said I agree with. There seem to be no mention of kitty. I had sent some suggestions in earlier I, like with all the colors and designs, particularly the track along the edge I'd like to see some inclusion of space where kids can ride, tricycles and scooters. That's just designated for children. It seems everything that we have talked about is mostly adult-oriented and I. Think kids really need a place to learn to ride their bikes and, yes, we agree sally. We agree. We had a learn to ride bikes on pr 54 before it kind of fell down, and and that's why, on one of the scenarios that we showed, we happened to show bike riding, and so we also think that we need a place where kids can learn to bike and just and I just want to meet you I want to reinforce in our letter you know I, absolutely I, think it's great yes, yeah brad. Do you want to say anything about ferries I? Think that it's out of scope? We had identified pier 79 as a potential here, it's just to the north. It's an existing ferry terminal and you know me I, never miss a moment to plug for ferry service, but I'm not sure it actually fits here and then my other one would be. You know we kind of touch about, but could there be some? We have to activate the water, so maybe there's a use because I know we have the canoes up the road, but maybe to activate some way the water I know we do. Fishing and I also want to thank wendy for really helping this I know she's helped out a lot I'd like to thank Lol. Thank you guys. Well, we love. We love fishing. We have a very large fishing program. As some of you may know, this is a very active boating area for non-motor for non-non-motorized boats. So this ferries, pier 78, is a private ferry. So there is on the north side, there's a lot of activity, but we can have calmer activities on the south side. The south side is also very shallow by the way brett you just I think with food is not there some kind of ban on disposable containers and whatnot. That would make it make food trucks and things like that. A challenge. Well, we have. We are the first park, as you know, to have started a program called park over plastics and we work with all our tenants. So if we had, if we had a concession there, they would have to follow the rules a park over plastic agreement would be within their permit, so they would have to basically use either a compostable or recyclable materials got it. Thanks for that, Brett I continue to see comments about food which are useful, so that will definitely be included. Sally's point on dedicated space for children use, especially as it relates to learning how to ride a bike is important. Anything new overall here, Anthony nope, you did no yeah I was small comment. I just wanted to mention that you know, while we're thinking about the pier we should think about how to get to the pier and most people from the neighborhood will be getting to the pier from inland. So how do you get there from 34th street and how do you cross the highway? Maybe that should be part of the planning for the interim use yeah, that's a very good point to consider access besides those who are already on that side of the highway. Thank you for that. I think this is extremely exciting that we are entertaining a public use of pier 76 tonight, interim or otherwise, and the options are great. I think that we I the list is long, but I think it's actually very achievable, based on what was laid out. Any other comments, questions things to add specifically on this I'll go through the summary again, which is going to be a bit jumbled still, and then I'd like to entertain a motion to turn this into a letter, so interchangeable uses across the board with consideration for specific areas dedicated to having kids learn how to ride their bikes or roller Skate performance concert, art spaces track use on the edges of the pier food options. Food trucks, concessions, connection to the water, perhaps physical connection to the water, but also as it relates to education and marine uses consideration for access to the pier from east of 9a how you get across the highway. How one gets to 76 safely, if you're, not in a car and then the consideration for funding and how that's going to happen to bring to make sure the interim use can happen? How about the consideration of renewable energy? We've talked about wind on the last pier. Obviously, you know the park will use solar for the lights hopefully, but maybe we should, let's add something to the letter about that. If there's, if there's an energy need there, it should come from a renewable source. Brad does that sound appropriate, be great to try? Yes, okay I, also like the idea of having, if it's possible, some of that outdoor equipment for adults to use while they're watching their kids ride the bikes pull up bars. You know not expensive stuff, but something that adults can can use physically or outdoor fitness got. It sounds good. Thank you for that, with with the direct connection to the West side, and CB4 definitely will include that in there marty on the energy. Do not forget that we in the presentation, the lighting was solar. So that's a good thing. I think the the Brad's remark meant other energy than just lighting. Absolutely okay. Would somebody like to make a motion? That means you need to unmute yourself, I'll make the motion seconded. Thank you, Chris any opposed to this exciting letter. Any attentions are present not eligible with that unanimous passage to support these various interim uses on pier 76, which is really exciting. Jeffrey's, giddy, I think I am a little kitty about this. Commissioner sega squishy you're, if you're still here anything to add or close with, I'm going to give it back to the trust. Also for any closing comments. No thank thanks. So much everybody, it's been a pleasure being with you tonight. We'll have many conversations from here on out, but it's all very positive. Thank you great. Thank you all very much nice to see you stay safe and we'll talk soon, great thanks. Everybody for that presentation. I'm just committee we're done with our formal items, but wondering if anybody else has any new business or questions to raise separate and apart Bye Lisa. Thank you. Thank you. Carl thanks. Everybody Jeffrey I had a question. Yes, please, the DEP site on 10Th Avenue. Do we have a timeline for that currently for that park, space I believe that's being heard at Clinton health kitchen land use next in two weeks. I do not know if it relates to the green space or not. Lowell does not relate to the green space, but the green space is dependent on the on the supportive housing, the affordable housing. That's supposed to go up on that site, and that is being heard by the Clinton health kitchen, Land News Committee, the La Next Thursday. Before thanksgiving it's the Tuesday before thanksgiving, they got moved yes, okay, excellent! Thank you so much chair. Thank you Lo! Thank you. Everybody for your great work. That's all sure any other bits of new or old business and did Lowell tell us when the tow pounds leaving. Oh I'm sorry, Lowell is moving the toe pound himself. I'm getting off this call, I'm going to start taking all of the cars off tonight. I am parking them on 22nd, Street Brad, that's great buddy I thought we decided we're going to send them to Albany. That's fine! It's going to take me longer to drive up there. I'm going to partner up somebody second, so Brad and Allen can have whatever they want. That's well, you really do have a. We have a very large parking lot on 22nd street right next to brass car I'll. Tell you what driving the tow truck there's so many movies on our block we never get to park anyway. Yeah there's a parking lot. It's called Hudson yards. If you want to move them there, all right, I, wanna, also I, know wendy. Thank you for being here this evening and tuning in any thing to share or add, based on the conversation. Is everybody else gone? Is it just the committee the committee's here and we have 14 members also the bill we're still in business session. I was just asking if you had anything to well. It was not really apropos the current discussion. You know, I think the conversation was great. As always, the committee asks great and important questions. You know the interim use is very exciting or the concept of interim use. I. Think that you know really key is to find out if the state is engaging with the city, because it's my understanding that the city has been trying to engage with the state on you know where the toe pound could move. You know I think that, well it's my understanding, correct me if I'm wrong that the intrepid site is not necessarily the board's number one choice but as we saw in the letter that the city wrote to the state they're, you know also looking at the marshalling yards, but we need to find out if this state is engaging and encourage the state, obviously to be engaging, because what we ultimately want is for the city to be leaving asap and the city needs the state's help. To do that, we are Jeffrey, go ahead. Lowell David, I promise you we will have the discussion you want to have when we get there we're still a couple years away from that discussion. Probably because of the pandemic is Susanna Aaron still here. I do not think so. Okay, then I do not mind. Throwing CB2 under the bus part of the problem with pier 40. Is they can never reach an agreement as to you know what they want to see on that pier and it gets hung up about? Should we tear down the existing structure which is falling down? Should we rehabilitate it? Should we build something new and because of the inertia? Nothing changes there and it's going to get to the point where pieces of the building are going to start falling on the ball field and the ball field is going to have to be closed. I mean Noreen may have more information. She wants to share about that or noreen may wish. I never mentioned her name, but that's been the problem and that's what we were specifically trying to avoid. Here. We have governor Cuomo's attention to give us some sort of open space and to bog it down with a discussion of something that is three or four years down. The line just did not make sense. Tonight we had you know his commissioners. Here there was a rep here from the governor's office who was in listen only mode, and we want this to happen because we want the tow pound moved and we want the open space. So that's why I shut you down David and why we handled it the way we did but I promise you there will be a time and place for that discussion. Thank you, lowell and thank you everybody. It was one item on the agenda tonight, but it was a big one and an exciting one. So if there's no other business, then we leave it at that and we'll see you all at in the neighborhood or on the next zoom. That was so great. Thank you thanks. Everybody.
