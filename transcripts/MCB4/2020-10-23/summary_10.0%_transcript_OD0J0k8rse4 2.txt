The second piece was to review the statement of district needs, Whatever's left of it to go in just even focus on the section you committed to again The letter is talking about FY 22, so we want to eliminate any references to previous years, so I will send that back.
You know want to represent the work of your committee and their priorities.
Expanded, funding, I think that our long- standing priorities matter, but that we should also acknowledge what people sort of on the street are saying right.
As we look to prioritize and take these take all of these various requests on the capital expense that we have, I think we should just try to keep all of these different, both the long- standing, but also the sort of feeling of the moment in mind.
You can see here 60 50 pages plus of comment, and our thinking was that we would then take this and kind of bring it back to each committee less that this would necessarily inform any budget request at this time because it is preliminary and these issues maybe have not been heard by committees themselves, but the committees can take them and use this as an opportunity to be less reactive.
I do not want to conflate that with a budget issue christine, you have your hand up It seems to me that the top line that you showed is really not totally reflective, like health care and human services.
Kids are not in school kind of narrative, Right, okay, I'm, going to just stop sharing for a second ever Sanitation underlying all of this.
These have been the major concerns that are impacting our community in real time, and we need to ensure that the budget protects some of has some protections put in to ensure that we do not worsen these problems, and then I think that the main categories Alan.
I, actually think that it may not be a good idea to reprioritize our long- standing district concerns because they're going to exist.
And I think that also it does need to be more informed, as throughout this year we get more input which we will from our partners that are in education, and your committee is very strong in terms of getting that input.
When we talk about our district needs, what are the long- term's effect on all of these items that we have as priorities because sanitation, so the garbage does not get picked up on a corner for a couple of days and people throw this stuff out there as funds come back in sanitation will straighten itself out when you have kids out of school when you do not prioritize or somehow keep kids in schools or make their learning abilities to overcome the deficiencies of not being in school.
I agree with what I heard Alan say, because a lot of this is going to depend upon November 3rd, because you know it's clear that what Speaker Pelosi wants to do in terms of providing money to cities and states depending upon what happens, November 3rd, that will either become part of the federal budget or it won't, If that money is coming, in, like Alan, said easy problems like the trash getting picked up because they cut back, sanitation will get fixed, and I.
Is every committee ranked their priorities based on a combination of past listings, things that made that on the list last year, combined with new topics and then ranked those, and what we have here is the one The thinking was that the top 25 or 30 are probably our most important to get right.
I personally, like upgrade school , I like the elevators, know the HPD thing right.
Do you want, I was saying, upgrade school from ACES right, replace the limiters and other affordable housing requests, which was adequate capital for HPD at the Harborview terrace?
It does not mean that we're getting bike lanes in the snow right, Sounds like a song : What's the truck it was on the park, I do not want to get into this number two.
We have another education, request, specifically something I know: Okay, I just want to read.
Think we do have on number three for ACES is additional books for students to practice at home and lending libraries I'm just reading off what district two sent me as far as the superintendent's, their priorities?
Can we replace their third priority as now their second priority, so something that will be further down on line 15 can not be bumped up to this section, like our second capital, ask yeah, If to frame it that way, we can choose between affordable housing, the tow pound, Hell's kitchen park, or this book number line, 15 books for libraries.
Think number four should be sorry to ask for HPD And I know you mean like an even bigger renovation, but I.
Schools have gotten away from that, and this is more, as this says, classroom libraries in the future, which is good Janine, the line where you just put move to group two that actually needs to go down to where it says bump up to second capital.
Then, where it says bump up to second capital, ask we want to put a 2, a 2, there, okay, great So now in tier three, we have another downsizing, a shelter, ADA compliance for pedestrian ramps, a ferry service.
I thought that shelter has gotten to really be not the issue that it was when it first opened five or six gosh, six or seven years ago, I would agree with Jeffrey on this because I think has not the community come out in support of this.
I. Think the most important thing here, though, is going to be establishing a new family, a permanent family, shelter in the district, because we do not have any the family shelters we do have I do not think we have had a letter, a resolution to ask, for what do you mean interesting?
What I mean is that we have not seen a letter from HHS asking for such a discussion on the family, We look at the language, it says, downsize a single men's shelter and establish and add new family shelter.
Okay, downsizing does not mean converting, does not say, eliminate the BRC and have a family shelter in place of it right, it just says: make the BRC smaller and, at the same time create a family shelter.
You know we still think brcs should be reduced, but we do want to have a family shelter return to our to our area, and so that's the So. It looks to me that we should have two entries in this day and age right and one of them should be establish a new family, children, shelter and then the downsized BRC would move way down in the priorities.
It's just roof repair, upgrade boiler new building entrance doors for both buildings and upgraded lighting for the public hallways Is. There anything you want to say about the Chelsea park truck or no just that was definitely been discussed of recent and in past, as well.
Okay, so it sounds like ACES I mean personally, I mean we're not doing a lot of sorting within, but school cameras feel less important than I.
Think I guess maybe you want to include the elevator repair to say that elevator, Roof, repair and elevator I mean it's a committee, but Our long- standing our task force, but our long- standing priority is housing and that might be a way to lead off.
Okay, so is our top priority education remotely the these all feel so minuscule to me in the age of Covid-19, every single one on this list actually sort of falls flat in what I think is a neat.
What new is online So one thing with this top list: is, I think at least the ACES is actually directly related to Covid-19, which is the remote learning and the funding for remote learning, and so I will say that I do think we have to remember, though, when we originally came up with this.
Think Leslie can confirm that from ACES that, rather than feeling We should have this separate list of Covid-19 stuff that we would put in some other document that they felt it was a priority to make the Covid-19 stuff to be the number one priority within our actual budget, requests, and I.
They did not completely connect it to Covid-19, but they did say that it was some of the stuff that they prioritized was sort of, because a result of the Covid-19 programs that were results of Covid-19, and so I think you guys can decide whether you want to stick with the original idea, which was to keep with our the fundamental or regular priorities and then have a separate Covid-19 list or integrate it and try to say you know.
We want to bring in affordable this preservation, loan and Sarah program like The. Next Trans item is nine okay, and I have to put the Wpe request in there of the bike lane stuff.
I mean, I, think everyone knows my concern about that.
Up, I'm just saying instead of the hell's Kitchen park, We need a second meaning.
You know the big ass first, the things that can be done like if we ask for a dog park renovation that can be a win that can be done.
We will send this back to everyone for our final review to catch things like what we just caught, which is you know, an optics issue that sometimes you can't see when you're so up close And I'm going to suggest that we now move as quickly as possible through the expense budget or get as far as we can in the time we have do.
So are you proposing that we not even start with expense right now and move everything to another meeting which , so here we have DOB code, enforcement, dangerous intersections, broken elevators staff for homeless families and after school.
This, whole thing, but ACES number one expense was definitely was the Was, this tech support Sorry for a second?
You know other issues related to homelessness or education that are going to come before and I do not want to give up all of our top slots.
It's, a multi- committee request, but I also agree that in the during this time, if we're going to prioritize Covid-19 related, you know top issues.
Do not think that our budget request is saying this resolves it, but I think that you we need to continue to advocate for funds to homeless, issues.
I think we are saying we definitely should move it up, because everybody was concerned about sanitation, right.
I should probably be picking the other homelessness issue, but I feel like the tech support is needed.
I. Do not know, I wonder if after school should be further up, because it's the kids, I agree with you, but the only thing I say is going back to what you put it out in capital.
You know the top 30 capital and you right, now, you're close to the top 20 expense.
