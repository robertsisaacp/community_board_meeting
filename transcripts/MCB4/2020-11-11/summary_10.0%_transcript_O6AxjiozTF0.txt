This committee hears applications for liquor licenses and sidewalk cafes.
Yes, the applicant for 164, ninth avenue, milk and hops, or here Brian Frederick, says Attorney, okay.
We get to the committee, I just want to clarify some things about your the stipulation form on the first page, you said, you're, not making any operational changes, but I think to be clear.
I, looked at your prior form and the occupancy numbers on page two were very different on the the original application.
You said no to the question about whether you'd close doors and windows when there's music inside right.
We would not want that because of the people that live above this building, so we comply with sound and any calls or anything related to that have not happened because we keep it within the indoor space.
You know how the how the committee feels about that when we, when we discuss it and then the last thing which I think is also just a wording, thing, there's a question about whether you're going to have a canopy.
I'm trying to find out, because this did not look like a change that it is and one of the things I was going to say.
Okay, I think you know.
Yes, we're looking for a full on-premise license, but not to the extent of a bar with multi-level top shelf, a few bottles of wine for any person that wants to have a glass plus a few to sell and a small cocktail menu I.E that mixed drinks that we already set plus.
No I, just I think that the community does not know this based on the application.
Do not think they reached out to anyone and the application says that it's a much smaller place and obviously if their certificate of occupancy was what it should be.
I, wonder if people think it's a smaller place and just like to see.
I apologize, I believe that I sent an email to everyone that was included on the list to reach out to to the extent additional outreach is necessary and to learn more about the plans.
Yes, okay, so the number of tables on the application is wrong as well.
You know you do not get a license based on Covid-19 number.
Our actual occupancy is like stated before, but with outdoor dining people can come, walk up to the bar and purchase a drink from the bartender and then walk back out to their seats, and so with the to go aspect, we have fridges with beer cans as well.
Okay, understood so and going back to a point that I, missed and I do not mean to hold everyone up here, but is it the suggestion of the community board that a beer and wine license would be more agreeable as opposed to a license, a full of full license with spirits as well.
You know like I could not tell if Inga, who was a committee member who lives who lives, hey, bro can I say: something.
I every time I pass by during the summertime when they've had their like doors, open, I've, never heard any music leading out and I go by there.
And I also will point out that Rob's one of our bigger enforcers of doors and windows being opened with music flaring out.
It was interesting to hear that from him like Brian as his hand, yeah I just wanted to echo what what Rob said.
We need the occupancy and they just need to know that the doors have to be closed when there's music on, because when you add hard liquor, it's going to get louder.
I would default to the usual, but personally, I've never heard any music larry coming out of them at all, and they said it was on when the doors open, which is really unusual, and I'm.
You know they have music going on in the bar.
Are you, okay, with that agreeing to the changing your answer to the stip, about keeping the doors and windows closed when his music and then and sorry.
That's the goal, and if you do not, if no one hears music on the sidewalk or across the street, people are not going to complain about it.
You know right, you can manage it to keep the music off the sidewalk that that's the goal.
Okay, so also right, okay, I think we're going to have a motion for the full liquor.
We are applying for a wine beer and liquor license for a new hotel called Pistana Cr7 located on 39th between 8th and 9th avenue.
See, that your form says no outdoor space, but I see on the floor plan that there's a something called outdoor patio, I.
So if and when that space ever was open to use by hotel guests or our customers, we would of course go through.
You, know, frank and the proper channels to make sure we updated the application, but as of now, guests are not even permitted on that outdoor space, let alone to eat or drink.
Frank, please feel free to chime in, but the space is still actually being built, so the floor plan as in the positioning and the number of seats at these small tables might have to change ever so slightly the floor plan that we have that you're looking at.
I just want to say: I, do not have a split screen, so committee people, you're, going to have to be very.
One is about the hours your kitchen is going to close at 11 pm, even though you are doing room, service, I would have expected that it would last much more and then the operation and the music continues until 2.
I noticed on the plans that you've got a meeting space event space you're not going to have any promoters come in or do any special events that might be like dj or lounge, music or any impersonators, or anything like that.
And I think we can all use a little more green, so, okay, thank you.
Then they are actually putting a lot of trees back there just to make it visually appealing, because you can see the patio area from our interior dining space.
Frank, we're changing the kitchen closing hours to 2 A.M across the board and then just to sort of confirm what we've been hearing about.
We'll have two additional steps: there'll, be no use of outdoor patio by members of the public and there'll be no music or speakers in outdoor space.
There's, a few issues, with some applicants being able to join I'm, trying to figure it out hold on one second, here.
License application for Lotus Manhattan co-op they'll be doing business as the Goat House, located at 857, 9th avenue between West 55Th and West 56Th street, and the premise formerly known as Kilo.
With a restaurant wine license the applicants owned and managed La Pocaria at 1626 Second Avenue, with an on-premise liquor license until it closed in December 2019.
The applicants did come before you in September 2020 for their other restaurant at 623, 9th avenue and were approved for an on-premise license.
It's, not just that it has a different name, but the the awning on the Side Street also says South american wine bar or something like that really suggests it's a separate place, so if they could just make all the signage consistent, so it does not look like the concerns we've been hearing from the community.
He is the owner and does the ultimate landlord have any rights to approve or veto sublises, not for what I'm reading, but the pima did notify the landlord about a month ago that they had a new tenant coming in and Pima has not heard back from the landlord.
Because I guess nelly had a communication from a lawyer today, we're not quite sure for whom indicated that the landlord might have objections to a full liquor license in this space that maybe someone will speak in the public session, but that's sort of all.
And I know that next door there is rise, but they also had the same issue and they did a lot of sound attenuation.
The quality of life for the residents, because I think it's also just like a different, whereas like a wine bar, is a little bit calmer, but a liquor license might not, and it's also I'm a little bit concerned.
After hearing what Michael Kelly had said about the applicant that they were not, they did not fully comply with the stipulations of their previous approval and also looking at their previous restaurant.
You know when you were speaking earlier about providing a stipulation that the new sub-tenant in that space keep those windows shut to me, I'm a little wary of that as a stipulation for the following reason.
When I ask I, do not want to have to live my life, you know going downstairs and asking them to shut those windows.
Hi, I'm, also a shareholder in the building, I'm on the board, I'm Secretary of the board, I'm, probably just going to reiterate basically what everyone else said: I do live on the side of the building where the air shaft is where the window is always open for Kilo and the noise just echoes so loud.
Mike said we have ryze right next to us, which is just insane amounts of people just like sitting on the floor.
Seriously, and you know obviously, there's been also food safety issues with is another space that is also released by by Pima.
Our function is here to hear applications for liquor licenses, but we strongly suggest before we go ahead with this, that you guys get together and talk some more I'd like to make another suggestion before they go.
You look like you've got enough space to have an internal vestibule.
He has known at 161 West 72nd street, since 2019 has an on premise: liquor, license Miss known 75, 9th avenue from October 2017 to present cream line, same location, Chelsea, music, hall, same location and also ball gonzo at 511, 9th Avenue.
That I know no one's showing up on my paperwork, because it's the okay, yes, because the reason I ask is bar gonzo.
I. Do not think the mall knows if they're open, enough.
Okay, so the mall wants to stay open later in the future.
I do care right, but I just wanted to clarify that they're planning to stay open, later.
Folks, is that he is a member of Brooklyn community board one's liquor, licensing committees and he has been for many years.
He knows exactly what you all go through every month with liquor license applications, and he knows the types of concerns that you have and if any of you think that your job is tough, spend the night at Brooklyn community board one's liquor, licensing committee as I have done, which is.
If you look at the Broadway theater experience, you want to go out, you know for dinner and a show on Broadway, generally you're, going to a restaurant somewhere else.
One of the things you've agreed to is all shows are going to end an hour before the closing time of the venue.
It's not even like everyone leaving is going to necessarily end up on the same sidewalk or even the same street avenue or you could take the breezeway through straight to 10.
So, the tables outside what are the hours for those, because you've got the eugene right across the way, which is residential, good call.
That's, going to be associated with the cafe generally for daytime use, we'll close that outdoor seating, area.
We are now talking about after the recovery right when everybody start to make money again whether we could have some opportunities to invite some underserved people from schools from the neighborhood and get them to you know attend some of those representation.
If you're going to be a restaurant with the theater with background music, maybe in the restaurant and good question.
Oh okay, right next door to ours, they're in the loft building, which I believe is like 424 or 436.
One thing that I do want to point out, because I know that it's a touchy subject for this committee is that we would like to replace the carriage door, which is now a closed glass.
Okay, you x'd out, live music, but you know, given that you're talking about having live, performance.
We going to be a you know, an open, Mic kind of a cafe law type thing.
Okay, I just did not know if you were from Seattle or where were you coming, from.
This is an application for a hotel license full on premise: liquor.
It's an outdoor space that will have a roll of cover, but the roller cover is intended more for weather, as opposed to sound because as I think Al will talk about.
Or I can turn it over to Al. On the second floor, terrace, are you saying you are going to keep the roller cover closed.
We would like to have that space on the second floor be available to be open during the nice weather, season.
Okay, no I, think photographs are good, I mean looking at.
My question was, if you put a roller cover thing in that setback, space, I remember, does that somehow contravene right.
It does not look like you have answered the question: Can you take us through that on the space floor, lobby, public, space, dining kitchen.
Okay, so, therefore, the operation is 24 7, but the food and drinks is from when to when win well from 6 am because technically breakfast starts at 6 A.M, so people want to eat out there.
Okay, I'm, getting closer here: now, public space for dining interior.
Then now we come to number two second level public space for dining, and that's where you just told us that the terrace would be with roller cover during the win winter, but would be essentially open during the summer.
It's, where you have these like glass doors that open and close.
I believe we have only recommended approval of places with roller covers that were on the low level permanently closed, no music, 10 and 11, and even the doors had to be closed at 10 and 11.
You know to keep the music from inside getting out to the roller cover.
Yeah I personally think that first and second floor music, are, you know, problematic, even having an open space is not consistent with our guidelines or where we are concerned, but.
But I think it certainly would be appropriate to allow some music to at least you know, recorded background in the spaces.
If that is not open, if we could have it where there is like no music or nothing playing when that wall is open between the two, if there's going to be any opening at all.
You're going to have people looking out their corner hearing that seeing that, so, if we could, as everyone suggested, have a permanent roll down, also have no music out there at all.
You know that the applicant would like to use it to provide shelter from the weather.
I think they've agreed to keep it closed, so I do not think we need to talk about sound when it's open or partially okay.
And, they are going to respect those hours, and we may want to say also that the music certainly stopped at 10 and 11.
I just have a question to my fellow committee members and you know, as I'm trying to learn.
Roller cover space, which last month's applicant did not so in some sense that there is not direct precedent for that, because I think the issues are a little different when it's on the first floor and in the front.
Think the open question is whether we want to allow them to have background music.
In the front first floor, roller cover space.
Yeah, the the roller cover space is 6 A.M to 10 p.m, and then the internal first floor.
You know: try to really be a reasonable with the exceptionally reasonable, with the with the members and the and the committee and agreed to no music outside, even though, with the eight speakers.
It still was fine, but we want to be a good neighbor and not you know and work.
You know, part of me thinks it's on the sidewalk facing the street, but.
Arcade Roller cover space is 6 A.M to 10 p.m. Both of those have background music.
We want to answer yes to the questions that say: you'll, keep all the french doors and such clothes whenever there's amplified music inside or after 10 and 11.
So you want to say, music, slash, sound I, do not know okay.
