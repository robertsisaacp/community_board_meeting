They got from development, air ride, sales, there's no money for a design at present and the other continuing support was 705, 10th avenue and the MTA site If anyone wants to add anything to the capital, budget.
Think everyone's going to say yes for extra funding city budget, I mean it's not going to go anywhere, but you maintain the habit of requesting the number one request for the board that came from us was more funding for building code enforcement at D.O.B and to raise updating the DOB website as a priority.
Was we after saying all that we want to talk about a way to look at zoning regulations such that waivers, become easy enough that if there's a lot of commercial space that can be used as homes and housing locations, and it violates zoning regulations that there's a mechanism in place for reusing, empty space, particularly in Hell's kitchen and Chelsea, that could be used as something different than currently exists in the zoning regulation.
But if housing is not allowed in a particular zone that we allow for that to happen in some way and to do a study as to what needs to be looked at to provide usage for currently empty spaces.
Second action we would like to take is that we are subject to the preliminary approval by the Public design commission, because this site in question is a site that will be in ownership by the city and then will indeed be needed to the developer, entity.
That would be our second ask, and the third reason we are meeting today is we'd like to go through the public Plaza on 39th street, which is directly south to the site prior to meeting.
Based upon that design and presentation, we asked that not be included in the letter to pdc only comments and questions that really address the developer, site.
The center slide is looking southward on 11Th, Avenue and 43rd, and you see that the residential building is a very classic form that steps up and the top are those sort of fingers of the verticals coming up and then on.
The right is from the park looking east over the new Javits expansion and there you can see how some of those medallions really create a little bit of a playful pattern on the building.
I turn it over to star White House on in terms of development of the of that public space, which you sort of excuse me in sketch form on the left right behind the white car.
And I think that if you go to the first slide, we can, we can start, And I think that Jonathan introduced a lot of this already, but just understanding the the site considerations based on the various ownerships that are involved surrounding the site, so one being that the plaza is part of a Map street and then subject to the New York City D.O.T revocable consent.
The land, just south of the plaza, is owned by New York state and operates out of a port authority easement next to the vent tunnel, which we'll talk about the plaza is intended to be a public private partnership to be maintained by Radson, and we want to also provide a safe entry to the Javits center, as well as a space adjacent to the hotel and restaurant, and we also are going to respect the existing infrastructure.
It's our understanding that the the area up to 39th street will be an upgrade park that is currently in design and anticipated within the next five years or so to be opened and then potentially in the future, this land bridge that would go over up and over the tunnel entrances, but for now also assuming that or for now, under the assumption.
In terms of our design that between 38th and 39th street, there will be this public park that will have a connection with this local plaza here, the next one.
The bike lanes that we've discussed and the pedestrian circulation coming from Hudson, Boulevard, Park and street connections via crosswalks across the north side and south side of 39th street, as well as crossing across 38th street, and going up towards along the vent structure and running to the plaza the next one.
I'll jump in now, and what we're looking at is a map of what would be maps 39th street owned by the state going through the gray area would be the revocable consent area directly attributable to us, and we have this unusual arrangement of utilities there, because they were all moved to the south side when the Lincoln Tunnel was built, so that sewer line, which is usually right on the center line of the streets.
So, we can't really plant a lot of things in the ground, we're limited to what we can put in a permanent way, and so that's why we're building it up with planters and furniture and trying to make a sense of space going through there.
This would be have to involve the consent and agreement of adjacent property owners which we've not yet begun, but to make it feel like a bigger space than just this sort of half of the street next to the building and to make it feel inviting we thought was an important thing to explore.
This is being shown as a public place from one end to the other that culminates at one from the street and with a regular traffic we expect going to and from the Javits employee entrance, even in addition to members of the public and passing tourists and javits visitors and everyone else who may be wanting to use this space as a respite next.
Think the design itself is so thoughtful of just what is already here and distinguishing itself from Hudson, yards, and I , always also very encouraged by the ideas that you're, bringing together for those public spaces and those connecting spaces and thinking very forward of what our community would look like five years from now, as we redesign a lot of this part of the city.
Give me one second, but So the thing here is, you still have the building floating in the residential tower on the southern corner, where it changes from the limestone color to the brick, and that also, I believe, is set back I think it is right a little bit about five six feet.
I have a few questions about the presentation going back to the first block that had like the Axon metric that had the what was residential and what was hotel and the The how the base was broken out in terms of commercial space.
We have our servicer in place, cucs who's used to managing this scale and has gone into some neighborhoods that have some some different markets and affordability, and I think they're well equipped to do this, but there will be on-site services they'll, be inside the residential tower among the interdispersed, supportive housing.
If you look at the image on the far right, you know, the tower on the left is the residential I mean I.
You know that shows the context, there's, obviously not only the context of your building but the tower across the the vent across the street, which is pretty dominant in that in that space, as well.
We, understand that there's going to be a variety of type of uses for this space and, as Kristen mentioned, there's going to be javits employees coming through here, but it's also going to be used by many tourists, many people who are visiting New, York City for the first time, staying at the hotel, visiting the Javits, Center, etc.
This is my first time seeing it So. This likely came up in a previous presentation, but I want I did not hear anything about it today and knowing that Joe and Dale are on this committee , I'm sure it was raised, but on the presentation you had a loading dock of one door between the police station and the police parking lot and one loading dock door.
When we've had to have long drawn out conversations with D.O.T and even limiting those curb cuts there And then, of course, we have all the pedestrian access to the co, working space, the residential entrance, the supermarket and the hotel entrance.
You have to program that in to make sure you design for it Dan, because that's how this kind of density of housing will not work, otherwise, so they'll be compacted and we'll look into the containerized approach, one more question on the housing program and then the public plaza all right, Joe hold on I had a just a quick question for clarification: will there be disburse throughout the building, affordable housing and supportive housing?
So one of the things that you're going to have to prepare coming back when you do euler is like a stacking plan that lists floor by floor, the types of affordable, housing.
We know right now and do we know how many families are in need of supportive housing that would actually necessitate something larger than one bedroom, because in my experience with working for the coalition for the homeless, a big problem is that we only look at studio in one bedroom.
We all know that we as an affordable housing developer, are doing a number of other projects that are serving other specific needs, including Db, survivors.
I. Think we're going to see a lot more need if that's even possible in the years to come, for supportive, housing.
More families, more individuals are going to be working from home at least part time in years to come, and for that reason we looked at our community room space and what we're considering to doing is programming one as a business center.
It be you know, roof, top plotting, gardens and or other spaces for individuals to congregate within the building facade, but not externally to the surrounding walls, how that is being integrated or what plans might be for that to help those supportive housing, individuals for their rehabilitation and social service suspects and the second question.
We are a bit limited there, but we are looking at ways to best program interior combat space as well, but a rooftop outdoor space is something that we're hoping to implement into the project, which I think you mentioned something about the top of the ballroom, which would potentially be a perfect space for that The common area in between the two towers that would be on top of the base right, now.
