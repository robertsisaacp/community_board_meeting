, I'm, the deputy director of the ryan Chelsea cleaning committee, health center we've been serving the community since 2001.
We have been open throughout the pandemics serving the community 70 of the patients that come to our center reside in CB4 or around CB4.
The mission of the Ryan help you want to go to the thank you so ryan, Chelsea Clinton is a sub-recipient or an affiliate of the Ryan Network Ryan Health, which started in 1967, which was established to meet the need for health care services on the upper west side of Manhattan as part of the war on poverty and the greater health care.
If anybody, you know anybody who needs pediatric vaccinations, please have them come to the center behavioral health integration, so ryan , Chelsea Clinton uses a collaborative care model where the provider, a social worker and a psychiatrist discuss the patient's needs.
We do over offer case management services who will wrap around everything for social services, Housing transportation, food and such we Are part of the city's Undetectables incentive program which helps folks, which is an incentive program for folks who are undetectable, who are living with HIV, who are undetectable to get a monetary incentive.
We are part of the state's cancer screening program, which provides uninsured patients over the age of 40, with free cancer screenings, and actually, today we had our Mount Sinai Mammogram Van. We have another patient navigator who is dedicated to helping our patients receive benefits that include Snap health, insurance, cash.
Food insecurity are just important to somebody's health as them getting a check up every year, so we have identified that need and applied for grants or provided resource or obtained resources to help with patient navigation.
You live in other things like health, behaviors, right, so how you eat any addictions, you might have your sexual activity and as well as your access to care.
So, it's a screening tool to assess a patient's social determinants of health right, as discussed before our outreach team and our patient navigators connect the patients to community resources within their zip, code.
And it'll give them the resources in their area that they're most interested in About, 400 or so searches, and the most popular things that people were looking for was connection to housing, food security as well as health insurance, connections.
So I mentioned this earlier today in our other meeting, but we've started a new collaboration with breaking ground and we've been using our mobile unit and visiting different areas of different hot spots in Midtown and kind of closer to Chelsea area So places where there's high rates of homelessness reported high incisions of substance use, as well as people who are accessing free meal services through local churches and other pantries, and with pairing with breaking grounds.
I mean 80 of our visits are in person now telehealth We do not get too many people in the center for social, Justice and reasons You know we've gotten awards and we are joint commission certified and we are certified Level three patient-centered medical home.
So we're going to we're developing a partnership with New York City Department of Health Mental hygiene, we're probably going to open up the center for about eight saturdays that were not usually open and just do mass flu shots for the for the neighborhood so more to come on that thanks Dan, it's actually a population for when there's a cova 19 vaccine is There's, many channels that the vaccine will flow through and one is through federally qualified health centers such as us, so we're using the flu shot the flu season as a dry run for when the vaccine is raised to vaccine to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible.
So right now we're about at our center about 21, which is kind of what that what the rate is for Manhattan, so in general, a little bit higher than for what the West side is so, but We, but, as people know, cover 19, has been disparately, impacting individuals from communities of color individuals who have less access to things to overcome social determinants of health, so health center patients are more likely to have Covid-19 than individuals with private doctors.
We have psychiatrists that are 96, I'm, sorry 100th in Amsterdam, so we can make referrals up there, There's, a shortage of psychiatry and community settings, So the our providers, also you know-are: We do have a social worker on site once a day.
You know, that's a big issue for us in the community I mean we see we're seeing more homeless people or who identify as homeless at registration.
So If you know, people who lost their job and do not have insurance or need access or recently obtained Medicaid tell them to come to us They live in the neighborhood, please what are their nearest guys, we're tracking the number of visitors, Medicaid versus the Medicare individuals that That's the best, the most accurate barometer of folks, who you know who are struggling financially right if they had private insurance before?
If you know, people who need health, insur health care, send them to us or their nearest community health, center.
A program meet community need like there was this question about funding.
Hey, I'd like to first say what or to duplicate what Jessica said, but I think the fact that you guys have stayed open the entire time and not laid anybody off, except for the two dentists, given the Dentistry rules is phenomenal.
There is a city testing site which I have the address in my office, not in my bedroom, the Chelsea center, it's on 28th and 9th thanks.
Yes, if I'm understanding correctly, is that some people in reaction to the flu shot, get like a little bit of a fever If you're in a high-risk group or have some sort of conditions and think that there's like you have not just been quarantined in your own in your own space and you might have been exposed--is to try to get a test.
Next, on the agenda, we have a committee discussion regarding homelessness, and, while I know Joe. You want to put the letter up so while we're, I, actually it's in the letter, but I-think I wanted to share anyway with committee, because I'm not sure.
If not more, we highlight the number of social services in Community, board, 4 and that have already existed, and then we add in the significant increase due to relocation sites, and we talk about what our main concerns.
The idea that these temporary relocations happen in a very unordered unplanned way and when you put it in perspective, the city noted that it relocated approximately 10,000 single adults in shelter and to our neighborhood now originally we're 21 2142 That is roughly 20 of the entire relocation it did in the city of New York, and that's why I believe we have our problems regarding this public safety issues, because it was not planned, not thought out and the building types that folks are relocated into for the providers and the shelter residents are just not adequate or properly programmed for that.
I believe it was on 36Th, Street, and I know that they're going to be using be able to use like Metro Baptist space starting this month for some programming.
So the question is: Why has it improved and can that whatever work there can that be taken to other problematic shelters like 6Th, Street, great question, jd, something that actually Joe has discussed it and talked about it before openly in meetings?
And, I think, really sitting down with the mayor's office in DHS and coming up with a plan as to how we're going to manage this.
We do not have political support and we're not going to accomplish reducing that density or pressuring any of these facilities to go ahead and provide the services needed to ensure the safety of those residents and the safety of our other residents.
Has it in his power to assist in the density issue, to assist in working with DHS on these facilities, providing the services needed for the public safety of those residents and the other residents within the community, so Cory's office is there.
He should be actually doing the work What the next letter coming out of this committee for this month, and that is working for a meeting of all the elected officials with the board to really sit and respond to us on the letter that we sent we're.
So I think that's a great idea with our follow-up letter, saying now that we've asked for this meeting with the mayor's office and the administration also meeting with our elected officials to deal with this, because we have to keep the pressure up to get people to engage.
I mean you guys are a lot closer to this, probably too close for your preference, but the press you know like the Lucerne topic, is like I'm hearing it every freaking day on the radio you hear lower Manhattan residents talking about how they do not want these places moved.
People on 36th Street now on 10th Avenue is a little bit better, but who knows, as we have to get some standard practice on how things are managed, otherwise we're going to go down to a black hole, again wait!
We are super clear on what the concerns are and it's you know around 36th and 37th street, and while I certainly appreciate it's a good idea to ask for a letter, I, actually think that it would be lovely and faster.
And I think if we just make a very specific proposal and ask them to sign on to it as opposed to like come talk to us, some more because I we've done the work, we know what needs to be done.
Well, I, think you're about to remember, too that if there were less people in each hotel, there would be more space to help people and provide some kind of services.
I just want to say that on 36th street I know it's a different situation than the rest of Hell's kitchen.
We have to have some hard discussions, which I see that the community board is willing to do, and I want to let my other fellow neighbors speak, but I would just ask that, when those conversations do occur, that a the community board is in the room, as I'm sure they would be, and I'd also just like to request that someone from 36th Street be in the room to give the perspective of what it's like as a resident to to be living on this block during current times.
But it also is that the police department, my wife and I-have seen people arrested and literally back on the street three hours later, not even like nothing happened and the cops they come.
So I know New York, one and gothamist have had some information on what's going on around here, but there's far less buzz in the media concerning our neighborhood than there has been for the upper West side, which is has as everybody's remark, is a much less serious situation.
You know the police take their take their direction from the mayor's office, We could get more support and the Midtown south precinct is on 35th street.
Driveway comes out onto 36th street on this block and they are not getting the direction or the support from the mayor to actually be able to do from a safety.
We one of the community boards that have the highest number of affordable housing or new developments coming up in or in the city actually has the highest number of rent new rents of rent stabilized units and that's directly related to the affordable housing production that happened through the rezonings of West, Chelsea and Hudson yards, and it's really made a major difference, but I think it's time to help for the public to see.
You do not even feel safe, walking down the street just from Kovitz I mean I, guess that could happen too, but just fearful of for my health , Okay, sorry, my husband and I, are on 37th street between 8th and 9th, and I want to echo what so many people have said.
You just want to know thanks all the residents for coming tonight and being serious, and it is very hard for all of us on this committee.
Based on my experience with this issue and my own observations, the conversations, the meetings, it seems The lack of assistance from the mayor's office, the speaker, Nyb NYPD, pulling back extremely limited services that are happening at the shelter sites.
I. Think it's also about the culture that the nonprofit providers, have, and I want to highlight the thing to me Is how this impacts the residents of the block, everything that they're saying I They're, not exaggerating, including from what I've heard from CB4 members who live in the community, including like, for example, someone told me.
I, do not walk up down that street anymore unless I'm with my husband, So I, just want to highlight that this has serious impact on the permanent residents who live on the block, and I am glad and thankful, and appreciative of everyone who spoke tonight, keep coming back to our meetings.
You know when all is done and done, and we hopefully come to some kind of resolution for this homeless crisis that we're having in your communities like 36th, Street and some of the other locations.
Keep these items still front and center that we've always advocated for the top ones from this committee have been very specific projects on affordable housing, but they've also been on improvements within NYCHA, and then we also highlighted a lot of issues and concerns for prevention of homeless services and maintaining programs that that keep people from taking homelessness.
We vote for continuing support for this number of affordable housing developments and then continuing support on the expense side for the homeless, for the prevention issues and the mental health that we've asked for before, and then anything else we'll have one more go: The budget committee will be meeting next week, so it would be really important to get any feedback or recommendations from this group now Then we will put that into the to the meeting and bring everyone synthesize all of the different committee's recommendations and then it.
, two months in a row, continuing support on the affordable housing and some of the services and then the new one, just you can just put them in and we'll ask the budget Committee to try to synthesize.
