Those to remind everyone, Jessie and the office created a essentially a worksheet online, where you could put in Second piece was to review the statement of district needs, Whatever's left of it to go in just even focus on the section you committed to again The letter is talking about FY 22, so we want to eliminate any references to previous years, so I will send that back.
Unfortunately, not everyone completed the survey, but we have almost 300 people who did complete the survey and with that we asked people to first identify the three issues that they believe need: expanded, funding , I think that our long- standing priorities matter, but that we should also acknowledge what people sort of on the street are saying right.
As we look to prioritize and take these take all of these various requests on the capital expense that we have, I think we should just try to keep all of these different.
You can see here 60 50 pages plus of comments, and our thinking was that we would then take this and kind of bring it back to each committee less that this would necessarily inform any budget request at this time because it is preliminary and these issues maybe have not been heard by committees themselves, but the committees can take them and use this as an opportunity to be less reactive.
I do not want to conflate that with a budget issue christine, you have your hand up It seems to me that the top line that you showed is really not totally reflective like healthcare and human service.
Kids are not in school kind of narrative, Right, okay, I'm, going to just stop sharing for a second Ever People are talking about homelessness, sanitation, underlying all of this, the subtext and talking about hospitals and is the pandemic Yeah sure and the economic effects of the pandemic and the economic effects reverberating through the city.
This is what people are saying, right, and so I think it's important that we reflect that in the context of we are in a special time.
These have been the major concerns that are impacting our community in real time, and we need to ensure that the budget protects some of has some protections put in to ensure that we do not worsen these problems, and then I think that the main categories Alan.
I, actually think that it may not be a good idea to re- prioritize our long- standing district concerns because they're going to exist.
That could be the Covid-19, response, and I think that also it does need to be more informed, as throughout this year we get more input which we will from our partners that are in education, and your committee is very strong in terms of getting that input.
When we talk about our district needs, what are the long- term's effect on all of these items that we have as priorities because sanitation, so the garbage does not get picked up on a corner for a couple of days and people throw this stuff out there as funds come back in sanitation will straighten itself out when you have kids out of school when you do not prioritize or somehow keep kids in schools or make their learning abilities to overcome the deficiencies of not being in school.
I agree with what I heard Alan say, because a lot of this is going to depend upon November 3rd, because you know it's clear that what Speaker Pelosi wants to do in terms of providing money to cities and states depending upon what happens, November 3rd, that will either become part of the federal budget or it won't, If that money is coming, in, like Alan, said easy problems like the trash getting picked up because they cut back, sanitation will get fixed, and I.
Three four and five, I was saying, upgrade school from ACES right, replace the limiters and other affordable housing requests, which was adequate capital for HPD at the Harborview terrace?
Think we do have on number three for ACES is additional books for students to practice at home and lending libraries I'm just reading off what district 2 sent me as far as the superintendent's their priorities?
We're, saying it's not actually your second capital priority It's going to go, move into the expense side.
The ask for HPD, wait a minute, but when we can select all of those right, And I know you mean like an even bigger renovation, but I think even residents were like wow- There's money.
Schools have gotten away from that, and this is more, as this says, classroom libraries in the future, which is good Janine, the line where you just put move to group two that actually needs to go down to where it says bump up to second capital.
Second, capital, ask: we want to put a two, a two there: okay, great Okay, so now in tier three, we have another downsizing, a shelter, ADA compliance for pedestrian ramps, a ferry service.
Jesse thinks it was, but Steve did not get back to us today on whether or not it indeed has been funded and then just on the Clinton hell's kitchen land use the fairy things should not have been in their nchrklu right,, it's a transportation fans or what wpe?
There are less bets there currently because of Covid-19, but You know when there's a vaccine available, so I guess I need to think about that one, a little bit more and talk it over with some folks.
I. Think the most important thing here, though, is going to be establishing a new family, a permanent family, shelter in the district, because we do not have any the family shelters we do have I do not think we have had a letter, a resolution to ask, for what do you mean interesting?
What I mean is that we have not seen a letter from HHS asking for such a discussion on the family, We look at the language, it says, downsize a single men's shelter and establish and add new family shelter.
Okay, downsizing does not mean converting nobody's asking votes, it does not say, eliminate the BRC and have a family shelter in place of it.
Getting combined into one, if you remember years and years, ago, right so ever since BRC started, we have been on record for saying we think it's too many beds.
You know we still think Brc's should be reduced, but we do want to have a family shelter return to our to our area, and so that's the So. It looks to me that we should have two entries in this day and age right and one of them should be establish a new family, children, shelter and then the downsized BRC would move way down in the priorities.
You can make that note, here, maybe even in column g like not in that very column, but next to line 12 or in line 12, that this is going to be about establishing a new family, shelter.
Okay, so it sounds like ACES I mean personally, I mean we're not doing a lot of sorting within, but school cameras feel less important than I.
Okay, so is our top priority education remotely the these all feel so minuscule to me in the age of Covid-19, every single one on this list actually sort of falls flat in what I think is a neat.
So one thing with this top list: is, I think at least the ACES is actually directly related to Covid-19, which is the remote learning and the funding for remote learning, And I mean I.
They did not completely connect it to Covid-19, but they did say that it was some of the stuff that they prioritized was sort of, because a result of the Covid-19 programs that were results of Covid-19, and so I think you guys can decide whether you want to stick with the original idea, which was to keep with our the fundamental or regular priorities and then have a separate Covid-19 list or integrate it and try to say you know what this year is going to be different.
You said right if you, if you do not mind, I'd like to make ADA compliant number four okay, because they have been dragging, I mean you.
I mean you know, okay, the clue, one for elevators under g right.
I mean, I think everyone knows my concern about that.
Just in the vein of Jessica, saying the having the public be some sort of participant in this, they did come to us with a 500 person petition about resurfacing that dog, Park, and I think.
Does Hk park mean what does Hk park You missed the chat and my shrinking of language before Hell's Kitchen, Park, renovation, okay, It's, not the DEP site park, The dog run right.
Right., Chelsea, elliott, So I, think we should just say in all public housing in our neighborhood in our district.
Remember Jeff, we're going to put the dog party: Okay, I think that after the tow pound moving up housing feels right.
Do not know which we're going to replace The hell's Kitchen Park ask with the resurfacing of the do it.
I'm saying then we should put the dog one up higher than what, though, because it's 19 now Probably four wpe requests tucked right in right at the bottom of our rank, In a row when outside space, I know capitals, long, term.
If you could keep going or maybe heat someone else about, you know the big ass first, the things that can be done like if we ask for a dog park renovation that can be a win that can be done.
I mean I'd much rather put Hell's kitchen park there and then put the dog run below the ferry and look Leslie we're going to But 400 thousand dollars does not get you a new park.
We will send this back to everyone for a final review to catch things like what we just caught, which is you know, an optics issue that sometimes you can't see when you're so up close And I'm going to suggest that we now move as quickly as possible through the expense budget or get as far as we can in the time we have do.
You know other issues related to homelessness or education that are going to come before and I do not want to give up all of our top slots.
It's, a multi- committee request, but I also agree that in the during this time, if we're going to prioritize Covid-19 related, you know top issues.
Do not think that our budget request is saying this resolves it, but I think that you we need to continue to advocate for funds to homeless, issues.
Long- term success, When you're talking about job training, education and when people when families move out of shelter, usually they have no support system in place and that's the idea of having you know case management.
I just want to make remind people that we have made expanding homeless outreach programs We put it into Cs because in the years previous to Kyovid, there's been so much funding put towards that and they have doubled up on their staff, and Things like that.
No really, I should probably be picking the other homelessness issue, but I feel like the tech support is needed.
I. Do not know, I wonder if after school should be further up, because it's the kids, I agree with you, but the only thing I say is going back to what you put it out in capital.
