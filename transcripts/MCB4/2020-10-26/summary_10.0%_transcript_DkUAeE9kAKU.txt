I've got some ideas about that, but rather than listen to myself, maybe we could open the discussion on mainly expense budget items and Covid-19 related items.
You know budgeting for getting budget information by from two ways, one from tenant associations Right and literally just calling up the tenant associations for Fulton, Elliot, Chelsea and harborview and saying what do you guys, need?
You, know the Chelsea NYCHA working group so much and wanted to make sure that we were advocating-But. It can be, it's usually all capital.
What we're doing now is the very early stages of what are the budget priorities from our community district right And we're taking a perspective from the land, Use committee.
Are there things within the city budget that we think need to be beefed up, whether it's a ongoing expense or a capital expense?
If the NYCHA working group has any land use, perspective, items that are coming out, that maybe housing will address something on the budget priority from the Nitro working group, but we as Lane juice, perspective.
I personally think that at this point in the city's economic situation, that those things do not feel to me to be high priority, those ones that we've had on our list-You know for a long time and that we may want to try to generate some new recommendations more relevant to our situation in the city.
I, send you an email, but that you had been talking at the last meeting about retrofitting or converting buildings that are underused or empty into other land uses, which I thought I thought is very relevant at this point: Or it could be relevant and that we could request funding for certain studies along those lines and you'd think that maybe architecture schools are looking at that already architectural schools.
I'm, looking at that, actually, even before Kowitt's truck for a variety of reasons, so New York City is known to have pretty high what you call it vacancy rate, irrespective of what happens the pandemic, but because the pandemic, I think the vacancy rate in housing apartments is 13.8 now and that's the data that actually is generally collected by HPD and real estate.
We want to make a recommendation for some kind of funding, which would be an expense item for some kind of study, along the lines of what we're talking, about, and so you know, could be DCP EDC, DHS HPD, some collaborative effort, because it seems there's It could be for office, spaces, I'm, not sure yet, because there is not enough data to suggest that it's warranted.
We could request that kind of a study through HPD because they are actually the keepers of you know how the vacancy, and because that affects their sort of what do you call it their mandate in terms of brand stabilization and land control issues EDC would come into play when we talk about industry, city or some other large.
If we wanted to go down this road, that we might recommend two different kinds of study, one about residential issues and one about industrial commercial office building uses so different, And I agree with you Betty as a as an advisory group.
So now I mean there are a lot of good ideas on the table and it does not matter which committee does it, but As a community board, I think a kind of clear agenda as to how we want the street space reshaped, moving forward, so there's more room for the pedestrians and more amenities for the community, including outdoor dining, and whatever else that follows absolutely.
The important thing for us is the difference between vacancy and emptiness Yeah, because vacancy reports are not going to address the land use issues that we're trying to tackle.
All right, I know that when I walk around Chelsea and Hell's kitchen And I pass by the sidewalk cafes Let's Betty, do you want to recap, then what we're going to actually vote?
So that's one thing, and if we follow up on Brad's idea, funding, I, guess I guess: I mean we have to always talk about money, because it's a budget so funding to support sidewalk cafes and that's as far as I could get, It seemed that I do not know whether we have a consensus about asking for money for studies.
I have one tiny item to bring up having to do with open streets, which is budgeting for the expenses that are presently being born by individuals and the block associations to maintain the barriers replace them when they get wrecked and purchase the signage that's needed to mount on those barriers.
I know that when I was on that committee, we talked about that a lot I think that's a transportation issue.
That's still a land use issue And you know, I'm conflicted with the notion of putting forward these priorities and also having budget constraints and being realistic abroad, as you recognize floating farms and floating homeless, shelters, Is, a grand scheme I think in when we have a stronger budget.
In again in future years, so to keep our the other things that were in the budget request from last year, such as code enforcement, issues, building, department, building issues, land use on neighborhood Let's talk about water, farms.
I think you're raising a very valid point, a very valid concern, and maybe what we do is try to tackle it at one of our meetings and come up with a letter to the appropriate agencies to change policy right, directly.
So I mean if we just want to agree as a committee we'll just leave any ongoing budget line items in there as placeholders.
That you, as reported by the agency, I, am not saying that you know the problem is solved, but you did get something funded last year, so one of the one of the expense items was listed as being funded, so I would just say: If that's okay, we can either move to continued support level which is sort of a rank below or just remove it completely and saying.
If the committee's in agreement that we're going to keep the budget priorities from last year and as Jesse points out, anything that is continued funding will leave on anything.
You know like, as Jesse pointed out, we'll clean out the list, but everything else says I think Betty, you said you'd had meetings with DCP This has to do with the luxury high rises going in along the high line where they you know they asked to exceed the 20 parking spaces.
We have to recognize that, whatever I think you guys are discussing right, now, the top priorities to the one two, three, the things that you want to send to the budget task force.
Think it's a more logical way of getting the funding, for that As long as you and Paul work on the together afterwards and submit something to the budget task force that it clarifies those What agency you're expecting the request to go to and if it's a, whether it's capital or expense?
I think it sounds like what you guys done is actually combined table two and three into sort of our top priority ones that we just talked about.
I am not from defending NYCHA all here at this point, but that's their big ticket items you're all right about it , That's why we go to the tas, because if we say the boilers and the roofs and the elevators, their response is going to say, We're working on it right, and That one of the reasons why we historically have gone to the tenant associations is Because.
I'm, going to the budget task force, Last year, with the with some of the Chelsea elliott requests.
But, again, I, think it speaks to a broader conversation about how we can get NYCHA more inclusive or how we can be more inclusive, with NYCHA going forward with our budget, because it's always been a bit of a kind of last minute type of quick call kind of thing rather than a You know.
