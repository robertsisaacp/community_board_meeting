I'm joined by my colleagues, lily, Gordon Covid-19, Brian, Parrott and Caitlin Toner from Dot's bike share program as well as Colleen chatter goon from the Manhattan office, who many of you also have the pleasure of working with so last year, DOT embarked on our five- year phase three CitiBike expansion alongside our partner lifts, and this is going to double the size of the bikeshare system, Triple, the number of available bikes in the program and since CitiBike launched in 2013, new yorkers and visitors have turned time and again to the CitiBike system as a healthy, safe, fast and affordable transportation.
Three expansion in Manhattan started this spring and I will let you know lily, go into a little bit more detail into what we've done so far, but as the bikeshare system grows into new neighborhoods ridership into the existing service area is going to grow as well.
So I wanted to thank the committee again for giving us the opportunity to present- Covid-19 And I'm, with the bike share group at DOT.
These include seat posts and handlebars baskets things like that, as well as disinfecting bikes when they're docked at high use stations near hospitals and the crews are using social distance practices in the field and while handling bikes and then the other key piece is the critical workforce membership program which began in March, where Lyft and in partnership with the city was able to offer free member annual memberships to essential workers.
This will support increased demand from the phase three service areas, folks on the outer part of the system coming in as well as help us meet existing unmet demand when riders can't find a bike or a dock.
It will be a rolling installation and we will be covering multiple community boards at one time coming back to community boards over the course of the following years, and the iterative planning process will help us address changes in demand.
We have a few different ways that we want to do this infill project through our design toolbox, so the first is to add new stations, and the second is to expand existing stations by adding new docks to stations that are already on the ground and then the third is creative design solutions like 3d bridging which you can see here on in this photo, which will allow us to have stations that are both on the sidewalk and road bed.
You know whenever you put something on the sidewalk, the people going to the lane, to the parking or from the parking right on the sidewalk, and it's not something we want to encourage, especially because you are just acrosss a large complex with a lot of seniors.
Why does not just the thing is that you know once you have that you have people riding on the sidewalk to get to the station In our neighborhood.
I think, especially since we've seen with Covid-19 We've, seen less compliance rather than more compliance when it comes to sidewalk writing and by the way , a lot of what we did not used to see before a lot of CitiBikes on the sidewalk, which is upsetting so the bottom line is we do not want it on the sidewalk right.
Thank you all for coming and being here, You know, I think it's great that you're putting these in the area, especially if you put them on the street, but the thing is: If I.
It's, just for us in Manhattan and just parts of Brooklyn and a neighborhood here, And there thrown in what's your connectivity plan and what And like, if you, if I'm going to buy from Coney island to my office or to my work, I, need electric bikes, so So, first on the electric bike, so Lyft is continuing to add new electric bikes to the fleet.
I'm a frequent rider, but not only do I think that you know having docks on the sidewalk is dangerous for pedestrians.
You've heard me mention this before, because we've talked about it in my professional cap with gansevoort street issues and having a sidewalk station there, but this is significant, given the fact that when the city begins to bustle again, our sidewalk space will be precious and we need to prioritize people as much as possible in terms of their feet and then bikes and then very small space leave for cars.
One thing I would be very interested in seeing DOT implementing with this expansion of the CitiBike program is taking another look at the bike stations and seeing.
If there's an opportunity that, while we're in the street, where is it, which is a great place to park, bicycles, to incorporate free bike parking racks for nine CitiBikes, so that way, riders, that are that are doing one better than CitiBike, which is owning our own bicycles and maintaining them ourselves will also be part of the amenities that are that are happening to us.
We have partnerships that provide discounted memberships to NYCHA residents and snack recipients and wanting to make sure folks know that those are available, and also just doing cyclist, cycling, education, so that people understand this is a system that works for me.
Are the rules of the road, all those kinds of things, so we're looking, I think, at trying to figure out how to maximize those opportunities, how to expand even to folks who are low income, but are not nitro residents or snap recipients and strengthening our partnerships with local community groups and local cycling groups that are already entrenched in their neighborhoods and understand the needs of their constituents.
Is you know, sort of reiterating what christine said is when you put bike track on sidewalks, you just send a message.
You know citywide plan, so you know, there's lots of good reasons why putting bike parking associated with the CitiBike docks Would be, would be a brilliant idea, and you know particularly considering that your current program for putting him in the street is not viable because of the way it's established been established, thanks, I had an individual complaint to me, or you mentioned to me that the bikes were not stopping on time, especially when they pressed on the the the the part that stops the bikes or makes an attempt to stop the bikes.
That looks like a wrench on the dock and you can press that button which will take the bike out of service for other riders and also signal to the operations team that it needs to be looked.
You know the preference in this community and at least in this committee, and this community board would be to take space from cars instead of pedestrians when it comes to placement of racks or docks.
But to the second question- Or I, guess your second point about city rack installations over the last year, I will say that Kova definitely put a halt, as one would guess, to a lot of our non- essential work for some time, but our public space unit has been working on our bike recovery plan to essentially kind of cover areas: City- wide, where we are installing additional bike, parking facilities and capacity to help with this increased demand in cycling.
We look to place stations near schools and any really large amenities, so school museum shopping, plaza anywhere, where there's going to be a lot of activity and people coming to or from we want to have a station there.
And, we'll frankly, continue to look into as outdoor dining is becoming a more permanent fixture in New York , City Thank you another wrinkle, dale and reason to take up more space from cars for cyclists.
I can read out your question if hello, yes ,, please hi several of these of these racks and thank you for expanding the one on West 22Nd street, better to have the racks there than the cars, even though some folks on the block were a little upset that they saw so many bikes.
It has become more and more dangerous for pedestrians, especially elderly people, to get their you know, bikes are on the sidewalk Although I've seen those I mean, I.
I do not know what we can do, but if you're adding all these bikes, I'd really like to know how you're going to enhance enforcement so that the streets are safe so that pedestrians and other cyclists, I mean the cyclists, who are abiding by all the rules, are in as much danger as the pedestrians.
In addition to enforcement, that we need to have a renewed sense of education, we have a lot of some of our typical education components like on- street teams and going to schools going to different businesses to educate people on how to safely ride a bike and what the rules of the road are.
Think it's a great reminder not only about the need for enforcement, but also the need for education, and you know, I think, the, as well as looking to place stations in the street as much as possible, which we appreciate.
Does your mobile interface have like basic instructions for riders on riding safely in New York, or should it the city, the CitiBike app I know, there's been some renewed conversations around rider training and having folks go through a quick demonstration or a quick set of slides on their phone about rider safety and rules of the road, but , great hi, I tuned in a little bit late, but Brian weber, a public member, a resident of West, 36Th Street and the co- chair of the very nascent Avenue did not know that it was coming back, but residents are very glad to see it reduces the number of cars that double park on that corner next to other cars.
I'd, really like to understand how we got to 70, and maybe we need a bike lane on 22nd street.
Yes, there is paint, that's Jennifer Jimmy, of course, thanks Brian and so Susan, just to speak a little bit more to you know your request, your suggestion of adding in a bike lane on 22nd 20th, street.
We DOT is willing to look at So thanks for your support of like infrastructure, acrosss, the city I think we have fairly exhausted this subject and we need to move on to some other topics on the agenda.
I have an open street between seventh and eighth and anything would potentially remove parking I believe we have a presentation from our friends at the EDC on the pier 79 ferry expansion.
We have seen a steady increase and recently as high as 60 to 70 percent of ridership from last year is actually riding now, something that shows us that our recovery for our slice of the ridership of the transportation modes in New, York City, is starting to see that recovery, and so we're excited to see those numbers come back.
Everything was purpose built for NYC ferry, meaning that we do have lower emissions, quieter, vessels, a more stable ride, which is generally noticeable when you're on some of the longer hull, routes, and also one of the things that we think is important is that we're also creating less weight than some of the older vessels just because technology has improved and designs have improved on catamaran style vessels in the harbor please.
First of all, there are changes to travel, behavior that are working in our favor and by in our favor Fewer people are using the shuttle bus to access the pier 79 area, either to or from the landing which, from a local perspective, is good information, because that means that fewer people are creating demand for those buses to come back to a full system.
They are still committed to doing so next year and sort of finding the times that it makes the most sense to bring traffic flag people and to put them at the two intersections that are needed in terms of other operations.
It does sound like there continues to be both an interest and a need for some long- term visioning in terms of how to recreate access points here, which is, you know, a longer and bigger capital, planning, process and project.
I. Definitely think that we would be much more supportive of using existing buses absolutely, but would also use this moment to recognize that waterways is actually in a bit of a violation of their lease, given the fact that they use the area for parking and layover, which has become a problem in particular at night time and Jeffrey.
What they've said is that yes, of course, the total slice of people who are using the ferry and the terminal is much smaller, but what they are surprised by Is that the proportion of those people using it is even smaller for bus access, meaning that, since people who were using buses were generally going towards places further.
You know they have retained, essentially the local customers and they have lost the faraway customers if local, If the difference between local and far away is distributed on their bus, routes, I think that's what it sounds like and the bike station.
Think that should encourage that, and maybe a good signaling sign signage would be a good thing to do to say you have a protected bike lane so and 42Nd. Are you talking to MTA to try to get the terminal to move over or not?
It sounds like you're saying that the in order to leverage the m42 SBS for ferry, riders, I think you're, suggesting that there be the terminal, be moved to be in front of pier 79 displacing the buses, some of which go acrosss town, but many of which go in many directions, not served by that.
Yes, the area from 29th to 44th street is Kind of the last big, not yet in process fully plan planning zone for Hudson river park, aside for our river research and education center down in Tribeca, and it is in the queue and we have been working on an RFP for that area, which is pretty complicated given all of the transportation and other uses that have leases and lots of issues.
It's, something we're going to have to be talking with you all about, because I think it's probably a zone that would be addressed almost in phases, because there are more open space opportunities in some areas and in some areas it's really more like enhanced, vehicular, passageways or pedestrian passageways.
That's going in a north- south pattern, given the number of subways that are doing, you know pretty close to the same thing, and so making ferries competitive at scale has always been really challenging.
Although the marketing has changed, I, think the fundamentals have not, and I think New York City is still putting the people at the back of the bus, and I wanted to give you some of the examples.
Why are the pedestrian restricted to the sidewalk and crosswalk when we have started to do it up to the destinations that we wanted and while we use the roadway requires permit and payments except for parking when so many activity, private activities are permitted to encroach on the sidewalk, with no permit and no cost, and although we support covered 19 for small businesses, why would we let permanent open, dining privatize, the curve?
It's called congestion, but pedestrian and cyclists have to ask for a permit and even on the sidewalk pedestrian, have to ask for a permit when people chant industry demonstration, when car screams and Yell Honk in the streets it's normal and when marchers block in the street, they go to jail, but cars block the traffic I mean I just wanted to open the discussion for everybody to chime in and give their thoughts and see whether we could design a program.
There has been totally uneven distribution of street space between the pedestrian and the cars 27 of New York, City's roadways of our cars, pretty much, but it's for a very small percentage of the population, because car ownership, as we know, is much lower in Manhattan and other parts of the city compared to Outer.
You know compared to auto boroughs and suburbs, so I think now, with curvat 19 situation, claiming part of the parking lane for expansion of sidewalks could be some.
So I, think we do need more of diversity, diverse opinion on our committee, but the and the last thing I wanna You know.
Okay, that you know we do have people that have a good deal of expertise on our committee generating a lot of these thoughts.
If we are trying to think strategically and tragically about how to be, you know more impactful, going forward, there's an element of scale and then joining forces if there's some common principles or even just policies that multiple of our community boards in Manhattan agree that they want to support.
You know it's, it looks like the whole city is functioning for the cars and the drivers and not for the people, and you look at all these layers and you see that all everything is slanted.
We put this because you know we had, especially when the bike lane in Ninth Avenue was coming in, and so we were suggesting red turn arrows because of the danger of people crossing green light, green lights.
The entire city has got these split signals everywhere, especially in Manhattan, and it started, I think, with our transportation committee's discussion so and the bike corrals.
A lot of times is not curb adjacent because the bike lane is next to the curb, and then you have the street dining kind of in the parking lane, which is between the bike lane and the traffic.
If somehow the committee could recommend, I do not know who's issuing the permits for the street dining, but just some sort of limit on how close they can get to a corner where there is a conflicting turn movement that would probably help just keep everyone a little bit.
Second thing: is, I think we know the DOT is supposed to come back to us with a study of the rest of the Eighth Avenue So I would be happy to to send a resolution covering those three things.
Have you know a warning to drivers that there's a hidden bike, lane That goes for a lot of places in the city Maybe.
This is before we even start talking about the pedestrian issues and ensuring the clearance on the sidewalk thanks That I bike on 45th and 8th.
You, know, I'm sure nobody on this in this committee ever is on a bike and runs a red light, but I always look both ways.
There are a number of areas of potential conflict between at cars, turning left and bicyclists on the bike lane that need to be addressed, and so you know thank you so much for bringing this to our attention, and I think that this is definitely That's, something that DOT needs to take.
And so I think that there is a massive issue of enforcement which is not going to get better until you know middle of next year, And then, after that.
I'm, not surprised, I'm at first Did , you can't leave I've been a staff member on these meetings before when I worked for city of Arinda, Okay, I'm going to move on quickly to the next item, which is helicopter safety, one second, just to kind of keep it on the recording.
They designed the loophole and now they're exploiting it right, and that was actually said when the first legislation went, through, which I think was 2016, was that well, these people are just going to move to New Jersey and they promptly did that But they're, still not obeying the law.
We send a letter to these people and say you know: Do you realize that it's the they are breaking the law in New York City It's, not clear to me that they're actually breaking the law as it stands, though I do not think they're breaking though they're following prescribed, Faa they're a nuisance to the we can say, they're a nuisance to the residents of our district nuisance and they're hazard.
This is the area that I'm talking about it's 30th street, between ninth and dire There's, a number of Ddc construction, project, sort of storage areas on the site, some on 31st street, some on 30th- We found out recently that Ddc will be turning over a portion of this area to DOT, meaning it will be paved, and you know back into regular use.
We see this as a really congested construction, heavy block, and we would like to do a little interim greening before we could work through a longer term plan where we would you know, do other types of enhancements, but for sort of the foreseeable future, we'd like to do something- We see this as an opportunity since D.O.T is about to take control back over this portion of the street.
Yet, it looks like D.O.T has said they can use our block for outdoor recreational activities and they can close it down to parking cars during those periods.
I. Do not think it's a good block for this to for this to be open streets for the school.
