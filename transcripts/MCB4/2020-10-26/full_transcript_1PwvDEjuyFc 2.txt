This conference will now be recorded. How are you it's Jesse from CB4 Hey Jesse? What's going on, I was just figuring out how to unmute. This is my first time using this service yeah. This is, we went the begin at the very beginning of the lockdown before they had let us know about. They were purchasing zoom for us. We had went off and bought this, and so this is our backup because we're holding another committee meeting at 6:30, so we can't be on the same system with two different groups. Right I have. I have a zoom meter as well at 6:30.. What I was going to say is, I think you can do another meeting like so, for instance, say you're having an upcoming meeting and so there's a chair. You can make them the host leave that meeting and then start another meeting. As long as you make that person the host, I was not sure about that and we've never tested it that way. So I did not want to. I did not want to test it out in a real time experience so right, yeah, you might want to you, might want to try it out, as I tried it out the other day for the first time, and you know, I gave someone the host capabilities, I left the meeting and then I used that same account to log into another meeting. So that's interesting, maybe I'll. Try that yeah or just you know, do a test run hi cicely. This is Jesse beaudine from Qcb4 hi. How are you good? Thank you for making it today just getting my earpiece, hey, jeffy, hi varan. How are you hey? How are you let me get the lights on Jesse? Can you hear me? We can't hear you Baron. Can you hear us, I think, is the question so hello, everyone, this is Karen Rory. Can you see me? I can't hi. This is a new program. For me, the cameras, the camera should be down by the bottom. The camera tab should be down at the bottom of your screen by the Mic I'll share my webcam, okay. There. I am okay. Thank you. Everybody you're very great. Thank you for making oh you're welcome my pleasure Karen. Do you think you'll be able to still share your screen the same on this newer platform? I may need to get some advisement on that. How would I do that so Karen? I I've made it possible for people to share the screen just because it made it. I think, and make it simpler for everybody today, so you should be able to see down by where you right next to the camera and by the Mic tab. There should be a screen share. Your screen function button. If you see it at the bottom of your screen, where the Mic and the camera, I I'm on an ipad so sure so, wherever you push to turn on your camera right next to it should be the let's share your screen function. This is on an ipad would be on an ipad Karen. Do you feel? Did you see where that do you see where it says Mic, where you can turn on your mic, all right, you're, looking at the screen, you see, you see all the boxes of everyone right, everyone's picture. Okay, if you scroll your mouse or your finger, if you're using the ipad to the bottom you're going to see where it says, Mic, Camera and screen, do you see that it would be on the bottom? No right, so you probably have to so what I'm doing is I'm moving my mouse over it on the bottom? But if you do not have your mouse just move your finger there and the icon should appear at the bottom. No, I'm not saying that hey you're on an ipad Jesse. Do you think that Karen can email you the presentation without help I would not be able to. I can't email it. It's a really huge file, yeah, I'm looking at Chat. I do not see anything there for that. How about this I'm going to make you the Presenter Karen, I'm going to see if that gives you that ability? Okay, that's your screen again when the bottom of your screen, where you see the Mic Camera now, do you see a screen option? Yes, I see ipad screen. Okay, now, okay, all right! Let me just call up my books. Okay, I think I'm okay, should I start broedcasting now or well. Let's just do a test run. Let's do it, let's see if you, if you, if you press, share your screen on it, then let's see if it pops up for us. Okay. Yes, it does yeah. Okay, perfect, that's fine! So if you want to unshare, Karen that'd be great and then let Veren and katie start the meeting and then we'll let you share back into it. Okay, let me just I do not think I shared my screen yet. Let me see, can you see this? I can see, we see, we see it. Okay, great yeah, they're, all good! It looks great all right great there we go. Thank you with that. Why do not we officially kick off our meeting right now, so welcome everyone. This is our monthly meeting of the social and racial justice task force, which is a slightly new name, which we will talk about in a little while, but this is our group that is a part of community board for that form. This group formed in June and we've been talking about a lot of really important issues and we're glad that you can all be with us this evening. Veron- and I are both the co- chairs of this committee, and we have some interesting things on our agenda to discuss this evening. We just want to go through a couple of quick logistics. Just as a quick reminder, this meeting is being recorded and because this is on a different platform, we may need a little bit of guidance from people more expert than me as to you know how we can all participate in a way and raise our hands and do that sort of thing. We will also be taking minutes of our meeting this evening and darren or Jesse. What am I forgetting about our general announcements? We need to make anything else. That's pretty much it. I think we're using the chat. I mean again it matters how so, if Karen, if you can unshare your screen, just because right now, very tiny, at least in my screen, you see your desktop, which you might not want us to see my desktop. I can't even see it- oh I'm not sure, okay, we're getting some of our logistics worked out at the moment and Jesse. I understand that you will be leaving us after a little while six o'clock, but I think maybe putting questions into the chat might be a way of doing the or at least saying into the chat raising your hand. So, therefore, you have a running list of people that if they have questions you can call on them as they have Jeffy one quick jeffy. One quick question is this being broedcast to public yeah? It is not being broedcast live, it's not being streamed live, but obviously anybody that goes to our website or receive the database. This is a public meeting, and so they could call in at any time, but we will put this on our website our YouTube channel once the meeting is over and make it live. I mean not a lot recorded okay, and are you also a co- host or something so you can share our agenda and other things later yeah, it looks like my screen actually is open, so I can try and see if it works. Do you want me to try Jesse yeah that'd be great. Let me see if that maybe boots out of the situation, but you can see my screen going to make you the organizer Varen. So therefore the meeting can go on after I leave you'll be able to share your screen. Okay sounds good. Can you write great okay and then it looks like Jesse? I do not know if everybody has control over their own mic or, if everybody's on you, oh you, everybody has control over their own mic. The organizer does have the ability to mute everybody and unmute everybody so base that people are talking over together or the discussion does not moves from a simple discussion into one civil discussion. Aaron has the ability to you know start everything again and everybody can take a deep breath and we can. We can begin again, got it well. I do not have fears about this group great then. Let's see it looks like I see at least initials, but not necessarily everybody's names on this, but I think we do have Quorum. Is that correct? Jesse yeah? You? I believe you do. I it's a little hard for me to see just because unfortunately, we still have parent. This queen is blank. So that's okay! Well, but it looks like numbers- wise. We probably do all right then, with that, actually, if you're in before we start, can you just put up? Do you have a copy of the agenda? We can put there Jesse one of you, let everybody know sort of what we're going to be discussing. I can buy there's someone who has the microphone the chat sure and that will at least give people it from the in the chat. I did not quite hear that Jessica, I'm going to put it in the chat. Okay, great there we go. Oh lovely, there we go Varan's got it, got it lovely okay, so I think everybody else should be able to see this on their screen right now too, thank you for sharing baron. So this is our task force agenda for this evening and, as you can see our very first item up is. We are fortunate to have some representatives from our fellow Community Board Community Board 10 joining us this evening to talk to us about a resolution that they have dealing with some a mural or artwork project in northern central park dealing with the exon rated five. So if we can turn over to that presentation right now, and can you introduce yourselves a little bit and then go from there? We look forward to hearing it hello, everyone I'll start. First, my name is cecily Harris. I am the chair of Community Board 10.. Thank you. Thank you. So much for having us hi everyone. Thank you so much for having us. Thank you, Katherine! Thank you. Baron! Thank you Jesse. I know you Shatik Mitchell, who has Rdm, is on here. I know he's having flashbacks of getting us together on our platform, so thank you so much jesse and everyone for having us here today. So I know Lowell already shared some things with you about our resolution that we had in Burl board meeting, but we really wanted to come and just have a conversation about it, explain how it came about and why we feel.
