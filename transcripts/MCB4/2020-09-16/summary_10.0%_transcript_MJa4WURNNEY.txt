We wanted to add something to new business at some point:: okay, Agenda, all right, The first item on the agenda is the the turning movement at 36th, street.
The little context here is that this is the bike lane going down ninth avenue and at 36th street there is a split phase, I'm, sorry a mixing zone and when the cars are turning, obviously pedestrian as well as bicyclists, are in danger, and there are a lot of conflicts there and john explain your the position of your establishment.
So, let's just try to put the fire out, but I think this is just another reason for us to keep D.O.T accountable for these mixing zones that we've long identified as dangerous, dangerous designs for bicyclists, yeah, colin colleen, You, know on a wednesday night, because you're concerned about safety of people outside of your business.
I know that on 38 and nine this is my street But and now with the issues of budget Unless colin, you have another one that you want to add in the same letter, and we can do that, I'm, not aware of him off the top of my head.
So why don't we make a resolution where we talk about all of ninth avenue where we talk about the construction at you know up there, The resurfacing in between the work, the Saying, okay and by the way.
I, moved that we write a letter targeting this intersection, as well as targeting the rest of the intersections in ninth avenue sort of reiterating the changing them when the resurfacing happens after the construction is finished, right, jacket, Okay, we have carl wilson here from corey's office from cory's office.
They were not allowing anybody onto the block, and I worked, I emailed with the neighborhood community officer and just sort of pleaded, my case, why don't you move the barricades back 20 feet and allow people just to get a city bike and come and go?
We have the same problem, obviously, and for a while we had installed we the times square, alliance, I'm, sorry, the 34th street partnership, but installed some flexible boulevard to define where the ultimate you know where the on sidewalk portion could be and limit it to a certain amount, so that the rest would be really passable.
I understand that a high percentage of the NYPD does not live in new york city, so they have to drive in I mean I would also extend it to my block and 54th between 9th and 10th Is nothing but placard parking, the entire block, so You feel like the entire curb is dedicated to the police force, but I noticed that they have painted lines on the sidewalk.
You know, if we're, if we're going to agree as a community that they're allowed to park on the sidewalk, which I don't necessarily agree with that.
You know the sidewalk is a major issue and we need to have a better delineation between the cars and the pedestrians and making sure it's open and making sure that the people with strollers can go through et cetera, et cetera and therefore recommend that they install those vertical ballards which are very inexpensive, but would be a good signal of you.
No, I think a couple of things then parking on the sidewalk is not permitted in new york, city, so I think we should put something in the letter.
I propose a resolution that we enforce the rules where you can't park on the sidewalk and let them know that would be my resolution.
I'm just saying, like I'm, asking us as a committee to weigh the possible outcomes like we can tell them they're being bad actors in the civic space of the streets of the precincts, and they will say you know they'll trash Can, our letter.
You, know agitated, but I think also they're not supposed to park on the sidewalk, and so I.
I think it's got to go through the electeds, because the electeds maybe stand a chance at wielding some kind of power over a policy issue in the streets.
People cannot go through the sidewalk for distancing and for ada and for you know, strollers, and it really It is illegal to park on the sidewalk and therefore we are asking them to not park on the sidewalk and the emphasis on clearance for social distance reasons for residents also and better communication moving forward.
It was a joint effort of the mayor's office, and oakland has eight city council, members, seven by district and one at large, and they all participated along with a bunch of other stakeholders like their office of disabilities, area, residents, cycling, groups and activists and a couple of non-profit organizations, and then the transit stakeholders, such as caltrans and bart, were on their advisory committee.
Like, let's crib their work We, think our city should take on this kind of comprehensive plan, and you know, look at the same kind of like engagement of stakeholders, equity, framework, business development, strategy.
I. Think one thing that distinguishes this document from like just a data crunch, is that you know the it clearly outlines an equity framework which I, don't think is part, especially of the rpa plan, for instance, and also that business development component, which you know You know, important rollout of as opposed to the oakland model, which was let's bring up small businesses and especially small business poc owned small businesses to meet some of our needs for cycling.
I think we brought this document to the committee to discuss and to say like if this is something that we would like to see take place in new york, the development of a of a plan that has all these components.
You know that we that equity and transportation is a goal that we need to get to, So then you go to community boards.
Think if we want to try to think like more tactically, there could be an opportunity, obviously like the streets, master plan, where you know the first iteration is supposed to be released by DOT next december.
As, you know, we understand you are going to be working on this plan and just like try to engage in that way with D.O.T. Dot is now going to be working on and that's going to include a plan for biking and bike, infrastructure, David so back to brett for just one other thing.
Why don't you initiate this kind of like you know and engage Instead of us going to students and saying hey we're from this one district in Manhattan, and we want you to do this.
You did a survey and ask people what are the five worst things about bicycling in our neighborhood, everyone's top five list is going to include double parked.
I. Think the angle would be to talk about the you, know, equity and and really the job developing some jobs.
A number of ideas like that, but especially this idea, because this id can apply to our neighborhood and it is part of the recommendation of the task of the working group.- Our business You want to depart from the district right as it stands, and then people are going to say none of our business.
The only way is to link it to veren that you know the question from your working group and maybe have you start to look at the report and extract from that, the things that could that fit in the working group and that could be a joint letter.
Up to now we have been working on sidewalk and we have talked a lot about the space you know.
By the issues of equity: There are about 3.6 million people who use the sidewalk and probably more, but I mean we use it in an intensive way to commute to to do the first leg of transit.
The sidewalk is really a place where equity is very, which is really very important, and one thing which is happening in new york city is since 2003.
This is practically the place where you have the most people walking, and the second thing is that the maintenance is really pushed back to the landlord, who pushed it to the store owners right and all these foreigners were all concerned about how the small business is going to survive, etc.
You know non-white people using it is really a shocking discrimination, and what I wanted to bring to you is there's a proposal to discuss how to ask for the sidewalk to be maintained by the city, certainly in our neighborhood and in other neighborhoods, and so that we get to a level of equity between the people which are walking, of which many are you know.
Well, I, don't know, but if we are saying as cb4 which we have said that we were trying to look in every committee and say, let's find some places where there is no equity.
We are all trying to achieve, and then you have the sidewalk One quick point: I mean you brought up some things, which is a much bigger issue.
That's, also an important issue that you know it's equity.
