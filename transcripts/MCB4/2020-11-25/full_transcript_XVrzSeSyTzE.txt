I want to welcome everybody to this meeting. It's an important meeting tonight so I think we have members of the public who will be joining us as well on tonight's meeting Janine. Can you hear me speak clearly? Okay I want to welcome everybody good evening. Thank you for coming to this meeting. My name is John Danielle Noland, I'm the chair of the Clinton health kitchen, land use committee of Manhattan community board 4, and this is our regular November meeting we couldn't meet on the 17th. It was veterans day so we're meeting tonight. You should have a copy of the agenda. There are three items on it. One is a presentation of the development going over the rail cut at the DEP site and the second item is going to be a presentation of storefront design at the Windermere, which is on 57th street 9th Avenue, wonderful, building, landmark building, and the third item agenda item is going to be a talk by the co-chair of Chelsea land use, Committee, Paul, Devlin who's. Also a member of this committee about the flood resiliency an important item. As you know, we're running this meeting remotely it's going to be recorded, transcribed it'll, be on YouTube. We ask everybody stay muted, unless you're going to speak and members of the public who have joined will be given an opportunity also to ask questions after a presentation, the committee will ask questions and then we'll go to the public. If you have a question, there's a raised hand button on your screen, you can use or just wave and Janine or myself will try to get everybody in order. We may fail, but we will try and if you're, calling in please use star9 and for the public when, if you want to ask questions when you're given the opportunity, please do so we'll be sure to call on everybody. So are there any questions? I guess not! So I want to welcome Barbara Davis, a former board member, always good to see you here, Barbara as well as everybody else welcome, so we're going to start. The first agenda item tonight is a presentation by HPD on a affordable housing site which is on above the rail cut between 48th and 49th street. Just west of 10th Avenue I just want to give a little background to this for any new members that we have or any members of the public that DEP site so-called DEP site. The department of environmental protection has been an issue for the local community and this board for decades. It was not that long at least 20 years ago that the local block association started pushing to get the open space made into a park. 20 years later, thanks to Tom Dwayne, our council member Christine, Quinn Corey Johnson, that's going to become come to pass. That's a wonderful thing in back of that. Just to the rest of that is a rail cut. Above that rail cut we're going to get affordable housing. How did that come about 2009? There was the western rail yards rezoning, that's down there. It was rezoned and there was a it produced, a lot of low income studios and one bedrooms. So the community board the City council negotiated robustly and came to an agreement that agreement was there would be two sites up here. City-Owned sites, this site and the MTA site on 54th 9th avenue between 54th and 59th would be for moderate middle income housing. Subsequently, every year after that, the board has produced letter after letter saying that affordable housing would be up to 165 percent AMI, that's area medium income, 20 would be 80, AMI 125 would go for 40 and the other 40 of the units would be for up to 165 percent. In other words, the majority of the units would be for moderate middle-income housing. That was the agreement. It was in our affordable housing plan from the community boards Housing committee about a year ago. The city discovered that there were homeless people living in the city and that there were people of low income who needed housing suddenly without any discussion with this community. This building that was supposed to be moderate middle became predominantly low and low income. The community board said this probably won't fly with the community. An agreement is an agreement. There is a need for moderate middle-income housing and, let's work together to restore confidence between the city and this community. That's where we are today so I don't want to stigmatize the developer because they have been a good partner, but we want to continue working to achieve the agreement that this community and this community board made with the city all those years ago. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Douglaston who's ever going to speak, just introduce yourselves and take it away sure. Well, this is Joel Coleman from Douglaston I'll be doing the speaking, but I think Melissa Auten from HPD is going to kick off our presentation tonight: okay, hi so good evening, community Board, 4 members. Thank you for having us tonight. We're really pleased to be here and also thank you to all the members of the community who's joining tonight. To listen to this presentation. As Joel mentioned, my name is Melissa Otton I am a senior planner at HPD, I'm also joined by my colleague perestrator assistant, commissioner of planning and pre-development at HPD, and we're really pleased to also be joined by our development partners. Douglas and development and the actors fund to present the 705 10th Avenue site, also known as the Dp site project. We previously met with the community board in March of 2020 to present. We are back here tonight to present the project to the Clinton hell's Kitchen land Use Committee. In order to solicit your feedback and answer any questions you may have the proposed dp date, project or 70510 site. Sorry, 705, 10th Avenue project will be the new construction of a mixed-use building consisting approximately 158 affordable units, as well as ground floor community facility space. As mentioned the site is located at 705 10th avenue, which is between 48th and 49th streets, it's on the west side of 10th Avenue, and it's in the Clinton hell's kitchen neighborhood of CB4. Hence why we're here tonight- and it was- we did previously- receive a disposition ruble as part of that 2009 western rail. So if we could go to the please join these actions that are needed to facilitate the proposed development include two special permits, as well as a zoning text. Amendment and then you'll see, there's also disposition of the city-owned property proposed. That disposition is purely for New, York, City code reasons to get a light and air easement and, as I previously stated, HPD approval for the disposition of the site in order to facilitate the development and with that stated, I'll turn it back over to Joel to go over some specifics of the site and the project. All right, thanks, Melissa, Gene I think we'll go to the all right. Well, first of all, hi again, this is Joel Coleman from Douglaston development, and thank you very much for everyone for having us here tonight and we're really looking forward to talking about this project with this group here. So just before. I get on to this slide just to introduce the team that we have here. First, you know the development team. The co-developers for this project are Doug, is Douglaston and the actors fund, and tonight from Douglaston you have Steven Charnow, who some of you may know from working on block 675 that down on West 29th street. That was a big project approved about two years ago through Euler and then from our affordable housing team at Douglas, and we also have Russell Lang and Arden Socolo and I don't need to introduce her, but from the actors fund we have Barbara Davis and Daniel Arno and then from our architecture, team, S9 architecture. We have Saurabh Genka. So that's a team here tonight to talk through the project with you all. So, a bit of background on Douglaston is a vertically integrated real estate development, construction and property management. Company we've been doing business in the New York City area for over 40 years. Our work is kind of very wide, ranging it has included rehab market rate residential. You know kind of smaller buildings tower buildings. It includes affordable housing. So we've really done a lot of work throughout the city and in particular, in community board 4. You know that 40-year history that we have in the city really extends to working in community board. For over the course of many years, we've been involved in a number of projects, both affordable and market rate, and obviously again, most recently with the West 29th street project and now with this project as well, which we're really excited to be continuing our relationship with community ward 4. So Daniel, do you want to talk about the actors fund? Sure thank you. Joel hi, everyone. My name is Daniel I run our affordable housing initiatives at the actors fund and, as many of you know, we are a national Human services organization. We provide support services and a safety net for everyone in the performing arts and entertainment community. Our core program areas include social Services, Workforce, Development, health and, of course, housing, and we also have deep roots in this community in terms of our facilities. Our main offices are located in times square, where we provide a lot of direct services to clients we own and operate the Dorothy Ross Friedman residence on West, 57th and 10th, which is a supportive housing residence and then we're also a social service provider through the Rodney Kirk Center at Manhattan Plaza. So in terms of our facilities, we're delivering a lot of services to the community and then to no surprise to many of you. So many of our clients live and more often work in community board for because of the theater district because of the robust network of arts and cultural organizations. So we're really excited to be working with the community board with the city and, of course, with Douglaston to develop this site and really deliver a long-term asset to the community. Thanks Daniel I think we'll go to the all right. So you all know the site very well, so I won't spend too much time here, but the site is the larger development site is shown in the black dotted line there. It's a 47,000 square, acre site, it's bounded by 10th Avenue to the West 49th street, to the north and West 48th street to the south. The zoning is a R8 C25 in the special Clinton district that site that area has a maximum floor area ratio of 4.2 and an as of right maximum building height of 66 feet. But, as you all know, through the western rail yards points of agreement, that, as of rate height, is able to be increased to 77 feet and then also just another thing to point out in that point of agreement which Jd you had already kind of alluded to was that we have at least 50 of the units in this building be two and three bedroom units, but just going back to the site itself. So it's a very large site- and you all are working very closely with Parks department on the future open space that will be planned for the eastern portion of the site and our building will be constructed in the area that you see that's in the red dashed line, and that area is almost predominantly almost all of it is covered by or includes the Amtrak Open rail cut and there's a little sliver all the way to the west. That is a surface level parking lot. That is also owned by DEP and I. Think you know we just. This is a good opportunity for us to kind of point out some of the agencies that we've been working with and how that's coming along, so the site's obviously owned by DEP. This was a site for the staging area for the water channel number three project, and so we've been working closely with them over lesson Covid-19. But before Covid-19 on doing due diligence and getting the information, we need to advance plans and we also are working very closely with Amtrak. Obviously that is a really key player here and we have been slowly but steady, working through their process and then the other big well, two other big agencies just to point out our obviously the parks department we'll talk a bit more about the coordination there and then look pretty technical, but because of the where the Amtrak right away is those the street bed or the sidewalk I should call it. These are DOT pedestrian bridges, so we're dealing with or working with, Dot's bridges and making sure that infrastructure is going to be maintained in the way that they need it to be maintained. So we could go to the here. Thanks Janine, so again, just some project area photos to point out to you all view, one which is on the top left. This is on 10th Avenue. Looking north view, 2 is on 10th avenue and 48th street, and that is looking kind of southwest and what you can see here and what you all know very well, is that the character immediately surrounding the site is these row houses kind of four or five stories and then, as you get beyond that area, the context is a little different but very strong character here view three: you have 10th avenue, that's looking south from 49th street and view 4 is on 48th street, and that is looking East, please all right. So when we were when I say we Douglaston and the actors fund and s9, when we were working on our submission to this RFP, we really were brainstorming about what is going to guide our program, our design and really make for a compelling proposal here. So we really thought of four key areas. The first obviously and most important is the you know the CB4 priorities and the western rail yards points of agreement. In particular, around the massing with the 77 feet, tall eight stories limitation there, the infrastructure on the site, the Amtrak Open rail, cut designing for that designing for smoke ventilation to come through our building, which is an Amtrak requirement, the site's adjacency to that future, open space. Thinking about how our design can really enhance that great neighborhood asset that will be coming online and then, finally, given that this site is in Hell's kitchen arts and culture and I'll, let Daniel to speak a bit more about that yeah sure, thanks Joel again, in addition to the affordable housing program, we're really committed to integrating arts and culture both into the building, but also into the community building upon so many arts and cultural assets that already exist. We're also aware that this community board, through the district needs statement prioritizes cultural services, absolutely as a need. We know organizations have been displaced from the community. Our initial proposal included space works as the community facility tenant. There are a wonderful arts organization. Sadly, in the early months of Covid-19, they were forced to close down so we're currently in the process of identifying and securing a new community facility tenant a new arts and culture organization. We've had some wonderful conversations and we think this is a really fantastic opportunity for the right group and we'd also look to the community board. If you know of organizations that are in need of space that have been displaced, that might be a good fit for the site, please let us know and we'd be happy to reach out to them directly back to you, Joel Great, thanks Daniel and then okay. So with those parameters in mind, this is just kind of key or kind of very high level overview of the project, so it will be approximately 138,000 square feet. Eight stories and 77 feet tall again, keeping in line with that western rail yards points of agreement. There will be approximately 158, affordable housing units and with a unit mix that does emphasize two and three bedroom units. Just with that breakdown. More specifically, we'd have 22 percent studios, 27 percent, one bedrooms, 41 percent, two bedrooms and 10 percent. Three bedrooms: amenities in the building would include on-site laundry, a fitness room, children's play room and a bike room, and we would be accommodating the Parks Department public comfort station on the ground floor of our building and we'll talk a bit more about that and then, as Daniel just said, the arts and culture community facility use. So please so just wanted to talk a bit more about the ground floor and give more context about how this program comes together at the Gra at the street level and the open space level. So to the left. You have a high level ground floor plan. The primary residential entrance would be located on West 48th street, and so you could see that arrow on the West 48th street, with a secondary residential entrance on West 49th street, is also where we'd have the community facility entrance. We thought that was a more appropriate location, especially given the Red cross on the same block. It's not entirely residential in that sense. So that's where we located our community facility entrance and then we have. The public comfort station, which you can see, is fronted right onto the open space. If you go to the the right side of this slide, so you'll see two images: the top image you could get a sense of what that entrance or what the facade at the comfort station would look like. You see some grading and it's a little hard to make out, but those would be you know potential. However, parks wants to design it, but you know some signage there to indicate that that's a conversation available for public use and then on the just below. That is a preliminary plan for the comfort station, and this is something we've been working with, parks on and making sure that this met their requirements and from what we understand also really meets. You know the conversations and the needs that have been expressed by community board, for so we have on each flanking each side. There are separate men's and women's. You know restrooms and then in the middle would be area for public storage, and that was something that we heard was a desire from the community. So that is what that looks like right now, please, okay, so the big conversation income mix, so I'll just walk through this and then Melissa and her team will talk a bit more. But the high level breakdown here is, as currently proposed. We have 15 of the units going being dedicated to formerly homeless households and just to note that is a city council mandate, so that is required for all projects receiving I think it is receiving public subsidy. Then we have 25 of the units at 47 to 50 percent of AMI. And again you can see what that income range is here: twenty percent of the units at seventy seven to eighty percent of AMI and then forty percent of the units at one hundred to one hundred twenty percent AMI. So that is that moderate income level, Melissa I, know you want to add some more context here so I'll hand it over to you. Yes, thanks Joel for walking us through the. As previously stated we the last time we met with community board four to pro present. This project was at the March 2020 executive committee meeting, and we presented a slightly different proposed affordability mix and we certainly heard and recognized the feedback that the community board is really looking to see more units and this new we did add a few units to the 120 AMI tier, but we also, as the city, recognized that New York City for quite a while now has been facing an affordability crisis that doesn't many different income levels, but most disproportionately impacts residents at lower income levels and with the recent pandemic. Unfortunately, those most vulnerable community members have been disproportionately impacted as well exacerbating the issues that they were already facing as far as affordability is concerned, so the affordability tiers that are proposed for this project that you see here are meant to help protect those most vulnerable residents of the local community, as well as provide a range of units that also moderate incomes. In order to allow long-term residents of the Clinton health kitchen community to remain in their neighborhood, the last thing I'll say before I kick it back to the development team. Is that, as always, the affordability mix is an ongoing discussion with the development team throughout the Euler process, so with that thanks, Melissa I, hope it's also an ongoing discussion with the community and the community board, because this is totally unacceptable. We're certainly here to hear feedback today, and we really would appreciate that you did not lecture our board of any about Covid-19 and the difficulties with Covid-19. It is so incredibly understand our issues with temporary shelters that have a huge impact on our community. It is not the message to bring here to say: we are not a community that welcomes the lowest income. Folks in the city. We do but I believe that's Joe Resteucher, please, when you speak, identify yourself, so we know who's talking, I'm so sorry, Jd, I'm sorry Joe stood your long-term member of the committee and it is really frustrating I, co-chair Housing, Health and human services also that please do not come and present in that manner when we are struggling every day with the administration, and we have accepted the absolute lowest income people here, which we welcome. With open arms. We have the third largest population of shelter residents and supportive housing of 59 community boards in the city. So that's not this issue and we're going to. We should just start to reframe it have the development team finish up, so we can respond to you all right. Thanks Joe. Let's continue on thanks, Melissa Joe Joel, you wanna, oh yeah, we'll finish up. We don't have too much more. Do you need? Please? Actually? So? Actually this slide we're going to talk about the design a bit and sarob from S9 is going to talk over the next for the next two slides. Thank you Joel, hello, everyone. My name is Sarab Goenka and I represent S9 architecture and engineering. We're the architects of this wonderful project, we're a firm based out of New York City and have been involved with the development team. Talking about the design, inspiration, the inspiration for the first design comes from the surrounding historic fabric of the neighborhood, and the neighborhood fabric in this area is dominated by what we call lost style, industrial architecture and our current design aims at creating an harmonious mix of the elements between the past and the present. So, as you might have seen from some of the images that we were shared in the presentation before the surrounding buildings have simple form. Most of them have large windows and they're, typically constructed of brick and with minimal ornamentation, so in our design, we're using exposed brick walls, we're also using metal panel, cladding and large glass windows to bring daylight into the building. If you go to the the design, as you can see, emphasizes on extending the large green space, which is a unique character of our site, it's our design extends that green space in front of our building onto the building facade, which creates a very pleasant congress between the architecture and landscape. We're doing that by is using a simple technique of allowing climbing plants to grow on an integrated metal mesh system along 48 and 49th street. The design draws its inspiration from the nearby buildings and, as you can see, it tries to match the scale with the brick of the nearby architecture. It's a pretty simple and elegant design and I think does enhance the current the character of the neighborhood back to you. Thanks rob all right gene. Thank you all right. So Melissa highlighted these again, but just to reiterate to facilitate this project, we will be requesting four Lan approval of four land use actions. The first is a special permit, pursuant to zoning resolution, section 74681 to develop over and in this case over the open, Amtrak right of way, and that is just a requirement for any site that has the condition that we have here. This second special permit is, pursuant to zoning resolution, section 96104. This is the special Clinton district and this is to modify height, heightened setback, regulations and, again that's to increase the maximum building height from the as of right, 66 feet to 77 feet and back when the western radio industry zoning was taking place. The mechanism for this special permit was included as part of that rezoning package, so this special permit was already contemplated back. Then we also will be needing a zoning text, admin to waive yard regulations on the site and I will we have a diagram that helps to explain that in the and then, as Melissa discussed earlier, the disposition of city owned property for the lay and air easement, because we do have those windows that are facing the open space. So we will be needing a disposition for lane air to accommodate those residential legal, legal residential windows. Please all right! So hopefully this helps to explain some of those waves. I just discussed on the left. You can see the massing with the I, don't know what to call it hatched, but the area for above 66 feet that indicates the area of that height and setback special permit. That's pretty straightforward and then, on the right hand, side you have a site plan that shows in pink what would be the required rear yard equivalent for this site and so for us in order Matt to maximize the number of housing units here and to create a building that we think you know, responds well to the site and is integrated onto the site. We would be seeking approval of the text amendment to waive rearguard requirements, and that would you know this we're still early in this process right so, but I think the idea is that we would make the parameters very specific to this site. So this doesn't become a precedent. You know for anything else. It has to be very specific, and we understand that and look forward to talking with you all about what kind of parameters you all feel are appropriate. Please, okay! This is my last slide, so just some an overview of the key milestones. You know the RFP was designated in the winter of 2019 and you know we held our first meeting with the leadership or some folks from CB4 in the summer of 2019. So not too long thereafter and our and we're here today. This is our regular presentation and then we anticipate certification of the application in the spring of 2021 with approval in the winter of 2021, and we also have there the article 11 as well the tax abatement, so that is the is just a question slide, so that opens it up. Thank you very much everyone for your time, Joel, thank you and thank you Daniel. Thank you. Everybody Melissa, thank! You are on the hot seat tonight, but please try to understand. It seems that HPD is picking and choosing what they want from the points of agreement and ignoring others, and the fact that after many discussions that what we were promised, what we agreed to has been completely turned upside down as Joe says, we're a pretty caring community. If you know anything about the location around this building, how many social services there are already to come and present this without it's just shocking to me, it's and I'm sure it's pretty shocking to the community members who are attending this, I'm not going to speak anymore but Melissa. It's not against you. You're on the hot seat, but you have to understand there is a lot of anger about this. That's what I'm here for to be on the hot seat. Again, we definitely hear what the community board is. I, don't think so why you're coming back to us with no change one thing I do want to community services and I just want to clarify for time tonight. I know that a lot of you already know this, but this project is not including any supportive units. So that's just one thing: I wanted to clarify. As far as that is concerned, thank you. I think we can I'm gonna shut up, because obviously I'm a little bothered by this so committee. We have hands up Janine, who who's who's on first. Here I'm sorry there is a request for Melissa to dial in because her voice keeps breaking on her connection. Okay, thanks Paul, I'm happy to do something thanks, Melissa I, don't know Joe, you had your hand up. Yeah I just have a before we get into the main issue of the income bans specifically for the developer, on the special permit under 96,103. My question is that the parameters to limit it we're very concerned, as you always know, with precedent, so can we limit it to have it only in conjunction with another special permit from the 74,681, which is the building over the rail cut and then adjacent to a public open space? We want to make sure that this does not get replicated Joel and the tighter it's worded, the more protective it is of the community. We want to make this project go ahead, but yeah, absolutely Joe and I. Think that's those parameters make a lot of sense and one other, while we're talking about it. I mean I would even say that if it's in a special Clinton district with a zoning lot that shares a boundary between the two sub areas, because it's bisected by those two sub areas that makes it very limited, yeah just double check on this there's. Only a couple of sites left over the rail cut at this point so be aware right, but the open space is a good idea too. My second question Jd, is to what Melissa just noted about no supportive housing. However, for actress fund or Douglaston, however, will there be some support services initially for the 15 homeless component, because just because people are going to an apartment, doesn't mean they don't need services? We've said this over and over so I give that to Charno or to Davis I. Think we'll. Let the actors fun talk about that. One I can also weigh in Barbara, and then you can weigh in as well. I mean we'll definitely be developing. A social service plan mostly focused on services around tenant, stabilization and retention services, and you know, per the mix and match term sheet. There are you know, service dollars to help us achieve and implement that social service plan? So absolutely that was my next question. Is there adequate funding from Douglaston through the mix and match plan to do this? So we don't get into this same problem. We've had in past years, yeah per that term sheet. There absolutely are okay, great thanks, Joe I'm going to go to Dolores, then Chris than David yeah. My concern is also around the the services. I think that clearly we have recognized that there is a dire need for more services for our vulnerable populations. The fact that there's a 15 percent component and there's not an in-house set of social services is very concerning. We are at a tipping point already throughout this district, as we have a good number of social services. But, more importantly, what we don't have are enough social services for those that have been temporary relocated here and that's what's getting us bringing us over that tipping point. Obviously, there is a path forward past the pandemic, and things may change within five years, but at this point we're quite alarmed as a community on how to handle this amount of special needs and social services needs community in a very small area. So to speak, because it's not the only facility in the 50s and the 40s thanks Dolores David Solnick, are you there yeah I'm here. First I have two questions. One is just a technical question and then the other is more general. The income bands are very narrow and they have large gaps between them. What happens to the large percentage of people who don't fall in those narrow those narrow windows clarify which windows you would specifically don't knock holes and then come back well just put up just put them up again and it's pretty obvious. Okay about the yeah I mean like I, think I can respond. Just generally. You know across the city that we do this. You know we the reason we make those marketing bans so small, particularly on the lower income ranges, is that we get so many applications that they don't have to be broad. Basically, we get thousands of applications for very few units, so we can keep them small and still get commit enough numbers of applications. That wasn't the question not to cut out the question Paris. The question is in the donor holes between the gaps. Why are there? What? How can you fix? Having gaps in between the bands? Oh you're, saying, okay, yeah I mean we could do more bands. I mean this is a little bit of a financing trick. In terms of you know, you set the rents at a certain level, so you set the eligible incomes at a certain level. It is the comment here that, generally you guys would like to see more. You know kind of broader ranges of eligibility. Is that the comment? Or is it just a question? We don't want people to fall through the gaps. That's been an ongoing community issue, yeah. Ultimately, there's always going to be a gap, so one project is not going to fulfill all the you know, eligible incomes, but I hear that you know trying to make it eligible trying to increase eligibility rather than decrease it. We acknowledge the effort to do that. It can be tricky sometimes in terms of your balancing that you're moving different levers, so, on the one hand, you're trying to bring in some income at the higher end and at higher rents. On the other hand, the lower income both achieves the objective of providing housing for those incomes in need, but also there's usually funding sources that are tied to those income, those populations so, for instance, tax credits and bonds. You that you can't fund units over 80 AMI with tax credits and bonds, so it's a little bit of a game in terms of toggling things, but generally you know I, guess I'm hearing that certainly broadening eligibility is something we hear and we hear that a lot in communities. But what let me just so I mean this is to clarify. For my purposes too, those bands are only three thousand dollars a year wide, there's much more empty. The gaps are much bigger than the income ranges. So does that mean that those you know if you're between 90 and 113, you have a different. You have other projects, there's just other projects that serve those people or if you're I mean these are incredibly narrow. Bands I, don't I, just don't understand how the system works to house people. If you could that's right in other projects, you might see that you know they set the incomes at sixty percent of AMI. We don't do sixty percent as much because there's just so much range. You know you keep talking about the no I'm talking about the windows. I understand that you've got. You know a cap at 80 or something I'm talking about the narrow windows of eligibility, so the narrow windows speak to that point. I made earlier about the marketing band will set the rent. So the developer sets the rents of 40. Excuse me like with the 47 they set the rents at 47 AMI, the eligible incomes for who can be in that housing. It will go from 47 to 50 percent, am I no yeah, but Paris I. Think we understand that what David's asking is we need there to be no holes in the income bans, irrespective of what they end up being. There can not be someone who makes 56,851 but doesn't make 87,549 and doesn't get the opportunity to apply and fit. We've done this in other projects, and we need to do it here. I think you know I hear that, and you know we agree with that. But what I'm saying is that you can't have eligibility too broad, because you just get too many. No, I'm not saying eligibility, we're saying that you probably have to create more bands to fill in the holes. That's all right! David, oh and yeah, and then you know so that that's something that we hear that you know again that goes back to you know. This is a financing and you know so you're both trying to provide housing at multiple income levels, but you're also trying to make sure that again, the number at the bottom of the of the Performa to finance the project is a zero and not red. So there's different things that we toggle and it can get complicated to do too many bands, but right but yeah. We know the project worked at the original income bands. So we're going to work with you and work with the City Council to move it back toward where it was. We know it worked, that's factual, so my second question, the more general one I mean you know you've, you know Jd and Joe are saying you know you you've not lived up to a clear previous agreement and you haven't really responded to that directly. Could you address that point directly and say you know: is that true you're not agreeing to a previous agreement, you're breaking a previous agreement, and if so, you know what's the what? Why is that the is that a mayor or a mayoral directive? Is that? Could you be really direct in addressing that criticism? Yeah? Certainly, and look you know we understand where you guys are coming from in saying this, and you know and the frustration that that's created. We obviously are not honoring that that agreement, yeah I, think I would just like to caution this administration. You are making many agreements that can be totally unwound by the next administration. The idea of working in a city is, we make a social compact and it carries from year to year, irrespective of the current mayor. So I would hope you should understand that things you decide today in 2022 could be just ripped apart when you set this precedent of not honoring agreements that are made and honoring engagement with community. It's not as if this was something that came out of the hat. So you can understand. Hpd came to this community and said we need to use public sites for moderate minimum housing because we're creating low income housing on privately owned sites through our new inclusionary mechanism in western rail yards and Hudson yards west Chelsea and the garment center. You, as an agency, came to us and said this is the way to get moderate middle income housing. We understand the homeless change, that's a reality and we accept it and deal with it. We're going to have to move the 25 of the units between 53 and 56, which are being built throughout our community in every single, affordable housing project that is inclusionary into higher bands in order to satisfy and to meet the needs of people who make more than that because those are civil servants. Those are people who work and make two incomes and can not afford the market. In our district. We have preached to you over and over. We understand you're presenting to us. You haven't, heard it and have to be settled through the Euler process. At this point, Joe I want to go back to David's question hold on I'm. If I could respond on behalf of the city, is that okay, it's just a there was a question that you both threw out. I no one was able to respond. I was on mute, so I apologize, so yeah I just want to acknowledge that I understand the frustration here from the community, because there was an agreement that these sites would be used for moderate, including this site would be used for moderate and middle income housing at the time and as far as it seems, we're not honoring that agreement to the letter of it I, don't think that we are actually in violation of the agreement and I. Think that's something we could. You know talk more about, but I acknowledge well, if I could just finish like it's finished, I acknowledge that we are not honoring the spirit of what was written in that agreement as it relates to this being a moderate and middle-income site, but I would yeah so I acknowledge that, and you know that's what we're proposing here. We are responding to conditions that we're seeing on the ground we're an affordable housing crisis. This is a high amenity neighborhood, where you've got good access to jobs, good access to transit and we're not talking about it. Let him finish: we are not talking about super low income, folks, we're talking about families of four making between 53 and 56,000, and that's only 25 percent of the units. The majority of the units are actually above that those are not poor people or very low income people we're talking about people that are working people and, as we've seen in the last four years, and particularly now that we're facing this economic crisis, those are the people that are most vulnerable. Those are the people that have the least housing opportunity. So yes, as the city, we are proposing to change from the agreement that we made, because we need to house these folks. We need to give people in this in these income groups opportunities, particularly in areas like your neighborhood, that have high access to transit, high access to jobs, good schools and high access to quality, commercial amenities, including fresh foods, and we put out a plant. We put out a report called where we live NYC. That's about our fair housing plan, where you know that some of this is detailed. It's not about just this neighborhood we're taking this approach across the city, so that is a change. Thank you for that. I just have to say these low-income bands were pre-coveted, so you can not say nothing to do with Covid-19 yeah so anyway, but I would say the reason I brought up Covid-19 is that this economic crisis, we're in it, has exacerbated the problem. This exacerbated the problem for working people at the lower end. The essential workers are in this category of fifty percent AMI, sixty percent AMI, seventy percent of Mi. These are the folks that are have trouble, not just paying their rent right now, but you know they're most affected even more than they were before, so that I understand that this was our plan even before that, so I don't want to be I, don't want to that's, not why we came up with this plan, but the economic crisis has exacerbated the problem and heightens the reason that we need to include low-income units in any and all the projects that we do, but particularly in high opportunity. Neighborhoods. Thank you for that answer. I would say it's also heightened the exodus of moderate middle income, people out of the city. That's also a problem, but David. Thank you for that question. Dale! No excuse me, you said Nate me next, actually, Jd Sorry Chris, you had gone off. Okay, Chris go ahead! Thank you very much! So I guess I'm going to start off this way. My name is Chris. Lebron I've been a member of this committee for two and a half years. I've been on this board for almost five years now, and I've lived here, my entire life and the reason why I've lived in hell's kitchen in my entire life is because my mother graduated from college in 1978 and was able to find affordable housing in the neighborhood that she grew up in. She was a first generation college graduate. She was a daughter to a puerto rican, migrant and through affordable housing. We've been able to live accordingly. I'm looking at these bans and I see this major gap between 50 and 77 percent. Ami and I have extreme concerns about people who live, doubled up or tripled up in housing in this district who can not find affordable housing when they come out of college, and we have to recognize that average starting income is 55,000 and up we're losing zoomers and millennials and I hate the titles, but I'm just gonna put it out there. These are the titles that these generations have they were given to them, but like we're losing the ability to build a healthy and sustainable demographic column, everything is piercing in and neighborhoods can't live that way. Additionally, here's my second point: I was on City council staff when, where we live was handed over when Vicki Bean and her team had delivered that to the staffers I read it through and it dealt with numbers from years ago, but it was a blanket report that was handed over. It did not look into the things that all 56 community boards were doing, and this community board has been doing an exceptional job at linking bands to ensure that generations of hell's kitchen and Chelsea individuals, as well as those who aspire to live here, can do so and part of the reason why I came on here is because my mother was a part of that block association along with Jd and Elkafears who's, the president at Block Association, to identify that lot of land. That lot of land means everything to so many people, and so, when I sat down across from the mayor's office in the past and I've heard I hear you or we're listening. It is a blow off and I, don't appreciate it professionally. I, never appreciate it, and here on this community board. I do not appreciate it. You need to go back and not say it's difficult, because we're New, York, City and we've survived we're surviving this right now. Okay and we're gonna survive it when this pandemic is over, but you can not tell us it's too difficult. Get it done. It's not a question. Thank you, Christopher from Hell's Kitchen Dale. Thank you, everyone for the presentation. It's this meeting has gotten very heated and I recognize the frustration, but I would really appreciate it. If my colleagues did not talk over our guests tonight, I, don't think it's a good look. I, don't think it's very persuasive, I'm very concerned about the income bans because of the gaps I'm looking at it from the perspective of somebody who earns a certain income and is essentially by the design of these income. Bans denied an opportunity to live in this particular building, and that's who I'm looking at say: I'm an applicant and I make 60 grand as a family of four. There is no place for me in this building and I think that's a form of discrimination that is unintentional as it may be, can not be advanced. You need to have, we can argue about the bands, but you need to have an opportunity at least some opportunity for everyone within the range to find a place to live in this building. Thanks Dale James, Wallace, Welcome James. Are you there? Yes, first I want to thank Dale for reminding us that you know we are here to serve the community and we're doing our best, and you know Mr, Stratter and miss out and I appreciate that you're also, you know you come here with the best of intentions, but I think you can tell from the feedback that it's kind of landing on deaf ears and what I would suggest is not only that you look at the bands which the holes in the bands are. You know you're looking at it from what you're telling us as a numbers game, but the practical implications is that, even if you get too many applications at least people have a chance. If you don't have enough availability, you don't not even giving people the option or the opportunity to apply. So that's where the holes in the bands and the fact that the bands are so narrow, 47 to 51, it's like a three thousand dollar needle that you have to stick your whole family through. So, if you're telling me that that's a challenge like figure it out that that's a mathematical challenge and I understand it might be challenging, but you're dealing with people trying to look for an opportunity so create those opportunities. Instead of just making your numbers work, the numbers will work. Maybe you break them up into smaller groups. You know, instead of forty percent fitting in this tiny hole. It's five percent in this whole five percent in this whole five percent, this hole just I. You know- and I'm sorry, I'm not the math expert here, that's your job, but you've got to create more opportunities. The other thing, though, is this justification for not abiding by the agreement with the community board. That's been working on it for decades circumstances are always going to change. They're always going to be challenging. So the idea that somehow the present crisis is justification, just it doesn't sit well and it doesn't make logical sense because there will always be a challenge and the only thing we have at the end of the day is our assurance sitting across from the table from one another and saying you know, we agree to something and if you go back on that, you're actually creating bigger problems for HPD and for community boards in the future, because they won't know if you're going to go back on an agreement that they're making it's opportunistic. It's short-sighted and it's dangerous and it's actually counterproductive to the goal that you say you're trying to achieve so I would just strongly encourage that you take the advice of all the people that you're hearing here figure out a way to go back to the original agreement and at minimum figure out a way to provide more opportunities for people and I, really appreciate your hard work. I know it's it's difficult work! Thank you! You're on mute, Jd, Sorry, Paul, Devlin, yep, thank you and before I join the bandwagon on the income, bans, discussion and harassment. I. Just want to ask on the development of the facade facing the park space that you work with waterfront parks on how that's accessed, because the plans for that park seem to indicate a fence along that wall and so make sure that that's in case also a picayon issue, but I would prefer that we use genderless restroom assignments and not have a male and a female assignment to those rooms. So if you could, please make note of that, but I will join the income bands bandwagon and urge you to revisit this Mr Strauder to say that the developers set the rents and that's how you determine the bans is not a welcome sound to this community. I think that we need to eliminate any holes in the income bans there's a way to do 10 at zero 10 percent. Five ten, you know build up and fill those holes to have a three thousand dollar income window of opportunity to get into these units. I understand that HPD might have a higher number of applicants in those income vans. That might be why you're approaching that, but you've come to this community and violated an agreement which had higher income bans you're putting in a zero percent income ban and then you're, creating all these holes and you're saying it's the developer, setting the rent rates, which is how you've determined these percentages, so I urge you to please go back, reconsider these numbers and make this whole less and make it whole for the community. Thank you, Paul Delores, you have a question actually I just wanted to take advantage of the fact that Douglaston and the architect are here, because we've made our points about the bands. I wanted to speak about the look, the design just so that I'm on record for my thoughts, I'm very thankful of how thoughtful you are about the context of the materials that you're using and the design so I applaud that. Thank you also appreciative of the actual size. We understand that you can go up to that higher height, but you know keeping it so that it's compact, that it looks more in keeping with the majority of the neighborhood, is appreciated and I just wanted to give the feedback both to the developer and the architect that for someone else like Chris who was born and raised in the neighborhood, it feels like a good fit for that block. But, of course, I'll leave that to the folks that live on the block, who are probably waiting in the audience to opine on that as well. Thank you, Delores Dale, you had a follow-up question: Dale yeah, sorry, it's! This is more less on the the disposition of units and affordability than on the design. I also appreciate the fact that the design is taking cues from a kind of strain of industrial loft style buildings of a certain height from a certain year in character. I think that is the I think that's the best reference for this particular project in terms of like context and function, I think the design is overall appears to be a lot of texture and not very much. You know it doesn't have. Maybe this will come in development, but it I think it needs a bit of a punch in order to become what is essentially an end cap building on a full block in this distinct architecturally, distinctive neighborhood and I'm not 100 persuaded by the symmetry along the park and the the use of vining to define the facade, but so I think I, hope there'll be a more. You know. A further along development of the of the treatment of the facades and I would even see you know a little more height variance, not to I mean it's functioning well as an end cap on a block which it is effectively with the parts but I you know, I would sooner see a little more variance in the roof line, to give it a little more character. So thanks thanks, Dale I also want to give a thanks to the designer for the comfort station. This is extremely important for the children of the neighborhood and also for the Parks department to be able to have some some amenities and maybe, while they're taking care of the Park Joe Rastucci Leslie has his hand up. Oh sorry, I had a quick question about the distribution of those people in the building who are going to get the apartments? Is it segregated by bands or is it the mixed use in terms of how they're distributed to the building got to be fully integrated right? Okay, Steve yeah? That's correct, yeah, fully integrated yeah! Okay! Thank you thanks Leslie Brian Weber. Did you have your hand up Brian? Yes, I did I, you know, look I, think the income bans and the reneging on the agreement is really the important topic discussion. Just a brief question on the design, though small one are those p-Tac units that I see in every unit and isn't there a move to move away from that for sustainability issues, and perhaps the architect could comment on that. I'll start Joel from Douglas and we'll start and it's Rob definitely add on to it. But yes, they are p-tac units. They and that's kind of where we are right now. The energy code has recently been updated and you know we are in the 2020 Energy Code. So we have to look into that. But in terms of you know this project and where we are now, that's where we will be looking at p tax and exploring if certain code requirements will be pushing us into other HVAC systems. Thank you. If there are no further questions, thank you Joel from the committee. Let's move to one last thing: Jd, yes, Joe, and would you also inform us or elaborate on the fact? This is a pre-eulerp right, yeah presentation, so there will be other bites of the apple beyond tonight. Go ahead! I want to just to note first on the Euler for the committee that this is merely a briefing. This will go through a full euler process and the city Council will weigh in and we'll come to some kind of conclusion on what the income ban should be. However, we need to state often and early what our preference is and what has happened here. That's what's really important. The second thing is I. Really take exception to Paris and Melissa, especially Paris on the issue of this is a high opportunity. Neighborhood we have this. People should be, it makes it sound as if our neighborhood is not only welcoming but has not developed an incredible amount of low-income housing through multiple programs. It has well before anybody walked in the door, so we specifically are trying to make sure we have economic integration. The project my office did on 53rd street has income bans with no gaps and the people who have moved there. It's the hugest number of civil servants going to any HPD project, because civil servants are union jobs and they make more money and they don't have the opportunity because they can't compete in the market in neighborhoods like this. The market here in our neighborhood one bedroom apartments are starting at 3,800, 2 bedroom apartments are 5,800. People who are making in those middle income. Bands can not afford that when they have children period and you don't as an administration, perceive it as a need. That is clear. I'm happy Paris at least said that you've not kept up with this agreement, but we're going to work to come hit somewhere in between I think tonight we should establish. We can not have any gaps in income bans, and this is not your issue. That's throwing it to Douglaston to figure out how to make the numbers work and we need to extend the income bans somewhat higher up. If we didn't have such a huge production of units below 50 of AMI. We would welcome this project in a moment Steve how many units below 50 of AMI are you doing on block 675 in Chelsea approximately below what am I below 60. 10, something like that. 10 had a 950 95 right there. If we didn't have the production, we would not be on this train to say, fix this. So I leave that and you'll hear from the public about it. Trust me thanks: Joe Janine, do we have some members of the public I brought over Richard Moran's and Christine Gorman Ray Richard? Are you with us Richard? Are you there I, don't see him yet there. Now, you see me. Ah, okay, Richard I, hear you well. First of all, I want to thank you all for your work on this committee and the community board and for fighting the good fight on behalf of this neighborhood. This is an act of treachery that we have never seen likes of here. This was a deal that was made and for the city to just simply throw it out is a complete dishonest and dishonorable act on their part and on the part of all the local politicians and the other people who have enabled it, and we will not forget this, and so just as you can throw out our agreement from 2009, maybe next year, we'll throw out the agreement for this RFP because it never should have happened and it's a disgrace. I. The community board has an excellent housing report that reviews all the housing development in the community and in the last five years, as far as I can tell we've had 1300 units of affordable housing, developed 1100 were 60 percent or below that's almost 85 percent. Only 200 of these units were above 60 and most of those were 80 percent. Now the community board in this report and this community board in general, has always pushed for keeping this neighborhood to be integrated along every single line and right now the people who are being forced out are working. People are moderate middle income people and we've had nothing built for the almost nothing built for these people, and so I. Just can't explain the outrage enough that all of us feel regarding this matter and furthermore, as an aside I think this pro this building is humongous I, don't think it fits in this neighborhood at all, but we'll just say that for another day I just want to let you know that this neighborhood is up in arms and that we are totally supporting our community board in fighting for us. Thank you very much. Thank you. Richard Christine Gorman. Are you with us Christine I am. Can you hear me welcome? Yes, thank you very much. So I'm representing the West 55th Street, Block, Association and I, was actually I'm. I'm been a neighbor resident of the health kitchen area close to 40 years now, and I actually remember the community gatherings and all of the you know, negotiating and everything that we did earlier and I want to commend community board 4, because over and over, in this situation, with the so-called DEP site and the MTA site, which used to be linked to the DEP site. That's another way that the agreement got broken and it was supposed to be both sites being developed by the same non-profit. But anyway, that's a whole other area to go. But what I want to really lift up is on this project on so many other projects. How well CB4 has worked to have a balance across the entire district? We're not talking about just one project. We I have been so impressed with community board for since back then and in 2009 at how you have really thought carefully about where and when to place various income bans and to make sure that we have mixed income housing all up and down and I. Think it's very clear and there is data showing how great the rent burden has become in this area and if you lose your tax base, which of course is part of what's going to happen, then you lose the vitality and the creativity that we've all come to know and love. So I would plead with you. Hpd do not treat this community board. As you know, just you know your run-of-the-mill community board. They know what they're doing they have looked across the entire district. They take the long view and I just applaud them, as the previous speaker said, that the community itself is 150 behind the community board and we know that they have our best interests at heart and we know that they have the interests of a wide variety of people, so I once again, I want you to not just dismiss it. I mean, as you know, it is just so unbelievable to hear somebody say: I, hear your frustration and then you know completely ignore it well said Christine. Thank you. So much Janine are there other speakers from the community yeah I brought over chocolate and Alka Fierce, okay, Chuck Lee Welcome. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to to speak I dialed in a little bit late, but heard most of what the presenters were saying. I am representing a condominium building in the neighborhood, we're actually a little bit closer to the MTA site versus 705 10th, but you know very concerned about both and in particular a lot of the topics and themes that have been discussed today, particularly not with regards to necessarily the project and obviously you know, there's a lot to focus in on, and people have used there, but I did want to at least thank the two representatives from the developer and the architect. Firm and HPD. I know that you know the architect and developer were hired to develop a project. I actually thought the project looked actually pretty impressive. On the skin and I know the HPD folks have a job that they need to do. That being said, you know kind of lipstick on the pig you know. Apologies for you know using an analogy like that, but I and my you know community here you know definitely do share all of the concerns that have been voiced to date, in particular with regards to the very statement that was repeated, that, yes, we acknowledge we have not. We are not living up to you know not even the letter, but the spirit of the prior. You know agreement the prior understanding that look. I've been in this specific building for 12 years, been a resident of the city for 24 years. That is so problematic, not just because of what the other gentleman said a little bit earlier. It will really be exactly because of that problem. That agreement was so easy to violate and rip up and throw away and pay no attention to. Why are we even having this meeting right now if the employees, the good people who are offering their time? You know today to hear you know rants and raves to go back to the city and do what I mean if they're just gonna rip that up last year or two years ago? What's to say that you know they get all this feedback and they just rip it up and throw it away, do whatever they want anyway, and you know that clearly just leads to what's gonna happen tomorrow and next year and the year after, when we all hit the polls and vote people out and vote people in that actually will live up to you know their agreements live up to you know what they had promised. You know that's what we're mostly concerned about we're mostly concerned about. You know having trust in what is being presented. What is being built, you know, and not feel as though, that the people that are talking to us from the city you know leave us with. You know feelings that you know what we've heard and what was presented was disingenuous was opportunistic condescending, insulting, insecure deceitful. Those are all things that popped into my head. As I'm hearing somebody say no I, you know I hear somebody else said this, so I'm just going to repeat it and I'll wrap up, because I want to take up anyone else's time, but it is so insulting to have somebody- and this is not an attack on the individual from HPD I recognize again you're doing your job, but you know to do that. Just it's just you know, there's there will be a backlight there's already a wave building, and you know I've spoken to people over the past couple of years in this city's office and in the speaker's office and had this conversation response to the allegation that this was a you know not in my backyard thing and a bunch of rich white people, I'm a gay asian man. I've worked with people of every race in color, old people, white people, you know asian people, you know black people, married people, single people, gay people, straight people all focused and all thematically, exactly where all the voices tonight are that this is just you know: Bs politicians back door dealing. This reminds me of the 2000 beds that they moved in overnight in 36 to 37th street, without notifying the community to do this and rip up the CB4 agreement and just do whatever they want on these two sites is completely outrageous, so just wanted to verbalize that and I'll. Let somebody else. Thank you. Chuck Elk of fears. I recognize that name elk a few years. Hey guys, how are you can we go back to 2009? You know what was agreed to in 2009, moderate middle-income housing for our hell's kitchen neighborhood. That is a mix of every income, every type of person. What have you my membership I mean reluctantly I know we have to accept 15, formerly homeless, and hopefully those will be families and not single men. They had house families in the skyline hotel until Covid-19 and they removed families that were living there to put single men in temporarily, which hey you know, makes absolutely no sense. I agree with all of the complaints. I think this is terrible. One good thing is the restrooms and the comfort stations to for the park. I mean that's sorely needed, so I do appreciate that. Thank you. So much I don't know whether HPD has looked around the area but you're surrounded by housing. That section aid support. If you have Ivan Shapiro House, you have project renewal, you've got other low-income I mean just you know surrounding that building. So I guess it's. It's always amazing. I'm tired of hell's kitchen being that second cousin, that person that you put at that small table at the dinner when you have family in you know somehow we're always on we're. Always second in you know I, just as you can tell I get a little bit emotional about this. We gave in reluctantly to 77 feet, even though 66 feet was what was the zoning for it. So again, I've I would like everyone. I would like you to go back. The income bans absolutely make no sense and I don't know what I can add that everyone has, and I'm really upset about this I know my membership is upset. We've worked at this I mean I've been overseeing this lot. This project I mean I've, been here in the neighborhood for like 38 years, probably not a year or two more and I was probably a community board member. When we looked at that site for a park and housing anyhow go back to the drawing board and thanks for listening. Okay, thank you. Elka by the way, is the president of the 47th 48th Street Block Association, and has been instrumental in getting us that open space, Janine yep, two more Vienne Cox and Leslie Murphy. Thank you, who's first Vienna yeah Vienna. Are you there hi Vienne? Are you with us? How are you on mute, hi, I, just wanted to chime in I've lived in this neighborhood for almost 40 years. I'm an actress. I've been an actress for the 40 years that I've been in this neighborhood and I would have been left out by this gap. If I wanted to live here in this neighborhood for the entire 40 years, I would have been in that gap where and I wouldn't have been able to live here, and so I just wanted to say that I wanted to reiterate everything that everybody has already said. But I also am very concerned about the fact that I live right in the center of the heart of hell's kitchen, and it is all that's left of hell's kitchen in the five-story brownstone area, and this building is I know. You've already made the decision to get the 77 feet. But if we're going to go back to the beginning, I would like to say you know. I know you guys. I know somebody has to make money, but it totally wrecks the last vestige of the hell, the heart of hell's kitchen. That is five stories, but I do have a specific question for the architect. Does eight stories that this building, which I don't think, represents the community at all and aesthetically? Does it? Does eight stories mean that it has another two and a half stories of air flow units on top of it, because that is what has happened several times in this neighborhood there's a five stories or six stories? Okay, but then they build these enormous air conditioning units that go two stories up higher. So is that something that you could answer good question? Can yeah I mean there will be an interrupt just chime in if I'm not describing something accurate? But you know there will be an elevator bulkhead on the roof. That's as you kind of noted. That is something that happens, but you know it certainly will not be two stories tall. So Rob do you have a sense of how tall that those things usually are yeah the elevator bulkhead will be about I would say about a story and a half. But then again the footprint of the bulkhead is set back from the street by at least I would say at least 20-25 feet. So when you're standing at the street level, or even as far as you can step back, you probably won't even see the bulkhead as you are on the street, just because it's set back from the street Line Street wall and secondly, about that. The fact that you mentioned that yes, certainly the building, is a couple of stories taller than the surrounding streets surrounding buildings. But one thing that we were very careful about when we, while we were designing, is to respect the scale of the neighboring buildings and, as it is evident in the design, we step back the top two levels of the building just to align with the height and the character of the buildings right next to ours. The brick facade goes up six stories and matches the neighboring buildings and the metal panel portion is recessed just specifically to solve the address. The concern that you just raised. Thank you yes, but there is an extra floor story and a half of stuff that makes- and I'm just saying because you know times square- is a big part of our neighborhood and all of those hotel rooms that want to see a view of New Jersey and want to see the scope of living in the heart of New York of Manhattan, and they pay a lot of money when they come back from Covid-19 to see that and that it's just ruins the it just ruins the aesthetic of the sky and the light that has been here for so long, and you know you can say that, oh no, it won't affect anything, but it does, and it will thank you Vienne Leslie Murphy. Are you with us Leslie I am here. Thank you. I want to thank the board. I also want to thank the presenters. I know this is a tough topic. I can actually talk about the broken agreement which I won't because you guys have gone through it so well. I can talk about the multiplication tact that I think the presenters are taking with us, both the board and the residents and as inferior as that is I will pass over. That I can also talk about how welcoming our community is and the balance our community needs and live with lives with every day, but everyone has talked about this I guess ad nauseam. So I think you know where we're all at, but I do want to leave this administration and the presenters with more of an anecdotal point of view here, my daughter's seven years old, when she was young, we had five families that really bonded together right and they had kid. We all had kids parents in the last year and a half three of those families out of the five have left, and this is pre-Covid and the most heartbreaking story to me was one of my closest friends, Jen sat across from me at a Starbucks and said Leslie. We can not afford it anymore. We can't afford it anymore. It was so heartbreaking to me because these are the people who and she middle-class job the husband also had a lower income job, but these are the people that are they they're part of the Ptas. They go to the local restaurants they shop at our local shops. They are the heads of our girl scouts and our in our community organizations. So the only reason why I am talking about this particular demographic is because I just feel that this administration doesn't value them. It doesn't value this group of people that I think brings such an important balance to our neighborhoods and specifically now to Hell's kitchen. So when all these people start peeling off because there really is no affordable housing for them or their kids, I think we're losing that balance and what you talked about in your presentation. Yes, we have strong schools. Yes, we have great businesses, but that's not going to happen anymore when you lose the balance. I just want to say that, because it is personal for me and I wanted to thank the board just for giving me that opportunity. Thank you, Leslie Well said Janine. Is there anybody else who would like to speak? Yeah last person is Becca Gottlieb she should be on hi. Can you hear me? Yes, Becca hi, I'm Becca and I am an actor and I live in this community board and I just wanted to express my gratitude for the actress fund and I'm so grateful for their collaboration with this new building and I just wanted everyone to know how grateful the artists are in my community that depend on them and that ultimately, contribute to the economic and cultural growth in our area, and I also wanted to point out that I really appreciate the low income and the low AMI affordable housing, like I'm, a college educated, young woman, who's, a freelance artist and I'm in the 40 to 50 AMI group and I'm not homeless, and I've always paid my rent on time. I have three jobs and I just wanted to let everyone know that I would really appreciate and really benefit from the low income units, because there are only a few available and on the housing connect site now and I believe they should be equal in all categories. But I know you have budget different budget issues, but my entire Broadway Community theater community is suffering from job loss at the moment and would really benefit from the lower AMI units. Thank you. Becca Well said an important component janine. How are we doing anybody else? That's all from attendees, but I see Dale put his end up sure Dale go ahead. I was actually just gonna amplify a question that was in the chat about the roof. Can the architects speak to what's going on the roof with regards to? Is there like a open space available to the tenants on the roof, or is it just or is it just the mechanical stuff? The roof is currently just maintenance access not accessible to the tenants of the building as per the building program. The old does that I mean that's an answer, I mean, but maybe there's an opportunity to activate the roof as well. Any suggestions, dale or just want them to think about it. Suggestion would be to activate the root for solar panels. Okay, yeah and Dale. Thank you for your question. Well, when we come back, we will address it in one way or the other I want to. Thank everybody. I want to thank Janine, well done, Janine keeping this going. Thank you, HPD for being exhibiting grace under pressure. Thank you developers and thank you panel and thank you. Community I think we want to come back and we want you to hear what we're talking about and we're talking about trust. There has been a break in trust and I'm sure we all feel that's not the way we want to be governed. This is very serious. The second thing is that middle moderate income, those people, it's we are the Clinton special district and we have a mandate to preserve multiple levels of income. So that's important. It's also important for the health of any community. It's shocking to me that representatives or politicians do not encourage middle moderate income, housing. That's rather shocking and the third thing the homeless component. We are a welcoming community, I, think the majority of homeless in the city. Our families are women with children and we certainly hope they will be given a priority. Any other comments from the committee is any idea about writing a letter for the community board on next Wednesday about this presentation. Yep I make a motion to write a letter expressing our extreme disappointment in the broken agreement and our major concern of the holes within the income bans and that we would like that to be addressed. We also can broadly comment that there were commun. There was community push back on the size and hoping to get more details on the design at a later date. But the main focus of the letter is to stress that we need to fix these income bands so that we can try to get back to our original understanding of the need of balance in the community with moderate and middle income. The letter would reaffirm the same points that we've already made in a prior letter letters prior letters. Yes, first, we need a second. We need a second on this I think that's a second from Dale, okay, there's a second an add-on, yeah! Okay, you want to add I I'd like to also propose that we, like homeless families in into the homeless component, any other questions that came up, that we should add to the latter. Joe you're, no I think the note about that is homeless families, because the surrounding blocks have a lot of homeless singles and that's. We need a balance here again in what we're doing and we wanted some support for these families. Yes, I. Have that note? Okay, any other additions to this letter, any other discussion about this letter, all in fact, yes Paul, making sure that the facade is integrated with the park. Next to it. That's all that the park the facade facing is integrated with the park yeah that is coordinated with Waterson Park on the design of the park and integration of the building and the adjacent property. Like that, the point I raised at the issue is that the facade of their building doesn't look like it's integrating into the park schemes that we've seen from Waterson Park, so just make sure that you're coordinating on that okay, I! Okay, thank you, Paul, any more additions, any more discussion. If not have a quick question, yes, Leslie, yes, the actors fund. Will they be based on that? Ladies comment before, who was an actor? Who was working various jobs and was trying to accumulate enough money to move into an apartment? Will the actors fund be able to be involved with getting actors into the building? How will that work? If this is Daniel from the actors fund, I can feel that question. We will be definitely be doing a lot of marketing and outreach to folks in the arts and cultural community to ensure that they know about the opera. Opportunity will also be doing community workshops around how to successfully apply and prepare an application through the New York City Housing connect, so we're going to be doing as much programming as we can to ensure that people know about the opportunity and have access to it. Thank you, Daniel also Daniel, the the occupant of the space. Are you going to come back to the board to discuss? Yes, I mean two things on that one. We will absolutely keep you posted as we continue to identify and secure community facility tenant and, like I said before, if the community has any feedback on potential tenants for that space, we would be happy to reach out to them directly too. But, yes, we will yes. Thank you, Daniel I think we can add that to the letter too, and we also want to thank the actors fund as well as HPD and the developer for the presentation. Is there any opposition to this letter? Is everybody in favor just raise your hand, any opposition, any president, not eligible okay. Thank you all. Thank you community board. Thank you actors, fun. Thank you all, I'm sorry, just for the vote. If anybody was opposed, can you just say your name? Was everyone in favor, okay, thanks, Janine I think it was unanimous. Thank you for that. This was an important issue. Another important issue, perhaps with less disagreement, will be the design for the storefronts of the Windermere, the so-called Windermere. It's a building at the corner of 57th and 9th Avenue, it's a historic, it's a landmark, and finally, after many years, work is starting on it. Joe are you there? Can you give us a little history of that building? Sure the Windermere is the second oldest apartment house in New, York City, Elevator, Apartment House built in 1881. It is a building that the community stocks have landmarks for many years and only achieved that in the last 10 years, the building unfortunately went from being a famous apartment house to being a combination of SRO occupied by lots of actors, a lot of famous actors and regular apartments in the 1980s. The situation deteriorated dramatically there, and this is the only building in our district, where the owner, his wife and the managing agent were criminally convicted of harassment and put in jail. One of my first community board meetings of this committee. The managing agent, showed up and he was packing a gun, as the tenants complained about the harassment happening in the building. Truly, whatever you think has happened worse here. Tenants went to work in the day and came back and found their apartment doors removed and they were cement blocked up with their belongings. The tenants were their door, they were knocked on their door and a hot iron was put in their face and they went or asked were they ready yet to move. This is a very serious matter and at one point, as the late 80s continued, the owner took a chainsaw to the beams in the 406 portion of this building and the fire department vacated all the tenants out on a weekend. Long many tenants hung on. There was a finding of harassment, and this building pretty much went through a series of owners. Nothing ever happened. Finally, the current company purchased it the building was declared a landmark and there was a major renovation. The two components are, it was a landmark building, so I had to go through landmarks and it is also a cure for harassment building, and there are roughly one wing of the building about 18 or 20 units that are being built that are for permanently for low-income individuals for seniors. The community board took a position on this. Jd is a 2009. We did so yeah 2009. We were specific that we did not want the building enlarged. That was part of the request through the mechanism called 74711 in the landmarks in the in this New York City zoning resolution and myself and Pam Wolf from the community board testified about it. The Landmarks Commission approved the changes for an addition over the community board's objection and today in front of us, we actually have a very modest issue and that's a storefront change that a storefront is being installed and specifically how the change in terms of history happened in this building the community board. We were briefed, I, guess last week, Jd right yeah on this yeah, and we asked the developer to come tonight to explain exactly what it is and although we know the building is not settled yet because the 74711 has not yet been approved. I was on an impression it had been, as we have testified at landmarks back in 2009. This has not come to completion. So today the narrow issue is just storefront installation, along ninth Avenue and one of bay on West 57th Street. Thank you, Joe and just to reiterate, this is not about what's going into the building yeah, not yet they will come back, but they haven't applied yet so that's gonna take a couple months, but this is just about the storefront Ninth Avenue and around the corner on 57. So welcome who's going to speak for the developers hi. My name is Albert Fax. I'd like to thank everybody for having us here, welcome, Alvin and not being in the prior item either I I am I'm the project manager for the building and I've been overseeing. Some of the work that's been going on. We've really come a long way with the historic restoration and we have Ilya who is part of the team. He is our architect for the restorations of the storefronts and redoing some of the brick work at the street level. Hi everybody, I'm I'm Kyoya. My name is Ilya and I'm the architect as Albert stated Dr Amelia. Oh thank you Albert! Do you want to continue or should I? Yes, please I can present Helio if I get anything wrong. Please yeah feel free to yeah and correct me. So here's a picture of the building as it stands today and you can see a rendering that Ilya overlaid on this picture of what the storefronts will look like the storefronts take up approximately three quarters of a bay on 57th street and then continue all the way down. Ninth Avenue, you have three bays of storefronts with historic cast iron columns that are still present, you'll see pictures of them later and then you have two windows and a doorway that's going to be restored. Please here is some information about the site's location, the site's located on the South West corner of 57th and 9th we're going to be filing an alteration type 2 with the building department for the installation of the storefronts, and you have some information, some satellite picture of the building please over here you have a compilation of different pictures of different dates of the building, so you can see a little bit of how it's evolved. The most original picture is picture number four, which is dated 1905. You can kind of see some of the storefront design right behind the elevated track. The picture below that is from 1917, which also gives a little more detail, and you could kind of see the ornate Cornish that existed above the storefronts and then you have two other pictures from 1940 and you could kind of see the transfer nation from its original condition to 1940, where the storefronts kind of all changed the please. So the reason why we are in front of the board today is that original to the building was an area way along ninth Avenue and an entrance to the cellar off the street. This point, this aspect of the building is original to its building, but is not was not present when the building was landmarked, so we need to present in front of the board, because this is an item that we will not be restoring and we'll go through a few of the slides and you'll see why we won't be restoring the areaway over here. We've highlighted where you could kind of see what that area way. Looked like please, here's better pictures of it. If you see there was a staircase right in front of the mailbox going down to the cellar and then, if you look at the picture to the right, you can kind of see there was this fancy wrought iron that extended out maybe six or seven feet, and this allowed light to go down into the cellar space please. This is what exists of the facade. Today, you could kind of see where the old area where the old stairs down to the cellar was located and you can get a good picture of the cast iron columns and really what exists of the historic streetscape today. Please here is a drawing of what existed back in 1905 or 007 the staircase down, that's to the left and we've kind of highlighted it and showed what's on the street today. That obstruction was approximately a seven feet: seven foot ten obstruction into the sidewalk, and if that would be restored, we'd really be creating a bottleneck at this corner. I've been at this site quite a few times in the last few years and I can tell you firsthand. As many of you already know, this is a very a busy intersection and you do get a lot of foot traffic walking up and down the avenue. I believe some of it is because there is a train, stop a subway stop, maybe across the street, and you get a lot of people that are going a few blocks downtown would get off and walk up and down this 9th avenue. Please here are some pictures of what's there today of the 57th street of Facade, so we showed you 9th Avenue earlier. This will give you a good idea of what exists today on the 57th street side. Please here are some closer pictures of the existing cast iron columns that are going to be restored, and you will begin to see what the proposed design is going to be to the right. Please here are some pictures of the 57th street to the left, which we showed you in detail. Two slides below before and to the right is what's being restored of that storefront please. This is a good overview of the entire frontage along 9th avenue you. There are three bays of cast iron columns. You can't see the cast irons, columns on the left bay, the most furthest from the corner, and that's because they are hidden behind the plywood fence. That's currently there right now, please. These are the original openings that we are dealing with and it could overlay to see where we are going to be in filling the historic store fronts and doorways and everything else please. These are the cast iron columns that are going to be restored. Like I said earlier, there's two of them behind this fence: we've highlighted them, but you can't see them from the street they're there. This is a missing storefront plaster that we believe should be extended down to the sidewalk. We believe this was original to the building, but at some point might have been tampered with or altered. We don't have good photos of 9th avenue, very clear photos, so we're doing our best, putting on our architect, hats and trying to say how would this? What would this building look like if it was built in this era? Please? This is some brickwork that you can see here. That needs to be restored and look similar to the brickwork above, like at the second floor level, or to match the brickwork everywhere else where the building has been restored. Today here is a rendering of what what the storefronts will look like and what the streetscape will look like once the building is once the storefronts and this part of the project is completed. Please here is a architectural elevation, showing the various different elements. I'll point a few out: we have the historic cast iron columns. We have the wood infill storefronts, we have the doors and we have the wood. Cornice, that's going to be restored the door, the second bay off the corner. That door is just a dummy door and I, don't believe it's going to be used, it'll, look like a door, but it won't be in use please. This is the historic archway that was above the entrance to the cellar level, we're going to be restoring it back to its original condition, and we, although we will not be restoring the opening that archway and that architectural feature will still be there. Ilya has some details to the right to show that shadow line that you'll see in the historic photos and the Keystone that's going to be restored or replicated to look like its original condition. Next, this is the storefronts on 57th street, the corner, storefront angles at a 45 degree angle, which you see a lot in this area and the storefronts to the right are kind of like a bay window where they project beyond the facade. Please here is a plan of the storefronts and what they and where they would be placed in relation to the building facade. Please, and here are different sections through the storefronts showing different different features. One of them is the Bay Window number four is the Bay window. That I was talking about earlier. Number five is the the fixed doorway which was located along ninth Avenue and the others are either at the window level or the cast iron column or at the storefront section. Please I think this. Is it correct, helium yeah, that's the last slide, so this is it for the presentation. The reason why we're here today is there is one aspect that I believe is not going to be. That is not going to be restored back to its historical condition. That is the area way that took up around seven feet of the sidewalk along ninth Avenue I. Think restoring that would do a great disservice to the community into that block, as it would really narrow the sidewalk and create even more congestion along 9th Avenue and Albert you're not required to restore it am I correct because it when the building was landmarked, it had already been removed. Yes, you are correct. Jd I did not. I did not state that thank you for bringing that up. Thank you, Albert and Elia for a presentation that sounds very thorough and very careful. Thank you. Would you take some questions? I'm sure there'll be some questions from the committee about this I. Don't see any questions? Oh yes, I do David, Sullivan, yes, hi! Could you put back the the elevation showing the ninth Avenue, showing where that seller access was? Do you want to see the historic photos or the actual, drawing yeah the exterior yeah? That's fine, I, didn't I, guess the current the photograph yeah. You want to go back a slide, one more keep going, one more yeah and there we go okay. That was fine, no one forward, yeah, so I. This is in reference specifically to where that near the corner where the seller access was so you don't actually know that. That's original! You just know that it was there in the earliest photograph you have, which was maybe 20 years after the building was built. Is that correct? Yes, but I? I'd have to think it's original when I go down to the basement of the building. I can see where they had openings in the foundation wall for windows. So if I go into the cellar of the building and I face the front of 9th Avenue I can see where there were windows along ninth Avenue and there might have been three or four of them. There was an area wave that was original to this building along ninth Avenue. And what so you know this to me doesn't look like even for you know, this is an interesting issue, because this is kind of like a Supreme court nomination as well, where you have the originalists who are devoted to what the founders wrote, come hell, high or hard water versus those who want to adapt the document for you know for modern life. You know this there's nothing particularly attractive about this. I'm talking about this first day off the corner on 9th Avenue, it's not attractive now, and if it was like that in 1881, then it would have been attractive then, and there must have been some utilitarian purpose of it for it, which is certain you're alluding to with this area way. But my guess is the original architects, if they without that utilitarian necessity that whatever it was wouldn't have done this they wouldn't have designed that I mean this is not a beautifully detailed building every you know pretty much from top to bottom, but that corner is not beautiful, and so there must have been a you know, a real functional reason that force forced them to do that. Having to do with access to the seller- and we don't have that now from what you're saying we don't have that utilitarian necessity. So why are we keeping this ugly corner just because you know James Madison, you know whoever put the electoral college in the constitution, which is not serving us very well now, either Hamilton. Whoever okay? Can you be a little more specific yeah, the blank, the brick, the blank brick wall in the first bay on Ninth Avenue from the corner, where you're, where your cellar arch is, which is bricked up, that bay is very unattractive, it would have been unattractive in 1881 and it's unattractive now so I, don't really quite understand why the compulsion to restore this utility access to restore visually this utility access, even though there's no utility access required I, think it I think because it is it existed when the building was landmarked number one were required to restore that archway and second I believe it will give it a little more character. But is there some way to design okay, the archway down below? Is there some way to design that blank brick wall incorporating an archway incorporating the archway into something that's more more open, more inviting more? This is a blank wall on the most prominent corner. Well, you know one of the most prominent corners in the city and it's a blank brick wall right. Why would I mean I understand you know if there's no choice? Okay, if you're telling me there's just you have to do it, no matter what you got to have the electoral college and we're going to live with it for the rest of our days. You know, along with lots of other, you know, problems in the constitution, if that, but it's hard to believe that you couldn't incorporate the arch into something that's more attractive than this. Can we quickly see the proposed facade? It's not much different from what we're seeing there. So two things that were that are going to give this corner a little more detail than what you see now, no I, don't I understand that. There's more detail, I'm specific! Let's I'm just talking about a very narrow thing that blank brick wall between the window. That's what I'm talking about, there's no point in talking about other parts: I get the other parts. It's that blank brick wall where the arch is I, understand, I, think if it was up to the owner, he he'd have it to be all glass. It would make the space more attractive but I believe. There's much. Could you answer my question directly, I'm asking. Is there a way to make it more open, incorporating the arch, but without a blank brick wall without the entire wall? Without that entire section being blank, but still incorporating the arch, we can incorporate the arch and we can maybe put a frosted window where the doorway was I. Think you're, missing David's point is: can you remove the brick wall and replace it with glass? The answer is landmarks. Will not no that Joe? Sorry, no, that's not what I said. That's not what I'm saying. Is there a design that incorporates the arch that is not just a blank brick wall but still incorporates the art, I'm not saying how you would do it, I'm not saying whether you would do it with glass or other materials. Maybe it's a combination, I don't know so we can. We can't take the infill of the arch and replace that, with a with like a fake talking about the entire wall. I understand that there's not much. We could do with the entire world. I'm trying to explain to David where we can maybe make some subtle changes if he believes that will make a difference go ahead, you can talk to me not to Joe David I, believe we can add an infill window within the archway and that's maybe the most. That landmarks will approve. I, don't believe, they'll allow us to make another opening in that wall yeah. Can you do anything I think that would be an improvement, but can you do anything to the rest of the wall? Well, the rest of the wall is going to be the face. Brick. The finish brick is going to be coming down and it's going to be re-bricked up to match similar to the brick above. Not what are you saying you have to do that? Yes, thank you. David! Does that, then that answer your question David they can look. Yeah I mean I. Think adding something to that arch besides, you know what it shows here would you know maybe glazing it with a with an opaque glass of some kind. Something would certainly help. Okay. Thank you. David Dale, you had a question yeah a couple of things and just sidebar originalism is a false precept. Okay, so, as per as regards our laws and our judicial system, I'm very glad to see that you're, not that area way that that staircase to the basement is not going to encroach on pedestrian clearance anymore by the way, I think one of the driving factors for pedestrian traffic along this ninth Avenue corridor is the fact that there's an m11 bus stop right across the street. So that's probably like it's a busy route and I also wanted to ask is since that area way is being enclosed or eliminated, is the access to the basement strictly interior? At this point or there's? Is there any other area way along the ninth Avenue stretch? There are I believe three seller access doors along ninth Avenue, either two or three and I think those access hatches are gonna remain. There is another means to get to the basement that isn't the only way to get there right. Was it just that one near the corner? That's extra long! That encroaches onto the sidewalks clearance. Yes, well, no, there's another one towards the end closer to the end of the building Mm-hmm. Maybe all the way at the end of the building. You have one alumni so furthest south along 9th avenue by the old Bar Lincoln Park, that's correct, dale, yes, yeah, yes, and maybe this one projects a little more than what they usually project and I, believe it projects more because it used to be an actual stair going down to the basement versus a hatch. Yes, okay, thanks Dale Dolores, you had a question, then James, not a question. Just a comment. I mean this building is something I've been looking at. My entire life I actually can look over my shoulder and see the top of it now I. I'm so appreciative that the work is being done. This red brick is just so beautiful. David I actually don't mind the wall. It is so it's actually really a gorgeous. Look when it's. This finished compared to what I've been seeing growing up here, so I appreciate that and forgetting about when it was landmarked. I'm I personally am not really concerned of creating that exactness, because right now, what you're, proposing at least creates the function of being able to move down the street, but also preserving the archway, which shows a little bit of that texture that you may not see if you're, not looking up or you're, not staring at the column. So I appreciate that very much I would hate to think that at this point as far as you've, finally gotten this building has been under wraps for so long I would hate to think that this small little change would hold you up and I really hope that the rest of the committee is supportive of being able to go back to landmarks, to say that, even though it's not required, it's not really important for the community to have that exactly as the original picture from 1905 before it was landmark. Thank you, Delores James, yeah, very brief comment. I just wanted to say I guess, first of all, Mr Fax! Thank you. That was an amazing presentation, the level of detail, the level of attention and care was apparent and also the cooperation between you and your architect. You know, usually the architect, will go to that level of detail. So to hear the project manager really massaging out the details is really great. My only question and comment and again you know, whatever you decide to do, I think you've shown that you've tried to maintain a character and maintain the landmark's intent. Have you considered or you've heard of the technique of Trump Lloyd I didn't get that trump sure it's a it's an artistic technique called Trump Lloyd. Have you heard of that? No, it's a painting right! You can't I'm sorry to interject. It's you. Basically, three paintings right on that's correct, so yeah! So as an alternative and again whatever you decide, I'm not advocating for this on behalf of the board or even on the behalf of myself. I just wanted to throw out there that if, in fact you wanted to do something with that blank red wall that isn't structural, there are painting techniques that allow you to create a three-dimensional illusion that will make the wall look consistent with the rest of the facade again, I don't know if that would require landmarks approval, but I just wanted to throw that out there and Joe's nodding, but I just wanted to throw that out there. So first is I'd like to give Ilya the credit he put together. The presentation I merely presented the case. I do have a background in architecture, but the credit should all go to Ilia. Thank you appreciate the Albert, but I think it's a collaboration that makes us strong and I. Think Albert has been a great resource for this and he knows the building a lot more closer than I do actually I came on not that long ago, on this project, I think Albert has been working on this case for a long time. Ultimately, my go to personal questions. Thank you. Brian. We have a question from Brian. Are you there? I am? Can we just put up that elevation, rendering real quick again the proposed rendering, and while we do that, I just want to echo Dolores comment like I personally, don't have problems with that red brick wall, it's really beautiful, brick, I, don't think adding a frosted piece of glass in the archway is gonna elevate. The wall anyway, I just think that you know I don't take issue with that. I don't want to hold this up as a result of that I just wanted to ask about bays two and three where they have that one continuous cornice, if you look at the other, oh okay, there's so that that's what I'm gonna see is the vertical plaster that comes down between base two and three. My question was: would that be? Would the cornice be continuous there? If, so, why and then I'm looking at what you're, considering bays one and two and I see that's also a continuous cornice, so I'll explain to you what we did it, what we did and why we did it. If we can go back to, can we go back a few slides to the I think it's slide. Number either 11 or 10. right here. This is perfect. You could kind of see what used to be a finished brick and what was a common brick what was covered, and if you try to follow that pattern, it was really inconsistent and we believe that over time something changed and we couldn't find pictures of what was the historic condition. So we kind of made a few. We made a few assumptions and the assumption was that, since the face break since the common brick ran across the first two bays from 57th street to towards 56 and the next two bays, the heights of the cast iron columns and the heights of the openings were very similar, they were four inches off. We figured that also ran across okay and it didn't continue running across because the next bay is probably a foot shorter in height. So now, if you go to the rendering you'll see how we try to mask that and be as consistent as possible and be as uniform as possible without having all these elevation changes now, if we can, please go back to the rendering, so you see that the height difference between the Bay Right 56th street. Even if you look at the height difference between the second and the third bag, with the cast iron columns, we have to kind of play a little bit and put a wood fascia on the top, because there's a four inch height difference between the two right I guess: that's what I was reacting to it looked like and I think it's just an illusion of the elevation it looked like it was slanting down, but it's not it's parallel to the ground plane. Is that correct, yeah and you're just using, and you just have that extra fascia there I now see that you're pointing that out was there when, in those historical photos, was there an original shot of that cornice and was that cornice. So that was the cornice step down like that, along with no, we only have a shot of the Cornish on the corner of 57th and 9th. So if I go back to the photos which might be slide three or four I believe, if we can please go back to slide three or four you'll see a good picture of what the Cornish looked like. Can we step back to slide three gene yeah right there imagine I, see yeah I, see in number two, and that was the only picture we had of the cornice. So it's okay, yeah and then you can't see what happened to it after that right, okay! Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you, Brian Leslie. You have a question for us or comment yeah. It's a comment. I just think. The removal of that area as discussed is going to be good for the block because the bus stop used to be on the corner there before the construction began. Now the bus stops on the north side of 9th Avenue and 57th street, so I assume, and maybe rightly or wrongly, that the city may again re-establish the bus. Stop in front of the building on Ninth, Avenue, yeah, so I think I was at the site two weeks ago and it seems like the bus. Stop is back. They put a signage for a bus, stop, but I don't think it's in use because they're digging up the street again so there's they might still be using across the street. The current bus stop is north of 57. Yes, okay, thanks Leslie I just have a question for Albert or Ilya. The cornice was wood. You you've established that originally yeah. We we've determined that okay right, Albert I think we know by now. Yes, okay, are there and Janine? Do we have any questions from the community? Are you there Janine? Yes, I had a bunch of windows, open, no I, don't see any hands raised in the attendee section. Okay, thanks Janine I just want to say to Ilya and Albert. This building is so beautiful right now compared to what it was, and it's just such a great asset to the community and I. Just I think we all appreciate the thoroughness and the care that you've taken to do this and I think what you're coming to ask us correct me. If I'm wrong is that we don't have, the board is not opposed to not restoring what was there before it was landmarked. Is that correct, Albert, Correct, okay, so nice job both of you? Thank you so much for coming to us. Anybody, wanna, yeah, I, don't wanna be specific about that. So it's that there is no requirement for the area around the arch which had an entryway and also an extension out into the sidewalk. That area is not required by landmarks to restore to that original photo prior to landmarking from 1905 and that, if that's the case, then I would like to make a motion to propose that the committee is supportive of not having to fulfill that requirement of going back to the very original photo and to be supportive of what we've seen tonight from the presentation on the storefront restoration. Exactly thank you and to thank Albert and Ilya for this presentation. We have a second. Are there any discussion about this anything? You want to add to the letter anybody, so, if not and all in favor of that letter, that motion is there any opposition to it or any present, not eligible janine. You got that all down I think it's unanimous yep got it. Thank you, okay! Albert! Thank you! So much for this and really nice work. Congratulations! Thank you all for your time tonight have a great night and happy holidays. Thank you stay safe! Thank you. You've been so good, panelist and community. We have one more presentation, not a presentation, exactly a little talk by Paul Devlin, who has been so kind to come and give us a little rundown on the latest flood resiliency ideas from city planning or whoever's doing it Paul. Thank you. He waived his usual fee for speaking he's gonna. Do it for free and we're very appreciative. It was a very. It was a very long presentation, I think something like 50, slides or something to Chelsea land use. Our area up here in hell's kitchen is not so affected, as Chelsea will be because Chelsea will be underwater. We won't be we're on high ground. Hudson yards might be flooded. We really don't care, I, don't think, but anyway, I think Paul. Thank you for giving us a little presentation, and if there are any comments, there's gonna be another meeting at Chelsea land use. We can certainly go to that. If Paul will allow us to attend his meeting and we can raise any issues or concerns we have now so Paul. Thank you. I appreciate everyone's time on this I don't charge a fee because I'm already a member of this committee, so there is no speaker's fee required. I did take the 50-page presentation and expand it slightly, because I know this committee has much more information than Chelsea Landis prefers, but very quickly. This is a zoning text, amendment it's city-wide which, as you all know when something is done city-wide. It doesn't pay attention to specifics within neighborhoods. So it's a zoning text, amendment being codified of the changes that were made after superstorm Sandy that allowed zoning areas that were subject to flooding in the coastal zones to have zoning regulations put into place to allow people to put in resiliency factors. So if you think about the homes on the Rockaway beaches that were flooded out, they were raised up on stilts and then the water could wash in and out below. Well now, that area below is that part of far are not part of far what about putting a backup generator in the backyard generators aren't allowed in residential zones. So if you want to put a generator in you're allowed to do it now or if you think about businesses that have storage in the basements like a lot of the retail facilities, have storage in the basement. If they dry flood proof that, then they can continue to use it if they don't dry flu flood proof that they can use the floor above for commercial storage, and it doesn't count as part of the formulas for residential units above it. So there are a lot of implications about the coastal, flooding, resiliency factors, and so they've put these rules into place that they're going to allow people within the flood zones and if you think about the flood zone map the 100 year and 500 year, flood plain basically west of 9th Avenue from 14th to 23rd is within that. So that means the half of the historic Chelsea district. All of the west Chelsea historic district, half of the special West Chelsea special district are all within this flood zone. So, if you think about, if a developer comes along and says, I want to put in resiliency factors and I want to put a flood barrier at 10 feet, which is the flood plain height. Does that mean they have a 10 foot wall surrounding their buildings? And how is that going to impact our neighborhoods? So for Hell's kitchen, the only parts in the flood zone are as Jd points out, the western rail yards of Hudson yards, which I think if they are allowed to put their commercial space up on floors above they're allowed to put their mechanicals out of basements. Above what they'll do is add height to their buildings, because they won't count those lower floors, they'll, add the 10 fighter, 10 feet of the ground and then they'll add that means putting 10 feet at the top. So we're trying to think through what would the developers do to apply for resiliency factors and allow for expanded development or destruction of streetscape? So those are our two big concerns. The other issue is that these zoning resiliency factors are, will supersede any special district regulations. So, as I point out, the Clinton special district there's one block between 42nd and 43rd between 11th and 12th. That would be in the flood plain everything else is outside of it, but for Chelsea there's a lot more areas, so we have requested DCP come back to Chelsea land use. We gave them a two-page list of questions about 18 different points again talking about height issues, talking about impacts on streetscape, talking about the impact on the historic districts itself and they're going to come back to us on the 21st to re-present. So if anybody here has any questions on zoning for coast, flooding, resiliency we'd like to go through all the materials in the dropbox would like to ask me questions and would like to attend the December 21st Chelsea land use meeting. You are more than welcome and I'm also happy to answer any quick questions that people might have Paul. That was excellent. Thank you! So much so hell's kitchen. Besides Hudson yards, it's 42nd to 43rd street 11th to 12th Avenue Correct yeah, there's that, if you think about where does water go right, it's all along the river side, and so really the only area where it comes in east, at all from the river I mean clearly, 12th Avenue is swamped and there's a couple of those low-lying areas that might get hit, but basically the only area that I see on the floodplain map that they're proposing is that one block of 40 between 42 and 43rd, between 11th and 12th and again, that's then Hudson yards and also Moynihan station is within this floodplain. So it does make it for some interesting discussions: okay Paul that will work. Thank you. So much any questions from the committee about this any concerns. I, don't see any hands raised, I love when there are no questions because I don't have the answers. Oh come on. Let's give Paul a hard time. What about the community? Can anybody Janine from the community needs? No one has their hand raised. Oh Paul you're getting off too easily here anyway, Paul. Thank you so much. That was excellent. If any questions do arise from the committee, we can reach out to you and bring them up always available. Thank you all very much, so anybody want to make a motion to thank Paul Devlin for this excellent short presentation motion to thank him and to adjourn I. Second, the adjournment. Okay, second panelists. Thank you so much. You all were just excellent questions. Terrific thank you! Paul for the Summation Goodnight everybody, everyone happy, Thanksgiving, stay safe and thanks to the public for sticking it out, yeah, happy Thanksgiving, all right, Thanksgiving! Thank you good night! Everybody! Thank you. So much.
