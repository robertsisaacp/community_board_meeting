One is a presentation of the development going over the rail cut at the DEP site and the second item is going to be a presentation of storefront design at the Windermere, which is on 57th street, 9th Avenue, wonderful, building, landmark building, and the third item agenda item is going to be a talk by the co-chair of Chelsea land use, Committee, Paul, Devlin, who's.
We may fail, but we will try and if you're, calling in please use star9 and for the public when, If you want to ask questions when you're, given the opportunity, please do so we'll be sure to call on everybody.
So I want to welcome Barbara Davis, a former board member, always good to see you here, Barbara, as well as everybody else welcome, So we're going to start.
The first agenda item tonight is a presentation by HPD on a affordable housing site which is on above the rail cut between 48th and 49th.
City-Owned sites, this site and the MTA site on 54th 9th avenue between 54th and 59th would be for moderate middle income housing.
Subsequently, Every year after that, the board has produced letter after letter saying that affordable housing would be up to 165 percent AMI, that's area, medium, income, 20 would be 80, AMI 125 would go for 40 and the other 40 of the units would be for up to 165 percent.
The city discovered that there were homeless people living in the city and that there were people of low income who needed housing suddenly without any discussion with this community.
There is a need for moderate middle-income housing and, Let's work together to restore confidence between the city and this community.
So I don't want to stigmatize the developer because they have been a good partner, but we want to continue working to achieve the agreement that this community and this community board made with the city all those years, ago.
Sorry, 705, 10th Avenue project will be the new construction of a mixed-use building consisting approximately 158, affordable units, as well as ground floor community facility.
That disposition is purely for New, York, City code reasons to get a light and air easement and, as I previously stated, HPD approval for the disposition of the site in order to facilitate the development and with that stated, I'll turn it back over to Joel to go over some specifics of the site and the project.
You know that 40-year history that we have in the city really extends to working in community board.
For over the course of many years, We've been involved in a number of projects, both affordable and market rate, and obviously again, most recently with the West 29th street project and now with this project as well, which we're really excited to be continuing our relationship with community ward 4.
Our core program areas include social Services, Workforce, Development, health, and, of course, housing, and we also have deep roots in this community in terms of our facilities.
Zoning is a R8 C25 in the special Clinton district that site that area has a maximum floor area ratio of 4.2 and an as of right, maximum building height of 66 feet.
This is a good opportunity for us to kind of point out some of the agencies that we've been working with and how that's coming along, so the site's, obviously owned by DEP.
And, then the other big well, two other big agencies just to point out our obviously the parks department, we'll talk a bit more about the coordination there and then look pretty technical, but because of the where the Amtrak right away is those the street bed or the sidewalk I should call it.
These are DOT pedestrian bridges, so we're dealing with or working with, Dot's bridges and making sure that infrastructure is going to be maintained in the way that they need it to be maintained, Thanks, Janine, so again, just some project area photos to point out to you all view, one which is on the top left.
Thinking about how our design can really enhance that great neighborhood asset that will be coming online and then, finally, given that this site is in Hell's kitchen arts and culture.
Please so just wanted to talk a bit more about the ground floor and give more context about how this program comes together at the Gra at the street level and the open space level.
However, parks wants to design it, but you know some signage there to indicate that that's a conversation available for public use and then on the just below.
That is, that moderate income level, Melissa I, know you want to add some more context.
This project was at the March 2020 executive committee meeting, and we presented a slightly different proposed affordability mix, and we certainly heard and recognized the feedback that the community board is really looking to see more units, and this new.
As far as affordability is concerned, so the affordability tiers that are proposed for this project that you see here are meant to help protect those most vulnerable residents of the local community, as well as provide a range of units that also moderate incomes.
In order to allow long-term residents of the Clinton health kitchen community to remain in their neighborhood, The last thing I'll say before I: kick it back to the development team.
The first is a special permit, pursuant to zoning resolution, section 74681 to develop over and in this case over the open, Amtrak right of way, and that is just a requirement for any site that has the condition that we have here.
You can see the massing with the I, Don't know what to call it hatched, but the area for above 66 feet that indicates the area of that height and setback special permit, And then, On the right hand, side, you have a site plan that shows in pink what would be the required rear yard equivalent for this site and so for us in order Matt to maximize the number of housing units here and to create a building that we think you know, responds well to the site and is integrated onto the site.
It seems that HPD is picking and choosing what they want from the points of agreement and ignoring others, and the fact that after many discussions that what we were promised, what we agreed to has been completely turned upside down as Joe says, we're a pretty caring, community.
You know anything about the location around this building, how many social services there are already to come and present this without it's just shocking to me.
My question is that the parameters to limit it we're very concerned, as you always know, with precedent, So can we limit it to have it only in conjunction with another special permit from the 74,681, which is the building over the rail cut and then adjacent to a public open space.
Obviously, There is a path forward past the pandemic, and things may change within five years, but at this point, we're quite alarmed as a community on how to handle this amount of special needs and social services.
That's right in other projects, you might see that you know they set the incomes at sixty percent of AMI.
You know so you're both trying to provide housing at multiple income levels, but you're also trying to make sure that again, The number at the bottom of the of the Performa to finance the project is a zero and not red.
We know the project worked at the original income.
Hpd came to this community and said we need to use public sites for moderate minimum housing because we're creating low income housing on privately owned sites through our new inclusionary mechanism in western rail yards and Hudson yards west Chelsea and the garment center.
We're going to have to move the 25 of the units between 53 and 56, which are being built throughout our community in every single, affordable housing project that is inclusionary into higher bands in order to satisfy and to meet the needs of people who make more than that because those are civil, servants.
I just want to acknowledge that I understand the frustration here from the community, because there was an agreement that these sites would be used for.
Moderate, including this site, would be used for moderate and middle income housing at the time and as far as it seems, we're not honoring that agreement to the letter of it.
We need to give people in this in these income groups opportunities, particularly in areas like your neighborhood, that have high access to transit, high access to jobs, good schools and high access to quality, commercial amenities, including fresh foods, and we put out a plant.
We came up with this plan, but the economic crisis has exacerbated the problem and heightens the reason that we need to include low-income units in any and all the projects that we do, but particularly in high opportunity.
Percent, Ami and I have extreme concerns about people who live, doubled up or tripled up in housing in this district who can not find affordable housing when they come out of college, and we have to recognize that average starting income is 55,000 and up we're losing zoomers and millennials.
It did not look into the things that all 56 community boards were doing, and this community board has been doing an exceptional job at linking bands to ensure that generations of hell's kitchen and Chelsea individuals, as well as those who aspire to live here, can do so and part of the reason why I came on here is because my mother was a part of that block association along with Jd and Elkafears who's, the president at Block Association, to identify that lot of land.
Yes, First I want to thank Dale for reminding us that you know we are here to serve the community.
You know you come here with the best of intentions, but I think you can tell from the feedback that it's kind of landing on deaf ears and what I would suggest is not only that you look at the bands which the holes in the bands are.
Is our assurance sitting across from the table from one another and saying you know, We agree to something and if you go back on that, you're, actually creating bigger problems for HPD and for community boards in the future, because they won't know if you're going to go back on an agreement that they're making it's opportunistic.
I. Just want to ask on the development of the facade facing the park space that you work with waterfront parks on how that's accessed, because the plans for that park seem to indicate a fence along that wall and so make sure that that's in case also a picayon issue, But I would prefer that we use genderless restroom assignments and not have a male and a female assignment to those rooms.
Five ten, You know build up and fill those holes to have a three thousand dollar income window of opportunity to get into these units.
Thank you, Paul Delores, You have a question actually I just wanted to take advantage of the fact that Douglaston and the architect are here, because we've made our points about the bands.
We understand that you can go up to that higher height, but you know keeping it so that it's compact, that it looks more in keeping with the majority of the neighborhood, is appreciated and I just wanted to give the feedback both to the developer and the architect that for someone else like Chris who was born and raised in the neighborhood, it feels like a good fit for that.
I think it needs a bit of a punch in order to become what is essentially an end cap building on a full block in this distinct architecturally, distinctive neighborhood.
Yes, I did I, you know, look I, think the income bans and the reneging on the agreement is really the important topic.
People should be, It makes it sound as if our neighborhood is not only welcoming but has not developed an incredible amount of low-income housing through multiple programs.
It's the hugest number of civil servants going to any HPD project, because civil servants are union jobs and they make more money and they don't have the opportunity because they can't compete in the market in neighborhoods, like this.
First of all, I want to thank you all for your work on this committee and the community board and for fighting the good fight on behalf of this neighborhood.
In this report, and this community board in general, has always pushed for keeping this neighborhood to be integrated along every single line and right now the people who are being forced out are working.
This building is humongous I, don't think it fits in this neighborhood at all, but we'll just say that for another day, I just want to let you know that this neighborhood is up in arms and that we are totally supporting our community board in fighting for us.
I'm been a neighbor resident of the health kitchen area close to 40 years, now, and I actually remember the community gatherings and all of the you know, negotiating and everything that we did.
I am representing a condominium building in the neighborhood, we're actually a little bit closer to the MTA site versus 705 10th, but you know very concerned about both and in particular a lot of the topics and themes that have been discussed today, particularly not with regards to necessarily the project.
Obviously you know, there's a lot to focus in on, and people have used there, but I did want to at least thank the two representatives from the developer and the architect.
You know what was agreed to in 2009, moderate middle-income housing for our hell's kitchen.
So much I, don't know whether HPD has looked around the area but you're surrounded by housing.
But I also am very concerned about the fact that I live right in the center of the heart of hell's kitchen, and it is all that's left of hell's kitchen in the five-story brownstone area, and this building is I know.
Eight stories that this building, which I don't think, represents the community at all and aesthetically.
So I think you know where we're all at, but I do want to leave this administration and the presenters with more of an anecdotal point of view, here, my daughter's seven years, old.
It doesn't value this group of people that I think brings such an important balance to our neighborhoods and specifically now to Hell's kitchen.
When all these people start peeling off, because there really is no affordable housing for them or their kids, I think we're losing that balance and what you talked about in your presentation.
And I just wanted everyone to know how grateful the artists are in my community that depend on them and that ultimately, contribute to the economic and cultural growth in our area, and I also wanted to point out that I really appreciate the low income and the low AMI affordable housing, like I'm, a college.
Let everyone know that I would really appreciate and really benefit from the low income units, because there are only a few available and on the housing connect site.
The second thing is that middle moderate income, those people, it's we are the Clinton special district.
We are a welcoming, community, I, think the majority of homeless in the city.
Opportunity will also be doing community workshops around how to successfully apply and prepare an application through the New York City Housing connect, So we're going to be doing as much programming as we can to ensure that people know about the opportunity and have access to it.
I think we can add that to the letter too, and we also want to thank the actors fund as well as HPD and the developer for the presentation.
A building at the corner of 57th and 9th Avenue, it's a historic, it's a landmark, and finally, after many years, work is starting on it.
The reason why we are in front of the board today is that original to the building was an area way along ninth Avenue and an entrance to the cellar off the street.
I believe some of it is because there is a train, stop a subway stop, maybe across the street, and you get a lot of people that are going a few blocks downtown would get off and walk up and down this 9th avenue.
Next, This is the storefronts on 57th street, the corner, storefront angles at a 45 degree angle, which you see a lot in this area and the storefronts to the right are kind of like a bay window where they project beyond the facade.
Think, restoring that would do a great disservice to the community into that block, as it would really narrow the sidewalk and create even more congestion along 9th Avenue and Albert.
I think because it is it existed when the building was landmarked number one were required to restore that archway and second I believe it will give it a little more character.
There are painting techniques that allow you to create a three-dimensional illusion that will make the wall look consistent with the rest of the facade, again, I, don't know if that would require landmarks approval, but I just wanted to throw that out.
Right, Albert I think we know by now.
So, If you think about, If a developer comes along and says, I want to put in resiliency factors.
