We start our agenda tonight with a public hearing on the proposed statement of district needs and budget requests.
You want to address any issue any other than the statement of district needs in proposed budget.
You want to speak on the budget or just about 36th street generally at just about 36Th. That is a warning to anyone who has signed up to speak at the public session or to speak on the topic of the statement of district needs.
Just wanted to comment on the letter about the temp homeless, shelters on West 36Th Street.
It's been over five months since DHS, and the city placed this disproportionate number of temp, homeless, shelters and hotels in a one block.
But what I know for sure is that placing three different shelters within one block has to be exponentially.
I'm thankful for the vocal support of the of this group of CB4, The borough President Assemblyman Gottfried Senator Jackson, but it is beyond disheartening that our mayor, Corey, Johnson and Senator Hoyleman take no action or remain silent for fear of appearing politically incorrect or insensitive and prefer to continue experimenting with our safety.
I'm, Brian, Weber resident of 36Th Street, and the co- chair of the 36Th Street Block Association, I'm here on behalf of the Block Association, to support housing, health and Human Services letter item number 15 regarding the temporary shelters on West 36Th Street.
Speaker, Johnson and Senator Hoyleman to support community board 4 Manhattan borough president Gail Brewer, Assemblyman, Godfrey and Senator Jackson's request to reduce the number of shelters and the number of shelter beds on West 36Th Street.
Let me just first stay thanks to all of those that very moving set of testimonials that I heard just now and want you to know that as your state senator as a state, official, I have been working with my colleagues who obviously are at the city level and trying to rectify this untenable.
Means that we can override a governor's veto and have a greater hand in budgeting and hopefully addressing issues like the need to build additional supportive housing for our homeless population.
If we're going to get to 42, though we suffered some losses in the democratic Senate, we're going to still retain the majority, though, but I think everyone's you know, hearts are in their throats waiting to see what the results of the federal elections are for just wanted to share.
The board report about my personal experience around the issue of familial violence, which I think is pertinent to our times today on different levels, wanted to mention that my office is going to be partnering with Mount Sinai to host a free flu shot event coming.
Well, there's now going to be a requirement that you have to buckle up in the back seat when you, when you're riding in a cab or an uber, and then I just want to finally mention that we have passed legislation that would amend the administrative code of the city of New York to require all new homeless shelters to conduct a public hearing in the community where the proposed shelter is to be located before it's cited.
That is important because, as we saw with West 36Th Street, the community board, the local elected officials and, most importantly, people who live on the block had no idea that the shelter was being located in this in this area.
I, think I've counted, 21, different agencies, state and city that follow up, whether it's the MTA, the consumer, affairs, the health department, the buildings, department, the Department of homeless, services, etc.
I'm going to ask you hang on one second dale I just wanted to let you know that we have actually gotten a fair number of complaints from Chelsea about the helicopter traffic We've identified a specific operator in Jersey, and one of the letters number 13 is specifically about that situation.
All these years and I'm happy and proud to have been re- elected for another term in the New York State Assembly, representing parts of Hell's kitchen and the upper West side, and there is plenty of work to do the election.
I told you about the park to with Clinton park, getting it fixed, up, we're waiting on parks for that, and I think you have a longer a long calendar You need me and thanks for doing your job, does anyone have any questions for assembly member Rosenthal, Dale, no That was for the anti- car comment.
The office will be closed for veterans day Chelsea, sorry, Clinton, hell's, kitchen, land, use, Just, a friendly verging on non- friendly reminder that all board members need to fill out their virtual vote sheets by the end of the meeting or at the very end of the meeting and submit them.
My report is up next, as you've heard from the members of the Public West We continue to meet with DHS and the providers to try and improve that situation.
For once, the tow pound is moved and there will be a presentation at the Waterfront parks and Environment Committee next week to that effect, to follow up on where you will hear some of the results of what we talked about at that working group, meeting.
There are two letters about the slaughterhouse site, which is on 11Th avenue 39th to 40th street we've heard about this before give a shout out to Joe Rostuccia when he was a young man just getting off the boat from Newark, he saw that piece of land.
When I read this and took a look at item 16 a which is the budget, I began to realize that our community board has a great deal of concern for homelessness, and yet we focus on housing that we say will exist at all levels.
And I'm just throwing out as a comment I'll vote for this, but I think it's time to put the homeless issue together with our stance on what levels, income, bands of housing that we support- Joe for one- has been arguing that it needs to be diverse, but we have a contradiction between our concern for the homeless population in our district and not have it not supporting enough housing that will house that part of the population, the homeless population that does not need supportive housing or any of that.
The issue is that it was proposed to the board not quite clearly by the developer, that the possibility, the support of housing units might be segregated on different floors in the building.
My question is, though, I know you answered Betty's inquiry about the homeless population and the services, but as far as the affordable part, how affordable is it going to be low, income, meaning at what type of income are we talking about so hector?
One, good job, Joe keep going with it good job, Joe Restudya has those cow heads and we're hoping that they will be placed in that little park area that we want designed and Betty had a great suggestion, maybe some kind of historic plaque or explanation of what existed.
It does not solve the problems with bicycles that are delivering food, but CitiBike is a huge program and if there were large numbers like four digits, for example, I'm, just throwing it out there The first letter- If, that's this, I mean I recognize both your concerns, but the first letter is specifically addressing their expansion for three sites within the district.
I'm aware that I mean, I think I think we could add something along those lines so that the within the education component that individual equipment is clearly identifiable in the case of any misuse, If I heard you right, given that sidewalk site is no longer in our district.
We are aware that there are sidewalk sites in other districts, and you know hope that as policy they will start not doing that.
Somebody had mentioned that they do, but I do not think there's any real enforcement, because there are folks riding on sidewalks illicitly I mean sometimes they're, not working at all or basically.
That block is most of the week, so in the reassert insertion of a letter about no our policy of no sidewalk installations, I think you need to be more careful.
There is a letter on the 36Th Street, Shelter, Joe and or Maria.
This is our monthly 36th street letter It's basically a pretty much a repeat of our letter to DHS and the mayor's office and NYPD, and now this is directed instead toward the elected officials to meet with us to discuss this specifically come up with a plan to solve a problem.
That's a crazy thing and that's why we're asking All right, excellent letter, Joe. We, insist that Dick Godfrey Brad Holloman Corey Johnson Dale Brewer sit down with the board as soon as possible, or something like that, just to make it specific and more well.
The testimony tonight was very poignant, and I wonder if I mean at a minimum, we should be clearly there are some individuals which are more dangerous than others, right, and I think we need our elected and the NYPD to address that the people which are really dangerous should be removed.
You know it's one thing to put homeless people in one place: I do not want to say we have a gang, but it looks like we have a gang.
We had similar language than the prior letter that I took out, so we can put it back in We, got a lot of clarifications from folks on 36th street things that were not quite right, so we're fixing that also lol.
You know the ask about de, densifying, and I think that there was a point that we made in the last letter.
And I think you need to put the community board vote information somewhere up there up front.
I have heard I've heard I have heard going to every housing meeting Maybe it's not the official community Board, but some kind of either protest.
The health Kitchen Neighbor coalition, which is made up of the block associations, different not, for, profit organizations, the garment center alliance, Manhattan Plaza, tenant association, Hudson yards a whole group of people together to basically bring publicity to this, because we really believe that it's not understood that we're, not the folks on the upper West, side.
The tone of this letter, which is one of these hotels, must be moved and that you know we are asking you to help us get DHS to move.
I think we need to be addressing to Cuomo's Covid-19 task force, or whoever is ahead of that area, to highlight that this is also a health issue for everyone, involved, the residents in the shelters and the residents on the street, and they that may give us another angle for a little bit of firepower for the governor to take notice of something that will be pushing against the great progress that he has made in stemming the tide of the virus.
So dolores I'm, going to suggest that we do that at our next housing community meeting And you're going to do the research to find out who we write, to, because I think it's important that we keep this letter focused and get the next issue, because basically we have to keep this on.
Think we know where this letter is going, That's for housing, health and human services.
The budget task force worked with all of the chairs of and all of the committees to come up with a plan for how to think about the priorities recognizing that we have long- So I really want to give a lot of credit to all of the committees who dug in and did the hard work of saying, Term needs, but things that we're seeing that we had not seen before and so really impressed at how quickly people have moved to understand the needs of the community and what they're, seeing to help aid.
And and they've also heard from Gail Brewer's office that it would be really useful to try and get support from lots of community boards, because central park is a place that everybody should feel welcome and and that this is an important issue.
Looking for letters of support from lots of different community boards, just a correction, they already have, I think.
And, that's what our task force is about, and That's why I was very supportive of writing this letter and thank you very much to Dale for working on this.
15 is the letter about the 36Th street shelter from HHHS 16 is the budget requests and statement of district needs and 17 is the letter from the social and racial justice Task Force, Mike and Leslie?
I know it's going to be an affordable housing site, And, we'll say: we'll save an apartment for you, Okay and at Nightclub on the first floor, great good, to see you good night, everybody anything else, we're adjourned.
