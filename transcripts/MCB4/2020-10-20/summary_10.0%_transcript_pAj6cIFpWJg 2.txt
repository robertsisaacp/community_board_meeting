I look back at what people said at our last meeting when we talked a little bit about the budget.
You, know the Chelsea NYCHA working group so much and wanted to make sure that we were advocating- It can be, it's usually all capital.
What we're doing now is the very early stages of what are the budget priorities from our community district right, And we're taking a perspective from the land, Use committee.
Are there things within the city budget that we think need to be beefed up, whether it's a ongoing expense or a capital expense?
The capital expenses are not necessarily from land use, but they would probably come more from housing, but if we can, you know help get our thought train running with ideas of what we want for land use.
If the NYCHA working group has any land use prospective items that are coming out, that maybe housing will address something on the budget priority from the Nitro working group, but we as Lane juice, perspective.
I do know from the conversations of the working group that the heating system and hector and elzora you can correct me that the heating system would need to be replaced at my house in which building we're talking about all of Fulton and all of them.
Many of them are but elevator maintenance, people and, It's also an expense item, because there are like right.
That's, interesting Jesse, because I've been thinking about it today and talking to Paul that I think a number of the things that I looked at them again and for the third time, like things about zoning and code enforcement and all that kind of stuff.
I personally think that, at this point in the city's economic situation, that those things do not feel to me to be high priority, those ones that we've had on our lists- You know for a long time and that we may want to try to generate some new recommendations.
I, send you an email, but that you had been talking at the last meeting about retrofitting or converting buildings that are underused or empty into other land uses, which I thought I thought is very relevant at this point: Or it could be relevant and that we could request funding for certain studies along those lines, and you think that maybe architecture schools are looking at that already.
Our graduate schools are looking at that, actually, even before Kovic struck for a variety of reasons, so New York City is known to have pretty high what you call it vacancy rate, irrespective of what happened with the pandemic, but because the pandemic, I think the vacancy rate in housing apartments is 13.3 now And, that's the data that actually is generally collected by HPD and real estate.
You might have read about industry city proposals being pulled back, meaning they withdrew that because it was not going to be approved, there was a big community push back and in the process.
We want to make a recommendation for some kind of funding, which would be an expense item for some kind of study, along the lines of what we're talking, about, and so you know, could be DCP EDC, DHS HPD, some collaborative effort, because it seems there's Just a group of people.
We could request that kind of a study through HPD because they are actually the keepers of you know how the vacancy, and because that affects their sort of what do you call it their mandate in terms of Trans, stabilization and land control issues EDC would come into play when we talk about industry, city or some other large.
Taking the side with space and maybe taking some street space, just thought: Brad, that's coming up with transportation community, which I'm sort of part of Yet is that city also should gain something from it.
So now I mean there are a lot of good ideas on the table and it does not matter which committee does it, but As a community board, I think a kind of clear agenda as to how we want the street space reshaped, moving forward.
The important thing for us is the difference between vacancy and emptiness Yeah, because vacancy reports are not going to address the land use issues that we're trying to tackle.
I mean we have to always talk about money, because it's a budget so funding to support sidewalk cafes and that's as far as I could get, It seemed that I do not know whether we have a consensus about asking for money for studies.
I have one tiny item to bring up having to do with open streets, which is budgeting for the expenses that are presently being born by individuals and the block associations to maintain the barriers replace them when they get wrecked and purchase the signage that's needed to mount on those barriers.
I know that when I was on that committee, we talked about that a lot I think that's a transportation issue.
To me, that's still a land use issue And you know, I'm conflicted with the notion of putting forward these priorities and also having budget constraints and being realistic.
I have been talked to by a number of people that when we talk about budget priorities, last meeting, I said, let's just wipe them all out, and I- was told that if we do not keep our priorities in place from previous years, they won't be right.
So to keep our are the other things that were in the budget request from last year, such as code enforcement, issues, building, department, building issues, land use on neighborhood needs things like that.
Just one idea, because you're not going to get it on a townhouse renovation, you're, going to get it out of something like Hudson yards I do not know which budget I understand, how what how we can describe it but Sustainability guidelines and how they actually get woven into city's approval.
I think you're raising a very valid point, a very valid concern, and maybe what we do is try to tackle it at one of our meetings and come up with a letter to the appropriate agencies to change policy right, directly.
Let's try to like hone in a little bit here on our capital and expense, line, add- ups for fiscal year 2022 and what we can get accomplished as okay, We should have an agenda item at a meeting to talk about how we can tackle sustainability in the city and figure out ways to do.
We have to recognize that whatever you, I think you guys are discussing right, now, the top priorities to the one two, three, the things that you want to send to the budget task force to say this is the most important last year's priorities are still important, but we recognize that those are all going to sort of be shifted down.
I mean, I think it's a more logical way of getting the funding, for that Is to put it in with the small business appeal, because a lot of these, As long as you and Paul work on the together afterwards and submit something to the budget task force that it clarifies those What agency, you're expecting the request to go to and if it's a, whether it's capital or expense?
I think you do not necessarily committees have tried very hard not to sort of like go into the scope of another committee in terms of recommendations, but that does not mean you guys can't, or the co- chairs of this committee, or maybe through Bert at the budget task force say that they, we recognize.
It does have to come through housing and us and whatnot Is that things like the roofs and the boilers and the and the elevators?
I am not from defending NYCHA all here at this point, but that's their big ticket items you're all right about it Because if we say the boilers and the roofs and the elevators, their response is going to say, We're working on it right, and That one of the reasons why we historically have gone to the tenant associations is Because.
You know we do not have people monitoring the number of breakdowns and that sort of thing how long it takes to fix an elevator.
I would I just leave it at that, and let people know that really is an issue Just the elevators, then, is that: Can we have a quick show of hands on that?
