What, they're, really talking about, is trying to prevent if a car or a vehicle skids on an icy snowy street in February, trying to prevent the skidding vehicle from going into an outdoor dining when it's 25 degrees outside, but they have their propane heaters on from, So again, This adds the department of sanitation into the regulatory pot, in addition to the department of transportation.
Can somebody walking down the street, and you know saying: Oh look at that and then calling up 311 or D-O-T and reporting.
I, Don't think it's as differentiated as you say, Joe. There are other issues like Marty right now in neighborhood on the diner on 24th, 23rd and ninth, which has a permanent, enclosed sidewalk.
Cafe they have built onto it, taking more sidewalk space, a temporary space for like I, think they have three tables in there.
Yeah I think that dilutes the focus of our letter, which is just on these temporary structure, so-called temporary structures, real replacement, everybody look at the chat.
Whatever pre, whatever agency approval, they'll, be needing to do this with you know, within 30 days, pretty much to get it done in December, We quickly put together a briefing for the Trans Co-chairs, Christine and Dale, and then the ACES co-chairs, Allen and Kitt, and it was decided at that meeting that we thought you know.
I would certainly be willing to push it back to January or February, which also will be months where there's not a lot going on, But we need the traffic if anyone has any ideas or input or anything, I'm open to it and willing to do whatever it takes to get this done.
A long time operating was a boon to a lot of the block associations because they could have their little booths and raise some money to distribute to the children of the neighborhood or whatever I wonder if it would be helpful for you to go to the get support from the block associations that might help your cause.
It's, specifically to drive traffic and interest through the area, we're thinking of it as a locavore event to really get people from the West Village from the east, village, from Brooklyn from other parts of the city to come, walk through and support us in the neighborhood.
So, there's just no, maybe Jeffrey knows a little bit more, but to my understanding they will only permit one lock as a decision, one block at a time: okay, yeah gotcha, placing for many years.
You know, that's why we see the same multi-block multi-day events every year and not anything new and you.
And also I want I, recognize the distinction you're making about you know about raising funds, but.
To Jd's point, Do you think there is a role for the adjoining block associations in this event, I mean so they would be certainly welcome to set up within those footprints and they would get a vendor assignment, but basically right now it's about driving traffic to the area and anything that gets in the way of having it be an art event and having people come and walk and eat at our restaurants and buy a carted, domus or delphinium, or you know, stop in and get some pastries from Poseidon.
I, Don't know that it's something that they would necessarily at this time of year want to participate.
That, it's pushed to January, You may be able to leverage a little excitement in the air around the inauguration, since it seems like we're actually going to have an inauguration in January.
Martin Luther King Jr three-day weekend when people are off from school, It's right around the time of the inauguration, I'm open to anything in a pre-meeting.
Covid-19 and I'm wondering if you've been working with them at all too absolutely Phil has been an amazing ally to the Ninth Avenue Association in the neighborhood, but he's also a personal friend.
Public housing by law can not have a mortgage on the buildings, So that means it relies solely on refinancing that comes from the federal state or city governments, None of which have ever supported public housing to renovate it to today's standards, let alone the standard of the 1990s, 80s, 70s or 60s.
Specifically, though, Everyone did not like the way that the city of New York did this rad conversion.
They co-chair this committee with a bunch of NYCHA tenants and all the concerns about specific things like pets and succession and what happens on apartment.
Specifically, the city of New, York and NYCHA will retain ownership of the buildings and the land they will be leased to a private development team and that private development team will consist not only of a for-profit developer but at the requirement of the working group, a not-for-profit developer together in partnership.
Every development will be involved in the development phase in the construction phase, and they will have input into the management phase, Also and again, Those requirements embody in the documents that govern the actual deal, The largest amount of money comes to the sorry step.
The city of the NYCHA came up with a capital needs assessment for Elliot Chelsea and Fulton totaling, 344 million dollars that would encompass new bathrooms, new kitchens, new plumbing, wiring and site work and masonry work and new windows.
The tenants were out of their minds and we negotiated with NYCHA and put another 22 million dollars in the capital needs to have new heating, systems, and specifically, today, The buildings run off connect steam from the street, and if you have a break in the main in one location, four or five buildings go down at the same time, With hundreds of apartments out of heat.
Out, was infill, meaning building new buildings on parking lots throughout the NYCHA Campuses Nycha's original proposal was demolish the low-rise buildings and Fulton on 9th Avenue and build 35-story or 40-story 80 20s.
Lots are two-story structures for community facilities, doctor's offices, day care things like that or commercial space, and then along ninth Avenue in Fulton.
All right, Joe, I'm gonna interrupt you here for a second, because the point I wanted to raise.
We had a fourth member of the community board who was on this working Group Alzora Cleveland was sitting on the group and she sent me a letter resigning from working on the working group, because she was still opposed to Rad and did not like the direction this was going.
There were other issues why she wanted to step down scheduling, issues and whatnot, but she specifically said I do not and can not support any efforts allowing Rad to manage any NYCHA projects given their history of poor, management, unjustified evictions and rent escalations.
I, don't know if you've seen it Joe, but it looks good all right.
Yeah I think it's kind of a miraculous process, because there must be about 90 people who are on our emails, who are reviewing documents.
I, guess sponsored by Community board 4 on December, 17th, Lo. Was that still a date or Jesse still a date, happening, I'm going to ask John.
They going to in their new space, consolidate all of their operations, because I know they have multiple sites, or are they going to keep satellite spaces in different like one in Lhlc one Fulton.
And, then the final thing is on the Chills restaurant housing fund, where you said there's about 730,000 left, is that the same fund as the Highline transfer rights that we just renegotiated those Tdr prices and isn't there more money that could be coming into that.
The, west Chelsea, affordable housing fund is priced at a different price than the development rights.
118 10th avenue, that's the old Chelsea park restaurant and that is currently on hold that was scheduled to produce around 8 million dollars at the city's request.
We are just now, probably tomorrow, removing that from the plan and replacing with something else, because there's a question of whether or not that will happen in timing to meet the start of this work.
So yes, One thing on the heating system: Joe just to enlarge on that the savings in energy, okay, I, don't know how they allow this to go on so far, but just moving that steam from one place to another.
I just want to say one more thing, Joe Betty Mike that it may be a little too early, but the world should know about this.
January's going to be a big month in this country and in this city, all right, Christine I, think Jeff had his hand up way earlier than mine, I'm going in the order.
You know attention over the past year or two that the many affordable housing developments that we fight like tooth and nail to maintain their character and integrity of today never would be built in the tenor and landscape in which we operate.
So, when I hear that, there's going to be one in two stories built on some of this infill for commercial purposes, I see it as totally waste of potential look at the buildings on eighth avenue between 23rd and 24th streets, one in two stories on each side of Eighth Avenue, one as owned by Penn South, one across on the east side of the avenue, completely underbuilt.
Those were for commercial purposes, Joe right, yes, can I on side streets and on Avenue can I help you first.
We had variety of concerns, I'm wondering if those folks were among the tenants who were on these working groups involved in this compromise or if they are now going to be engaged in where things landed.
She is an integral part of the working group of the capital, finance, subcommittee, knowledge, capital, finance subcommittee and some other committees so, and she and some of her buddies are very involved and they some number of these tenants, are going to be have speaking parts on the engagement, meetings, so.
And I should mention that there is a small group who is still protesting and still saying that, whatever it is, The Chelsea working group has come up, with, And I, don't think they even have understood what we're doing are protesting.
I mean we should note that there has been many attempts during the working group meeting was meeting in person to disrupt the meetings to come in to film the meetings to live, stream, the meetings and myself and other tenants, Attendant association members have gone and actually asked those people to leave.
Okay, just to the point about the heights, I do think there is something beyond the argument about like public safety and tall housing.
So I want to thank you all for that very much Joe. We've got to figure out how we're going to present this to you through your committee, through the Chelsea land, use, Committee Betty, and this forum you want Jesse to put together in two weeks.
Sake, So, December, committees, everybody's meeting at the regular time, To my knowledge at this point, so, Obviously, Joe and Betty will have to talk and Mike will have to talk about the 17th, because that's actually your committee Joe. I, just want to let you know Jessica had to jump off, unfortunately.
Some good work, Some good data to use to maybe give you guys a little additional information is what to be bringing back to your committees for discussions and possible future agenda.
I know everybody does a lot of work.
We would like you guys to give out in terms of directions and why we're doing this in a virtual way, and it just gives new people that are coming to the committee from the public, maybe even new board members who just an understanding of what the process is.
So I, just remind people that when you start your committees process at the beginning to go through those initial steps, you know.
And I, know it's easy to forget and just roll right into the work.
I think that's really helpful, because I received a lot of emails and calls about the process of how our meetings function and the proc.
That's what I wanted to share all right on the committee agenda for next month.
We have invited the NYPD to present to the Clinton health kitchen land Use committee on two sites that they have said would work for the towpound, so they're going to be hopefully coming in and presenting on that to anyone who's interested in that issue, hopefully to the Clinton hell's kitchen land.
Yes, Could you send me the requirements for so I can look and talk to Hartley House about it, because those are probably very physical and they're going to come to us anyway about it.
I mean I, don't think we're really going to get more than one I.
Good, Flag Jesse, So we want to add in a paragraph or a short section, asking the DOE to extend the deadline, just because it's not a lot of time for a community based organization to submit an application for a space.
All right, I have a request for new business, one quick thing from Leslie, so I'm going to give her the floor for a minute, I guess for BLP.
Actually a little bit, surprised, I, think that our community board should address this a little more vigorously about the how all of a sudden the mayor has said.
Anything I know, CB2 had a great letter that came out this week concerned about land use issues concerned about sidewalk issues.
I want to raise the point that last month we sent a letter that Bert wrote which was really addressing that issue, and so we just need to see whether how much more we need to say yeah, all right.
And I think we need to put them on the agenda of land, use.
If people are interested, it's a very thorough administrative letter, and if anybody has questions, I'm always happy to talk all right.
