Just now, I forgot we're doing this, but that's a pretty elaborate show there too I mean it's something: there's only 40 something people on it right now. So if somebody wants to get on later, you know later dates. I mean it's fun. You know it's fun, I'd be careful on a bus tale. You know, yeah I would think twice. Please yeah exactly I mean I've been to Georgia before now, yeah Michael Schwerner was my neighbor in the 1960s. If you remember that name or not. Well, I'm sticking to postcard writing myself and a handful of my church buddies. Oh really, we're writing cards to Georgia, sorry to interrupt, but do you have quorum? You're, recording and you're live streaming and your first agenda item as presenter is here. Well then, let's get started everyone to the November exec meeting item number one on the agenda relates to outdoor dining structures. I had actually asked Bert and Frank to do this. I don't know if many of you have noticed, but some of the outdoor dining structures that have been built kind of defeat, the purpose of outdoor dining for walls and a door. So I asked Bert and Frank to take this, and I will turn this over to them to address their letter. Thank you, gentlemen. Just for confusion, just in case anyone's confused, we had lol. Do you want to do this letter? First, we had the first item to be the Ninth Avenue Association to present all right and I'm looking at an old version of the agenda and I with the letter and get that apologize letter will be short and then we can go to the Ninth Avenue Association. That's fine! Okay! The letter is right to the point. It says there are health issues involved. There are issues about definition. You know it's all self-reporting, there's very little inspection, very little supervision. You know at a certain point, an outdoor structure becomes an indoor structure, but there's no one going around and actually looking at every single one and saying you're, not you're an indoor you're, an outdoor indoor, you're. Now an indoor you only could have 25% capacity, not the way it was before and in addition, because we're coming up to the winter. Just last week, the D.O.T involving also department of sanitation in terms of enforcement, there's going to be certain winterization provisions that these outdoor dining facilities will have to build it's hard for me to imagine, but they talk about water encased water around the edges sand. What they're really talking about is trying to prevent if a car or a vehicle skids on an icy snowy street in February, trying to prevent the skidding vehicle from going into an outdoor dining when it's 25 degrees outside, but they have their propane heaters on from. You know demolishing it and maybe demolishing some diners. So again, this adds the department of sanitation into the regulatory pot in addition to the department of transportation. So this lettuce saying is whoa, wait a minute one. We really want regularized scheduled enforcement. We don't want to be catches, catch. Can somebody walking down the street, and you know saying: oh look at that and then calling up 311 or D-O-T and reporting. We want them to be active and out there. So there are regulatory issues, but the reason we're calling for really people being out there to look at this stuff is because there are health issues involved. That's the bottom line. There are health issues involved, so it's a really straightforward letter and I urge you all to vote for it. Does anyone have any questions about the letter? Marty go ahead. I have two comments. I think this is an opportunity to be clear that these outdoor restaurants are time limited when Covid-19 is over. They should be over and second there's a pizza place on 23rd street, just west of Eighth Avenue that has just built on and it's not leaving any eight feet of sidewalk. That is the other issue is pedestrian safety that one just narrowed the sidewalk too much so I was wondering if remarks like those two could be included. Well, I'm going to address the first one, because the mayor has said that this is not just for Covid-19 anymore. This is permanent forever and ever then, our board should have a position that, after Covid-19, the use of city property gets a rent, I. Think in our letter endorsing all year round, dining I may be wrong or I'm not remembering correctly, but I. Think in our letter we did say that some point down the line. We should look at the examination of the use of public space for private activities and some kind of rental fee and I presume the enforcement remarks would include, leaving enough space for pedestrians to get by I. Think the pizza on 23rd street violates that very clearly there's a tree pit in front of it is only about four or five feet space. These are in the street Marty this one's on the sidewalk right. This addresses things in the streets, the street. That's why they're talking about protection from skidding cars in the winter so I understand that, but a lot of them are being built on sidewalks as well. So this is not an undifferent I, don't think it's as differentiated as you say, Joe. There are other issues like Marty right now in neighborhood on the diner on 24th, 23rd and ninth, which has a permanent, enclosed sidewalk cafe they have built onto it, taking more sidewalk space, a temporary space for like I, think they have three tables in there. Okay, so can we add something to the letter Bert that says that not only the structures but the placement of the structures should be looked into. That'll address Marty's concern we can put in a line or two because with a norm, whatever normal used to be sidewalk cafe, you had to have at least that eight foot right- okay, not including sidewall, fix Right Betty. You had a question as well yeah, I'm so glad that you wrote this letter because I have been bothered by the enclosed outdoor spaces and I was wondering if, like you, need to get certain certification for getting a cafe, could we not have something that these places apply and then they are conforming to the right, correct dimensions and open and openings, because the one that you were just talking about on ninth Avenue and twenty third I believe it's completely conclu enclosed. There's not a window, you know anyway, I that concept, I really think all right. One of the stated goals of this whole program was for it to be simple for the operators. So the city made clear. It was supposed to be a lot simpler than the sidewalk cafe process and it was supposed to be self-certifying and, in fact, there's now a movement to foot to go the other direction and simplify the sidewalk cafe, process and make it self-certifying and not require people seeking semi-cafes to hire architects and all that stuff. So we could say something, but the trend and the pressure is in the other direction. Yeah I think that dilutes the focus of our letter, which is just on these temporary structure, so-called temporary structures, real replacement, everybody look at the chat. Just did Joe, that's almost a concession: that's what we'll get there will not be a concession that is who cares we're starting all right, Kim, that's beyond the purview of this community board, but not for our mental health. It isn't. Oh I, understand that, but I'm trying to keep this meeting moving so we're gonna Betty. In response to that, to what Frank said, I don't think that belongs in our letter. That may be a second letter, but this letter should just be focused on those structures with Barty's one change. Anyone else have any comments on this all right. All those in favor of or do I need. A motion on this Jesse I need a formal motion. Jeffrey help me out here move to adopt letter as amended. Thank you Paul. All those in favor raise your hand, please hi, Jessica and Mike. That was you the two eyes. Yes all right, so it's enormous! Thank you very much, I'm just for clarity's sake. This letter is going to regular the normal full board process. Are we asking to send this out before I think we think we're sending it now? Okay, Burton Frank! If you can send me a finalized version, if there's any edits after tonight, yeah I'll try to get that something about the sidewalk in there all right, thanks, Marty, obviously, there's a location that you want us to follow up with D.O.T about. Please send me the location all right now, I jumped the order. Since I was looking at an old copy of the agenda, we do have a presentation can I step back a second. You know Polly Trottenberg, she resigned effective Monday, so I gotta readdress the letter to whoever all right all right. So we have a presentation. This is the Covid-19 substitute for the Ninth Avenue International Food Festival Jesse. Would you introduce our guest sure so I don't know I, don't think retrogrades would describe it as such, but so we were contacted. The board office was contacted by the Manhattan borough president's office and Mr Rodriguez from the Ninth Avenue Association. Regarding an event. They are looking to do in middle or late December. At this point you know we all know them from the Ninth Avenue International Food Festival, that happens every year. Obviously it did not happen this year. You know with we don't know, what's gonna happen next year, but this is a a separate event. This is a different event so because of the timing, they're looking to get a city approval, whatever pre, whatever agency approval, they'll be needing to do this with you know within 30 days, pretty much to get it done in December. We quickly put together a briefing for the Trans Co-chairs, Christine and Dale, and then the ACES co-chairs, Allen and Kitt, and it was decided at that meeting that we thought you know. This is a large enough project, a large enough proposal that it needed at least some level of public review before the board was going to make any recommendations or anything like that. I mean for the board to make any recommendations or not before. So that's what it is and I'll hand it over to Rick Rodriguez to from the Ninth Avenue Association to describe the project. I sent everybody a few hours ago. I know it's short notice, but I did send everybody information. This is. It is in the dropbox link that I sent you guys. It's got its own folder, so you'll see some promotional material. There you'll see a description of the event, but I'll let Rick handle it. Thank you, Jesse I, want to open by saying thank you all for giving me this opportunity. As you know, we're in unprecedented times I've lived in this neighborhood for 31 years, and I've done the creative and the content of the non-food vendors for the Ninth Avenue Food Festival for the last 14 years. It's beyond me that we're in the situation I walk home every evening, and it feels like I'm watching friends and neighbors and businesses that I've known for decades dying on the vine, I'm really looking for support. Ultimately, I've been through SAPO and have gotten absolutely no energy. Fortunately, the subcommittees have suggested working through the DOT I, don't know if anyone had time to go over the literature, but if you'll indulge me I'll read it pretty quickly. Basically, we're interested in unifying Hudson yards and hell's kitchen in an art walk. The artwork would be over two days. It would begin at 10 a.m and end at 5 p.m. And what we'd like to do is have artists visual artists set up from 34th street to 57th street along 9th avenue on both sides of the street. No more than five vendors per block and they would set up opposite the empty and vacant stores. They would have a footprint of four and a half feet deep by 10 feet wide and they would display, sell actually produce art on the spot, and the goal would be to drive traffic to the area. We are nowhere near the foot traffic that we used to have I would say that we're not even at 25 on the average weekend. The goal is to leverage the relationships we have with both social media, traditional media print, broedcast. Anything else that goes. We've got tedding signed on to give us a hand in boosting our signal, Nicole very graciously offered to help us from the Hudson yards bid. So she would be on in on this as well, and ultimately, we'd like to link the two parks, the Bella Abzug Park, to Balsley park, which is at the top of 57th street. That is really pretty much it. I've reached out to a number of arts organizations and artists who are at the ready to do this and participate. The big issue is before any money can be spent. Anything can be done. We need an okay from the city. Ultimately, I'd love to see this happen in December, but given the time frame and the amount of time that it's taking it's looking like the 19th and the 20th I would certainly be willing to push it back to January or February, which also will be months where there's not a lot going on, but we need the traffic if anyone has any ideas or input or anything, I'm open to it and willing to do whatever it takes to get this done. Questions Jd go ahead. Sure the thank you for the presentation, the Ninth Avenue Street Festival a long time operating was a boon to a lot of the block associations because they could have their little booths and raise some money to distribute to the children of the neighborhood or whatever I wonder if it would be helpful for you to go to the get support from the block associations that might help your cause and if there was any any money that's raised. Where does that go so this would not be so this so to roll back. So the Ninth Avenue International Food Festival, the oldest largest continuing food festival in New, York City, is a charity. It's a 501c3 charity, I believe and all of our proceeds go to charities, the block associations on the local charities, the food pantries and the bottomless closets. However, this would not be that event. This would not be replacing that this would literally be on the sidewalks. We may charge a nominal 20 or 25 to cover the costs of promotions, printing up decals, paying sanitation to do a sweep. It's in the rough outline that I sent it would not be a money making event or a money generating event. It's specifically to drive traffic and interest through the area, we're thinking of it as a locavore event to really get people from the West Village from the east village, from Brooklyn from other parts of the city to come, walk through and support us in the neighborhood. Thank you, Joe go ahead. Yeah I reviewed your things very quickly, as we got from tonight. Could I just ask that in your literature you actually start out with Hell's kitchen Hudson yards as opposed to Hudson yards held kitchen, because that's what our neighborhood is? You know Hudson New York is a thing that just happened yesterday and okay. Well, if I may respond to that so Nicole who I believe is on the auto version of this call, has spoken to her team. They will be underwriting this so I understand what you're saying and if that is necessary. I will certainly I'm all for it, but ultimately they will be underwriting and they will be writing the check. I'm a member of the board of that bid and I'll make that recommendation to them directly. No problem, then no problem second thing is: what's very confusing. Is you call it bella absolute park to Balsley park along 9th Avenue, but of course Bella Abzug is on between 10th and 11th, so I think you have to clear that up in the presentation. Otherwise it somehow sounds. I know what your intent is, but it sounds kind of odd understood that can be done. Go ahead Leslie. Why are we limiting it limit to the sidewalks? Can't we I mean can't we think a little bigger just for these few days and get the permit for the street to close the street, so people can walk a little more freely and the booths might be a little more accessible, can't close the streets in the in December because of the Midtown moratorium for street closure. No, that's not an effect! This year, no yeah! It's there's no moratoriums this year, oh cause it's good, because there's no Christmas got it yeah! Well right, but there's not Joe. Well, there is Christmas this year, not the busy one Joe, the Grinch rustuccia Christmas this year now so Leslie. To answer your question on that. Is that there it? But there is a moratorium through SAPO on any new or different multi-block multi-day events. So there's just no, maybe Jeffrey knows a little bit more, but to my understanding they will only permit one lock as a decision, one block at a time: okay, yeah gotcha, placing for many years. So you know that's why we see the same multi-block multi-day events every year and not anything new and you it restricts these applicants to they can't really change anything about their application until the moratorium ends. So that's why Christine? Thank you. Jesse yeah I think it's a fantastic idea. It's really very good. I would simply change the depths from four and a half foot to four foot so that it's aligned with the most of the street, the tripits and, in addition to the exhibits you're going to have people stopping by, but generally I'm very much in favor of that understand. That won't be a problem. Actually I spoke to one of the top vendors for the artist screens to be that most artists use and they actually only come out three feet so I, don't think changing it to four feet will be a problem. Perfect, dale I think it's a great idea to activate you know Ninth Avenue and get more business there. All right! Thank you. Christine Dale, yeah I was also generally supportive. I wanted to see a some kind of plan or just a you know, rough plan to help conceptualize it and I know we. It was short notice, but it would be nice to see that and also I want I recognize the distinction you're making about you know about raising funds, but to Jd's point, do you think there is a role for the adjoining block associations in this event, I mean so they would be certainly welcome to set up within those footprints and they would get a vendor assignment, but basically right now it's about driving traffic to the area and anything that gets in the way of having it be an art event and having people come and walk and eat at our restaurants and buy a carted, domus or delphinium, or you know, stop in and get some pastries from Poseidon. Anything that gets in the way of that I think can muddy the water. They are certainly welcome to take a table. We give them away, we donate to them on a regular basis. I, don't know that it's something that they would necessarily at this time of year want to participate. In of course, I can't speak for them, but I don't see the necessary upside for them at this time of year and I guess. The other point is I. Think would be great if it happened before Christmas. If it there's whatever such making winds up that it's pushed to January, you may be able to leverage a little excitement in the air around the inauguration, since it seems like we're actually going to have an inauguration in January. That's a great idea, so it could technically also happen over that Martin Luther King Jr three-day weekend when people are off from school, it's right around the time of the inauguration, I'm open to anything in a pre-meeting. Someone brought up the fact that the board may have access to West 39th Street, where the old hell's kitchen flea market once stood. It's not exactly a footprint, that's helpful, but if necessary, I'd circle, the wagons and figure out a way to make something happen there and maybe create a treasure hunt or something that would bring life to the 42nd to 57th corridor, all right any other hands. Devlin I think two points. One was on the timing. First of all, I support. This idea on the timing. I do think doing it before Christmas might be a good idea to promote, because none of us will be able to travel at Christmas is my suspicion. So let's ship gifts home to our family members and have it be Hell's kitchen gifts to our family members, so I would strongly recommend that we get it done as quickly as possible and then the second point you just talked about the local businesses like Poseidon Bakery. Would they be able to have booth space so that they're out on the sidewalk, as people walk by someone could consume pastries or buy cards or any of the local businesses beyond the artist community? So that would absolutely be available to them the issue there is, as you know, the city has allowed stores to set up out front. They have less than five percent participation, because the idea is that if you're a merchant you've merchandised you've done your shop I, don't know how many of you walk- ninth Avenue after dark or really afternoon. It is when people call me from out of state and ask me: what's it like I tell them that it's like Gotham city before Batman I, see the catwoman I, see the joker I, see the riddler every day and I can't imagine any of my merchants that are holding on by a thread dragging their stuff out to the curb. The goal is to really get people to go into their stores familiarize themselves with it. We're working on a map in terms of supporting the small business, we're a designated neighborhood for small business, Saturday and I'll be distributing the all of the swag that goes with it with American Express they've also agreed to give us a certain amount. I don't have a total on that, but a certain amount of sidewalk decals for social distancing, but they are certainly supporting us as a neighborhood in an extraordinary way. I believe it's for every fifty dollars spent they get ten dollars in American Express rewards when they use their American Express cards in any of our merchants on small business Saturday. And then we follow over to restaurants Saturday the next week and the same deal applies there and I also have received swag that our restaurants will also be giving out and posting at that time. As a matter of fact, we just unpacked and we've got tons of swag and stuff to give out and as a follow-up I know that 42nd Street magazine had done a lot of promotion on the businesses that were open during Covid-19 and I'm wondering if you've been working with them at all too absolutely Phil has been an amazing ally to the Ninth Avenue Association in the neighborhood, but he's also a personal friend. I also believe he's listening in on this call as well and he's totally on board, for whatever we need. Phil is listening in all right, any other questions Alan great Project. Hopefully we can bring something like this down to Chelsea, starting from the meat market working north. So if Sappo is added a picture, so it seems how quickly and how do we get this through D.O.T? If it's D-O-T, it's got to be it. We've got to send the letter to DOT. We'll try to you know, push it with D.O.T in an informal way so that it's really adopted asap I doubt that I don't know what is their process for that kind of request, which is absolutely not standard, so we're going to have to find out all right, then I'm going to make a suggestion that we authorize Christine to engage with and if they require a letter we authorize a letter supporting this program. Does that make sense to everyone yeah we're going to need the letter first right, yeah do the letter first, all right, yeah, okay, so Christine, are you going to write this? No I thought we had somebody else going to do this? No I'm nominating you I can do that. Yes, fine I'll help you Christine I'll help you do. Please join us in doing that. Absolutely I will email with my phone number yeah, we'll get it off the chat put that in the chat. Okay, so do I have a motion for a letter and a follow-up phone call if necessary go move. Second, all those in favor Mike, hi Jessica. Did you vote? Yes, yeah? Okay, thank you all right! That's unanimous! Thank you again. Thank you, Rick. Thank you all very much. If we can not get this in December, I'm willing to circle back and make a January or February whenever we can get it, I will sign off. If you don't have any more questions and I'll add my phone number to the chat. Thank you so much for coming Rick all right. Thank you for being there. Thank you for listening, okay Jesse. Since I'm looking at the old agenda, old version of the agenda is NYCHA up next. Yes, you want me so all right, okay, here now, all right, so the NYCHA working group has been reconvened and has been meeting regularly and we're going to get an update from Joe, Betty and Mike about the working group, and then I've got an issue to raise go ahead. Yeah, so I just want to note that the working groups in the best spot it's been since we began. There- was a consensus reached two weeks ago on a Friday regarding the final elements of the revised financing plan for the whole El. For the whole Chelsea NYCHA plan and the elected officials, the tenant associations and NYCHA in the mayor's office all came to conclusion on what to do so. We have, we no longer have any internal disputes. This doesn't mean our process is over now, I'll, explain the components of the plan in a moment, but the process now is a major outreach for tenant engagement happening on a series of meetings in the next in the month of December and those are Zoom meetings. There's some tabling happening, there's flyers, there's a faq and there will be session extra session with a presentation by all of the various subcommittees involved in this process. So we are expecting to get to a final report either the end of the year or the first week or the first couple weeks of January every time we think we're settled, Covid-19 intervenes and we keep pushing this out and, of course doing tenant outreach is very difficult when it's only electronic I'll give you the details in a moment but see Christine has a question. No, I'm asking I was asking the overall shape of the of what you're proposing oh yeah. I'm gonna do that next time where we are in the process. That was the thing, so the things I have to announce which are very good, is that we have achieved entire consensus. There will be no demolition whatsoever as part of any of the plans and that's a major thing and that we own we settled out pretty much in March but then Covid-19 hit it took a while to come back to it. The second thing is the so-called rad conversion rental assistance demonstration. That means public housing is under a part of the law under section 9 of the affordable Housing act of 1937, section 8 is a different thing. That's called section 9 public housing. One of the things that we should all understand is public housing by law can not have a mortgage on the buildings, so that means it relies solely on refinancing that comes from the federal state or city governments, none of which have ever supported public housing to renovate it to today's standards, let alone the standard of the 1990s, 80s, 70s or 60s right. So, by moving the NYCHA buildings to section 8, it allows you to put mortgages on the property. Specifically, though, everyone did not like the way that the city of New York did this rad conversion. They did not have all the tenant rights and the tenant protections that the NYCHA tenants have today carried over into these conversions. A subcommittee within the working group called tenant rights and protections has worked on this for 14 months and has secured the agreement of the city to move all the rights and protections that nitrous tenants have today, plus enhance them as part of any rad conversion. So that's a huge change and we can really thank two people who love that Committee Robert Atterberry from Congress member Nadler's office and that he helped me the name of the legal aid person. I forget Lisa. What's your last name: Lucy, yes, Luke Lucy from legal aid who specializes in litigation with NYCHA. They co-chair this committee with a bunch of NYCHA tenants and all the concerns about specific things like pets and succession and what happens on apartment size like you name it really detailed, stuff, washers air conditioners. All these things will now be embodied in the rules and regulations governing a conversion, but most important. Those things will be embodied in the documents that govern the deal. Specifically, the city of New, York and NYCHA will retain ownership of the buildings and the land they will be leased to a private development team and that private development team will consist not only of a for-profit developer but at the requirement of the working group, a not-for-profit developer together in partnership. So we really worked very hard on that part to make sure these protections get carried over. The next thing is tenant engagement, we're very concerned that NYCHA was paying lip service attendant engagement. There was a full committee that really came up with specific requirements and the tenants associations every development will be involved in the development phase in the construction phase, and they will have input into the management phase. Also and again, those requirements embody in the documents that govern the actual deal. The most complex piece of this has been the financing and how to put it together. The largest amount of money comes to the sorry step back. The city of the NYCHA came up with a capital needs assessment for Elliot Chelsea and Fulton totaling, 344 million dollars that would encompass new bathrooms, new kitchens, new plumbing, wiring and site work and masonry work and new windows. They left out the need for new heating systems. The tenants were out of their minds and we negotiated with NYCHA and put another 22 million dollars in the capital needs to have new heating systems, and specifically, today, the buildings run off connect steam from the street, and if you have a break in the main in one location, four or five buildings go down at the same time, with hundreds of apartments out of heat. Instead, there will be individual heating systems in every building, functioning separately, with a major savings in energy. Also, so now the total cost is 366 million and our task was to solve for 366 million. The first portion comes from a private developer, coming in with their own equity and taking out a mortgage for renovation, and that raises about 237 million dollars. The next portion, which was the hardest to figure out, was infill, meaning building new buildings on parking lots throughout the NYCHA Campuses Nycha's original proposal was demolish the low-rise buildings and Fulton on 9th Avenue and build 35-story or 40-story 80 20s. The community was entirely against the Niger. Tenants were entirely against it, so instead we spent a great deal of time going site by site parking lot by parking lot figuring out how to get in individual sites to do this kind of construction. We worked on that. First. Both it was only in Fulton. The working group extended it to Elliot Chelsea and found two sites there, and then we also really struggled with what would the income mix be in those sites, the city of New York? The easiest way to do this is do 80 market rate and 20 percent low income. The tenants did not want that. They did not want as much market rate to buy our president other elected officials in one market rate we finally hit on up on a proposal of 50 market rate and 50 low, moderate and middle, the idea being that we are preserving 2071, low-income apartments. We add on another roughly 200 apartments for sorry, another 250 apartments for a moderate middle and then the balance are for low income. This is a major issue going back and forth with the mayor's office and we have came to an agreement in March, but it just finally got settled two weeks ago. As part of this, there will also be a new Hudson guild, because one of the sites that is being used for the development is the current Hudson guild site. So that'll be a complex phase. Part of the plan where a new guild structure gets built first in that entryway in front of the guild and then a new building gets for modern for market. Modern, middle income and low income gets built on 27th street that funny street we have behind by south of Chelsea park. There will also be infill, so there is a commercial infill one story: structures on parking lots are two-story structures for community facilities, doctor's offices, day care things like that or commercial space, and then along ninth Avenue in Fulton. There are many spaces that were laundry rooms, wood shops that are obviously high rent income producing commercial space that will be converted to commercial space very last piece. Putting it together is the west Chelsea, affordable housing fund, there's only a small amount of that left around 733,000 and we're putting that into the pot in total. It means that today- and this will change probably tomorrow, that the plan is funded in full and has a small surplus of a million dollars going through. This has been quite complex because every step of the way the tenants were involved, they had issues about every single item and reconciling their issues was a major thing. Any development will also relocate parking throughout the complex. We will never lose parking and it'll relocate all the various uses, like the workshops, the the dumpsters, the garbage. All that stuff has to be baked into everything. So that is the plan in total and the both tenant associations have completely signed on to the more important participate in the development of this plan, and now it's being rolled out to the tenants, we're hoping that rolling out to the tenants will get rid of a lot of the misinformation and the general knee-jerk reaction, because we didn't start. None of us on this group started out in favor of a rad conversion and I was one of the biggest opponents, the idea at all. But when you take it the modified rad conversion with all these protections, that's what makes a major difference, and it's very it's been great- to watch people grapple with difficulty and non, and a lot of complexity and I will tell you the tenant association representatives. They understand this 100 all right, Joe, I'm gonna interrupt you here for a second, because the point I wanted to raise. We had a fourth member of the community board who was on this working Group Alzora Cleveland was sitting on the group and she sent me a letter resigning from working on the working group because she was still opposed to Rad and did not like the direction this was going. I wanted to raise that I wanted everyone to be aware of that. You're. Actually informing me for the first time. Okay, yeah I, didn't know that either and I had been in many meetings with El Zora, where she has participated, engaged to ask questions and been totally engaged with it. So yeah. There were other issues why she wanted to step down scheduling, issues and whatnot, but she specifically said I do not and can not support any efforts allowing Rad to manage any NYCHA projects given their history of poor management, unjustified evictions and rent escalations that to me sounds like a general knee-jerk reaction to a complex problem. She's telling me what she's dependent say, saying: she's speaking as a typical tenant trying to change everybody's, you know perspective, you know and we're working on that with a booklet now and so we're coming along. I just want to turn this over to Mike and Betty. To give you their perspective. They've been involved in this all the way through Mike. You want to go first and then Betty well, just quickly. You know: we've started working on a summary booklet of the working groups, progress. You know where we're going and it's taken to this date since November, 17th, 317 or more edits to that initial draft lots of people working on a Google document for the first time myself for the first time with such a huge number of people and the people at Hester, Street have been able to. You know shepherd this thing along amazingly, and it looks real good now. I must tell you know what Joe spoke about last Friday, it's worked into it I, don't know if you've seen it Joe, but it looks good all right and I think it's something we can hand off to the tenants, and these booklets will be handed out. I guess in the first part of January, some and I think they'll be able to look through it and be all translated and everything else. So that's a huge achievement. Hester Street did a tremendous job. I'm so amazed. I didn't think we'd ever get this far Joe. To tell you the truth and I think a lot of people might get their minds changed on what rad it's. We call it rad pact now just to let people know that this is not your typical rad conversion like you've seen elsewhere. This is our own, unique to Chelsea program, okay, Rad pact, that's what we call it now and I think it's you know it's coming along and I'm happy with it. Yeah I think it's kind of a miraculous process, because there must be about 90 people who are on our emails, who are reviewing documents. There are three subcommittees: Joe heads, the capital finance, one that has been spectacular in figuring out all the aspects of generating money for this project, and just you should know that there are five engagement sessions coming up in December and the public can come so you can go to some of those one of those. You know we don't want to go to more than one those sessions and there's also as I understood it. I don't know if the date is still in process. A general community meeting, I guess sponsored by Community board 4 on December, 17th Lo. Was that still a date or Jesse still a date happening, I'm going to ask John it's I! Guess it is happening. Yeah I know you mentioned an event that we'd be involved in I. I, haven't heard anything to the contrary, buddy well, I will we'll keep on top of it and let you know I would like I, don't even know I guess it would be some giant zoom session. You know yes Betty. It will be a giant zoom session. I can't wait. So, just for clarity's sake gives Joe we'll talk tomorrow, maybe or something about our responsibility in we're just trying to figure out how to fit it in among all the tenant engagement sessions, then afterward. So, of course the tenants get information first, because that's the most important I'm all for that. I'm just saying I just don't want to let anybody down in terms of if we're running the thing or we're running it. Okay! Well, that's good to know. Okay I see a lot of hands, let's start with Paul. This is amazing. Work I have five questions so I'll rattle through them really quickly. You probably can answer yes or no to most of them. First awesome news on the commercial enterprises on ground floor. Would those rent spaces be managed by the city or private enterprise? Second question is on capital improvements. You didn't mention elevators, I'm wondering if elevators are still in the formula. Third on on funding sources. At one point there was discussion about Tdrs, I, hope, I, wonder if that's been taken off the table and that's not going to happen again. Fourth is on Hudson guild. Are they going to in their new space, consolidate all of their operations, because I know they have multiple sites, or are they going to keep satellite spaces in different like one in Lhlc one Fulton and then the final thing is on the Chills restaurant housing fund, where you said there's about 730,000 left, is that the same fund as the Highline transfer rights that we just renegotiated those Tdr prices and isn't there more money that could be coming into that? And would that be funding that would be available for this? So there's my five okay, so first of all, elevators I forgot, yes, fully replaced as part of the as part of the plan, the for commercial space, the entire develop. The entire developments would go to this development team of for-profit and not-for-profit the housing authority would not be managing or operating it'd, be the private team and they would do the whole commercial marketing and renovation in order to actually be nimble enough to deal with. This housing authority has kept commercial space vacant on 9th avenue for 25 years. Hudson guild currently has the two aspects here. First there'll be an expansion down to Chelsea there'll be a Gr. One of the sites is a playground that the tenants agreed to relocate and that'll be turned into an indoor community. Center Fulton does not have an indoor community center and the guild will operate that no for clarification. That's the Godfrey playground. No, it's another one! Actually it's another one! The third! The next thing is the early, the children's center on 26th Street and Tenth Avenue that odd-shaped little pavilion on the corner. People familiar with that pre-k, the pre-K that building can not comply with today's requirements for pre-k, so that building will be turned into commercial space and Hudson guild's operations of that will be consolidated to the adjacent one or two-story structure, where the entryway is as for some of their other facilities, they will keep them because they serve specific populations in other locations and what did I miss Tdrs? Yes, Tdrs were felt as part of this to be too speculative because in fact it's they're market driven, but we've asked for them to be included to establish a future capital reserve for Chelsea NYCHA. The west Chelsea, affordable housing fund is priced at a different price than the development rights. It's very specific and that affordable housing fund in fact has raised to date. 1 million 733,000 1 million of that has gone to the seventh avenue till buildings on 22nd street and 7th Avenue the balance of 733. We have to use in Chelsea NYCHA, there's an additional project in the pipeline, 118 10th avenue, that's the old Chelsea park restaurant and that is currently on hold that was scheduled to produce around 8 million dollars at the city's request. We are just now, probably tomorrow, removing that from the plan and replacing with something else, because there's a question of whether or not that will happen in timing to meet the start of this work. So can I follow up with that, then, on the high line, development right transfer budget that goes into a housing fund. Is that a separate housing fund? And is there a way that we can access that for nitro? It is the west Chelsea, affordable, housing fund, that's what we're talking about, and it's priced at that at a at 6.25 per square foot right and that's what we are accessing for NYCHA, but on a limited manner, because there's has not been a lot of contributions to it. Yet. Okay, thank you! Marty! What's next, Marty did I see your hand before go ahead. Unmute yourself! This is a a really complex set of information and the question I'm about to ask maybe to picayune, for so I'm apologizing in advance. The 50-50 building. We've been told over these many years that 80 20 couldn't produce revenue sufficient for a developer. Now this 50 is it going to set a standard for what we do in the future? Can we get our other projects to go 5050? Actually, this is very peculiar to NYCHA and the specific reason is as part of the overall plan. We are preserving 2071 units of low-income housing, meaning the NYCHA apartments. The issue we have with this is that it would be cheaper and faster to make eighty percent market and twenty percent low income. The problem is Marty that would produce many more market rate units on the NYCHA campuses, and that was an overall concern and fear of the tenants and the tenant associations and that's how we got to the 50, and then we threw some low income units in it too, really stupidly, complex and compromised. It's pretty much a one-off I think what a developer will be happy with it. They can still make money that we've gone through and done the feasibility on. So that goes back to my I know. You said I don't want to belabor. It just seems if they can make money on it there, then, why can't some other schmuck make money on something because of the scale, because it's not just that? It's those four or five sites, plus the 2071 units at the higher section 8 rents at the subsidized mortgage, all the stuff together, makes it work. It's like one part of a puzzle as opposed to Standalone Dale. This sounds: are we not using the raised hand, function Mr, Chair, I'm just I'm going in the order of everyone as you're, showing up in my screen, so I don't miss anyone. Okay, this sounds incredible. This is Joe's magic sugar, cubes dancing in Chelsea I have I would like to I, don't know if it exists or if it'll be available at the upcoming meeting. Is there like a campus plan or a schematic 100 with plans and diagrams, and you name it there's a whole pile of stuff there. Well, if you could you like ballpark, like what are we talking about in terms of number of units, how many towers of helmet of what height sure there no building is higher than 22 stories, which is the height of the Fulton buildings, there's two at 25 on Elliot Chelsea, because those are 25 stories and in total the production of units is 640 or something like that in total 640 units between the two no Elliot Chelsea has 2071 units we're, preserving and then building an additional 640 units on multiple sites. So not every building is large. Some of the buildings are kind of small, the new buildings yeah. Okay, that those were the figures just to get a ballpark concept of the scope and scale thanks, Joe Bert, yeah I mean I think the product. What you ended up with is amazing and great and the process. That's the amazing part you didn't get to that until you went through that process produced it and I think it's that the stamina, the three of you, everyone who is involved. It's amazing, I, can't imagine you know what you talked about: Mike the edits from the beginning at the beginning, so tdrs some may be someplace down the line in the future. Okay, this very structured, rad and obstruction is the wrong word limited in terms of well-defined red, modified, entirely private sector, not-for-profit involved, 50-50 and all the tenant safety measures to keep them there and what they have. Has the authority in any way recognized or is it too early for them to say you know this was really an amazing thing that we came up with. Let's use it in our other proposals. I want to say this is about Chelsea. We don't want to set a citywide precedent, understood let them take whatever they want, because we're not redoing it for the city, although they end up being a model, I'm not asking you to do it, but is there any acknowledgement that you've heard I know the housing authority nowadays is not full of organized bureaucrats they're all over the place, but is there any kind of recognition that this is really to their benefit? Well, Bert. In these meetings, we've had the participation of deputy mayor Vicky, Bean and Greg Russ, the chair of the housing authority and Jonathan Gavia, the head of Development Greg, Russ and Jonathan Gavia have sat in the finance committee meetings and we have vetted every single supposition through them to make sure they were in agreement and that's what's made a big difference like the whole thing with the heating system. That was a few of us talking to Greg Russ saying we can't proceed unless we have new heating systems. We can't do it. You can't put the tenants through all of this and they have shitty heat at the end. So yes, one thing on the heating system: Joe just to enlarge on that the savings in energy, okay, I, don't know how they allow this to go on so far, but just moving that steam from one place to another. By the time it gets to where it's used, you've already lost to the atmosphere, 25 of the energy that's produced in the beginning. Okay, that alone should wake them up. Okay, and it took this to get it done right. So yeah I just want to say one more thing: Joe Betty Mike that it may be a little too early, but the world should know about this. It's a little too early, let's get through the tenant engagement. Okay, if you come out alive on the other side and still in place, the world should know about it. January's going to be a big month in this country and in this city, all right, Christine I, think Jeff had his hand up way earlier than mine, I'm going in the order. You're. All on my screen, I made that yeah so I have a question. Joe is in Manhattan Plaza, for example, which was a whatever system eight or whatever. It is section. Eight, yes, section. Eight. There was a really intense negotiation to make sure that the tenants were not displaced and that the selection of tenants was very objective and that people were getting the good service. How is that going to be applied in this instance? So it's the tenant protections that were identified by that tenant protection, Attendant Rights committee they get will get embodied as requirements in the ground lease and all the regulatory agreements that will be part of this process. The housing authority has the ability it has enforceable, have enforcement mechanisms. If the development team for profit and not for profit, remember every best intentions can go awry. They will be able to enforce those provisions and the real concern. The tenants had was things like succession, for example, or what, if you're in a for there, are single people in a four bedroom apartment? Well, you have to shift around because that's part of the whole section 8 process, and so everyone wanted to make sure that the tenant's rights were covered and I will tell you the tenants themselves are the ones that identify item after item so, for example, washing machines are not allowed, but there are washing machines that exist throughout both complexes. That's going to be factored in to save their grandfathered in dogs and pets. People yes know like there's all kinds of specific things: that's where the tenants drill down and that's what informed all this list of rights and protections that are now will be embodied in the whole package. But, for example, is there going to be a situation where some people could pay market versus some people could not pay market? Oh no. Everyone will be subsidized, but there is one issue that requires a waiver from HUD that nice just said they are willing to pursue. Currently tenants go up to in the section 8 building you go up to wherever the maximum section 8 rent is, and that's it in a rad conversion in a public housing is something called flat. Rent up to that amount, you don't pay anymore. That is a key provision for tenants here that they're going to re that nature will request a waiver to have a version of flat rent. So after you hit whatever that amount is you're not always paying. If your income goes, you can get better you're, not going to pay 30 of your income you're going to pay up to that those rent levels established by section 8, just as it happens today in other section 8 projects. That was a huge issue and again it requires it waiver by HUD. If you asked me about this five months ago, I'd be very pessimistic. However, come January I feel very optimistic for this okay Mr first Vice chair. Thank you, Mr Chair, Congrats, Joe Congrats to the working group. The process has been tremendous, but I guess I'll, be the only one, who's a little upset a little let down and many concerns remain and will even once this project comes to fruition. It's come to my you know attention over the past year or two that the many affordable housing developments that we fight like tooth and nail to maintain their character and integrity of today never would be built in the tenor and landscape in which we operate today, where, if the 60s and Penn South was being built were at the 70s of Manhattan, Plaza was coming to life with the 20S and London Terrace was taking shape, and so, when I hear that, there's going to be one in two stories built on some of this infill for commercial purposes, I see it as totally waste of potential look at the buildings on eighth avenue between 23rd and 24th streets, one in two stories on each side of Eighth Avenue, one as owned by Penn South, one across on the east side of the avenue completely underbuilt we're an island with a serious housing crisis that one and two story buildings are even being contemplated for construction is kind of mind-boggling. To me, I know you mentioned those were for commercial purposes. Joe right, yes, can I on side streets and on Avenue can I help you first. So there is no one or two story being built on the avenues at all, it's in the blocks and that's specifically because those sites are too close to the existing windows of the Fulton houses for there to be a building built next to it would not meet the requirements for building separation of 60 feet or 30 feet and how much of your plan assumes reasonable retail rents. What assumption goes in that any commercial side street operation is going to command a market rent and at what rate are we projecting that for 2025 2030. sure so, specifically, they're set up not just for commercial, but also for community facility, like doctor's offices or medical offices, for a hospital, because the idea is there may not be even be pre-pandemic. There may not be this appetite for mid-block commercial, so it's not just commercial. It's also community facility and, as you know, it's very broad as we can go in there. Those rents Jeffrey are currently pegged anywhere between 180 a square foot and we're about to just adjust them down given the current market. But remember this is roughly a five year plan. So we're not talking about everything being built day, one it's going to be over time and you and I hopefully aren't we are we live in the same place in the city? We want things to get better to adjust back to where they were. But again, the only reason there's a one or two story building built is because physically you could not build a tower at that location because it would obstruct light in air. The adjacent faulting houses got it and then just two other comments. I have always maintained that I do wish the even though it's only 700 thousand dollars in change from the west Chelsea, affordable housing fund would not go into this project and I wonder why you're still entertaining it, given that there's gonna be a million dollar surplus at the end of the day, why not hold on to that money for other new, affordable housing? We're doing some revision of the underwrite of this plan tomorrow and the million dollar surplus is going to disappear this just this is one of those hot off oppressors. Something happened on Friday that changed a lot of stuff with the administration got it so I would I still maintain that I wish that money was not being burned on a project. That's getting a whole bunch of other funding sources. It would only go to one place, which is the seventh avenue buildings and get sucked up and go away and then that we're saving, so many apartments is great. We're only building 640 new units across a number of parking lots playgrounds, that's not a lot of new units. Why are we capping these buildings at 22 stories that preserved agreement with the tenants association who did not want 40 story towers in their midst and part of our process? Here is called compromise and, as usual, you don't start you don't get what you want. The housing authority would love to. Have you work for them because they'd like to have 45 story towers in the block tomorrow? It's not just the housing authority, it's a macro view of the city and the need to actually house more people. My issue is my community and not the macro view of the city. That's what I'm trying to do? Yeah Jeffrey! Let me just type in just a minute here. One comment about as a tenant, all right, it's scary, sometimes to live in the projects, see the higher up. The building goes the scarier. It gets okay when you're adjacent, so we're renovating we're redoing that I'm not changing the population here. So what you've got the Eliot houses are low buildings walk up the block to the Elliott houses, which are the tall ones, and you have some Chelsea houses, Chelsea house. Those are the ones where you have most of the issues. You know crime and all sorts of things. So now the lower the better you know for us once this land is gone, it is gone. So. Thank you and congratulations. I hope this comes to life. Without many, a hiccup there'll be a lot of hiccups, we'll be coming back well once it starts. Actually being you know, shovel in the ground kit, thanks lol, so having been in Chelsea Landi's meetings where folks talked about this and attended one of the public engagement sessions. I want to say really appreciate all of the thought and work that went into making the progress that's been made so far. I definitely want to add my name to the list of folks giving kudos. My question is actually for Betty. We had a pretty consistent contingent of tenants at Chelsea land use meetings. We had variety of concerns, I'm wondering if those folks were among the tenants who were on these working groups involved in this compromise or if they are now going to be engaged in where things landed. I think you probably can remember many of the folks I'm talking about because it was yeah. I could answer that since it was Chelsea Landrieu's Mary, who was one of the most vocal people at Chelsea Landrieu's tenant. She is an integral part of the working group of the capital, finance subcommittee, knowledge, capital, finance subcommittee and some other committees so, and she and some of her buddies are very involved and they some number of these tenants, are going to be have speaking parts on the engagement meetings, so I think that's really pretty wonderful and I should mention that there is a small group who is still protesting and still saying that, whatever it is, the Chelsea working group has come up with and I, don't think they even have understood what we're doing are protesting and I guess it was Paul. You said about Marcy Mari, Marnie, Barney Marnie is most likely involved in that and I. Actually, a person at Penn South sent me an email that there was going to be a protest on Sunday and I. Didn't answer her back because she said you know we don't want demolition and blah, so there's still room for some more education and I'm hoping that the engagement meetings that people will get the correct information and not fake news. Thank you. Good morning, herself is running for City Council. You know Corey, so she has been missing an action lately. I mean we should note that there has been many attempts during the working group meeting was meeting in person to disrupt the meetings to come in to film the meetings to live stream, the meetings and myself and other tenants, Attendant association members have gone and actually asked those people to leave. They were obstructing the business there's going to be people not happy about this period, because that's the nature of change, we're managing a huge change and the main thing is: if we don't protect people in this, we said over and over. None of these things are going to go ahead unless all these protections and this engagement requirements are part of it. We put that over and over in the financing section right back to Dale. Wait. No, you muted yourself! You were okay before so sorry about that. Okay, just to the point about the heights, I do think there is something beyond the argument about like public safety and tall housing projects. I do think there is a conceptual framework which argues for equal high new construction, because we want the final product to be of a piece yeah. If you have tall market rate towers in the midst of a public housing project, it's going to be very tale of two cities, in my view, and to equal out the heights is going to help with that. You know holistic view of the project once it's finished. Okay, thank you, Dale. Anyone else, Bert yeah I, just want to say that I'm glad that you're, preserving some open space just because there's open land doesn't mean we have to build on it and we're not necessarily going back into the 1920 visions of towers in a park. You know acres of park in one tower, it's a hole, but we need to preserve some space too, and back and forth and Jeffrey I just want to say. Yes, we do need more housing, but it doesn't all have to be in Chelsea and it doesn't all have to be in Manhattan. Just because there's an open lot on the corner doesn't mean we have to build a 70-story building on it. Okay, oh I, didn't say 70 Mr Lazarin by any stretch of the measure, but adding five more floors. Adding five floors to each of those buildings would actually have quite a few more units, and if we're looking to talk about integration, you know there's a whole bunch of ways to look at how every neighborhood can play a role. Thank you. Jeffrey. All right, I want to express my alan. You got something now go ahead quickly. Please congratulations! Great work! Yeah I want to express my sincere thanks to Joe to Betty to Mike and Elzora. They put in a ton of time on this. It was very stressful, I, attended, I, think two of these meetings and it's remarkable that anything came out of this. So I know that Joe and Betty and Mike's leadership made a big difference here. So I want to thank you all for that very much Joe. We've got to figure out how we're going to present this to you through your committee, through the Chelsea land use, Committee Betty, and this forum you want Jesse to put together in two weeks, yeah, I'm thinking we do the forum first and then bring this to the January committees after the tenants have had a chance that the Jessica's the tenants have to we don't want to up. You start the tenant's response. You know right, but we can take that offline and discuss it. I want to thank you again for your efforts all right. Everyone got the full board proposed full board agenda and committee schedule. If you have any issues, questions whatever bring them to Jesse's attention. Small meeting report. Nature group has we'll get there. Oh okay, coming in it's technically coming in as new business. Oh sorry, yeah there was a Chelsea land use and transportation had a briefing with Flix Bus. Regarding a parking lot outside of 300 West 31St Street, there was a briefing on the 311 West 42nd Seat 42nd street project with Clinton health kitchen land use. There was a rebuild by design big U event. This was about resiliency that waterfront and parks and Mcb four co-sponsored. So thanks to I think Marty was involved with that or at least attended that, and we are continuing to meet on an ongoing basis with DHS about density reduction of the shelters in all of the community district, with a focus on 36th street and I. Don't know if we're making progress yet but we'll find out soon enough. Jesse, you want to talk about the code. Drive sure I'll hand that really off to Maria, because Maria's done the the lion's share of that work, but before we get there, I just want to go over a couple things just for clarity's sake, so December committees, everybody's meeting at the regular time, to my knowledge at this point, so there shouldn't be any no surprises or any changes. Obviously, Joe and Betty will have to talk and Mike will have to talk about the 17th, because that's actually your committee Joe and so we'll have to figure that out and before we get to the coach I just want to let you know Jessica had to jump off, unfortunately, but so we Jessica and I reached out to beta NYC, which is data kind of crunching organization that Gail Brewer uses with her a lot of her work to look at the results of the survey. The community survey that Jessica put out as the chair of the budget task force. You know we had about I think we had over 200 people respond a lot of long answers and so they're actually helping us crunch, all the numbers and data and so we'll be getting each of the co-chairs for all the committees. Some good work, some good data to use to maybe give you guys a little additional information is what to be bringing back to your committees for discussions and possible future agenda items. I just also want to put a remind folks. I know everybody does a lot of work and everybody does a really good job of running their committees, but I just want to remind folks that they to definitely remember that we always have new folks coming into this experience, and so, when you start your committees and I'll, send it back out to you guys again. There is a standard thing. We would like you guys to give out in terms of directions and why we're doing this in a virtual way, and it just gives new people that are coming to the committee from the public, maybe even new board members who just an understanding of what the process is. So I just remind people that when you start your committees process at the beginning to go through those initial steps, you know and I know it's easy to forget and just roll right into the work. The first agenda item, but it is a whole different process when you're doing it remotely but in terms of I want to just move on to good news right. So we are yeah. If you remember a couple months ago, at this point, I brought up the idea of doing donations and trying to get a donation drive going from board members and I was going around in circles a little bit with that Maria Ortiz came in and really came up with this idea about the co-drive. It was very helpful, got people on the phone to start getting people speaking about it and we so we gotta I'll, give it to her I'll we'll let her do the rest of the talking, but I really appreciate Maria's work on this. Thank you Jesse. It wasn't that much, but I think the tough part is gonna, be the day that we're getting the collection and distributing, but so we're doing a coat and soft drive and it's gonna be for children and adults that are living in shelter in our community. Originally, we were going to do it just for families and just coats, but after speaking with DHS and some non-profit providers, we recognized that there's really a need for codes for adults as well and socks they're, also underwear, but we're just going to do coats and socks. We're going to do it with Metro ministries, and so the dates that are going to be to collect items is going to be Friday, December, 11th from 10 a.m, to 2 and then Saturday the following day from 1 pm to 5 p.m, and then we're going to distribute the items. People are going to come pick them up on Sunday I, don't remember the time Jessie. Do you remember the time of pickup I? Think it's yeah, I, don't I! Think that's pretty! We have that's still a little broad just because it's really about the shelter residents coming, not so much people from the public dropping off so I think most of the day on Sunday. So we'll share that information at the next meeting, which will be full board. But what I am going to need is some volunteers for collection on that Friday and Saturday, and also for Sunday. So if you are interested in helping out, I would really appreciate it. I'm not gonna need I'll just need a couple of people, so if you're interested, if you could email me, thank you, I see, I saw what you wrote: Joe, oh, and what I also wanted to mention separately but piggybacking off. What Jesse said about reminding folks about the process in the beginning of the meeting. I think that's really helpful, because I received a lot of emails and calls about the process of how our meetings function and the proc. So that's what I wanted to share all right on the committee agenda for next month. I just want to highlight something: that's not there yet, because we haven't locked it down. We have invited the NYPD to present to the Clinton health kitchen land Use committee on two sites that they have said would work for the towpound, so they're going to be hopefully coming in and presenting on that to anyone who's interested in that issue, hopefully to the Clinton hell's kitchen land, Use Munich, although it's not on the agenda yet because they haven't locked it down yet can you stay with the clients? Okay, all right now we have I'm gonna move to new business and I guess yeah. You say what the sites are. Please the two sites, the two sites that Vicky Bean sent a letter to the state indicating two sites that they believed would work. One is the intrepid parking lot at 46th and 12th. The other is the marshalling yards 34th and 12th you're on mute, Marty I can't hear you ranting I said. Thank you all right. New business item. We've got a letter who am I turning this over to who's, taking like kit you're taking it okay. Will you explain what's going on here and explain the letter for us? Please yeah, absolutely I'm taking it initially and then Josephine has joined us. She drafted the letter and she'll be able to provide some helpful context as well. The headline is because of Covid-19. We are in a hybrid we're in a hybrid and now we're back to all remote with the New York city DOE, and there are sites around the city that have been set up for families who don't have a suitable learning environment for their student. That could be because their student is a student with special needs. It could be because the parents are essential workers, it's a very dire need, though kids are going to continue to get their education, while schools are not able to operate normally and the bad news is. We currently have zero of those sites in CB4. The letter is the result of several meetings, but most recently, a meeting where we heard from DOE, specifically locating one of these sites in the 30s or the 40s, would be the most helpful thing to do specifically for families who are living in temporary shelters in the hotels that have been converted, and so the hope is to get one or more sites. They're called Learning Bridges in our district, and this is a need that will continue to be dire. Whether or not schools reopen before the summer, so I'll stop there and Josephine. Please add in I think it would be very helpful to get a learn: a Learning Bridges site in the West 40S, particularly to cover the school's ps51 and Ps212 Ps 111 I think that school they can send some of their kids to a site on West 60th. So currently, there is a Learning Bridges site on West 26th street at Hudson guild and then the next one is in the West 60s at the New York Parks Department a recreation center there so we're trying to fill a void between the 30s, 40s and 50s. So if we could do it somewhere in the center, someone had mentioned Hartley House as a possibility, then that would be great. I've sent around a whole list of criteria that these daycares have to meet in order to qualify, and there is a deadline for day care for these providers. These community-based organizations to actually apply and the deadline is December 3rd. So we're also asking that the DOE extend that deadline and they take applications beyond that. So this is really critical, especially now that kids have gone fully remote, so they're not in school at all, and we have many children that are still not able to get Wi-Fi for whatever reason, and also some kids just need to be around other children. They need to go somewhere during the week. It helps them. So this is very essential and thank you for listening. Anyone have questions. Joe saw your hand first. Yes, could you send me the requirements for so I can look and talk to Hartley House about it, because those are probably very physical and they're going to come to us anyway about it. Yes, of course, we'll do it. I forwarded it to you already. You did yeah, oh Paul kid I, just thought of this I just emailed you I wonder if district 27 Afscme represents school workers, janitors administrators, they have a massive hall on West 45th street between 9th and 10th that they're not using, because they can't because of Covid-19 I, wonder if that might be an option as well. Yeah saw the email that I will look at it. One of the criteria to be a center is, it has to be staffed already. So basically, the DOE is partnering with community based organizations that already have some staff there like either they run an after-school program or senior program, something with people who are already there and then I think the deal we will send. You know a couple additional staff members, but that is a criteria, so somebody has to currently be in the building. You know and be able to facilitate some of this, but maybe with the union. If their union workers aren't in the schools anymore, they might be able to move them into the hall. That's a thought: yeah. Anyone else, fatty I, just love. This idea, I think it's really important and I hope. Hartley House has the right physical requirements to could be met, and you know I know. You said that Metro Baptist Church on West, 40th, 29th and 10th would be ideal, except they don't have the phys. They don't have enough bathrooms, they don't have proper access, but I just would like to suggest that we're in an emergency situation here and maybe there's just some way- that there can be a waiver for some of the requirements physically for bathrooms or you can put a ramp for access. In other words, maybe there's some way you can work around these requirements that that's all, because that would be a great location. They have an after school there, I don't know if the preschool is still working up there right now, but you know they have the space. This is my thinking about it. Thank you. Marty thanks. I support this also on line 35 of the second page. You say that Manhattan community board for requested Dqe and open a Learning, Bridges site, Midtown I reacted to that singular and I think you're looking for more than one site and it shouldn't be singular there does that make sense, I mean I, don't think we're really going to get more than one I. The mayor seems to think that you know there's a need, but maybe the need isn't as great. He they're basically adding it as an as need basis. So you know if we add one, and we see that the need is huge, then maybe there's a possibility of adding another, but I don't really see us getting more than one I have. No doubt that's right and I'm sorry to hear it. I still think you should not be giving away the bus by saying it's singular in that sense, open learning, open bridge centers in our neighborhood. That's fine, accept it! That's fine! It's great feedback, Marty and I. Think you know the positioning of we want to have multiple is a bit of a negotiating stance. Thank you all right. Anyone else, Jesse, I, just think I, don't think we actually wrote in the letter. Tell me if I'm wrong guys that we want the deadline extended. Is that correct? We need to add that language yeah good Flag Jesse, so we want to add in a paragraph or a short section, asking the DOE to extend the deadline just because it's not a lot of time for a community based organization to submit an application for a space. We don't expect that we will get an extension, but we want to be on the record for requesting one there's. You know a very plausible situation where there's multiple rounds of this is at least chosen being correct from wrong. The second time that applications have been opened up, I think there was another Rfi earlier. So we want to ask for an extension to put us in a better position to hopefully apply for this later. If we don't get it initially, Alan I think I put a suggestion in the letter Josephine where you wrote, the applications are rolling applications for parents. We had that a little confused, I thought it was for the sites, but it's actually for the parents, but there's a line in there that we just have to tighten up a little bit, maybe put that in as bold when it goes out. You know just bolding up that, as you know the request, but some of the wording is already in there right. You can jazz it up a little bit. Okay, we also see, if I see that you guys addressed it to Garen, I'm sorry Karen Goldmark and she had actually stepped down to work on the Biden campaign and I. Don't think she's returned I, don't know so we may want to. You know check that out before we address this letter to her. It won't go out unless until you three have her okay. Thank you well signed off on every t. In every eye it was a temporary legal absence. My understanding is she's back now that the election apparently has been won today, all right. Anyone else that I'll take a motion. Please motion. Thank you. Second, all right, all those in favor, because this letter has to go out immediately all right, Marty you're in all right, that's unanimous spike! You were right, actually yeah, president, not eligible all right. Kids, Piani! Okay! Thank you! So much everyone all right, I have a request for new business, one quick thing from Leslie, so I'm going to give her the floor for a minute. Thank you, and this is more I guess for BLP. Can we extend the conversation on the outdoor dining structures? I'm actually a little bit surprised, I, think that our community board should address this a little more vigorously about the how all of a sudden the mayor has said. These are no longer temporary. These are permanent and he did it without any community input without any meetings. Without anything I know, CB2 had a great letter that came out this week concerned about land use issues concerned about sidewalk issues. Disability issues concerned that actually this would hurt the restaurants and stores they were really intended to help where, in the long run landlords. If this were permanent landlords, could up their rent and say: hey, you have an outdoor space, we're going to up the rent and could so you can use this outdoor space. That was a big concern that it would be that type of land grab anyway. My request is that we look at this and we and law. What do you think? It's BLP, maybe yeah the letter out of that frank and bird. Are you, okay, adding this to your December agenda? Sure all right? Thank you. I want to raise the point that last month we sent a letter that Bert wrote which was really addressing that issue, and so we just need to see whether how much more we need to say yeah, all right. You can take that up and be Lp the Flixbus issue Christine. How are we handling that is that going to transportation? No, my understanding was that yeah. It should go to transportation, but Dale didn't we want to come to full to the discuss that I mean you know. What what's happening is that the flex bus is really asking for a change in zoning, slash a special permit, and so it should come really to land use, because it's a special permit, which are really a land use issue. It's going to go to committee in December. We can figure out which committee to send it to yeah. It should clearly go to in my mind, to a land use, it's a very much a land use issue, and then we can have the we are as transportation. We're sending comments to land use. I've already sent my comments. Okay and I think we need to put them on the agenda of land use and then maybe do it in two steps. One step is, you know, listen to them and then tell them to go back and then come back the following months: okay, that's okay with Betty and Paul gave a thumbs up and then I'm going to ask the question so and Bert add his hand up I, don't know! No, I'm going to come back here. Betty you're! Okay, with that going to your committee, just give me a thumbs up. I thought we decided it was a transportation issue when we discussed it before, but I guess we can I think it's both I think it's actually both there's a whole thing about buses and bus stations and everything so Christian, but at the end of at the end of the day, if I have, to put it I mean just like we do. When we do parking, we put it into land use and then transportation comes and say this is our problem. This is a little bit the same situation. There is a lot of land use issue. That transportation is not an expert with so I think transportation should come and contribute to land use, but it should be mainly a land use issue. I just want to I, don't want to beat a dead horse, but Christine. You raised a very good issue at the end of your comments, the person who's writing. The proposal is not representing the owner of the property, and so it seems kind of like the horse. The cart before the horse, well I think we should have raised all these points so that you can raise that with the applicant. That say, we need to see the landlord, because the landlord is the one who is, you know, asking I guess we have to raise that before the meeting. Yes, the landlord has to authorize the application as the landowner yeah exactly okay, so I think we've got a process on that Bert, you had your hand up. Yeah I was just wanting to ask Paul and Betty the letter on flood resiliency and flood control. Is that coming up here or what that was that Jesse, you sent it out already right. Oh, it doesn't come. No, it's not a formal letter; it was not so we did a letter with questions to city planning. Okay, and we said we needed more information so that we could discuss it at the next land use meeting. Okay, so it doesn't go through here yet not yet. Okay, anyone else have anything yeah. Just are you waiting goodbye? Are you raising your hand? We did agree that what what Paul is going to do, because Paul sits on both committees, land News, he's going to provide an update to the Clinton health kitchen land use committee as to what clue has been highlighting as the issues for regarding the application and then invite any interested parties from that committee to attend the follow-up clue committee in December, because DCP will be coming back. So therefore, input from both land use committees will be taken into a into account similar to this process that Christine just rolled out to with regarding transportation and clue on a different topic, though. Okay, so the let the administrative letter could be sent to Hell's kitchen Clinton land use, it already has we've included it's included into their packet, and so okay, I'm happy to send an executive, I'm happy to send it to exec the full exec committee. If people are interested, it's a very thorough administrative letter and if anybody has questions, I'm always happy to talk all right. Anyone have anything else. Or can we adjourn Alan go ahead. Just a point of information. I need the DOE letter is going to be going out before full board. Does the letter still come up before the full board? Yes, it has to be ratified by all letters that a side note about the moving of the toe pound. There is a parking lot called the intrepid parking lot between 11th and 12th 45th to 46th. There was a Con Edison gas works. There it closed in 1918. Suddenly, the state is proposing a remedy to that site. I'm not suggesting there's any connection. Oh I'm certain there is I am certain. There is Jd. Thank you being as, though, that the chair, the commissioner of the State Department of environmental conservation, sits as the governor's representative and the chair of the Hudson River park. Trust I can not imagine, there's not a connection there. Hey I'm just saying. Is that a remediation putting the toe down there? No, it's a cleanup, so they're going to make the site unavailable. Oh, this is like ending in a negative. Yes, there's a lot of talk going on behind the scenes. Okay, we're trying to resolve this. That just means that every car which is towed will be rusting very fast. Marty I didn't know that site was a again. That's funny that came out about a week ago. 1910. I know something about gas works in the sense that they leave a residue that needs to be cleaned up and that's. There was one on 17th street that's built over and there are others in our district I, don't know where. So I'm not surprised they're going to crop up again and you can't really put anything there until you clean it up. Well, they've been using it as a parking lot for years. So they're going to say that was the cap. I know yep all right, seeing no other hands. We are adjourned. Thank you. Everyone. Good night, everybody happy Thanksgiving, everybody good night, yeah.
