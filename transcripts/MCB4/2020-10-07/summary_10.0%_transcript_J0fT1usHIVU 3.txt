We're asking all of the precincts to come through on a regular basis to try and establish better relations between the Community board and the NYPD.
So many people walking around with guns- You, know like a crime, stopper sort of thing.
You know maybe some sort of crime stopper announcement should be made to the communities, because there's too many people out there firing weapons, yes, Sir!
I do not know the statistics as far as shots fired calls in the 10th precinct, but I'm sure Whether, it's the overseeing borough or downtown comstat, or just a zoom call with the executives at one police plaza, a shots- fired call is treated like an actual shooting, like someone's, actually being shot for.
You know thing that might be people could be that live in the developments that you know the players over there But that's what the NCO philosophy is all about: The NCO officers in the 10th precinct.
And I think it's not as prevalent an issue with you, but I'd like to see if I can get a conversation going amongst all the cos where the precinct lines cross over so particularly up here at 40 39th, where the 10th, the Midtown north Midtown south those corners where the intersections are the drug dealers all know where those lines are and if they're on one side of the street and they see an officer on the other side of the street.
You know the the corridors that we share because a lot of times they can commit a crime on my side they're going into there That sounds like a quality life issue.
The CEO Sarah Appleton go ahead, I'm sure you've seen that in recent days, there's been a lot of public discussion and media coverage on mass adoption among NYPD, officers.
I think this is an issue that you know at least my opinion was always important, but has certainly become particularly important with coping cases ticking up around the city and officers being charged with enforcement of mask wearing and other social distancing, rules.
I'm sure that I'm not alone on this board and saying that I've seen you know dozens of NYPD officers in our district Less on our streets throughout the summer and fall, maybe noticed a couple.
You know every time I go out, but for the most part most of the officers I'm seeing are still not wearing masks and obviously that's not only a public health problem, but it further erodes trust and goodwill.
You know we understand there was a change in direction from the city about your interaction with the homeless people, and it's at that point at this point, It's, very confusing to the population of what you can do The first question: is: can you steal pet patrol in streets where there are homeless?
We're arresting summoning whatever action we have to take, but if it's a quality of life, homeless, person living on the street, we're going to make every effort to reach out to social services, get them some help and try and see.
So the NCOS are sort of the outreach people, the ones that are contacting you they're, following up on crimes, they're, working with the community, as well as the Detective bureau.
The community affairs officer- and whoever else is there for that meeting, and so it's not only through this forum that you can ask questions of the NYPD inspector helen.
Carrie Keenan Europe I've been asked to ask what is the role of or mandate to the police in our community for ensuring the safety of the people who are exercising their right to vote on November 3rd to make sure that the polls are safe, you're, saying yeah The personnel at the polling, sites.

Restaurants access open streets and will create an interactive map that lets new Yorkers, see what is happening in their community.
We hear an oft echoed concern that New York City streets no longer have the foot traffic that fuels economies and these bills solve that by getting people into their community in a safe, way, still beholden to all the safety protocols, and we also hear from parents who need safe outdoor activities for their children.
This community board covers the most dense area in terms of cultural institutions and venues, and so providing the ability for public performance in a safe and respectful way is going to really help some of these organizations.
Thank, you so much just a quick introduction, I'm from the guardian angels, the guardian, angels, we're unarmed volunteer community patrols, comprised of women and men, We started in the Bronx in 1979, and we have patrols throughout all of the boroughs, and we want to reach out to obviously everyone in Chelsea, because the goal is to form partnerships with everyone in the area as we're doing the community patrols.
Since the lockdown began, the group we've been asked to start patrols in Chinatown when people were being Asians were being attacked because of the Covid-19 and Upper West side, where we reside, because the increase in crime quality of life issues and now in Chelsea.
So, now we're starting a group in Chelsea and they were speaking of problems in the corridor along 8th Avenue between 20th and 22nd street, like relating to hard drugs being dealt people shooting up, arguing, fighting.
But obviously you know you want to give notice of your presence to people who are active in the area.

Well, with that Mr Chair, I declared the public session closed, not available that we have sent on this issue and we recently joined a letter sent by Gail Brewer Senator Robert Jackson, an assembly member Dick Godfrey that was sent to the department of homeless services about this.
It was you know we rescheduled and is scheduled for tomorrow, to meet with the commanding officer and discuss with him the issues and concerns in order to bring about the type of resolutions where the residents can feel that their safety and security is being considered.
If I ca not feel safe in my home and my neighborhood we're in trouble, and so we I am going to meet with the commanding officer of the Midtown South, tomorrow, and I.
I will be in contact with both of you about that, but there is to the concerns have been expressed to all of us on a continuous basis and what they're only hoping for is to have it's a type of environment where they can walk in the streets going to their home and also feel safe and secure.
Borrowing, money from New, York City, what's happening with the possibility of early retirement incentives in order to reduce the head count without refilling them, and it seems, though, everyone, both the governor and the state, is hoping and waiting and praying for the federal government to act.
He really meant that some people do not believe he really meant that, but I, surely hope so, because the impact is devastating not only in New York City but around our country, and we know that so obviously we're hoping and waiting that the federal government would act.
Budgets have been put on hold and monies that state legislatures have legislators, have allocated to Cbo's and other organizations, there's a hole on that As far as funding for organizations that we've allocated money to, that's the jam that we're in quite frankly, and as I said, the most important thing is: We have to have enough to sustain the people of our city and state.
Please wash your hands, do not stand too close to people, because if not, then we all who do not follow that it's going to make the situation worse, for not only our city but our state and our country.
What we always find is that what is needed is a strong program of services and and security and where we get that in place from the provider from the city, things tend to work out a whole lot.
It's going to be very important to the security of our country and to the security of our of the election that the votes of Chelsea and Hell's kitchen show up on TV on election night in the national totals, because if the national total is not the right, way, I think we will see massive disruption of the counting of ballots to follow.
I. Do not think anybody listening tonight is likely to be in the group that we're talking about taxing, but unless we increase the taxes on really ultra high wealth, we're not going to be able to fund healthcare and education and housing and transportation, and a host of other needs, and I've been working with all of our local elected legislators and those from around the state to press the legislative leadership and the governor to do.
I again want to thank Senator, Jackson Assemblymember, Godfriedenborough President Brewer for joining that letter on 36th street that we joined.
And I want to thank Peter Johnson's office because I know we've been working with the skyline, also etc.
So the whole issue of homeless NYCHA working group to the credit of the city every Tuesday night.
Now activity was quite limited, except for the 10th, and I want to thank both Chelsea elliott and fulton, because they had members residents and pd there to talk about issues of concern.
But you know I, guess these times call for a thousand points of light, but I do think that some sanitation money needs to be put back, because it's not just unsightly it's.
So I'm going to ask everyone who speaks whether it's the rest of the electeds or Jesse, when he does the district manager's report or any of the other board business, we do if we can keep this as tight as possible, because evidently there's a lot of people who want to watch TV, tonight.
One estimate to that one out of every three might be gone after pandemic, which is why we launched our safe main street initiative to help New York City small businesses.
You know flyers of information, and I just want to highlight that, because it really does give a great report back to the community What.
At the end of the meeting to hand in your vote, sheets, And, then I do want to end on a positive note, with due to the generosity of Brookville properties and a great assistance from Cb4 member Josephine Ishmael, the Cb4 District Office was able to help deliver five thousand dollars to the ptas of Ps33 and Ps51 for their reopening needs, and so that was a good.
We may have some other candidates for some of the seats, which would be you know a little bit more fun to have an election that people actually have to vote in, but we'll have a full report at our November meeting or our December vote.
We really laid out the context of our community, the facilities we have for homeless and supportive housing and ask in essence that there be a sit down and a plan developed to basically correct a bad decision to have so many people with so many social service issues located in one area, and it is.
We have an Appendix a b and C A is just the questions by the committee and the Public Appendix B is the main comments by each public member who spoke, and I need to fix that We're attaching our letters from June and August, which were about this issue specifically about the density that was on 51st street and all three letters.
There is chaos going down on now in cb1 about a single hotel, That's being moved, we're talking about three hotels in a one square block area on 36Th Street, and we have offered repeatedly to work with DHS to relocate this hotel within our district.
As we already know what happened with the skyline right, I still ca, not trace these families at so many kids that were going to our schools.
We are either number three or number four in community boards out of 59, with social service facilities for the homeless in the city.
A specific ask in this that NYPD is going to respond to or that we want them to play a role in the neighborhood between the shelters just wanted to know what task was specifically for the commission on line 57 is to coordinate the DHS street outreach and the NYPD public safety enforcement?
