So I'm, going to just give a thumbnail on the first item, zoning for coastal flood resiliency, commonly known as Z C, F R, and we have the pleasure of Nibila Malik to present from city planning.
I'm, a planner for community board, 4 from the Department of City, planning, and I'm, going to be presenting a summary of the zoning for coastal Flood resiliency proposal, which was referred out on October 19th.
The proposal introduces updates to the zoning resolution, sections related to flood resiliency measures and options.
When we're analyzing the city's coastal risk, we tend to focus on the area that FEMA designates as the high risk flood zone.
We need to pursue a strategy that involves multiple lines of defense, so the city's work includes coastal defense, strategies, protection of our inland infrastructure like drainage and transit, and advanced emergency preparedness.
This proposal builds on two zoning text, amendments that were put in place shortly after Hurricane Sandy to help coastal neighborhoods recover and rebuild quickly, but those zoning flexibilities which were passed as a temporary emergency measure are beginning to expire.
Zoning for coastal flood resiliency will help those living and working in the flood plain to reduce damage from future coastal storms be resilient in the long term, by accounting for future risks from including climate change and potentially help save on flood insurance.
Floodproofing means meeting specific design and material requirement so that water can not enter the building during a flood.
The building code requirements in Appendix G started to become widely applicable soon after Sandy, when many were trying to rebuild and suddenly faced these new standards, the post-sandy zoning regulations, DCP, put in place were not were intended to make it easier for building owners to design to Appendix G standards without facing hurdles or conflicts from the zoning code.
Flood levels also attached homes and multi-family buildings were not sufficiently addressed, since they must evacuate spaces below the dfe and relocate them on top of the structure, which is a retrofit strategy that requires more flexibility and businesses.
The floodplain community wants to be able to prepare buildings for flooding, even if they're not located in what FEMA currently determines to be the highest risk.
Two people also want the option to raise their occupiable space a little higher than the current flood level that FEMA projects, because they have seen higher flood levels already and expect that risk to grow.
They want options like moving their mechanical equipment to a higher elevation, without necessarily triggering a requirement to raise or fully flood proof.
We know that we need a way for the city to be nimbler and responding to future events that might require rebuilding homes or other forms of recovery.
The proposal expands the applicability of the current text to a broader set of buildings that are also exposed to flooding in the event of coastal storms, so any lot located within either the high risk or moderate risk flood plains would be allowed to use the proposed special options for resilient building design.
Today, building heights can be bumped to 9:10 or 12 feet, depending on the building's use and zoning district, making it a highly complex framework and because its applicability depends on the flood elevation level site.
You can see a provision that applies to existing buildings which exempts the dry flood proofed space, but the buildings then have a hard time recouping the investment of making the building water tight, because the uses for that space are constrained on the right.
You can see a rule that applies to new and existing buildings, which allows any space to be exempted from floor area.
The proposal would modify these regulations to instead only allow the first 30 feet of a space that is dry flood proofed to be exempted from floor area, provided that the space is used for non-residential uses complies with certain standard requirements such as minimum transparency requirements and internal clearance.
This would help encourage active uses close to the sidewalk level to promote a safe and lively pedestrian environment, while making sure that the resulting buildings are not out of scale please.
The proposed rules, take existing streetscape requirements and make them more consistent and provide more design options to ensure that resilient buildings reflect and contribute to their surroundings.
The proposal would continue to offer discretionary pathways in the form of BSA special permits to ensure that unique situations and hardships based on issues like lot shape, can get relief from certain zoning provisions in order to meet the Appendix G Standards, please.
A big portion of the flood plain contains businesses that offer either neighborhood services or are part of the large industrial economy of the city, and many of these buildings can not be completely elevated or dry flood-proofed due to cost or operational needs.
Zoning generally does not allow waterfront yards or require, or required, visual corridors to be raised to account for flood risk.
Many sites at the water's edge are also required to provide public access using specific design standards and have little flexibility to accommodate best resiliency, practices.
So the proposal will allow power systems, including generators, solar energy, systems, fuel cells and batteries, to be considered, permitted obstructions in open areas across all zoning districts.
The proposal would prohibit the development of new nursing homes within the one percent flood plain and other selected geographies likely to have limited vehicular access during a storm.
The time of the text amendment, the provisions could be limited to designated recovery areas based on the disasters impacts and the city's recovery plans.
The second provision would support businesses that do not conform with zoning use regulations by allowing them more than two years, which is the current limit of discontinuance to return to operation.
We go to the and talk about next steps, so the city-wide text amendment is being proposed to follow the euler process.
As, you can see here, community board resolutions are due by December 28th and more information about the project, including an annotated version of the proposed zoning text, can be found on our website.
If there's a way that we can zoom in a little bit more on that, because, as members ask questions, I want you to look at it and think about the neighborhood that you know and how these rules might impact, because a lot of the pictures were from like Rockaway, Beach and whatnot, but I'd be interested to know.
The relatively new zoning along the high line includes limits so that buildings, along 10th avenue, step down across from the Chelsea historic district to become more contextual in height with the historic district.
That's you know the trade-off if they are producing a building that is responsive to climate change and trying to mitigate the flood.
You know, I'm particularly concerned about how this would impact areas like the Chelsea historic district, which is primarily made up of row house blocks, and.
One issue that we've had is that developers will buy these houses, which have an far of three by the way, and that you know is not too much above what the existing row houses embody in terms of their use of that they are.
It sounds like the basement, not counting, as far would even happen automatically under what you're proposing in the case of parts of the Chelsea historic district that fall within the flood plain.
The attempt here is to provide consistent and equitable regulations that do allow buildings to accommodate flood risk, and you know, given that Chelsea was hard hit during Sandy.
You know not to belabor this, but one of the problems we have is that developers, sometimes from the far side of the planet, will buy a row house in Chelsea with the intention of maximizing its area and flipping it, and the Landmarks Commission often allows them simply to preserve the street facade and an entirely new building goes in behind.
It is general for the entire city, and those of us like David and thank you David for your questioning, have to narrow it down and try and figure out what is and what is not targeted to us.
This is a city-wide text, and so what I'm presenting are these general regulations that do they also do apply to Community, Board 4.
We I think we would be advised to write a letter that does not approve or deny the zoning text, but has questions about it.
We have these issues that cross both city planning landmarks buildings and all how much do you folks talk to landmarks when it comes to something like this.
Any sort of major concerns that LPC would have had would have been addressed before going out with the proposal, so was LPC involved in any dialogues or that resulted in any changes by city.
Could you provide what that looks like for this kind of building, because I do not really think you've done that like if there is no way to raise anything.
But let's say there was a non-complying condition, meaning that you know the use was technically not allowed, but was legal because it was grandfathered in once an owner, rebuilds.
You, know a lot of a lot of the provisions that this new proposal is providing is in response to constraints that were seen after Sandy, and the whole goal is to really provide property owners with more flexibility, sort of in the aftermath of a crisis or of a natural disaster.
That also include new constructions like high-rises, that like, for example, 432 park Avenue, where there was they oversized these structures because they made a maintenance space in the middle smack in the middle of the building to accommodate those units.
That I think you're referencing, where city planning proposed had approved a text amendment that would address developers putting inflated mechanical spaces in the middle of building.
Are you saying to us that everything you're putting out is optional, both for new construction and optional, both for people who want to renovate because I, remember, city planning coming before us, and maybe it was only those temporary flood mitigation measures.
We're talking about here are the zoning regulations that provide the flexibility needed to sometimes meet Appendix G rules on flood measures, so the building code does require.
You know, fixed flood mitigation regulations, and then the zoning resolution is providing further flexibility to help meet those particular rules and Appendix G, because sometimes that's good the way you explain it helps us to understand it.
For example, there may be a building with with a non-conforming use, so a use that technically is not allowed by that zoning district, but has been grandfathered in typically when a use like that is vacated for two years.
So city planning is taking the opportunity to add this flexibility now in the zoning for coastal flood resiliency.
Other thing that I wanted to ask about was the sort of protections in place for streetscape thinking about someone retrofitting a townhouse in Chelsea and they build one of those.
It, is really about providing the flexibility for you to use these options in a way that makes sense for your building, design.
I'm concerned about mechanical void, height, but that's been discussed, considerable impact on in historic districts, and there are some questions in the Q and a box Betty from Chris Lebron.
Zoning for coastal flood resiliency is focused on zoning lots, building stock and things that owners can address on their sites in terms of levies and things like that.
You know larger flood resiliency measures city-wide, but this is this.
There is not really much flood risk regulation that or options that exist today and because many sites require owners to provide public access using specific design.
So the proposal would offer more flexibility for the grading of the site so being able to create public spaces by the waterfront at higher grades, and you know, would allow them to facilitate resiliency measures such as soft shorelines, okay.
Yes, so actually parts of Chelsea, Elliott and fulton houses fall into the 0.2 flood zone as it stands now or in this proposed change in this.
Would these new campus and building managers have a say to activate this coastal flood zone plan and what that has that been put into consideration as to the loss of section 8 housing.
It tells me that if we like, if NYCHA were to move any or the mayor were to move any of these properties over to red pack, the developer would be able to trigger this coastal resiliency zoning to do what they please, with those buildings to meet, G and G seems a bit of a convenience for them just to clarify Chris Christopher, if rad or pact or any of those things go.
And Jesse's thoughts were that we would like a similar past when these city-wide issues come up is propose a denial of the of the zoning text amendment unless these conditions are included, and then we have a list of issues that we as community board.
What has what have those conversations been like in terms of how they're helping point this in the right direction, to protect historic, districts.
But anyway, I think what nimble is presenting is more sort of generic and sort of city-wide, and it's typically what you encounter when there's a change in zoning text.
There might be some ways of understanding how these various agencies would change their best practices based on the proposals that are being made in into HPD I would also add, as Kerry was raising the point of displaced garden basement residents, if an owner retrofits, a building to make it resilient to storms and that garden basement tenant is kicked out.
No I was just going to suggest that if you want to be constructive and say these are our concerns and come back to us with some clarifications that might be a way to sort of find a common ground to be able to approve or disapprove.
My experience, landmarks just likes to draw up close borders and and limit their involvement in things, and you know in my experience, developers, will come before landmarks and talk about the addition to their historic row.
We might want to suggest to city planning a zoning text, amendment that would, within historic districts, remove the option of lowering an english basement level so that it no longer counts toward far, which is the opposite of the direction that this is going.
So I would definitely propose a car route for historic districts, and maybe this is an opportunity to say that people who lower the basement level so that it becomes technically a seller and does not contribute to far that should not be allowed anymore, because you know, within this floodplain, it's actually making the building more susceptible.
If, I'm, not wrong, but that's the same thing, but I- think that you're conflating the issues here and that the reduction, the increase of basement height in historic districts, does not count as far these buildings.
You know all the incentives here to implement the proposed zoning changes.
This is you are substantially altering your historic district, building, meaning you're already going to LPC.
You can not use anything that I presented today as of right in a historic district without substantially altering your building, which means you're already going through some kind of review process at LPC at DOB.
But, it sounds like what you said earlier was that the flexibility that they get from the zoning resolution would apply only in cases where they're no longer talking about residential space, so they would not be able to increase their far, for example, if the building was still entirely residential.
About, the english basements, the 30-foot rule of dry flood proofed uses within the first 30 feet of a space that can be exempted from floor area does not apply to residential uses, so that could not be that could not be utilized even if the building was being substantially altered and triggered Appendix G, okay and the only other consideration is that the height, the height limit, might change.
And I, think that goes back to the Opt-in Opt-out like not really sure you know whether you have to or do not have to, but that no penalty will be applied.
Well, for example, somebody brought up flood insurance, which you know I think is probably the responsibility of the homeowner, but that is an increased risk in living in an apartment that is sub.
Let me see if I can help phrases in a way that so, if a building owner has a garden basement apartment and they get slapped with new flood insurance rates and unless they meet some sort of flood resiliency requirements to reduce their insurance, they come in and say all right.
Apartments, because they're in the flood plain, I'm not really sure how the zoning could provide protection when what we're trying to do is protect.
You know these construction issues that just do not necessarily apply to many of the buildings that are in our district.
Yes, because sometimes what happens is, for example, you know, Appendix G says you need to elevate your building because you're in the one percent flood risk zone and we need your building to be safe and resilient.
Then you're, going to be able to use the rule that gives you the 10 feet, additional flexibility to elevate your building and still use the floor area.
Let's come back, but when we come back, I would like some kind of proposed letter from us, as not so much from department of city planning, because they're not going to change too much, but they I would like some reaction from them on our specifics.
So we write a letter to city planning, saying highlighting these issues and impact questions.
Then, hopefully, city planning comes back and then at our Chelsea land use committee meeting we based on the new information.
We were going to get a letter, but it just did not come in time, but it was well received by the by the building.
