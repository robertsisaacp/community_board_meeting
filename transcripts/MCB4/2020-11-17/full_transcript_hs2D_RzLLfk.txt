Back here it does look a little strange does not. It looks like a music video from devo or something looks great I like it flying out of here and now we're not being recorded yet right. We are live on YouTube right now and there are there. Are you know attendees already in the room? So should they hear us they can hear us. They can yes, so I, better, not say anything strange! Then! Okay, I will that's no fun. That rules me out. I forget Jesse. How do we do minutes on this? I I'll handle the minutes. If that's all right, I want to, we just need. We just need a corman I think we have it now that Kit Tullerson has arrived, you technically have a quorum, and this and the speaker for DCP the speaker for DCP I. Yes, your your the plan for DCP is here, so I'm going to move her into analyst and what's her name, nabila she'll be on in two seconds. I hope I'll be a loser. Oh here it should n-a-b-E-E-l-a yep yeah right abeela. Are you there I do not know why she's not well she's muted. Can you unmute her I can only ask her to I'm here there she's everyone, oh hello hector. Can you rename yourself we're good nebula? Is there anybody else from your team that I need to bring over no just fee? Okay, great? Will you be showing a slideshow? Yes, yeah I have it you sent it to me earlier so I can either. If you like to I, can give you the option to share your screen or I. Can just do it from my end, and you can tell me when okay, if you would not mind sharing it, that would be helpful. That is fine. Let me just do a quick check yeah, so you guys have Quorum and we are streaming live on YouTube attendees from the public I'm going to bring over Mr botcher who's in the audience. That's all right with you guys yep does he want to be birthday? Maya Burlo is also there. So is that is that it sure yeah I mean your your. The speaker for the second item is here as well, so we'll bring him over when we get to that item. That's J right! That's Jay! Yep! Exactly so! If you guys want to start that's whenever you're, whenever you guys want to start in Europe, it's your choice, all right betty! Why do not you start because you're doing the first agenda? Oh Betty looks like she's frozen Betty, Froze, Presentation and vote on a physical culture establishment, and that is number two. So I'm going to just give a thumbnail on the first item, zoning for coastal flood resiliency commonly known as Z C, F R, and we have the pleasure of Nibila Malik to present from city planning. It's a proposal for a city-wide zoning text, amendment, it's updating, regulations from the zoning resolution that were temporarily created for emergencies and it will make permanent those regs and provide options to design and retrofit buildings and there's much more than just that. So we have a slide show and just keep gather up all your questions. So then we can have a robust conversation about it. So you're on nabila, before you start I just quickly for the members of the audience just to give them a heads up. If they are looking to ask questions or make comments on any of the agenda items, they can do so by raising their virtual hand, which is under the participants section in the chat section. You should be able to raise your hand, there's an icon there for that, and if, for some reason you can not do that or can not find it there's the Q&A section. You can always ask a question in the Q&A and we can we'll be able to. The co-chairs will be able to read it from there. Oh and we should just introduce Eric Batcher from Corey Johnson's office. You want to make a wave, you know and we have Maya Burlo from Senator Hoyman's office. That's it for elected officials. Right reps hold on I'm bert in attendees, I got ta, move him over sorry, and we have one other member who just says please rename, but the video is not on. If you can just name yourself, please. Yes, you have to either. Yes, please rename yourself or let us know who you are and then we I'll rename you. Oh it's bert there we go. Oh no, there's still another person, Mike, noble, okay, oh fred! Thank you, brad, okay, so we're all ready for the Cpc presentation. Give me one. Second, there we go okay! Does that work, for everybody? Is everybody seeing that? Yes, yep great? Thank you. Jesse hi everyone. My name is Nabila Malik, I'm a planner for community board, 4 from the Department of City planning, and I'm going to be presenting a summary of the zoning for coastal Flood resiliency proposal, which was referred out on October 19th. The proposal introduces updates to the zoning resolution, sections related to flood resiliency measures and options. Please so just to begin with some background here. While there are many sources of flooding that pose issues in New, York, City, Coastal storms present the most significant flood risk in terms of compromising human safety, property damage and business disruption with 520 miles of Coastline New York is very much a coastal city. So when we're analyzing the city's coastal risk, we tend to focus on the area that FEMA designates as the high risk flood zone the area that has a one percent chance of risk of being flooded. Every year, however, in 2012 Hurricane Sandy woke us up to a more widespread risk by inundating well beyond that one percent area close to half of the properties that are technically classified as being at moderate risk of flooding or having a 0.2 percent chance of flooding, were inundated in the two areas combined. So the one percent and the zero point, two percent, almost a million new yorkers, live at risk of being flooded by a coastal storm. As you may all recall, west Chelsea experienced record surge levels as high as six feet in 2012. and with climate change. The floodplain will continue to expand so by the 2050s. Today's moderate risk flood zone will likely be a high risk for flooding. Please to the wide range of challenges that come with flood risk adaptation. We need to pursue a strategy that involves multiple lines of defense, so the city's work includes coastal defense strategies, protection of our inland infrastructure like drainage and transit, and advanced emergency preparedness. But today we're focusing on the tools we have to help advance the resilience of our building stock excite. So this proposal builds on two zoning text, amendments that were put in place shortly after Hurricane Sandy to help coastal neighborhoods recover and rebuild quickly, but those zoning flexibilities which were passed as a temporary emergency measure are beginning to expire. The Department of City planning conducted years of research and outreach, which uncovered many issues that communities are still facing. The proposal now is to make many of those provisions added after sandy permanent and to expand them. So communities have even greater flexibility for adaptation. Ultimately, zoning for coastal. Oh sorry, if you could stay on slide, four. Thank you. So ultimately, zoning for coastal flood resiliency will help those living and working in the flood plain to reduce damage from future coastal storms be resilient in the long term, by accounting for future risks from including climate change and potentially help save on flood insurance costs. It would also assist with disaster recovery from future disasters, including the present situation with Covid-19. please so before I get into the zoning proposal, it's important to understand what regulations apply to the construction or retrofitting of buildings. In the flood plain today, there are certain things that are required for new or significantly modified buildings in the flood plain and those requirements are listed in building Code Appendix G, which is regulated and enforced by the department of buildings. Some of these building code requirements are based on the building's location within the flood zone and what the building code calls design, flood elevation or dfe is the height that flood waters could be expected to rise, plus additional freeboard or additional elevation for protection, so for residential buildings, all living spaces must be located at or above the dfe. Any space below must be wet flood, proofed, meaning it's designed to allow water to flow in and out and those wet floodproof spaces may only be used for parking storage and access. These buildings can't have any spaces below ground non-residential or mixed-use. Buildings can be designed with the same wet floodproofing methods, but they also have the option to dry flood proof and locate some uses below the dfe dry. Floodproofing means meeting specific design and material requirement so that water can not enter the building during a flood event. The strategy allows uses to be located close to the sidewalk level, but it can be expensive and especially challenging in locations with high water tables or high dfes slide please. So. The building code requirements in Appendix G started to become widely applicable soon after Sandy, when many were trying to rebuild and suddenly faced these new standards, the post-sandy zoning regulations, DCP, put in place were not were intended to make it easier for building owners to design to Appendix G standards without facing hurdles or conflicts from the zoning code. Since then, we've heard that there were still some issues that people faced when trying to recover our current rules, mostly assisted buildings that can be physically elevated, such as detached houses. However, they were not enough in assisting owners that had to relocate all living spaces above the dfe or over elevate the lowest floor above future. Flood levels also attached homes and multi-family buildings were not sufficiently addressed, since they must evacuate spaces below the dfe and relocate them on top of the structure, which is a retrofit strategy that requires more flexibility and businesses were also not sufficiently addressed, as they need high visibility from sidewalks, but also because many heavily rely on sellers or on being at grade for operations. So, after a long process of studying the floodplain and engaging with many stakeholders and the community, we were able to establish four overarching goals that help us move from sandy recovery to a long-term resiliency strategy. So one the floodplain community wants to be able to prepare buildings for flooding, even if they're not located in what FEMA currently determines to be the highest risk flood zone. Two people also want the option to raise their occupiable space a little higher than the current flood level that FEMA projects, because they have seen higher flood levels already and expect that risk to grow in the future. Three residents and business owners want to be able to invest in resiliency incrementally so it's more affordable over time. They want options like moving their mechanical equipment to a higher elevation, without necessarily triggering a requirement to raise or fully flood proof the structure. Four. We know that we need a way for the city to be nimbler and responding to future events that might require rebuilding homes or other forms of recovery. So now for each goal, I'll present a set of strategies that help to achieve them and go over a selection of regulations that we are proposing. Important to note is that these proposed regulations maintain optionality just like the 2013 regulations, so owners can opt into these resiliency measures, they're not mandated, so the first goal speaks to where the proposed zoning text would apply. These regulations are optional to help buildings undertake resiliency improvements. The proposal expands the applicability of the current text to a broader set of buildings that are also exposed to flooding in the event of coastal storms, so any lot located within either the high risk or moderate risk flood plains would be allowed to use the proposed special options for resilient building design, so the 0.2 floodplain serves as a proxy for the high-end projection of the 2050s 1 annual chance floodplain, allowing the city to advance resiliency in the longer term. Please. So this is a community board, four's applicability. You can see, there's more coverage in Chelsea and Hudson yards in Orange and the yellow is what is already included in the existing optional rules. The yellow is the one percent flood plain and then the dark orange is the 0.2 percent floodplain please. So this section illustrates options that would be available only if the building fully meets or exceeds Appendix G of the building code, and these are split into five separate categories so, starting with building envelope. These optional rules would allow building owners to physically elevate habitable spaces and other building support features above expected. Flood elevations. Currently, the 2013 flood text allows maximum height to be measured from the dfe. The design, flood elevation and the dfe is currently called the frce in the zoning text or flood resistant construction elevation. However, this is only available for buildings in the one percent flood plain which have a designated dfe in the building code to allow buildings in the 0.2 flood plain to take advantage of this rule, we will be setting a standard flood elevation of two feet to buildings in that point, two percent area, so the current rules a lot also allowed extra height in situations where buildings are located in areas with certain high flood elevations. This extra height allows buildings to have a more useful ground floor. However, we learned over time that it also helps with long-term resiliency. Today, building heights can be bumped to 9:10 or 12 feet, depending on the building's use and zoning district, making it a highly complex framework and because its applicability depends on the flood elevation level site topography. Changes can lead to inconsistent outcomes that benefit some buildings more than others. So the proposal would make those height allowances more consistent and equitably distributed. So more buildings can be prepared in the long term and incorporate c-level projections in the design to create a consistent framework. The proposal would allow building heights to be measured from a new reference plane that can be up to 10 feet above grade in the one percent flood plain and up to five feet in the 0.2 flood plain, as you can see in the in the graphic. So next I'll talk about ground floor regulations. This set of rules would help promote good, long-term resilient design and neighborhood streetscapes. So the current rule allows ground floors in existing buildings that are retrofitted to be wet flood proofed to be exempted from floor area. This helps buildings become resilient without having property owners lose a chunk of their building in the process. This proposal would allow such exemption to apply to both existing and new proposed buildings. The intent is to apply the allowance more consistently and support new buildings adapting to climate change. The current rules also include floor area exemptions for spaces that are dry flood proofed to promote active uses at the street level. So there are two sets of rules on your left. You can see a provision that applies to existing buildings which exempts the dry flood proofed space, but the buildings then have a hard time recouping the investment of making the building water tight, because the uses for that space are constrained on the right. You can see a rule that applies to new and existing buildings, which allows any space to be exempted from floor area if more than half of the floor is below the flood level, and so we call these spaces sellers. The problem with the seller exemption system is that it results in a squished ground floor with low ceilings that also ends up encouraging sunken ground floors. So, ultimately, these two exemptions ended up promoting buildings out of skill and ground floors that were less marketable and effective for active uses. The proposal would modify these regulations to instead only allow the first 30 feet of a space that is dry flood proofed to be exempted from floor area, provided that the space is used for non-residential uses complies with certain standard requirements such as minimum transparency requirements and internal clearance. So this would help encourage active uses close to the sidewalk level to promote a safe and lively pedestrian environment, while making sure that the resulting buildings are not out of scale please. In addition, this proposal would mandate a set of streetscape requirements to improve the ground floor level, design of resilient buildings. The proposed rules take existing streetscape requirements and make them more consistent and provide more design options to ensure that resilient buildings reflect and contribute to their surroundings. The proposed framework would require the design to include elements that earn either one or three points, depending on the elevation of the first floor above the flood elevation. So for floors, more than five feet above grade points will have to be satisfied in two categories of mitigations, and those categories are those that improve access and those that improve ground floor design. Please so to meet those points, the proposal would provide a range of options for a variety of building types items are split into the access and design categories and they would include additional options from what we have today. So the updated options are highlighted with an orange outline on the side, so you can see there's accessory residential use, additional fenestration entrances close to the grid to the grade level. Recessed access, multiple entrance points, please so. Lastly, we recognize that not all buildings and all situations would be helped by our as of right rules. Therefore, the proposal would continue to offer discretionary pathways in the form of BSA special permits to ensure that unique situations and hardships based on issues like lot shape, can get relief from certain zoning provisions in order to meet the Appendix G Standards, please. So the set of provisions located within this goal are what we call partial resiliency strategies. They will help building owners, undertake incremental steps towards resiliency without requiring the structure or sites to fully meet Appendix G. So we learned that raising mechanical equipment is often the first and most cost effective step to make buildings more resilient, so the proposal would enable more options for the placement of mechanical equipment above the flood level, either on rooftops or in a separate structure. The proposal would allow for a wider range of placement options of such structures, provided that they are not placed too close to neighboring properties and do not exceed a certain height. Please, a big portion of the flood plain contains businesses that offer either neighborhood services or are part of the large industrial economy of the city, and many of these buildings can not be completely elevated or dry flood-proofed due to cost or operational needs. But many of these business owners would like to raise priority spaces and equipment above harm's way, so they can minimize business disruption in case of a storm event through our resilient retail study, stakeholders identified that many businesses rely on below-grade spaces for support services, especially when they're a mixed-use building existing regulations prohibit most mixed use, structures from using more than the first story for non-residential uses, and so if the building owners decide to fill in sellers to reduce the potential for damage, businesses would not really have options to relocate the uses they had in their sellers. So the proposal would allow all commercial corridors in the flood plain to use. The first two stories for non-residential uses provided that there are not sub-grade spaces in the building slide. 28, please. The proposal would also enable different types of flood protection measures to be implemented. This would include allowances for flood planals and flood panels and landscaped berms to be considered permitted obstructions in open areas. It would also allow spaces used for the storage of panels to be exempted from floor area to enable on-site storage when looking at our waterfront sites. Zoning generally does not allow waterfront yards or require, or required, visual corridors to be raised to account for flood risk. Many sites at the water's edge are also required to provide public access using specific design standards and have little flexibility to accommodate best resiliency practices. This proposal would offer more flexibility for the grading of these sites and would facilitate resiliency measures such as soft shorelines next side. Please so now on to the final goal, which is different from the previous ones, in that these rules would apply, would mostly apply not just in the flood plain, but on a city-wide level. Please Sandy showed us how a storm's effects can go beyond the floodplain, especially regarding issues with our energy grid, so the proposal will allow power systems, including generators, solar energy systems, fuel cells and batteries to be considered, permitted obstructions in open areas across all zoning districts. Next, in addition to ensure that all areas of the city can easily provide ADA access, the proposal would classify both ramps and lifts as permitted obstructions in all required open areas to facilitate accessible design next site. Please. Another important issue is how disasters, especially those that require the evacuation of residents, impact vulnerable populations. Next, please so. The city believes it would be appropriate to limit the growth of nursing homes in high risk areas, to lessen the health consequences and logistical challenges of evacuating the residents of those facilities. The proposal would prohibit the development of new nursing homes within the one percent flood plain and other selected geographies likely to have limited vehicular access during a storm event. Existing facilities would still be able to conduct enlargements for modest improvements, including those that help with Resiliency. So Sandy showed us that a lengthy process to update zoning regulations can slow disaster response. The proposal would make certain recovery provisions available to be enabled quickly following future disasters, and some of these provisions would be implemented now to help address the Covid-19 pandemic and its associated economic effects. So currently immediately following a disaster, the mayor can issue emergency orders to temporarily remove obstacles to facilitate recovery efforts, but that process is limited to the duration of the disaster, which may not be enough time to address regulations that would hinder a longer-term recovery. So this proposal would include a series of disaster recovery provisions that could be made available through a text amendment when a disaster occurs. Applicable recovery provisions would be selected based on the issues caused by the disaster and would be available for a limited time period and that time period would be set. At the time of the text amendment, the provisions could be limited to designated recovery areas based on the disasters impacts and the city's recovery plans. Please, the set of provisions that could be made available are drawn from lessons learned from Sandy, as well as the current pandemic. Examples or rules in this menu include modifications to the damage and destruction thresholds to allow the reconstruction of non-complying buildings and non-conforming uses and rules that could allow uses in zoning districts where they are not typically permitted on a temporary basis. While these options would be included in the zoning resolution text, they would not all be enabled as part of this action, considering the situation we're going through right now with Covid-19. The proposal would include enabling two sets of rules to help support more predictable, long-term recovery efforts. The first one would give property owners who hold special permits and authorizations an additional term so that they can complete their original plan of construction on a longer term line on a longer time timeline, as some of you may be aware, special permits and authorizations have expiration dates, so this would provide the flexibility of an additional term. The second, the second provision would support businesses that do not conform with zoning use regulations by allowing them more than two years, which is the current limit of discontinuance to return to operation. So this is this is the end of the proposed changes. If we go to the and talk about next steps, so the city-wide text amendment is being proposed to follow the euler process clock. As you can see here, community board resolutions are due by December 28th and more information about the project, including an annotated version of the proposed zoning text can be found on our website. So thank you for allowing me time to share this update with you and I'm happy to take any questions. I may not have immediate responses. The proposal is being led by our zoning division, but if I can't answer anything I'll take it down and follow up before we open up Betty. Do you mind if I asked privilege to just? Can you go to page 11 of the slide? I want to see where community district 4's borders are, if there's a way that we can zoom in a little bit more on that, because, as members ask questions, I want you to look at it and think about the neighborhood that you know and how these rules might impact, because a lot of the pictures were from like Rockaway, Beach and whatnot, but I'd be interested to know if this zone is in our historic district, how it's going to impact Hudson yards, it looks like Moynihan Station is in here, so there's a lot of areas. That is there a way that we can see better our district borders here in the streets on there. So streets are not really visible yeah. Unfortunately, the map does not show the streets, but the blue outline is all of is all of CB4 yeah thanks, ready, Betty, muted, okay, all right! Thank you very much very good presentation. Now all committee members there'll be a quiz after this about all these terms. It's actually I find it quite daunting. It's a lot of there's a lot of detail. So why do not we open it up for questions from committee members I have a few questions, but I'll hold back until everybody else gets a chance to ask a question: you could do your blue hand and participate so or you could just raise your hand if you want I can see. If you raise your hand, that's probably easier. There's some hands already raised in the box. All right go there. First, okay, yeah well, fortunately, David's hand looks like it's first David you unmute yeah, I'm a bit concerned because the area that's affected. It does overlap with the Chelsea historic district, and you know zoning is traditionally sensitive not just to the ground plane but to existing rooftops and contextual zoning. So, for example, the relatively new zoning along the high line includes limits so that buildings, along 10th avenue, step down across from the Chelsea historic district to become more contextual in height with the historic district, and it's my understanding from what you presented nabila, that both height limits on buildings would be elevated and fars could effectively be enlarged when lower floors are considered no longer contributing to far so I'm concerned about what the impact might be on the way buildings relate to each other and, as I'm sure you know, there's a high priority, especially in West Chelsea, on luxury penthouses and views above existing construction. That exists. It's kind of like an arms race among the penthouses. Is there any kind of consideration in your plans for that? So what I'll say is that all the existing zoning regulations include, including the special west Chelsea district regulations, are all still in play, still required. The zoning for coastal flood resiliency is providing the optionality where owners can opt in if they are trying to meet Appendix G requirements, and so with that said, the historic district. Any building that would want to opt in to these new regulations would still have to go through LPC review as standard procedure right, but let's say it's outside of the historic district but bordering on it. You mentioned that the special west Chelsea zoning along the high line would still be in force, but it sounds as if buildings could now be taller by virtue of considering the datum line the base from which they're building upward yeah so buildings will they will be able to be a little taller if they are meeting flood resiliency measures. So that's you know the trade-off if they are producing a building that is responsive to climate change and trying to mitigate the flood risk, then, yes, that they can slightly increase in height I just want to follow up with what David was saying. Is there any maximum amount, they can add on say to the height of a building? So, yes, it's basically you're following the district regulations, but you can begin the height from the design flood elevation. You would count the height from the design at flood elevation, okay, just to continue with regard to the historic district. You know I'm particularly concerned about how this would impact areas like the Chelsea historic district, which is primarily made up of row house blocks, and one issue that we've had is that developers will buy these houses, which have an far of three by the way, and that you know is not too much above what the existing row houses embody in terms of their use of that they are. What they'll often do is to take the so-called English basement. That's entered under the stoop that is slightly below sidewalk level and they'll lower the floor of that to get the average volume of that seller that basement space down into what DOB considers a seller. That does not count as floor area and then they'll blow out the back and create a really outsized addition that begins to impinge on the historic rear yard space and just change the character of the block altogether. It sounds like the basement, not counting, as far would even happen automatically under what you're proposing in the case of parts of the Chelsea historic district that fall within the flood plain the two percent part. You know it's going even farther with the two percent consideration than previously point two percent, so you know. Is there any possibility of making a special sort of cutout for the historic district I? Can I can bring that to our zoning division's attention? But the attempt here is to provide consistent and equitable regulations that do allow buildings to accommodate flood risk, and you know, given that Chelsea was hard hit during Sandy. You know we do feel that it is important to allow building owners to have flexibility to meet these mitigation options. Yeah. You know not to belabor this, but one of the problems we have is that developers, sometimes from the far side of the planet, will buy a row house in Chelsea with the intention of maximizing its area and flipping it, and the Landmarks Commission often allows them simply to preserve the street facade and an entirely new building goes in behind and I'm sure that these developers do all of the calculations in advance for the maximum area that they can create and because the underlying land value has escalated so much here since the development of the high line, it's bringing a huge market force on the destruction of the substance of the historic district, and I'm just worried that this may contribute further to that I. You know what I think off the top of my head. Maybe city planning could look at those kind of cases and just see what the implication could be. It may not be an example that city planning has looked at in terms of the various housing types, so that's just my two cents about that. What do you think David? Maybe yes, I'd agree that they should do that and look at the envelope how it's preserved, but then how developers expand it particularly going down in the basement. It may not be an example that city planning has to is too familiar with and I wonder if there's a way of introducing an element of resilience that does not have to do with these spatial considerations and I do not know exactly what that might be. It might be a fun for rebuilding that you know could be made available to people. I do not know where the money from that would come from whether it would be tax dollars, but my hope is simply that it would be something that does not end up being abused by speculators anyway. Thanks for that question, David Marty you're next on mute marty, yeah. Thank you, Betty. Thank you. Nabila, for presenting a complicated set of a piece of information. I have two question: one angry and one curious I. The first is I looked through the materials that we were given before this meeting. It's extremely frustrating to me to look at so much information. That's not in my wheelhouse there's no way for me to take it all in a serious way. The presentation and the material that was presented to us is not targeted to our district. It is general for the entire city and those of us like David and thank you David for your questioning, have to narrow it down and try and figure out what is and what is not targeted to us. So the complexity and the the discussion- that's not directed at us and a decision that we need to make within 60 days, sort of really infuriates me what the hell we're volunteers. This is. This is way outside of our scope and I do not know what the chairs and what the chair of the board intend us to do. I do not know what we're voting for come on. It's totally unreasonable. Second question: what effect does the big U have on all of the information that you're presenting to us big U projects do not exist on the West side, they go down. They go from community board to not in community board two but south of Community Board to around to the east side. If there were a serious barrier built along the Hudson river on the hell's kitchen and Chelsea area that effectively would prevent storm surge from coming into our area. How does that affect all the gobbledygook that you've been presenting to us? So we directed it at the chairs of the committee I? Do not think it's your fault Nobel! Maybe it is I, do not know that it that the information you gave us is not targeted to us and the second question you can, you can deal with as well so I'll first just say that to your first question, about it not being targeted to see before what the information I have presented. This is a city-wide text, and so what I'm presenting are these general regulations that do they also do apply to Community, Board 4, so any property, that's within the one percent or 0.2 percent flood plain, can opt in to to utilize. These regulations of you know ADA access elevating above the floodplain. You know all of the other examples that were provided in the in the goals and what I, what I can provide is one. We have a one pager, that's a little more digestible. Just to give you a good summary of everything that I've provided a link to in the chat. I'll. Also right now actually provide you a link to. We have an annotated copy of the zoning text so that you can scroll through and see the changes and the additions that are being proposed with notes to help you navigate that so I will include that and then you know there were other. There were other rules that I presented that have to do. You know with providing flexibility based on the current pandemic. That would apply to properties in CB4 as well. To your second question, that's an interesting point. I think that you know there are. There are other flood resiliency proposals that come in to the city and I think based on those proposals, you know there we would revisit the text in case there are conflicts or redundancies or if they make certain provisions irrelevant. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Marty. Betty you, the two of you, need to what are we voting on? Are we voting on approving this entire set of complex issues is that is that what we're being asked to do? I believe that is so I believe that is so Paul. Do you want to opine I'm also going to quickly defer to Jesse on this? My impression is that we opine on the overall thing, but we raise the issues that we're concerned about, such as the impact on historic districts, the impact on floor area ratio, mechanical voids, raising height of adjacent property, to special districts. Things like that, so we are going to put in a list of commentary that they will then incorporate into their discussions further down the line. Jesse right I mean that's correct, I mean this. Is a city-wide amendment application it's open to every community board to comment for the next 60 days and how they feel that the application needs to be altered in any way, I mean in the past. You guys have done similar. You know letters in terms of you know. You know standard deny unless the following considerations are taken into account. You know so, yes, so marty I, look at it like the we did. The manufacturing zones allowing hotels, it was a city-wide issue and they had implications directly for us. So we did not. We voted against the change unless these conditions were put into place that addressed our concerns so but that made sense for a much narrower set of issues. This is a hugely broad set of issues and it would seem to me that we, because of who we are I, I'm putting nobody down understand. I'm really talking about my own ability to understand this material. We I think we would be advised to write a letter that does not approve or deny the zoning text, but has questions about it all right. So, let's, let's have that as part of our committee discussion, marty I think you raised a very good point, but let's have that as part of our community discussion. Let's get through questions from committee members. Okay, let's go to Brad all right good evening. Can you guys hear me hi? We can hear you brad yeah, okay, I do not like when we hear that we are being told that we can't put in senior housing or retirement housing in our district, because that is what our district could possibly need. Let's say we take that jail, that's sitting on 22nd and it becomes senior housing, and now we can't do it because of this act of trying to do something right, but in the end it creates a lot of wrongs right. Let me just clarify with city planning I believe that the proposal is for facilities like nursing homes, which are different from senior housing, but Nabila can help us out on that one, yes, but what I meant actually hold on what I meant to say is nursing homes. We should not be told in our district that we can't if somebody wants to put a new nursing home, which we could use in our district in the floodplain, and now they can't I mean this is this is not right. This is not what I would vote for in any means. Also. My second question is: what is the insurance impact you even created a bigger zone? Can the insurance companies now say you did not do this, and now your insurance is going up or we're not going to provide you insurance? What is the mechanism on that? So I'll answer the first question about nursing homes, so you're, correct, nursing homes would not be allowed in the flood plain, but in the one percent portion of the floodplain and that's for safety measures. We conducted research on nursing, home facilities and found that they're a population- that's not capable of self-preservation or responding to an emergency without physical assistance or staff. So you know this is this is really to protect vulnerable elderly populations that are in nursing homes in the event of an emergency, because it has been proven difficult to evacuate that population. It does not mean that nursing homes can't be included elsewhere in CB4, it's just to protect that vulnerable population from having to live in a flood plain, and thank you for that. Okay and the second question about the flood insurance. This would not affect that because these regulations are optional, so owners are opting in. If you do not opt in it does not. It does not change anything for you yeah, but insurance decides that a private insurance just by city, saying, if you do not want to do it, you do not have to do it does not change the way. Now the insurance companies say well, you actually are in a flood plain. You did not do. The brownstone did not upgrade and move their mechanicals, which cost a fortune up top and now you're going to pay higher insurance. I also would say to David's point David, just like the upzoning of the mechanical spaces in the towers that were accentuated with by developers. It's the same thing, that's going to happen here. We know this, it's just that's! No doubt it's going to happen. Okay, thanks brad for those points. Let's go to Mike noble well as usual, when David speaks before me, he covers most of the ground. Thank you, David, but I do have just a general question. Whenever we have these issues that cross both city planning landmarks buildings and all how much do you folks talk to landmarks when it comes to something like this? No we're always all over it when it comes to landmarks and I, wonder if you are as well yeah. So in the time of this the study leading up to this proposal and in developing the proposal itself, our zoning division would meet with LPC to discuss this to discuss the proposed regulations, the regulations that owners could opt into and so LPC is other agencies are involved at the development of the proposal as well as they have opportunities to comment during the in the environmental analysis as well. So we do not see that until the end, if ever and what do you? What do you mean? We do not see it till the end. Well, if there's any input by landmarks, there are no notes, there's no meeting notes or anything like that. Their concerns are not necessarily highlighted. Are they are they? No, so, typically in the development proposal, if LPC has raised concerns, it's usually resolved prior to issuing a proposal. Any sort of major concerns that LPC would have had would have been addressed before going out with the proposal, so was LPC involved in any dialogues or that resulted in any changes by city planning. I, do not know the details of that I could try to find out. Okay might have been another divisions, yeah I always you know it would be nice to know how much there are they're advocating for us. You know, okay, I think. That's mainly my concern. That's the point on that one, all right: okay, Carey hi! Sorry, I'm super new to this. So if this is a stupid question, I apologize in advance, there's no stupid. No, this one might be this might be. Are you talking about only new construction now from here on out? Sorry, if I missed that? No, so not just new construction, these regulations would also apply to existing buildings, so existing owners could opt in to renovate their buildings to meet some of these regulations if they wanted to so I. How so, as a person, who's lived, I guess in an english basement for 22 years? How? What are we supposed to do? You know I. Just do not I'm really struggling with this, whether we're you're in the historic district or not, this neighborhood- and you know our entire district- is filled with townhouses that have sunk in apartments and gardens, and I'm not I'm just like trying to wrap my head around it. That's one thing also: could you please provide a map, a better map for us, so we could see exactly what you're talking about and can you please let us know again where we can find the presentation you gave today versus the one pager which I appreciate the brevity of it, but it I do not find it helpful sure so, I emailed the presentation to Jesse, okay I did not see it in the drop box. I could be me there's there are documents, but that one does not seem to be there. Okay, the presentation was not put in the dropbox yet Jesse had to leave. This call I'll follow up with Jesse to have that emailed around. Thank you, and would you mind in that when you, when we get that sending a better map, so we can really see what we're talking about I mean this neighborhood is literally filled with three four or five-story brownstones that all have you know sunken apartments and gardens sure and I'll definitely follow up with a more detailed map for you to answer your question about the garden level. English basement apartments, so you do not have to do anything. This is if a building owner would like to pursue flood mitigation measures, they can opt to do that if they want to so typically, you know that might happen if a building owner is already deciding to renovate their building and then they would opt into this. But could you provide what that looks like for this kind of building, because I do not really think you've done that like if there is no way to raise anything and there is no way to build a barrier outside it's just impossible like maybe, if you so yeah so certain buildings, it won't be possible to elevate them or to relocate certain things, but depend you know. It really just depends on how much a building owner is looking to renovate. If you're in a historic district, you probably won't be able to elevate your building because it will change the historic character and it would just be too costly, or you know there are many constraints, but there are situations in which this greater flexibility would allow for a more resilient building. Amelia Kerry raises an interesting question if she was living in a building in the basement lower level, and she was in the one percent to the two percent area. Then if there was a big super storm, big surge is she vulnerable? Then, if she's living in that space, I mean she's vulnerable because of the superstorm, but in terms of zoning you know there will be flexibility in place of rebuilding. For example, you know this would not really apply in this situation, but let's say there was a non-complying condition, meaning that you know the use was technically not allowed, but was legal because it was grandfathered in once an owner rebuilds. The provisions would allow them to rebuild that non-complying space. Okay, I got it. I was probably being too much of a nudge about it, because I guess I, guess carrie. You have to run fast. Well, I! Guess, honestly, it's not just me, though I mean it's the you know, there's a person like me in every building in this neighborhood, so I guess I am thinking. What does that mean so that thank you betty, because I think that's a really good question. If there is you know, damage do. Are we somehow out of a home? Sorry I do not mean by the water I mean by the by the city and the you know being not allowed to rebuild or fix it. No, there are definitely. You know a lot of a lot of the provisions that this new proposal is providing is in response to constraints that were seen after Sandy, and the whole goal is to really provide property owners with more flexibility, sort of in the aftermath of a crisis or of a natural disaster. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Nina Hector, yeah, hi, nabila, I guess my question is: oh I have one of two questions so I'll try to make it brief. You're saying that some of the utilities like the air conditioning units or the boiling units will and some of these new constructions will be relocated to the roofs. Would that also include new constructions like high-rises, that like, for example, 432 park Avenue, where there was they oversized these structures because they made a maintenance space in the middle smack in the middle of the building to accommodate those units? Would not this leave an opening for that kind of situation again that'll be blessed by this program because of rezoning or is there somebody going to be looking at this more closely when they authorize these kind of constructions? Sure so that would not that would not conflict with the residential mechanical voids rule that I think you're referencing, where city planning proposed had approved a text amendment that would address developers putting inflated mechanical spaces in the middle of building. So this would not. This would not recreate that risk, because it's only allowing for mechanical uses to be located on rooftops and the whole. The whole issue with the mechanical voids where developers were putting them in the middle of buildings, was to prop up residential units, and so when you're putting mechanical space on top. That's not that's, not really an issue so yeah that would not conflict with this. Okay, thanks for clarifying and my I guess, my next question is: let's: is the city going to be assisting some of these homeowners? Let's say if they do opt-in because it sounds like it's an optional thing: it's not mandatory! Is it going to be optional for the existing buildings that are already here, they're, going to be grandfathered in as an exception or, and is it going to be mandatory for new structures? I guess Mike, it's twofold! My question is that if it's going to be in that situation scenario, but also the funding, are you going to be assisting somehow the folks that are homeowners with some of these conversions, if they're possible at all, because we're dealing with some really old buildings here, some historic landmarks actually sure so the so one part of your question in in addressing the the construction of buildings? This is not. This is not mandated. This is this is optional. So if you have the funds to do it, you can pursue it and gain this flexibility to mitigate for flood risk in terms of providing funding or support the department of city planning. Does we do not have the ability to do that? I can look into agencies that would provide the support, but I'm not I'm not aware of any offhand yeah. The reason I brought that up is because harborview housing over Brooklyn. They received a huge amount of money for from FEMA after Hurricane Sandy hit, and they have converted a lot of their generators and boilers to the roofs with that money and they created floodgates and all sorts of scenarios on the grounds. So that's what I was wondering I guess we would have to wait for a disaster hit and then possibly FEMA would step in and provide such funding. I mean that's an option. I guess I mean I'd hate for that to be. You know, after the fact, but I guess that at least will be an option for some folks. I hope it is yeah. There was money, given you know for after super storm Sandy there was there was my funding: okay, Bert yeah, I'm just very confused and I. Consider myself fairly, you know, well-versed and I. Have an ability to read stuff and understand: I mean I have a degree in city planning, but so what one I mean I also agree and I have some of the same reactions of my fellow committee members that this is generic. This is not anything specific to Chelsea community board four, and we all know that one size does not fit all Rockaway beach is not west Chelsea West Chelsea is not rockaway peach. This is not a nuanced piece of proposed. It's not a nuanced proposal at all. I also feel like marty is like this is a lot. How do we chop it up? How do we wrap around it and I still an answer to victor a hector's question? I did not get a clear answer. What is mandatory and what is optional? Are you saying to us that everything you're putting out is optional both for new construction and optional, both for people who want to renovate because I, remember, city planning coming before us, and maybe it was only those temporary flood mitigation measures, but I remember it was optional for existing structures but mandatory the new construction, and this does not seem to be placed in that same situation category and it's like you, keep saying, optionality and you're flexible and but if we're trying to prevent damage from flooding, why is it optional? Certainly, why is it optional for new construction? I could see old buildings, maybe grandfathered in you. Take your risk like across the street from me: 24Th Street, 25Th street, there's an underground stream that no one of course knew about until there was you know, overflow and the stream kept had been buried for 120 years, and now we came up above the ground. Okay, so you take your risk, but why is it what's going on here? Okay, bert, that's a good question for clarification. Can we cover that Neela yeah? So there's it so there's two things: there's the building code, Appendix G, which is mandatory for both new buildings and substantial improvement improvements in existing buildings. Is that what we discussed two years ago or three years ago? No, so what we discussed was the it was the flood resiliency regulations that are temporary, that are set to expire, and so this is an update to that. So the zoning, Regulations and Appendix G are separate. Appendix G is the building code and new buildings are required to meet those conditions. What we're talking about here are the zoning regulations that provide the flexibility needed to sometimes meet Appendix G rules on flood measures, so the building code does require. You know, fixed flood mitigation regulations, and then the zoning resolution is providing further flexibility to help meet those particular rules and Appendix G, because sometimes that's good the way you explain it helps us to understand it better. So you're saying that department of buildings, their code, G Appendix G, is mandatory and city planning is coming along with another layer. So to speak, saying that if you need some wiggle room from that mandatory here are some options you could take. Is that the way it goes exactly yes, so that was that was what I was explaining in the beginning of the presentation, and so once Jesse shares it you'll be able to go back and see those earlier slides, I have a second question: you had a couple of throwaway lines about and mitigate Covid-19 or what is that about good question bert? That was my question that I've been sitting on I, do not quite under I too, do not understand how hovid fits in this so sure. The way that Covid-19 fits into this is that part of part of this text. The goal of this text is to help provide flexibility in these emergency response situations. So with the pandemic, there are two items that this proposal is seeking to help with in response sort of in the longer term. So one is giving more time for non-conforming uses to come back. For example, there may be a building with with a non-conforming use, so a use that technically is not allowed by that zoning district, but has been grandfathered in typically when a use like that is vacated for two years. You can't bring that use back into play. You have to rely on the existing district rules, and so that use is gone. It's no longer grandfathered, so the proposal gives more time for non-conforming uses to come back and then two we're giving more time for applications that came to the city, Planning Commission. That may be running out of the 10-year time limit to complete their plans of construction. So, for example, if some, if a developer came in for a special permit that the City Planning Commission approved- and they have not finished their construction within the 10-year time limit because of pandemic related delays, this will give them more time to complete construction. Okay. So it's important to note that the city is still operating under the mayor's emergency order, and so these were the items that we identified that need more. That may need more time beyond what the emergency orders can give. So city planning is taking the opportunity to add this flexibility now in the zoning for coastal flood resiliency, since it's a city-wide text amendment and is already going to all 59 community boards borough presidents for review, but we're continuing to monitor the pandemic to identify you know what other items the city might need moving forward. Okay, thank you. That was that was very clear. I know you said it in your slides, but it took a wh takes a while to die. There's a lot of information in this slide, but I get it it's an interesting twist. It's sort of at a different level of discussion than all the rest of the text. Amendment yes, and would that be? Actually that's in the text amendment? In other words, you can read it if this gets approved, you can read it in the in the zoning text. Yes, so the link I provided with the annotated text, if you, if you peruse it, you'll, find that in there okay now I see brad, you have your hand up, but just before I call on you is there. Anyone who has not spoken, who wants to speak Paul, yeah I, just have a few questions. Nafila. Can you, when you provide the map for the district for us, with better clarification of where we're impacted? Can you also provide the dfe height that you forecast for those areas, because the question was asked about how much higher up a building could go again by gaining this floor space at the ground and then adding height above and I? Think it was 10 feet above dfe lines, but the dfe line might be 10 feet above where we are today, so that could be 20 feet of additional height. So to address the question of additional height, can you provide us a dfe line as well as clarification on the height added on after the building's built? You muted, let me sorry sure I'll provide that information, but so in terms of the dfe line. Basically, sorry, I'm just trying to find this slide where I showed that, while Nevilla is defining her slide, I just want to point out that Jesse had to leave to go to a meeting for his child, and so Paul is our new host. Now right so I mean I. Do not think necessarily, but you did say that there was in that graph. There was the 9:10 12 foot height issues, then you change it to 10 and 5. But my question is whether that's from a increased height water line so, for example, Hudson yards. If the water line there becomes 20 feet high at the flood and then we add 10 feet onto do, they get to build 30 feet more onto each of their new towers that are coming in said. No, so so there, the height is measured from set dfe lines. So, for example, the building height would be measured from a reference plane located. So if you're in one in one percent of the flood plain the reference plane where you would begin to measure the height from is 10 feet, so you would measure from the grade 10 feet and then so you would add 10 to the maximum height. So from current grade you add 10 feet. It's not! Is it not the new water line grade and then 10 feet up from that? No it's from the current grade, 10 feet plus height and then, if you're in the 0.0.2 percent floodplain it's from five feet so, but from existing grade not from okay enough new water line grade all right. The other thing that I wanted to ask about was the sort of protections in place for streetscape thinking about someone retrofitting a townhouse in Chelsea and they build one of those. You had an image of a seat, almost a sea wall in front of the property, and is there a height on those such that seawall? If that's a ten foot high wall in the one percent zone- and we have a whole series of ten foot tall walls on our sidewalks- that's not going to be a very comfortable neighborhood to live in, and so how are the? How is the street scrape addressed in this? Okay, let me see if I can share, if not I have your presentation up and I can I might be able to share too okay. But if you look, if you're pulling yours up, it's on p on slide 28, that's where I was right. Can you share it? So we can all see it yeah, it's going to be I, think Novella's going to try to share. If not I can yeah I can last like. Let me see if I can do it, I can do it right now, I think I. Remember the visual on that it's a little a little a rectangular thing there. It is that's it so all of Chelsea, every townhouse has one of these walls and they're all 10 feet tall. It will certainly change the dynamic of Chelsea. Well, how tall is that? That's not 10 feet is not it. No! That's what I'm that's why I'm asking how tall of these? No so the specifics of that are in the text and I'm sorry I do not have have the limit. The height limit on those, but I can I can look into that and get back to you, but I, I'm positive that we would not be allowing 10 foot going water if the flood comes in and it's 10 feet high and the wall is three feet tall. All those flood walls are just going to be overrun with water, and all the water will go into those basements anyway, so they'll be useless right, like does that, so I'm trying to get some clarification on that particular point as well yeah. So the point of this is that you know you can. As a building owner, you can find the design tools that you need. That would make sense for your building to mitigate the flood risk. It's not that you know hear all the options and you can use all of these, whether or not they make sense so it is. It is really about providing the flexibility for you to use these options in a way that makes sense for your building design. Okay, that does not quite answer my concern that somebody, some building owner could say for my sensibility and my safety of my property I want to build a 10-foot tall wall to protect from a 10-foot flight. There's no there's no 10-foot tall wall, that's permitted, but I can I can so you can confirm what maybe you can confirm the wording that would prevent a 10-foot po I. Also when I saw this I had a reaction to it myself, at least in our neighborhoods in Chelsea, where low rice housing you know. Maybe this is a big apartment. Building I do not know, but it would stick out like a sore thumb in much of our neighborhoods yeah again to follow up on that. The graphs that you presented on the front porches and the stoops and the winding staircases do not necessarily can't be necessarily addressed in Chelsea. We can't have winding long, porches and stoops. So the point system that you have for Rockaway beach is not a point system that I think can work here in Chelsea. Yes, and that's true, I mean there are different options in the point systems, and so some may not be able to be utilized in certain areas of the city. It's just you know, I know. I know. People are upset that you know this is a sort of more general presentation that applies city-wide, but it is, you know, for informational purposes. There are some things that won't apply in CB4 just because of the building stock that exists there. Those are my two immediate concerns. I'm concerned about mechanical void height, but that's been discussed, considerable impact on in historic districts, and there are some questions in the Q and a box Betty from Chris Lebron. Do we want to bring him in? Do you want me to bring him in or do you want me to just ask his questions? Well, we do also have a blue hand up when we get to her hand and then to Chris. Okay I'll bring I'll bring him over there as a panel. Just like everybody else. I have many questions, but I'll only limit it to one. The slide that you had there. Also when you scrolled up a little bit I noticed that they talked. It was a little bit about the waterfront, and that seemed to be a little cursory in talking about the waterfront and there was a picture with all the rocks there. It brings to mind for me the movie, the Spike Lee movie when levees broke from Hurricane Katrina. Instead of having to do all of this building type remediation, so to speak, why not have any sort of levees that surround even maybe just that waterfront or something similar to that part was not really clear. Could you just repeat that a little bit I lost some of it? I got the waterfront. Why can't we have and then I got lost, levees levies levees like it makes me think of the movie when the levees broke, having to do with Hurricane, Katrina and Spike Lee, where you could have something along that waterfront that particular waterfront presentation part was a little cursory. It was not clear what limitations there were to doing something similar to that versus having to do individual optional remediation on buildings. That's a that's a big U question or similar to it. I do not know what big U is. That's just making an association for those who know who know tui and I'll. Tell you about it anytime. You want okay, so let's go ahead. So this is. This is something so. Zoning for coastal flood resiliency is focused on zoning lots, building stock and things that owners can address on their sites in terms of levies and things like that. That's not something under the purview of the Department of City planning, and so that's why it's not written into this proposal. These are initiatives that other agencies may be looking into, but it's not something that's relevant to this proposal. This is about what flexibility do. Building owners have in order to meet Appendix G Building code standards when required, so that that's kind of outside of the scope of this particular proposal. That's not to say that the city is not looking into you know larger flood resiliency measures city-wide, but this is this- is strictly about the zoning resolution related to the city's building stock. Just as a follow-up on that, because it was a good question for the waterfront, it was a very brief mention. It seemed like it was a different topic than all the stuff about buildings. No, so so for the waterfront, when, when a property owner has a waterfront yard or is required to have visual corridors to the waterfront, there is not really much flood risk regulation that or options that exist today and because many sites require owners to provide public access using specific design standards. There is not much flexibility to accommodate best resiliency practices through those design standards, so the proposal would offer more flexibility for the grading of the site so being able to create public spaces by the waterfront at higher grades, and you know, would allow them to facilitate resiliency measures such as soft shorelines, okay, that kind of links it to why it's there I guess, in other words, it's relating to property owners who are near the waterfront and maybe in the future. It could be sort of clarified a little bit more that that's the tie-in anyway. It's not a big deal. I think somebody who has not spoken is Christopher. Do you want to ask a question? Yeah j, just one I, was kind of curious as to whether or not the community board's nicer campuses fall into this expanded one percent flood zone. Yes, so actually parts of Chelsea, Elliott and fulton houses fall into the 0.2 flood zone as it stands now or in this proposed change in this. In this proposal, okay, and so if any of these campuses were to flip over to like red pack, I know that there are larger conversations to make sure that it does not. But let's say hypothetically it does. Would these new campus and building managers have a say to activate this coastal flood zone plan and what that has that been put into consideration as to the loss of section 8 housing when section 9 housing is transferred over from knights at red pack, so I mean any I guess the answer is yes in terms of any building owner, including NYCHA, could opt into these regulations. So I do not know. If that answers your question. Well, it kind of. Does it just kind of said. It tells me that if we like, if NYCHA were to move any or the mayor were to move any of these properties over to red pack, the developer would be able to trigger this coastal resiliency zoning to do what they please, with those buildings to meet, G and G seems a bit of a convenience for them just to clarify Chris Christopher, if rad or pact or any of those things go through. The housing authority continues to own the property. So this is a good thing. Yes, but the money is put. The money spent on maintenance is through the management company in red pack. I'm not sure what you mean by Appendix G being convenient for them. Appendix G has pretty strict flood resiliency requirements for new buildings or buildings that will be substantially altered, and so that's something that's quite costly and is purely meant to address flood resiliency requirements that the building code has laid out so I. Do not I'm not sure that this would. This would trigger a negative. So my large concern is just tenant protections under section 9 versus tenant protections under section 8 and whether or not we will be losing houses potentially something like this. That's all! Okay, thank you. Christopher now we've got Brad and marty that want to talk and ask a question, but before that is there anyone else do not be shy. If you have a question that you want to ask at this point, so we do not forget anybody and I did not notice you no okay. So then we'll take marty and then we'll take Brad. Just I just want to say quickly that to tweeze question and I'm sure that Nabila knows that Big U is a proposed series of barriers along the shoreline that go from approximately 59th street on the West side to 42Nd Street on the East side, I'm not sure that I have the streets accurate, but you get the idea. Some of the projects are already occurring on the lower East side to create onshore and offshore barriers for storms, as I said before, none of them they're envisioned, but none of them are actively being talked about in our district. So there is a discussion about storm barriers along the edge of Manhattan. The slide that Nabila showed, of course, was from the Brooklyn side, and soft edges make sense there. Soft edges do not make sense in our soft water. Edges do not make sense in our district. Thank you. Thank you appreciate it now, I see by the visual. It looks like a: u yeah, that's right, exactly yeah, probably I would imagine. There are other agencies in the city who are sinking their teeth into that topic as compared to city planning right. My gut says that waterfront and parks needs to they spoke with us some years ago, and they need to come back at some point so that we can get ourselves refreshed on the state of what's going on good point. So what marty's talking about is part of the East side coastal resiliency plan, but you know, aside from me, sort of more regional types of large plans to address this. You know this is this proposal is really meant to provide these smaller fixes and options for property owners in these floodplains. Okay, thank you all right, brad! Yes, just a clarification: I know you said in open spaces. It would allow what the city to put in generators and backup batteries, and what does that mean? Does that mean a park? I'm just trying to understand I mean in Chelsea. It's not like there's open lots. Where would they put these things, so it would not be in parks. It would be in if there's open space on the zoning lot itself. Okay, I get that you get that brad yeah, so they're saying you could put a generator on the ground, even though they keep telling you it's got to be off the floodplain. So I'm trying to understand that so he's asking. How could it be on the lot when, if you're in the flood plain would not that generator be threatened by the storm surge, I mean I, think it depends on how exactly the generator or batteries or whatever power system is there is built, so presumably it would be flood protected in some way. Okay, flood protected. Somehow, okay Paul, you got any more questions. No I think that no so I think I think we're fred. I still see your little oh I can take his hand down. Okay, is he sure everybody's got their too sensitive a lot, a lot, a lot of good comments and questions. So what we can do is try to get a vote saying, approve or not approve or with conditions one way or the other, and this is what we want. It does occur to me that the comment period goes to December 28th, it's possible. We could talk about this again in December and then finalize that, or is that too painful I mean I. Think that I'd like to I'd like to try to tackle the marty's question at the outset of like what exactly are we trying to do here and Jesse's thoughts were that we would like a similar past when these city-wide issues come up is propose a denial of the of the zoning text amendment unless these conditions are included, and then we have a list of issues that we as community board. 4 want to make sure are included I, for one would like to hear more and see more, that's specific, to Chelsea specific, specifically to the historic portions of Chelsea totally agree, so we could have that as an issue that we want to see. I was also thinking. Maybe there could be a couple of examples of the types of buildings that are typical in Chelsea and what would be one or two or three options for them? And what would it look like because I'm a visual person anyway, we could. We could write up something like that as well, so we would need so. A big issue is wanting a detailed map or a better map of community district 4 and the flood plain boundaries right. The flood plain and you'll kind of like the idea that maybe there could be a couple of examples of how the proposed text would impact and I would have the answer to that. The question that came up about have you been communicating with LPC? What has what have those conversations been like in terms of how they're helping point this in the right direction to protect historic districts? Well, for historic districts, well can I add one more thing to that sure jared yeah I was waiting for you to say something. You've been awful quiet. Well, there's a lot, but anyway, I think what nimble is presenting is more sort of generic and sort of city-wide, and it's typically what you encounter when there's a change in zoning text. My question is just addition for the LPC Heavens will LPC or any other city agency sort of tailor their guidelines or their regulations in light of what is being proposed in the zoning text, something that we I'm not framing it very well. But what I'm saying is that these conversations must have been translated into some sort of changes at the LPC. Would they be issuing some different set of guidelines for well? That's, certainly an issue we can raise yeah. Is there any other agency that you would be thinking out? Yeah LPC is one and right is another. One obviously I mean multiple agencies like DEP. Definitely because there are the cso issues that sort of ties back into flooding mitigation. So there are multiple ways: how about HPD: they have a large ownership of housing, definitely I. Also, there might be some ways of understanding how these various agencies would change their best practices based on the proposals that are being made in into HPD I would also add, as Kerry was raising the point of displaced garden basement residents, if an owner retrofits a building to make it resilient to storms and that garden basement tenant is kicked out. Where what options do we have available for those displaced residents, yeah and one last comment that I want to make is, if you're talking about blocking the drains while the floodgates are wide open. So how does it Aaron? Could you could you do me? A favor talk a little slower because you're taking notes, I have to remember I, can't I can't write as fast as you talk. What I was saying is that we kind of discussing blocking the drains while the floodgates are wide open. So how does this change of text and resolution get tied into larger sort of mitigation and plant retreat scenarios? That city is considering or the sea level rise, and you know the waterfront adaptive waterfront guidelines that are being discussed at the city planning. How are these different pieces getting tied together, and that is not clear from this presentation at all I think I got it I think I think I got it. Marty was next marty, then David Denver. It's also probably not clear. Just to pick up from what you were saying: Baron, not clear in the text of the zoning amendment as well, because zoning amendments are usually not written speaking to other agencies, Paul I hope we do not write it. The way you suggested I think that it's far too complex and I think our letter should start out that we neither deny nor approve the zoning zoning text amendments. However, we have these concerns and the one we just heard is certainly one of them all right. Well, I personally think that if we, since this is a comment period and there is going to be a zoning text, amendment passed I would propose that we do in fact take a position one way or the other because to say we're not in favor of nor opposed. But here are issues. I'd rather say we deny, but we want to make sure these issues in our neighborhood are addressed because it's going to go forward. I do not mind that wording but I mind we deny, unless these are addressed. No all right, yeah, we'll find a way to word it. But if we address, if we say unless these are addressed, then by the time they are addressed, we approve the zoning, the zoning amendment and there's so much more in the zoning amendment than any of our comments can address so go ahead. So how would we? How would we were to then marty? Paul I used Paul's language? We deny the zoning text amendments. However, we have these concerns. Oh okay, just take out. Unless, however, we have these concerns, that's much more I mean that okay, we have not looked at all the things that we can't look at all of the issues in the zoning text. Amendments far too complex and we have not had it targeted to our district, as many of the questioners have said so even denying and then giving concerns is probably a stronger position than we want to take, because there may be a whole lot of good stuff in there that we have not been able to look at, but we're just we yeah, not much of it is for other districts. So right we can only. We can only talk for our district, so I think it's a good compromise to take up your suggestion. Byron did you want to say something else. No I was just going to suggest that if you want to be constructive and say these are our concerns and come back to us with some clarifications that might be a way to sort of find a common ground to be able to approve or disapprove. But you know giving DCP a chance to come back and explain to us how our concerns can be addressed. I think that would be I personally think. That's a good idea to see. Maybe they will maybe they won't, but it to come back. It would help us if they could come back fairly quickly with addressing some of our concerns and asking for excuse me information, so that would be. That would be very helpful to us right and very the reason why I'm saying it- and you know DCP will not be working in you know in vacuum. So I'm sure there have been many coordinations between various agencies and there might be some of these answers. Some of these answers might already exist, so we might just slightly yeah right. Let's go in the order that we had told everybody, David, Burke and Pamela David, okay, yeah, I'm not as optimistic as vieren about Landmarks kind of talking to city planning. In my experience, landmarks just likes to draw up close borders and and limit their involvement in things, and you know in my experience, developers will come before landmarks and talk about the addition to their historic row house and say it's all within what zoning allows in terms of far, and that makes it sound. You know it's even less than what zoning allows, even though what they've done is to lower the English basement, so that it does not count as that they are and they're adding on in a way that is, it's not appropriate for the neighborhood and they just point to the zoning, and it makes them look great. Even before this meeting I was thinking, we might want to suggest to city planning a zoning text, amendment that would, within historic districts, remove the option of lowering an english basement level so that it no longer counts toward far, which is the opposite of the direction that this is going in. So I would definitely propose a car route for historic districts, and maybe this is an opportunity to say that people who lower the basement level so that it becomes technically a seller and does not contribute to far that should not be allowed anymore, because you know, within this floodplain it's actually making the building more susceptible. In the case of the oldest house in Chelsea, not only was the developer going to lower the english basement level so that it would not count as zoning but put in an entire level below that would go back to within six feet of the rear property line for the full width- and this is I'm not reading. I'm not reading this zoning text measurements allowing that sort of activity David. So let's get some clarification on that now. What it would do is say that you do not have to count your bottom floor as far if I'm not wrong, but that's the same thing, but I think that you're conflating the issues here and that the reduction, the increase of basement height in historic districts does not count as far these buildings. It still does not count as far so if there, if it's already a basement, they dig out. It does not count as far if they're, making it more resilient and no the english basement counts as far it does, because the average height of its volume is above sidewalk level. That's why we're constantly getting these proposals, where they're lowering the english basement by two feet, so that its average height falls below sidewalk level, and it's no longer counting toward far. Then they put that far on the back of the building and we lose. We lose the backyard space and it's fundamentally unsustainable because it contributes to Urban Heat island effect. In addition, so maybe this is an opportunity for within the historic districts, to go in a different direction and say no more of this, giving yourself an far bonus by digging out the seller, which does not make sense in a flood plain, and we incorporate that change. Can I close what the what this proposal is allowing. So the proposal is allowing the first 30 feet of a space that is dry flood proofed, so it has to be dry flood proofed. To be exempted from floor area and provided that the space is used for non-residential uses, so this is really geared towards spaces that have like ground floor, commercial use or you know a doctor's office. This is not allowing. This is not allowing anything more than what's already happening in the historic, the historic brownstones. So let's say, I have one of these row. Houses and I've got an english basement and I've got a tenant in there could I simply dry waterproof, that basement area, move the tenon out and create a rear addition, and that rear edition could fall within the extra far gained by my new treatment of the basement. Well, no because this is for non-residential uses and typically those houses are located in purely residential districts, so you're not going to have a non. It's all residential use. Okay, so that clears that up all right. So let's go Bert Pamela and Kerry yeah. All you know all the incentives here to implement the proposed zoning changes. The changes by the sustainability, the flood prevention changes are physical and there's no, and maybe it's the wrong fiscal environment. Even to think about this. But to have this attached to some kind of program, low-cost loans, low-interest loans or something that would provide an incentive to implement the changes. So as I'm talking, this has nothing to do with city planning, yeah OMB yeah- and you know this is not the environment all right, but I, just I. Just let's go to Pam. That's it! That's good! That's in the right place! Okay, what David said basically in part but I'd, be interested to know what other community boards that have large historic districts. If they've already had this conversation and what conclusions they've drawn particularly CB2 and one would be interesting for us to know, I would think. What's what they're thinking is, and they probably would like to know what our thinking is about this I like to think that there could be some sort of carve out for, as has been discussed for historics, not just ours. On this subject, I think the discussion about the berm, the U, the great giant. You is a worthwhile conversation to have, because, if that's done and successful, then all of this conversation is moot. It seems to me and I- do not think 59th street on the Hudson is. It does not need to go that far. I. Do not think that I think it's just up as far as about 35Th Street or so the Manhattan's elevations are higher further north we're the most vulnerable and the village obviously and CB1 anyway. That's my thought: is there some possible way to carve out those districts? I can see that if this happens in these zoning changes take place. This is basically the end of historic districts, as we know them the faces. The developers will indeed take advantage of every possible loophole that there will be, and we need to be very cautious about that. That's all I've got. You know why the historic district situation so the historic districts, the only way a building could take advantage of these options is if they are significantly renovating their building within the historic district, because that would then trigger the building code, Appendix G requirements to meet flood resiliency standards. If you're already at that level of substantially altering your building to trigger those building code requirements, then you can take advantage of these options here. You can't just be like: oh I've, I want an extra I want a penthouse in my historic district building. I can use these rules no. This is you are substantially altering your historic district building, meaning you're already going to LPC you're already filing building permits, where DOB will tell you have to meet flood resiliency requirements noted in Appendix G. Once you look at Appendix G and you see oh I need to meet all of these requirements, and I need a little bit of flexibility to be able to do that. Then I go to this. These new provisions that give me the flexibility to meet those rules. You can not use anything that I presented today as of right in a historic district without substantially altering your building, which means you're already going through some kind of review process at LPC at DOB, all right, I'd like to if I may just jump in, because I would like to follow directly on that thought. I do have another agenda item, so okay, I'll try to be brief, but you know nebila. What happens in Chelsea is that people buy these houses and they demolish everything but the front facade. They do go to landmarks, they do go to DOB and they put in completely new buildings behind the historic facade according to existing zoning- and you know they work with the basement levels to get the maximum zoning they can. But it sounds like what you said earlier was that the flexibility that they get from the zoning resolution would apply only in cases where they're no longer talking about residential space, so they would not be able to increase their far, for example, if the building was still entirely residential. Is that correct? Yes, that's true! That's a good collaboration. There are. There are other flexibility options that I presented that they could potentially use, but only if there they have triggered Appendix G requirements of the building code. So there's a lot of pieces here. The piece that you initially were talking about, the english basements, the 30-foot rule of dry flood proofed uses within the first 30 feet of a space that can be exempted from floor area does not apply to residential uses, so that could not be that could not be utilized even if the building was being substantially altered and triggered Appendix G, okay and the only other consideration is that the height the height limit might change it. Might that would be elevated yeah because it's based on the decided to if they needed to elevate because of the flood plain, then yes, they would have flexibility in their height to address that. Okay. Thank you all right. Let's do carrie and then, let's see, if we can get Betty, can do a summary and see if we can't wrap this up some sort of sorry, I'm not sure if this will be very eloquent, but I'm just wondering if there's some language we can ask for that protects buildings or residential buildings, probably mostly that where people it's just not an option, it's just simply not an option to create what you guys are suggesting and I think that goes back to the Opt-in Opt-out like not really sure you know whether you have to or do not have to, but that no penalty will be applied. If you can't that makes I think that Nabila correct me if I'm wrong, have just clarified that the issue on the lower level is talking about non-residential buildings, correct nabila, so it's not your case. So only non-residential buildings am I right. So the concern that David brought up about the english basements being able to not count towards floor area. That is not true. That does not happen through these provisions, but these provisions apply city-wide to residential and non-residential and mixed-use buildings within the 1 and 0.2 percent floodplain. So then I would renew the request that, if it's impossible to comply somehow without displacing people that there's no penalty for that building, is there some kind of grandfathering? I, I'm not sure I understand that question. Well, for example, somebody brought up flood insurance, which you know I think is probably the responsibility of the homeowner, but that is an increased risk in living in an apartment that is sub. You know a garden apartment, which is how we always refer to it. But let's just say that there's a flood I want to make sure that residents who do live in garden. Apartments in Chelsea, which are all throughout Chelsea, are not going to be penalized if they need assistance from the city, for example, I mean the zoning can't control flood insurance rates. Right I mean the second piece. Let me see if I can carry. Let me see if I can help phrases in a way that so, if a building owner has a garden basement apartment and they get slapped with new flood insurance rates and unless they meet some sort of flood resiliency requirements to reduce their insurance, they come in and say all right. We're going to make this basement blood resistant, we're going to use these resiliency rules, it's going to create a vacant space and the garden basement apartment tenant is now pushed out, and is there any protection there I mean we're talking about the safety of new yorkers. So if there's a storm event and new yorkers are harmed in garden level apartments, because they're in the flood plain, I'm not really sure how the zoning could provide protection when what we're trying to do is protect. People from these natural disasters is Carrie. Does that help address your question better, not really I mean I'm not sure how to no I appreciate that I do not know if I'm phrasing it correctly, but it feels like it feels like a no well and it feels like there are. You know these construction issues that just do not necessarily apply to many of the buildings that are in our district, so I do not I'm not quite sure, I know how to under how to process this, maybe I, maybe I, understand a little better now, so whatever does not apply to CB4 just does not apply. These are these are options that are triggered when you have to meet Appendix G building code requirements, so if you're in CB4 and you are building a new development or you're significantly altering an existing building and DOB says okay, you have to meet Appendix G requirements, you just go ahead and you meet those requirements, but you can use these provisions that I presented in like pick and choose what's applicable to your site that will help you meet Appendix G. To do so. There's no penalty, if you're not using something that does not apply in your district. You just can't it's physically impossible does not make sense, is not cost effective, so you're. This is kind of like a menu of options. That's triggered when you're required to meet Appendix, G building code requirements. So I guess that I'm slow on this myself. So if the owner significantly plans to alter the building significant alteration, they have to use g, they might be able to use some options that are in the proposed text. Amendment right. Yes, because sometimes what happens is, for example, you know Appendix G says you need to elevate your building because you're in the one percent flood risk zone and we need your building to be safe and resilient. And then you look at you know your zoning regulations and you know zoning. You know, there's a height cap or what have you there's a limit and you can't elevate your building without compromising some floor area that you need to sort of recoup your investment in a resilient building. Then you're going to be able to use the rule that gives you the 10 feet, additional flexibility to elevate your building and still use the floor area you're allowed in the concern just to make it basic. The concern of Kerry is: would any of the options result in the tenants in the garden apartments to be thrown out? Could they is it? Is it? Is it likely or is it totally unlikely? Do we have to worry about that? I do not think so unless there's an actual storm that harms these people living in garden apartments, that's about as much as I can say on that. Well, maybe we can raise it as an issue to highlight it and since it's a little iffy and we can put it in our in our letter- let's so Paul I'm going to do my best here- okay, it sounds like Betty, your initial initial reactions. We may need to come back to this in December. Well, so we have to decide. Are we going to write a letter now or what I mean? It seems to me we're on a roll here. I do not know. While the issues are fresh, we can write a letter and there's and if DCP comes back and clarifies certain things better for us or if we understand it more or they change in regulation, then we can say: oh okay, we feel comfortable about x, y and Z. We could write a second letter right. What I do not know? What do you think is sounding like Dan's abort all over again Buddy? Oh, do not do that. Let's not do that. So what do so? Should we do? This then do this letter no I would I would like to have them back. Another time was much more specific, but we have, but if we do not write some kind of a letter, maybe it's not a vote letter, but we have to write some kind of letter saying we want to know about xyz right. So the question is: do we want to make a request of DCP for further information that is specific to community district 4 and we can list the few things that we've discussed and then address those at our December meeting and then write the letter for Community Board approval at the December meeting? We could do that, but I think we have to write something down and I would not. I would prefer to have something in front of me written to discuss our position, not sure what you're saying I, I'm saying you know I like I like that timeline. Let's come back, but when we come back, I would like some kind of proposed letter from us, as not so much from department of city planning, because they're not going to change too much, but they I would like some reaction from them on our specifics. But I would like from us from you guys something a proposed letter that we're going to send to the Full board right. So I think we have a framework you're saying the steps are to request from DCP information on the concerns about the historic district, the heights issues, the streetscape issues, the displacement issues. Yes get that information from them. Then betty and I draft a letter incorporating that information to present at the next meeting to this committee to vote on it at that point and I would suggest we circulate it ahead of time as well, and I've been put on it right. I would ask that we also ask for information about how this might impact the special west Chelsea zoning district, which was so carefully sculpted. You know the impact on the skyline, the relationship between that district and the adjacent historic district, because all of that stuff is within this area of concern, and it would be great if we maybe could see diagrams showing what the impact would be there as opposed to in a generic New, York location or a Brooklyn or Queen's beachfront location. So, let's just let's just clarify, so we write a letter to city planning, saying highlighting these issues and impact questions, and but it's not a denial or approval or an unless or whatever it's a request for more information. This is a request for more information and that to help us make a more informed decision at our December meeting right and a better map. I got that on the list. Yeah we have very what that would mean. Is that Mid-December they come back and they tell us what we want to hear, hopefully before that, even before that okay. So it's not going to wait until the next committee meeting. It might happen before then correct it early December. So we could digest poor nebula you're, going to have to go back to your boss and say that they want all this stuff that early December. So then we can digest it, and then we can not have such a long meeting right. What I was trying to say that taking the letter back approval letter back to the full board meeting might not happen in December am I right. No, it would one way or the other. We would have a position and we take it to the full board. We can take it to exec. It can go to exec at the end of December yeah marty. You had another question: no I'm trying to I. Thank you. I'm trying to I'm trying to process this I my original thought and then the calendar got in my way was that Betty has the idea of a letter and I would like to see that letter sent as soon as possible. That does. That means that it can't be approved by the full board, because that would take too long to send out I wonder if we could send out an administrative letter soon is that the plan send out an administrative letter asking listing all the points that we've made. It's just like you're writing a letter, but you make it an administrative letter and then get the answers to that the sooner the better. If those answers could be brought to the full board in December, that would be lovely, but it does not feel like that would be possible. Time is wrong too short. I suggest the very same thing marty, it's an administrative letter, questionnaire and I do not know the process as well as you guys, you've been around longer than me and bert. You could certainly address this administrative letter me immediately. Do an administrative letter requesting more information that information is given to us. Betty and I will work on a draft letter that we would then circulate to the committee in advance of the December meeting at the December meeting. We would discuss the letter which would have incorporated the information we received from DCP that hinges on you're, getting the information back soon enough for that process to work. Indeed, we're talking about our December meeting the committee's December meeting, not the full board I want to make that clear, but then we would not make the deadline we'll make the deadline, because okay I think we got it. Has everybody got it yeah? We? Let me I, do this administrative letter, all these issues that have been raised, I think the two of us took notes. Then, hopefully, city planning comes back and then at our Chelsea land use committee meeting we based on the new information. We write a letter that says denial unless or whatever or concerns continue continued concerns, and then that goes to exec so that it can get to city planning by the 28th, and it would go to the full board in January in January the only case from ratification, the only the only wrinkle that I would like to hear some consideration about is I. Do not I. I'm I do not mean to insult the speaker today. This city planning is not going to get back to us quickly enough in a month in order for us to consider this meant this well marty. That's their problem. If they do not get back to us, then we know what we're going to do it's their problem. If they do not get back to us, you're saying I'm just I'm just putting it on the table. If they do not come back to us by our December meeting, then in our December meeting we're basically writing the same letter. That says we can't approve this because we do not have enough information, they did not respond and we'll be very clear about it. We want to cooperate and we assumed city plan was cooperating, two hours getting drilled by us and I'm sure and she's got 50 of these boards. She's got to do so, I hope, she's, you're, not good, not the one going to all that. This is just I'm all yours, I'm all CB4. So I've taken notes as well, and you know I will get as much information as I, possibly can to you before the next meeting. Thank you. Great I have full confidence in you nabeela. You will do it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. We move on had dinner and came back already all right. What about Clinton's Hell's Kitchen Board I mean? Are they weighing in I honestly, do not know I do not know. I have to check with Jesse on that I think they have no floating up there. Yeah I think it impacts our portion of the district bigger, but I'm also a member of Health's kitchen land use, so I can maybe do a presentation to them and see if we can get some input from them to incorporate into our letter. So just I do not want to go over the whole thing all over again, so Paul and I will work on this administrative letter. You give us your trust on that and we'll show it to you after at some. You know when we've read it, we should it's ten of nine and we have one more item to go all right. It looks like everyone's nodding. Their heads are given thumbs up, so we're going to move on to agenda item number two. Thank you, Navila. Thank you, Nabil appreciate it very informative. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all right. So item number two: I've lost my agenda on my screen, so I'm going to have to just want me to read it but yeah. That's right! Okay, all right, 217, seventh, Avenue physical culture, establishment, mind body, project, meditation and fitness establishment. So this is a pce application. Basically, a gym betty and I did go on a tour of the facility and we have Jay Goldstein here. Who is the attorney representing Chris Dockel? Who is the entrepreneur so Jay we're going to leave it up to you and I think give a presentation you can share screen. Yes, I can try all right and if not, I can pull it up too. Let me know if that worked out. Well, it works. I can see it works because I can not see it. Ah there it is okay, so good evening, Jay Goldstein for the applicant I will try and keep it short. I'm here tonight for a pc on behalf of mindbody Project and Chris Stockel. The proposed pc is at 217 7th avenue. The building itself is a six-story mixed-use building ground floor, commercial residential above the building is frontage on 7th avenue, which is where our space would be located, and it runs between West, 22Nd and West 23rd along the east side of 7Th Avenue, hey Jay, it's our interrupt. Can you zoom out or in on your screen, because all we're seeing is some white. The top left corner of your map is that centered we're not seeing I do not know. Why so hang on a second, I'm not sure so, maybe Paul you want to try and share it and see if it works better sure I'll try to see if I can do it so go ahead and keep talking and I'll see if I can pull it up. Let me see one more time and see if it works. That's better! That's better! Okay! So give me one second I just unhooked! My second monitor. Okay. So again the space is located on 7th Avenue at the ground floor of the building which spans between West 22Nd and West 23Rd Street. The application for the gym is required based on city zoning, which mandates that all gyms have to come for a special permit before the Community Board and the board of Standards and appeals. The building, as I mentioned, is a six is a six-story mixed-use. Building the space that you see over here with the roll-down gate is the location of the space which is currently still under construction. Mind body project is a new concept in physical fitness group classes. The it focuses on holistic wellness, combining meditation and functional training, so you'll have 50-minute classes. The classes will start with 10 minutes of meditation, 30 minutes of body weight, yoga and trx, which I'll show you in a minute and 10 minutes of meditation and stretching there's no free weights. There's no machines. There are no bicycles. This is really just a mellow environment, focusing on meditation, focusing on wellness the space itself or the space itself. You'll see you enter along 7th Avenue into this area. This is a reception area and a waiting area over here there's this little areas very cool hammock, where people can hang out and wait for their classes. Since this is a class only gym, you won't have people working out as a in an open gym environment, so they'll be there just immediately before and immediately after classes, as you walk further into the space. Here's a locker room with handicap, accessible, toilets bathrooms, and then you walk further in these are the showers. It's a handicap, accessible shower and changing areas within the shower and changing area outside in a communal area, the studio itself, the space itself has one studio: it can accommodate a maximum of 30 people. The space is really guided and geared towards a yoga feel. So if you see over here, you have these built-in yoga mats, that'll probably be covered with a towel or some sort of other yoga mat and then floor lighting and these bands hanging from the ceiling or, what's known as the trx bands, you use those you can lean into them or put your feet into them and use them for bodyweight exercises. But as you see, there are no free weights in the space and they're not proposed to be any free weights. The space itself or the studio itself is built boxed within a box, so we took into account the fact that this is a residential building and that there are residents above us below. This is the parking garage but above us, are our residences, so we did do an extensive, build out to soundproof the walls and the ceiling on the floor so that it's separated from the elements of the building to reduce the noise that comes from the space so as not to impact the neighbors above. The proposed hours of operation are 5 A.M to 10 P.M Monday through Friday Saturday and Sunday 7 A.M to 4:30 p.m. Eight classes per day again with a average of 20 to 30 people expected per class. Currently, the space is closed. It's still under construction. Unfortunately, given the Covid-19 pandemic, they we do not really know when we'll be able to open. Currently, group classes are not allowed to be up in New York City, and we do not anticipate that changing, unfortunately, for the few for the near future. If there are any questions, I'm happy to answer them is Brad still on Brad you're, always the one that likes to talk on pcs, then you're that you regret that they come after they're open this one's not open yet brad yeah. That sounds like a mistake: I apologize, I'll, try better next time, but yeah this space, I, would say only one thing: it's vibration up the residential with the music and also here of hanging on the steel and that vibration going up to the residential I, get there's no weights I get that, but it's usually the music and vibrating up the steel up the building. So that's why we built this. As a box was in within a box as I mentioned, it's not. Actually those ropes that are attached to the ceiling are not attached to the steel of the building they're attached to this frame, that's within the space and it's built to absorb the shock of any of any movement within the space same for the noise. This is the same system. That's built for spin studios and the like. Our music is going to be substantially less impactful. Given the fact that it is geared towards meditation and a holistic vibe as opposed to that club atmosphere, you see a lot in spin studios and the other gyms that this board has seen well just one more third, sorry no go ahead, which we always regrettably ask later, have you reached out to the tenants in the building and if they had a discussion, and has this been approved? How was that communication bit? So we did this. Unfortunately, we had our walk through on Friday, and this question was asked us, so I tried to get a letter from the from the building it was presented to the building. The landlord that we have is on the board and presented it to the board, my client's here he can talk to it. We were going to get a letter, but it just did not come in time, but it was well received by the by the building. When you say letter, I'm asking was this presented to the tenants above and they signed off on it was presented when they come back to us later. We want to remind them that they did have a say right and I'm glad to hear that reach out happen because you've been in front of us many times now. I just want to confirm that Paul for the record, yeah, no I what Jay just mentioned: Betty and I both specifically asked about a presentation, the Condo Association, and if they could in fact the letter the letter he's referring to is the letter we requested from the Condo Association saying making a statement about this facility. So Chris, were you going to add to that about the letter? Yeah? Absolutely so we did. You know happily receive your requests for that letter from the Condo board. We put it in on Friday that request to my landlord they've got a lot of moving parts right now. I fully anticipate we'll get that letter back from them soon this week with confirmation that it's been presented to the building tenants and that everyone is very much aware on board and approves of our being there does that answer you Brad and then varen. You still want to come yeah. Just one quick question: is this a wood frame building I'm not entirely sure, but I do not I mean it seems to be. It seems to be a newer construction. It's a large six-story building that spans 25,000 square feet, so I do not believe it's a wood frame building, but I'm not positive on that answer. I think I can speak to that. If anybody I turn myself on here, hi, that's a building that was a series of buildings. There was a major fire there in the 1960s there was a paint store and a linoleum store, and the buildings were renovated into this facade that you see but I believe the original structures were retained. Underneath the facade I can't promise that, but that's my recollection is that it's a sheathing of the original structures. Yeah right. If you go back to the interior view, we can see the wood joists below the floor. That's those joists are artificial. We, this is it's just artistic design we actually well below the ceiling. Okay, I would imagine that at the ground floor above the basement, it would not necessarily be wood, but the rest of the structure might well be wooden joists and it's possible not to say that there's anything wrong with that. But that's my recollection and I've been here for 64 years, so I have a pretty good memory about structures, I'm so happy to hear that. There's, none of those weights that hit the floor that shake the whole block. I, have one question I see on the plan that you wrap around onto 20. You have access on to 22nd street onto the residential street. Am I right about that? No, the building, so you can see over here that the building wraps around to West, 22nd and 1:23rd our space is internal space. It's not, it does not have access. You do not have access to 20 to 20 seconds beyond our street frontage. Okay got it thanks! Any other questions. Let me see if there are any attendees left at the meeting. There are none still in the room. I have a question. This is true: oh go ahead: Tweet, I'm I! Guess I'm a little confused as to the footprint, because it's where the old jean store used to be, but then the arrow shows the site is like expanding to like where the subway is and you're talking about this picture yeah. This is these are photographs that we give to the board of Standards and appeals. So the space is the frontage of the space is what I'm circling here, which was omg, which you'll tell me that jeans I, believe you, when we put this yellow dotted line in the arrows. That's to show the zoning lot so we're giving the broader picture of where this space is within the context of the building, okay and then I guess. My next question has to do with Covid-19 and air circulation that studio. That's not a basement studio right, that's the same level, ground floor, yeah, ground floor. So but it's there's no windows. It seems from the rendering what's the circulation air circulation to be, is it going? How is it going to be yeah? I can speak to that. So we actually installed a brand new HVAC system throughout the entire space, and it takes into account the new regulations that New York State New York City have placed on fitness facilities, which requires MERV, 13 filters and we've gone above and beyond and installed something called bipolar: ionization, it's an additional air, filtration and cleaning system, just because we want to, of course, we know we're entering this marketplace in the middle of a pandemic, and we want to be able to tout all the measures that were we're taking to keep the air clean and safe. Okay. Thank you all right. All right, bye, baron thanks anybody else have any questions or concerns. This is probably going to be one of our easiest gyms. Ever then, oh yeah, one more thing. I'd like to go I'd like to make sure that they know that we have a CB4 website for jobs and if they have any jobs that they could post on our website, that would be great and helpful. We like to promote hire locally. Thank you that's great, to know, thank you for that. Thanks Amanda Brad Pam, so I want to know if you're going to be offering any classes for extremely elderly. Ladies with not very good knees, we have just the class for you. I can't wait. We plan to have a very broad audience and all of our movements are fortunately like we discussed body weight focused and we will have a sliding scale of modifications that can be made to any anything that we're offering. We would love to have a wide range of folks splendid yeah. Thank you just a quick question. On top of what the comment about seniors, what about veterans so you're going to be offering something like that I mean veterans are, of course more than welcome in the space I mean I personally have not explored, maybe some sort of some sort of program that lends well to veterans or affords them some sort of efficiencies, but I will take that and certainly give it. Some thought I like that, all right, so I'd like to Betty, did you have anything you wanted to yeah, I'm ready for us to vote. So I'd like to entertain a motion to approve this application for a pce at the address on the on the agenda. 217,177Th avenue anybody want to make that Brett Bert makes the motion.
