As Lol pointed out, the New York State, Urban, Development corporation, also known as empire state development or esd, is proposing a transit oriented development surrounding Penn station through a general project plan or gpp which supersedes the city's euler and overwrites Current zoning We're at the stage in the process where esd is determining the scope of study for the environmental, impact, study or eis.
This is our community board full hearing on this project and to repeat, as wolves already pointed out, the governor's executive order, we're holding this public hearing Remotely We have requested that people submit their names by noon.
One first, because I did not know if that we'd see before CB5 members joining us who were interested in one item, but I will I do see you there , Paul This is an issue item 22 on the rest of the agenda for the letter that was compiled, and I will be moderating that discussion so not seeing any further requests for comment.
, I'm, the first vice chair of Manhattan community board for this evening, I'll be running our public session as we do each meeting those that have signed up in advance.
A number of letters of opposition and support to a particular liquor license on the agenda of a place called the spot.
That will be talked about in detail during the business section of the meeting by the co- chairs of the BLP committee, and we also see the number of we're letters around concerns about the homeless issues we're facing in largely in Hell's kitchen, but in the district as a whole, and one of the things to Lowell's point is, if somebody says something before you your time at the microphone.
The last four years I've been living here in Hell's kitchen and last year, and I think this is relevant and worth Noting I was the head of HR for breaking ground, which is the largest supportive housing network, probably not only in the city, but in the United States.
These are poorly managed, pop- up facilities, appear, the quality of life has decreased, overall, and I might add that the tenants are smoking and drinking in large groups in front of the hotels without masks without social distancing, and it's something that the governor has shut bars and restaurants down all over the city.
I've been personally asked to give money to a tenant milwaukee in the street when I refused, he threatened to spit on me, as the residents no longer feel safe or comfortable, going out to eat or shop.
I want to remind the board that Detective Mike Dugan, head of community affairs at Midtown North, told me that in two that in 2020 rise bar six, three one violations all happened in the beginning of the year.
Sorry, in their later years, from my experience within the immediate vicinity of the proposed bar, my neighbors will have issues with noise pollution coming from the spot bar itself, as we have found living in an older building coupled with the spot guests who will congregate, as the previous speaker, said, outside the bar.
I've ran nightclubs for many years, and I want to make clear that ryze ball operates as a local bar and far from a nightclub which requires a completely different business model like much larger capacity.
Most of our guests are from Hell's kitchen and We actually know many of them by name most consider rise as their local cheers, because we do provide a safe environment for our guests staff members and our surrounding neighbors.
Do not think this is the best interest of the student staff faculty or the lgbt community, which is very heavily represented in our community board, and that's why I'm also bringing it to you I feel like when people are shrugging their shoulders.
I. Do not think it's a good way to manage public funds, particularly given that Cuny's public And it's facing 150 million budget shortfall, so This money would mean a lot to a lot of different people in the community, and so I would really like someone to reach out We could figure out a way to go forward with additional support.
I'm, a public member of CB4, land, Houston, Zoning, Committee, and I'm, also a resident of West 36Th Street between eighth and Ninth Avenue, and I'm, calling with regards to the temporary homeless shelters that have moved into West, 36Th, Street and West 37Th street.
I've spent the past several afternoons, walking the streets with Eric Bocher from Corey Johnson's office and members of DHS, the shelter providers, and what is evident is that we have too many residents too little space.
We represent many service workers, including more than 3,300, who either live or work here in Community board 4.
For the last year and a half we've supported chipotle workers in New, York, City, struggling to better their working conditions.
I just want to thank the BLP committee for their decision and encourage the full board to vote with them on resolutions.
It's not a rowdy bar I also think that in this time, right now, when we're dealing with so much blight, that's happening in the city, because people are literally leaving the city in droves.
The whole neighborhood is outside right now, As far as rowdy bars, I do not think of rise.
Three queer spaces are closing and announced in the neighborhood, and I'm really shocked that people do not want that block to be lit.
Get the homeless, out, and I will tell you that I helped to get letters and many people that I got letters from have small little children who live in my building.
We have recently gotten beat cops on the streets through the efforts of the House Kitchen, Neighborhood, Action, Committee and spot bar.
The, and the people that are getting letters are not from Manhattan plaza or the neighborhood.
I wanted to talk about all these homeless shelters going up in the area, It's really start to destroy the neighborhood I've been in for 30 years.
To get such a voting block, you know, And I, do not know where the Florida boss is coming from, but they're, not 16 seconds , I'm, just in favor of the bar, because it's going to light up that block, I jumped there at rise.
These are not just businesses or jobs for people in our communities and at the last full board meeting when they were trying to get the spot at the location.
Second, now is the time to approve the spot and help restore Hell's kitchen they'll, make the block safer and provide jobs to those in our community.
So I think one of the concerns that I'm hearing from the community is that the spot bar will have an outside impact.
Many, apparently lived outside of Manhattan, so landstown road was a quiet, local pub that had an exemplary operational record 15 seconds and one of the clear things that a petition like this tells me Is that even the owners understand that spot bar is going to have an outsize impact on the on the community.
I have a different kind of perspective, I'm, fairly new to Hell's kitchen as well as New York I've, just been very thankful to work for Tracy, Teddy and John as being one of my first managers and for one of my first jobs to make money in New York City.
I just wanted to say that the open restaurants plan has been overall promising for our street from having like a couple hundred people on our street to smaller problems.
Smaller, gatherings, I just want to note, there's been a related problem and we could really use the help of the Community Board and our local officials.
So people have been bringing portable sound systems stereos and playing music on their car to like really late hours of the night and like I, do not want to blame any specific restaurant or bar, but contacting 301 and 911 has not helped, and I've spoken to a lot of neighbors about the same issue.
And, so I know, Carl from the speaker's office, is out of town, but I'd love to do something with the neighborhood, as well as the Community Board and the speaker's office to maybe do a walk through to see just kind of some of the related problems that are still sort of manifesting, because we could really use some help in that area.
Does I think my coach, like my peer, said with Gotham cheer rises up this race over thirty five thousand dollars for homeless Lgbt, youth at the ally, New York court coat Drives and trinity place shelters, but the larger piece is a as a black gay man going into Hell's kitchen , it's great to go into a bar.
You feel supported, and I realize that security does that not just for rise, but for anyone passing by if security sees someone team second in need of distress, they actively jump in and assist strongly encouraging our communities more than just stroller families.
I, want to let the people know that I was the reason why I closed And I was reported the business of the SLA and got the license.
First off, I'd, like to say, ryzebar, has only had five noise complaints in three and a half years, 33 out of 40 tenants that live above rise of our support, the rights application and due to living directly above in terms of noise, we are having the appropriately security guards bartenders certified to make sure that they are over seeing people are not drunk I'm, an architect at building violation, services, and I.
Truly want to put my support behind theodore He's been he's been a pleasure to work with, in the last couple of years, trying to make everything legal and the most safest for the health, safety and welfare of the public at rise.
Not only is it quiet and peaceful and The public is protected, but making sure everyone is safe and with the limited issues with the neighborhood and the community, I think he's one of the most upstanding individuals.
I'm, the president of the Manhattan Plaza, tenants, association You know, 800 units in our building are acrosss the street from the proposed location of the spot.
I did write an extensive letter and hopefully you were able to read it, I'm, echoing Owen, Brian, Thomas and Amy. I lived on 36th street, I've managed buildings on 36Th, Street, The fact that the police and 9- 1- 1 are not dealing with the open drug use.
420 of those are south of 48th street in Hell's, kitchen 329 are above 49th street 137 petition signatures are from Manhattan plaza in addition to that , we've obtained eight letters independently from residents of Manhattan Plaza 33 of the 40 residential tenants that live in the rise of our building Are in support of this, including the two residents who live on the second floor above rise, bar.
I, want to tell you that also add value to our community by hiring people that live in the neighborhood.
I talked to Ted arenas yesterday, and he told me that they got the homophobic people living in the Manhattan plaza and they do not want gay bar in our neighbors They got 140 people from the Manhattan plaza who support gay bar and the neighbors, and I think it's really good for our community.
I. Think it's going to be a really good opportunity for our neighbors, and I want to tell that television has created a really nice bar This is a bridge and tunnel crowd.
We look forward to working with board for with our fellow elected officials with the city to try to clear up this situation.
Is that part of the reason we have so much so much trouble in this city with housing and behavior that that stems from people with mental problems that are not getting assistance and a whole list of other things is that for a couple of decades, New York has been operating on an austerity budget, and we've got to break that And I'm, not suggesting that people who live in this community.
Who've been fighting to get taxes on ultra high wealth in New, York , I want to say the Assembly Health committee, which I chair is going to be having public hearings in August on on the Covid-19 epidemic and its effect on nursing homes and adult homes and home care, and on our hospitals.
You should know that other parts of Manhattan are having the same darn problem, because these, in my opinion, these non- profits are not doing their job, not to mention too many people.
Hope 420,000 new yorkers have left so those are hard to chase and for those of us who are here, we need to fill out the census, I'm, not going to say more, except if you want us to come with an ipad, and you have a group of people.
Now, it's gone in terms of pickup with an Nyu group and others So community board members or the public is interested in working with us.
Board, 4 has an amazing history of understanding, affordable, housing, perhaps more than any other board, and so we're going to try one more time to list, at least for the bar of Manhattan.
So I know it's not the number one issue, but if we can figure out open space for these schools, you have a lot in district.
You know the ulip timetable is now going to be opening up again with the City Planning Commission and again we'll be working together on all those many issues.
Many of the issues with homelessness with mental health There's in our community We've got the issue with the hotels that I'll talk about in a minute, but there's the closure of the subways and the libraries and other places that street homeless people spend their time.
One of the major issues with this ban was that it was depriving refugees and lawful permanent residents from the right council upon being detained in american, airports, and I know that Jerry actually went to Jfk to see the chaos Firsthand and to understand really what it looked.
The second thing is on opening schools going into the fall, which I think some of the work we're doing dovetails.
We reconvene the Hudson yards construction task force with the support of the mayor's Community Affairs unit and Speaker Johnson's office, and we had got DOB and DEP to agree on a set of construction, hours, Acrosss for all the major developers in all Hudson yards, including Manhattan West, and those from my understanding.
The district office has been responding to a very high number of complaints related to the increase in the temporary hotel, hotel, homeless, shelters and continues to advocate, with for the department of Homeless services, to lead a monthly service meeting with all providers and community stakeholders until the temporary health shelters are closed.
As I mentioned, we've got a letter coming out of two committees on that What's going on those blocks.
There are a lot of things in those recommendations that we are going to pursue going further, one of which may be keeping that working group intact to address public safety issues going forward.
Group, Chelsea land use and transportation held a joint committee meeting and, as I mentioned earlier, provided testimony yesterday regarding the empire station Complex Eis. There was a letter about that for the business session.
Trust, that is it for the chairs report and We are going to move to the business session and first up Is the arts, culture, education and Street, Life, Committee, Allen or Kit. We have a letter to mayor De, Blasio who's, going to talk about this So a letter is about the forum that we had recently As folks know.
We touched upon that, but what parents and residents in our district going back to school were most concerned about, and we gave recommendations off both of the experts and What parents and educators told us one was which is a big deal for if everyone knows, is, live remote learning and the desperate need for it.
I had one thought, having talked to some parents, that there's great concern about parents who need to work and irregular scheduling in terms of you know, days of the week or hours But, then they come back home in the afternoon or something like that, and whether or not that's a factor that you came acrosss or not I'm, going to move on then to the business licensing and permits Committee, Frank and Bert hi, everyone.
We're going to people will call out if they want to vote against a certain letter.
If you are voting for this letter, you are voting for the license to be granted with the stipulations Jean Danielle you're on mute, Sir. They're, probably you know, 50 percent of the toughest and most community involved applicants.
I was also one of the people against and exactly for the same reason as Frank, which is, we have had a horrendous history and with these applicants, where they have consistently misrepresented one part or another of their operation and or not executed what they were supposed to do, and you know whatever they are saying they are going to do at this point.
Yes, I think the numbers are important, because if you have 100 people at Manhattan plaza, you still have 3,200, which are represented by the block, as was the tenant association, and even if you have 800 number in the petition, you still have 3,200, so we're still like 80, not in favor.
There was also some unresolved issue about whether it was even properly zoned for commercial space, but the other path that we heard at that time was that a place like the spot with its method of operation was unsuitable for this block and would likely change the character of the block, and that is still true and those arguments were made with respect to the prior location and took up about half the letter we ultimately sent to the SLA.
So we thought we'd write a letter One of our main concerns was that these hotels do not become permanent homeless residents without a full discussion community Board, so we thought we'd draft a letter, a general letter go to the executive committee.
I. Just want to note that in combining these letters, we need to update them, because from the time we met to now, there have been additional homeless facilities open that we've not noted the letter, so we should list them as much as further as I spoke to Jesse today, there's yet a new hotel on West 48Th street that is now housing.
Homeless, We really want to attach to this letter a series of pictures that have been sent to us by the local restaurants of what they are contending with in these blocks, because I actually did not believe it when I was on a zoom caller and have good connectivity.
We all know that it's a fact that most people who are homeless are not mentally ill, and we know that we have a moral obligation to help others and in fact, in this particular community we have several shelters We have several buildings of supportive housing, so we're open to helping others.
The second point I wanted to mention is that Dhs's position seems to be that this is all going to be temporary and trying to figure out the street homeless versus residents from the shelter Personally.
If you think about the entire community, as Brian Webber pointed out, that's about 35 to 40 percent of the entire resident shelter population on those two blocks.
Other amendment was fixing a sentence saying that we strongly urge DHS to rectify the issues towards the end of the letter, which I think was a great suggestion.
You know there are a lot of people making money off of the homeless, and A.
It's a sad issue, as everyone knows, but Joe, mentioned, and Is there any way we could get the good managers to take over some of the buildings of the bad managers, because, I think, would be terrible to move these homeless people once again or these people without homes.
Only looking for comments on the letter we've had these discussions multiple times at committee hearings in meetings with DHS, it's all been taken into an account, I'm.
, then I would just say you know, obviously as a board member, not only of the Community Board for but also of BRC, that I thank people for acknowledging that they're really good providers out there doing their very best.
Think the letters attempt this, but it just needs to be made explicitly clear that DHS is facing a mismanagement nightmare and there are too many times where we reference the pandemic and try to pit the homeless issue against the pandemic as if they're separate and competing the bottom line.
I would be happy to take it up at the next video and it sounds like a an issue that we actually want to really drill in on what we're looking for on those intersections, because it's not just about the people and folks using it.
All right hearing, none we're going to go to the joint transportation, Chelsea land use letter regarding the empire, station, complex, Eis, who's.
Given these baseline adjustments and for the second portion of the letter, we then went through and identified 23 specific tasks for the study that need to reflect concerns from our community and those include traffic, pedestrian, use, community facilities, business and residential displacement, open space, historic resources, water insurances and energy issues, amongst others, as well as questioning.
I mean Betty as co- chair of Clu, Christine and Dale with transportation and Jeffrey is our liaison to Community Board five and to the advisory council for Esd. So, there's still some editing tweaks that need to happen in the letter.
If people have comments other than minor typos and want to talk about substantive issues, I think we're going to work on some master.
I will say that this letter is actually one of the recommendations so, but we might as well discuss the letter first, because it's attached first The letter is addressed to the mayor and Speaker Johnson, asking for the creation of a commission that would include a representative from each community board to provide input to our elected leaders, about feedback concerns and suggestions and best practices about policing in our communities, and we think that it's really important that we have something at that larger level at the higher level and with our elected officials, so that it's not just about You know at each at the precinct, level, So we've asked for the creation of this commission that would exist for six months to provide feedback, and so anyway.
Our plan is also to circulate this to other community boards to encourage them to think about asking for the same thing to get on board about it, and then we also explain: we've added a paragraph in there sort of explaining the work that we did for the last seven or eight weeks, The recommendation.
So the way our task force worked was that we invited everybody to just start, throwing out suggestions on any topic to advance this issue, and then we ended up with a really long list, and then we said okay, but let now we have to start thinking about you know.
Thank you all for actually suggesting formation of this group and for actually 20 other people from within the Community Board four to have come together and really get this going.
You know to focus on community policing, practices, and so that's the letter that was number 25.
We fought with them for 20 years, we're working well now any racism or anti- We would go nuts, so who's going to represent the community board to represent our many different neighborhoods.
These are set of recommendations for the board that we're going to you, know, vote on to see to take forward.
It, come about through a number of sort of much longer list of recommendations, and just to your point, Jd CB4 is not insulated from rest of the city and the folks come in and out of CB4 as well, and they also actually form part of the community Schools in the neighborhood.
The Community board's voice with the rest of the city That's what this working group is all about.
So, there's a lot of focus that we're doing specifically related to CB4, while also branching out and trying to work with other community boards and seeing what other folks are doing in the city.
You know the community board has been offering like six or seven different kinds of trainings.
Think this letter indicates that community board 4 has a commitment to supporting black and brown people of color Again.
Okay, just a suggestion, I, think a lot of people were concerned about the four o'clock or whatever, and whether we should you know change that end.
, it's the new letter on number six and you have to enter that in your vote sheet with everything else, because we still need a written record.
, so I think that's the part that people are asking all right letter , 27 Is a letter to deny the application.
