Thank you so, as lol pointed out, the new york state urban development corporation, also known as empire state development or esd, is proposing a transit oriented development surrounding penn station through a general project plan or gpp which supersedes the city's euler and overwrites current zoning For the environmental impact study or eis So, this is our community board full hearing on this project and to repeat, as wolves already pointed out, the governor's executive order.
We're holding this public hearing remotely We have requested that people submit their names by noon today So we will call on the public I wanted to do this one first because I didn't know if that we'd see before cb5 members joining us who were interested in one item This is an issue item 22 on the rest of the agenda for the letter that was compiled and I will be moderating that discussion so not seeing any further requests for comment.
I'm, the first vice chair of Manhattan community board for this evening, I'll be running our public session as we do each meeting those that have signed up in advance So with that first speaker, jacob morris, followed by caitlyn moody and then george henderson, jacob morris, jeffrey A, number of letters of opposition and support to a particular liquor license on the agenda of a place called the spot.
That will be talked about in detail during the business section of the meeting by the co-chairs of the blp committee, and we also see the number of we're letters around concerns about the homeless issues we're facing in largely in hell's kitchen, but in the district as a whole, and one of the things to lowell's point is: If somebody says something before you your time at the microphone So with that I'm going to, let's see is our first speaker.
We will have some people in limited capacities in the residence halls, we're all looking forward to getting back to doing the fabulous public education which leads to terrific creative employment in new york city and throughout the world, and also the black students union about a month ago, put up a really powerful and beautiful and very cool mural that they chalked on the outside of the buildings that face seventh avenue, and it's about civil rights issues and police brutality and a very broad array of civil rights issues.
Can, you just imagine with a space twice the size, a crowd twice the size on the sidewalk, what the noise and is going to be like, and you need to do better with the steps in managing the crowd on the sidewalk I've lived in the piano factory at 45th and 10th for the past eight years and within hell's kitchen for nearly 15 years now, as a community, we had many issues with martini previously in the neighborhood which, in my opinion, operated very much in the style of the proposed spotlight in the spot club Sorry in their later years.
I think that while I would appreciate having a new bar in that space and someone taking over I think that myself and all of the residents here at the piano factory would be adamantly against having the spot there and I'm a manager of rise bar for about a year and a half I've ran nightclubs for many years, and I want to make clear that ryze ball operates as a local bar and far from a nightclub which requires a completely different business model like much larger capacity In some cases.
and I think we need to be mindful of that, and just in all the children walking to school every morning, there's going to be tons of garbage I also want to emphasize to people that we've got 20, plus new hands going up, and so, if you're speaking on the spot, I'm going to be limiting those comments to one minute I'm here talking to you, both as a resident of west 49th street and also a member of the lgbt community I'm coming to you with a concern It's, a 500 000, repeat, 500 000 award to investigate the long-term impacts of bullying on gay and bisexual men, looking particularly at sexual and health, mental health outcomes like trauma which hasn't really been studied very well in the past As you may know, bullying is not generally and it's important to get this type of funding from the feds lehman college.
A researcher for service employees, international union, local 32, bj We, represent many service workers, including more than 3 300, who either live or work here in community board 4 for the last year and a half we've supported chipotle workers in new york city struggling to better their working conditions.
There is no evidence that the homeless problem is going to disappear, because one bar opens up We have recently gotten beat cops on the streets through the efforts of the house, kitchen neighborhood action committee and spot bar The, and the people that are getting letters are not from Manhattan plaza or the neighborhood We wanted this bar, we would have done it.
You know I'm just in favor of the bar, because it's gonna light up that block I'm totally in favor of a gay bar in the area and as far as thank you, david I live on 10th avenue near the spot bar I'm, a frequent customer of rise bar and I can say with full confidence that is easily the cleanest most well-run bar There are a number of lgbt bars in hell's kitchen that have had to close because of Covid-19 therapy.
Ninth avenue have all announced they're closing for good, and there are rumors of at least three more These aren't just businesses or jobs for people in our communities and at the last full board meeting when they were trying to get the spot at the location next door.
So landstown road was a quiet, local pub that had an exemplary operational record 15 seconds and one of the clear things that a petition like this tells me is that even the owners understand that spot bar is going to have an outsize impact on the on the community.
, there's been a related problem and we could really use the help of the community board and our local officials to kind of you know, put a little pressure for law enforcement to come together and visit the block a little More.
So people have been bringing portable sound systems stereos and playing music on their car to like really late hours of the night and like I, don't want to blame any specific restaurant or bar, but contacting 301 and 911 has not helped and councilmember consanity's brought a lot of attention to the issue in astoria and there was a lot of attention about how big those parties were going and it really helped bring the sla over and a lot more law enforcement attention to that area, and so I know carl from the speaker's office is out of town but I'd love to do something with the neighborhood, as well as the community board and the speaker's office to maybe do a walk through to see just kind of some of the related problems that are still sort of manifesting, because we could really use some help in that area.
The sidewalk turns out you're running this neighbor Everyone has hell's kitchen resident here for about four years soon to be a resident of 54th and 10th speaking out in favor of the spot, I'd like to basically echo everyone's statement in favor of the management there at rise, and the only thing I will add in addition to that is throughout this pandemic and quarantine and bars, opening and shutting down I've been to as many of them as I can to support businesses in the area Thank you in support of the spot.
Does I think my coach, like my peer, said with gotham cheer, rises up this race over thirty five thousand dollars for homeless, lgbt youth at the ally, new york court coat drives and trinity place shelters, but the larger piece is a as a black gay man going into hell's kitchen , it's great to go into a bar You see diversity, you feel safe, You feel supported and I realize that security does that not just for rise, but for anyone passing by if security sees someone team second in need of distress, they actively jump in and assist strongly encouraging our communities more than just stroller families.
Some of the other premium seconds that people were worried about is the sound outside First off I'd, like to say, ryzebar has only had five noise complaints in three and a half years, 33 out of 40 tenants that live above rise of our support, the rights application and due to living directly above in terms of noise , we are having the appropriately security guards.
Bartenders certified to make sure that they are over seeing people are not drunk Giving my daughter we're going to move on to the next speaker, I'm, an architect at building violation, services and I truly want to put my support behind theodore he's been he's been a pleasure to work with, in the last couple of years, trying to make everything legal and the most safest for the health, safety and welfare of the public at rise bar and I mean a lot of our discussions is about going up and beyond even just the minimum code requirements of making sure the public is protected, but making sure everyone is safe and with the limited issues with the neighborhood and the community I've worked with in the hospitality industry, so I do want to put our entire office's support behind him and his venture and he's an utmost standing citizen that would do right by the community in that area, beyond just keeping it safe and protected for the community.
During the business session of the meeting, So people know that as well, rashaan james, followed by will schwartz and donald bernstein rashan I am a resident of Manhattan, plaza and I would be very excited to have a gay bar in that space after lansdowne has left us, but I also wanted to speak about being a Manhattan, plaza, resident and debunk.
That may have been true 10 years ago, maybe 15 years ago, but we have a new crop of people who live here who are not inundated with the things that people who are older than us You believe that anyone who has said I speak for all tenants at Manhattan plaza is a person who has a voice I'm going to jump in for one second here , The Manhattan plaza has a tenants association that is elected by the residents of the building.
In addition to that, we've obtained eight letters independently from residents of Manhattan plaza 33 of the 40 residential tenants that live in the rise of our building are in support of this, including the two residents who live on the second floor above rise bar The blp committee was not very excited about that.
I talked to ted arenas yesterday and he told me that they got the homophobic people living in the Manhattan plaza and they don't want gay bar in our neighbors and they got 140 people from the Manhattan plaza who support gay bar and the neighbors and I think it's really good for our community I'd like to join with to everything what was said before about this about the rice bar and all the bars was operated by generally 15 seconds.
We hear that there are 2 000 hotel residents that have been moved into the district and I don't, and we look forward to working with board for with our fellow elected officials with the city to try to clear up this situation.
Is that part of the reason we have so much so much trouble in this city with housing and behavior that that stems from people with mental problems that are not getting assistance and a whole list of other things is that for a couple of decades, new york has been operating on an austerity budget and we've got to break that and I'm not suggesting that people who live in this community.
mr chair and I- want to follow up 51st street to talk to john mandel and I'll be glad to go back with the community board and other electives and we'll work on it number two regarding the penn station and what we call the gpp, which is the way in which the governor does the eulip and It's a state mandated task force, and we will be making our comments before august.
You should know that other parts of Manhattan are having the same darn problem, because these, in my opinion, these non-profits are not doing their job, not to mention too many people We are going to be listing for department of homeless services, a whole bunch of situations and owen sweeney I'd be glad to meet with you.
4 has an amazing history of understanding, affordable, housing, perhaps more than any other board, and so we're going to try one more time to list, at least for the bar of Manhattan An affordable housing program should look like I want to just say in terms of black lives matter, there's lots of discuss, but we did do a mural.
Greater new york also worked with us 'm, not actually trying to call every school in the borough of man, and they said you know if a child hasn't learned in the past and temporary housing is overcrowded and wants to come in five days.
So I know it's not the number one issue, but if we can figure out open space for these schools, you have a lot in district I think everybody gets it, but if there are people who are listening, who don't just know, it's really a fabulous newsletter?
Four lowell kern helped get a sizable contribution from the hudson yards house, kitchen bid and we've been purchasing food from trader joe's and distributing at it at public housing and others Many of the issues with homelessness with mental health there's in our community we've got the issue with the hotels that I'll talk about in a minute, but there's the closure of the subways and the libraries and other places that street homeless people spend their time.
That's really forced them out into the community for us to see There's the population of Rikers, which you know Rikers for many years, has been serving as de facto housing for people with mental illness and we've always struggled with these issues during the summer Now it's just more acute than ever, and then you have the fact that many parts of town where people would panhandle for a living are no longer populated with people all the tourists that are gone So. We have people coming to neighborhoods where there's people, so we've had a lot of issue with panhandling, and particularly at the restaurants where people are sitting outside, which is an amazing thing.
We had a meeting today on 36 with brian weber who lives on the block and christine bertay who lives a couple blocks away and the owners of tovola and all the operators of these hotels, and it was very clear to us who was doing a good job and who wasn't so Who's, been working with us on that and to all the residents on 36th street who reached out We know that will come out of this crisis as a city.
We're happy to have you get kerry is going to be on blp and chelsea land use, Cb4 executive committee members have attended and continue to attend multiple meetings with our elected reps and the department of homeless services regarding all of the temporary hotel shelters in our district, including those on west 36th, west 37th, west 42nd, west 51st, west 57th and the aladdin hotel on west 45th We've got a letter coming out of two committees on that What's going on those blocks.
The protests that followed the death of george floyd I want to single out christine bertay, dolores ruben, katie, stokes and vieren brahma, who attended the four precinct meetings for the precincts that represent the cover community district for the 10th, the 13th midtown north and midtown south As. We formed a social justice working group that group met every tuesday in june and july and have drafted both a letter to the mayor and a number of recommendations which we will be dealing with in the business session.
Thank you to bert, and the various committee chairs that make up that working group, chelsea, land use and transportation held a joint committee meeting and, as I mentioned earlier, provided testimony yesterday regarding the empire station complex eis, there was a letter about that for the business session.
I think it's a terrific letter I had one thought, having talked to some parents that there's great concern about parents who need to work and irregular scheduling in terms of you know, days of the week or hours, but then they come back home in the afternoon or something like that, and whether or not that's a factor that you came across or not it's just the effect on the schedule for parents I'm going to move on then to the business licensing and permits committee, frank and bert hi.
, some of them you've heard about martini rise bar and perhaps most egregiously, the xl nightclub in the basement of the out hotel, I, don't think xl ever got straightened out and was ultimately closed down by the police and the sla as things get out of control So, you know, I find it hard to weigh you know who in the community, is more forward and more against it, but my opposition really came to what I've lived through with these operators and trying to work out their problems with their prior operations.
I was also one of the people against and exactly for the same reason as frank, which is, we have had a horrendous history and with these applicants, where they have consistently misrepresented one part or another of their operation and or not executed what they were supposed to do, and you know whatever they are saying they are going to do at this point: I'm not trying to qualify the operators I'm trying to say that their operation has been really sloppy and very I mean people spend hours, fighting that and people couldn't sleep, etc, and that's not good The second thing I want to point out is that generally I like to rely on the people who live right around an operation and our goal is to really make sure that those people coexist and cohabit with the operator in a good way and therefore, if the people right around the corner are not supportive, I would have a tendency to be to go with them.
So I just wanted to reiterate what I said the last time about this applicant since I happen to live pretty close to the rise bar and do patronize that establishment of pheromone You know I found it to be an operation that is pretty clean inside as well as on the sidewalk You know they do always have security personnel I mean as far as in my experience there, and you know, as far as I can tell it seems like a lot of the ordinances, including with the outdoor seating, have been followed, and you know I think it's also important to bring up the last discussion that we had around their last application.
Space There was also some unresolved issue about whether it was even properly zoned for commercial space, but the other path that we heard at that time was that a place like the spot with its method of operation was unsuitable for this block and would likely change the character of the block, and that is still true and those arguments were made with respect to the prior location and took up about half the letter we ultimately sent to the sla It seems like this was a bar space before going to be a bar space now, but it's on the same block, As I understand it are you know large crowds entering and leaving hanging out on the sidewalk , maybe lines to get in and generally a more boisterous crowd, perhaps than frequented lands down road, and since these storefronts are side by side, the effect on the street would be the same from both locations.
One of our main concerns was that these hotels do not become permanent homeless residents without a full discussion community board So, we thought we'd draft a letter.
There was no executive committee, so we thought we'd bring it to the board meeting It's a bare bones letter because we figured everybody's going to add all kinds of things : Subsequently there was a health and human services letter on the same topic, so I think it's a good idea to combine them and I think our main concern was to hold dhs to give them some specific I just want to note that in combining these letters we need to update them because from the time we met to now, there have been additional homeless facilities open that we've not noted the letter, so we should list them as much as further as I spoke to jesse today, there's yet a new hotel on west 48th street that is now housing homeless.
The second point I wanted to mention is that dhs's position seems to be that this is all going to be temporary and trying to figure out the street homeless versus residents from the shelter Personally.
The realtors have a predominance of mentally ill chemically addicted people in them that were relocated here, that's one of our problems, so we have density of people with serious social service problems and the setting they were in which gave them support is now totally not there, although some of them there's lots of staff at the same time, so that that's what's so disturbing here and they're, acting as if they're, not in a series of small rooms and people who are truly profoundly decompensating, meaning they're having mental, have a mental illness and they're breaking down that it doesn't work if you're not being connected with and talked to and engaged with by case management, all the time So, that's our problem here they got taken out of a certain location that was set up to treat and manage the circumstances and now they're in a hotel and thrown on a block and I watch people just they are All new people, they're, not our street homeless whatsoever.
I'm going to the waterfront parks and environment committee jeffrey and marty There are four letters to the parks department requesting a replacement of the track at chelsea park, one to hudson river park, trust regarding the chelsea waterside park, redesign of which we're all very excited about, but provided some important critiques and comments, a letter to the city's economic development corporation and our elected officials regarding a lack of public space and a very dangerous situation around the Manhattan cruise terminal access way, I'm, including extending the invitation to them at our september wpe meeting and finally, a letter to NYPD state, DOT and parks around on the hudson river greenway and the placement of the what sugar cubes and how they pose overdue danger, an overdue burden and danger on cyclists that need to be permanently addressed.
So you want to take that up at the next meeting, or you want to just I would be happy to take it up at the next video, and it sounds like a an issue that we actually want to really drill in on what we're looking for on those intersections, because it's not just about the people and folks using it and I think that can be tied to a really important ask about making the greenway safer for everybody, okay, cool Thank, you any other questions on the wpe letters moving to transportation, christine and dale letters 14 through 21 Second, we're not bundling, because we're vote, we're bundling everything!
Fifth is that homelessness issues, as we just discussed, are not going away anytime soon, they must be studied and on-site mitigation must be proposed and, sixth, the transportation and public realm plan envisioned in the project must be studied from a pedestrian commuter and micro mobility, Point of view, rather than a car-centric perspective Given these baseline adjustments and for the second portion of the letter, we then went through and identified 23 specific tasks for the study that need to reflect concerns from our community and those include traffic, pedestrian use, community facilities, business and residential displacement, open space, historic resources, water insurances and energy issues, amongst others, as well as questioning.
We also unquestion the underlying funding mechanisms for the entire development and then in the third step, Besides the proposed plan and a no action plan, and so we for the third part of the letter, include recommendations for five different alternatives, which include one an alternative with decreased far: two, an alternative with the relocation of madison square garden, three, an alternative with residential components on site, one, four, an alternative with a connection to grand central station using the new east side, access or other amtrak projects and five, an alternative implementing non-paired through service of lirr to see caucus and new jersey, transit to sunnyside I mean betty as co-chair of clu, christine and dale with transportation and jeffrey is our liaison to community board five and to the advisory council for esd, so the without those guys.
So there's still some editing tweaks that need to happen in the letter If people have comments other than minor typos and want to talk about substantive issues, I think we're going to work on some master plan.
Thank you all for actually suggesting formation of this group and for actually 20 other people from within the community board four to have come together and really get this going.
You know to focus on community policing practices, and so that's the letter that was number 25 We are not going to re-litigate the entire subject of social justice right now.
They have the build your block meetings, I'm, not sure it's monthly, but I think it's maybe four times a year where there's a very healthy interaction and I think we just need more people to come to those meetings to get face-to-face time with police officers A lot of this I only got this letter this morning.
An amendment on that letter just a suggestion, I think a lot of people were concerned about the four o'clock or whatever, and whether we should you know change that end hour.
