This is our community board full hearing on this project and to repeat, as wolves already pointed out, the governor's executive order, we're holding this public hearing Remotely We have requested that people submit their names by noon.
My name is jeffree lafrancois, I'm, the first vice chair of Manhattan community board for this evening, I'll be running our public session as we do each meeting those that have signed up in advance.
A number of letters of opposition and support to a particular liquor license on the agenda of a place called the spot.
That will be talked about in detail during the business section of the meeting by the co-chairs of the blp committee, and we also see the number of we're letters around concerns about the homeless issues we're facing in largely in hell's kitchen, but in the district as a whole, and one of the things to lowell's point is: If somebody says something before you, your time at the microphone.
We will have some people in limited capacities in the residence halls, we're all looking forward to getting back to doing the fabulous public education which leads to terrific creative employment in new york city and throughout the world, and also the black students union about a month ago, put up a really powerful and beautiful and very cool mural that they chalked on the outside of the buildings that face seventh avenue.
These are poorly managed, pop-up facilities, appear, the quality of life has decreased, overall, and I might add that the tenants are smoking and drinking in large groups in front of the hotels without masks without social distancing, and it's something that the governor has shut bars and restaurants down all over the city.
I want to remind the board that detective mike dugan, head of community affairs at midtown north told me that in two that in 2020 rise bar six, three one violations all happened in the beginning of the year.
I've lived in the piano factory at 45th and 10th for the past eight years and within hell's kitchen for nearly 15 years, now, as a community, we had many issues with martini previously in the neighborhood which, in my opinion, operated very much in the style of the proposed spotlight in the spot, club.
From my experience within the immediate vicinity of the proposed bar, my neighbors will have issues with noise pollution coming from the spot bar itself, as we have found living in an older building coupled with the spot guests who will congregate, as the previous speaker, said, outside the bar.
I've ran nightclubs for many years, and I want to make clear that ryze ball operates as a local bar and far from a nightclub which requires a completely different business model like much larger capacity.
I, don't think it's a good way to manage public funds, particularly given that cuny's public And it's facing 150 million budget shortfall, so This money would mean a lot to a lot of different people in the community, and so I would really like someone to reach out We could figure out a way to go forward with additional support.
I'm, a public member of cb4, land, houston zoning committee, And I'm, also a resident of west 36th street between eighth and ninth avenue, and I'm, calling with regards to the temporary homeless shelters that have moved into west 36th street and west 37th street.
I've spent the past several afternoons, walking the streets with eric bocher from corey johnson's office and members of dhs, the shelter providers, and what is evident is that we have too many residents too little space, two little resources and separate providers, and all we will be provided with is additional phone numbers and there's no way out of this until we reduce the density of the shelter population, either removing two or more of the shelters from this immediate vicinity.
We represent many service workers, including more than 3 300, who either live or work here in community board.
For the last year and a half we've supported, chipotle workers in new york city, struggling to better their working conditions.
I just want to thank the blp committee for their decision and encourage the full board to vote with them on resolutions.
It's, not a rowdy bar I, also think that in this time, right now, when we're dealing with so much blight, that's happening in the city, because people are literally leaving the city in droves.
Get the homeless out, and I will tell you that I helped to get letters and many people that I got letters from have small little children who live in my building.
So sorry that the young gentleman didn't go to a meeting to be heard on this very important issue, but the fact of the matter is over the years the this community board has taken the plus attendant association's word that they represent the tenants And they do by law.
We have recently gotten beat cops on the streets through the efforts of the house, kitchen, neighborhood action committee and spot bar.
The, and the people that are getting letters are not from Manhattan plaza or the neighborhood.
The other thing I want to talk about is the new spot bar I'm, totally in favor of the spot, bar, I You know across the street.
These aren't just businesses or jobs for people in our communities and at the last full board meeting when they were trying to get the spot at the location.
Second, now is the time to approve the spot and help restore hell's kitchen they'll, make the block safer and provide jobs to those in our community.
So I think one of the concerns that I'm hearing from the community is that the spot bar will have an outside impact.
Many, apparently lived outside of Manhattan, so landstown road was a quiet, local pub that had an exemplary operational record 15 seconds and one of the clear things that a petition like this tells me Is that even the owners understand that spot bar is going to have an outsize impact on the on the community.
I've just been very thankful to work for tracy, teddy and john as being one of my first managers and for one of my first jobs to make money in new york city so that I continue.
I just wanted to say that the open restaurants plan has been overall promising for our street from having like a couple hundred people on our street to smaller problems.
Smaller, gatherings, I just want to note, there's been a related problem and we could really use the help of the community board and our local officials to kind of you, know, put a little pressure for law enforcement to come together and visit the block a little.
So people have been bringing portable sound systems stereos and playing music on their car to like really late hours of the night and like I, don't want to blame any specific restaurant or bar, but contacting 301 and 911 has not helped, and I've spoken to a lot of neighbors about the same issue.
Councilmember consanity's brought a lot of attention to the issue in astoria and there was a lot of attention about how big those parties were going It really helped bring the sla over and a lot more law enforcement attention to that area, And , so I know carl from the speaker's office is out of town, But I'd love to do something with the neighborhood, as well as the community board and the speaker's office to maybe do a walk through to see just kind of some of the related problems that are still sort of manifesting, because we could really use some help in that area.
Does I think my coach, like my peer, said with gotham cheer rises up this race over thirty five thousand dollars for homeless, lgbt youth at the ally, new york court coat drives and trinity place shelters.
I want to let the people know that I was the reason why I closed The business of the sla and got the license cancelled.
First off I'd like to say, ryzebar, has only had five noise complaints in three and a half years, 33 out of 40 tenants that live above rise of our support, the rights application and due to living directly above in terms of noise, we are having the appropriately security guards bartenders certified to make sure that they are over, seeing people are not drunk and I'm, giving my daughter we're going to move on to the next speaker.
I'm, an architect at building violation, services, and I truly want to put my support behind theodore He's been he's been a pleasure to work with, in the last couple of years, trying to make everything legal and the most safest for the health, safety and welfare of the public at rise.
The public is protected, but making sure everyone is safe and with the limited issues with the neighborhood and the community, I think he's one of the most upstanding individuals.
I've worked with in the hospitality industry, so I do want to put our entire office's support behind him and his venture And he's an utmost standing citizen that would do right by the community in that area, beyond just keeping it safe and protected for the community.
I'm, the president of the Manhattan plaza tenants association, that's over 3, 500 residents, so you know, 800 units in our building are across the street from the proposed location of the spot.
We, live in the building with ann excuse me with amy and 36th street I think that moving eight over 800 people homeless, people into two blocks overnight, Was an ill-conceived plan from the start, with no plan for security.
420 of those are south of 48th street in hell's, kitchen 329 are above 49th street 137 petition signatures are from Manhattan plaza in addition to that , we've obtained eight letters independently from residents of Manhattan, plaza 33 of the 40 residential tenants that live in the rise of our building are in support of this, including the two residents who live on the second floor above rise, bar.
I want to tell you that also add value to our community by hiring people that live in the neighborhood.
I talked to ted arenas yesterday, and he told me that they got the homophobic people living in the Manhattan plaza They don't want gay bar in our neighbors and They got 140 people from the Manhattan plaza who support gay bar and the neighbors, and I think it's really good for our community.
I. Think it's going to be a really good opportunity for our neighbors, and I want to tell that television has created a really nice bar This is a bridge and tunnel crowd.
Is that part of the reason we have so much so much trouble in this city with housing and behavior that that stems from people with mental problems that are not getting assistance and a whole list of other things is that for a couple of decades, new york has been operating on an austerity budget, and we've got to break that And I'm, not suggesting that people who live in this community, the vast majority, I'm, not suggesting our taxes are too low.
Increased last thing, I want to say the assembly health committee, which I chair, is going to be having public hearings in august on on the Covid-19 epidemic and its effect on nursing homes and adult homes and home care, and on our hospitals.
420 000 new yorkers have left so those are hard to chase and for those of us who are here, we need to fill out the census, I'm, not going to say more, except if you want us to come with an ipad, and you have a group of people.
4 has an amazing history of understanding, affordable, housing, perhaps more than any other board, and so we're going to try one more time to list, at least for the bar of Manhattan.
So I know it's not the number one issue, but if we can figure out open space for these schools, you have a lot in district.
You know the ulip timetable is now going to be opening up again with the city, planning, commission and again we'll be working together on all those many issues.
Many of the issues with homelessness with mental health There's in our community We've got the issue with the hotels that I'll talk about in a minute, but there's the closure of the subways and the libraries and other places that street homeless people spend their time.
Who's been working with us on that and to all the residents on 36th street, who reached out We know that will come out of this crisis as a city.
The second thing is on opening schools going into the fall, which I think some of the work we're doing dovetails.
We reconvene the hudson yards construction task force with the support of the mayor's community affairs unit and speaker johnson's office, and we had got DOB and dep to agree on a set of construction hours across for all the major developers in all hudson yards, including Manhattan west, and those from my understanding.
We've got a letter coming out of two committees on that What's going on those blocks.
We formed a social justice working group that group met every tuesday in June and July and have drafted both a letter to the mayor and a number of recommendations which we will be dealing with in the business session.
There are a lot of things in those recommendations that we are going to pursue going further, one of which may be keeping that working group intact to address public safety issues going forward.
Thank you to bert, and the various committee chairs that make up that working, group, chelsea land use and transportation held a joint committee meeting and, as I mentioned earlier, provided testimony yesterday regarding the empire station complex eis, there was a letter about that for the business session.
We touched upon that, but what parents and residents in our district going back to school were most concerned about, and we gave recommendations off both of the experts and What parents and educators told us one was which is a big deal for if everyone knows, is, live remote learning and the desperate need for it.
I had one thought, having talked to some parents, that there's great concern about parents who need to work and irregular scheduling in terms of you know, days of the week or hours But, then they come back home in the afternoon or something like that, and whether or not that's a factor that you came across or not it's just the effect on the schedule for parents.
We're gonna people will call out if they want to vote against a certain letter.
I was also one of the people against and exactly for the same reason as frank, which is, we have had a horrendous history and with these applicants, where they have consistently misrepresented one part or another of their operation and or not executed what they were supposed to do, and you know whatever they are saying they are going to do at this point.
The second thing I want to point out is that generally I like to rely on the people who live right around an operation and our goal is to really make sure that those people coexist and cohabit with the operator in a good way and therefore.
We have a lot of confusion about the numbers, etc, but even if I take you know the 800 petition and compare it with the 3200 people at Manhattan plaza, who are representing by represented by their official board, I, mean essentially tells me that 80 of the population in our district is not in favor of this operation being located at that location, and therefore I felt that it's, we should deny it just a follow-up.
Yes, I think the numbers are important, because if you have 100 people at Manhattan plaza, you still have 3 200, which are represented by the block, as was the tenant association, and even if you have 800 number in the petition, you still have 3 200.
There was also some unresolved issue about whether it was even properly zoned for commercial space, but the other path that we heard at that time was that a place like the spot with its method of operation was unsuitable for this block and would likely change the character of the block, and that is still true and those arguments were made with respect to the prior location and took up about half the letter we ultimately sent to the sla.
So we thought we'd write a letter One of our main concerns was that these hotels do not become permanent homeless residents.
I. Just want to note that in combining these letters we need to update them because from the time we met to now, there have been additional homeless facilities open that we've not noted the letter, so we should list them as much as further as I spoke to jesse today, there's yet a new hotel on west 48th street that is now housing.
Homeless, We really want to attach to this letter a series of pictures that have been sent to us by the local restaurants of what they are contending with in these blocks, because I actually did not believe it when I was on a zoom caller and have good connectivity.
We all know that it's a fact that most people who are homeless are not mentally ill, and we know that we have a moral obligation to help others and in fact, in this particular community we have several shelters We have several buildings of supportive housing, so we're open to helping others.
The second point I wanted to mention is that dhs's position seems to be that this is all going to be temporary and trying to figure out the street homeless versus residents from the shelter Personally.
You know there are a lot of people making money off of the homeless, and A.
It's a sad issue, as everyone knows, but joe mentioned, and Is there any way we could get the good managers to take over some of the buildings of the bad managers, because, I think, would be terrible to move these homeless people once again or these people without homes.
Only looking for comments on the letter we've had these discussions multiple times at committee hearings in meetings with dhs, it's all been taken into an account, I'm.
I would just say you know, obviously as a board member, not only of the community board for but also of brc, that I thank people for acknowledging that they're really good providers out there doing their very best.
Think the letters attempt this, but it just needs to be made explicitly clear that dhs is facing a mismanagement nightmare and there are too many times where we reference the pandemic and try to pit the homeless issue against the pandemic as if they're separate and competing the bottom line.
There are four letters to the parks department requesting a replacement of the track at chelsea park, one to hudson river park, trust regarding the chelsea waterside park, redesign of which we're all very excited about, but provided some important critiques and comments, a letter to the city's economic development corporation and our elected officials regarding a lack of public space and a very dangerous situation around the Manhattan cruise terminal access, way, I'm, including extending the invitation to them at our september wpe meeting and finally, a letter to NYPD state, DOT and parks around on the hudson river greenway and the placement of the what sugar cubes and how they pose overdue.
I would be happy to take it up at the next video and it sounds like a an issue that we actually want to really drill in on what we're looking for on those intersections, because it's not just about the people and folks using it.
All right hearing, none we're going to go to the joint transportation, chelsea land use letter regarding the empire, station, complex, eis, who's.
Given these baseline adjustments and for the second portion of the letter, we then went through and identified 23 specific tasks for the study that need to reflect concerns from our community and those include traffic, pedestrian, use, community facilities, business and residential displacement, open space, historic resources, water insurances and energy issues, amongst others, as well as questioning.
If people have comments other than minor typos and want to talk about substantive issues, I think we're going to work on some master, plan.
I, don't know who wants to joe and then bert good job In the section about the hudson yard zoning we need to include the point I brought up in our in our first call about it.
How many times I say that tonight, I think it's a really good letter well thought through many of the perspectives Are important that we're bringing to this.
You know it would be nice if someone talked about art public art like if the sooner it's considered the more likely it is to actually be adopted and brought into being and done in a way that is That I ran through this letter very quickly, but there is some sustainability, issues.
Our plan is also to circulate this to other community boards, to encourage them to think about asking for the same thing to get on board about it, and then we also explain: we've added a paragraph in there sort of explaining the work that we did for the last seven or eight weeks, The recommendation.
So the way our task force worked was that we invited everybody to just start, throwing out suggestions on any topic to advance this issue, and then we ended up with a really long list, and then we said okay, but let now we have to start thinking about you know.
Thank you all for actually suggesting formation of this group and for actually 20 other people from within the community board four to have come together and really get this going.
You know to focus on community policing, practices, and so that's the letter that was number 25.
They have the build your block, meetings, I'm, not sure it's monthly, but I think it's maybe four times a year where there's a very healthy, interaction, and I think we just need more people to come to those meetings to get face-to-face time with police, officers, and I think it would hopefully help a lot.
It, come about through a number of sort of much longer list of recommendations, and just to your point, jd cb4 is not insulated from rest of the city and the folks come in and out of cb4 as well, and they also actually form part of the community Schools in the neighborhood where people come and some schools, students come and study.
The community board's voice with the rest of the city That's what this working group is all about.
There's a lot of focus that we're doing specifically related to cb4, while also branching out and trying to work with other community boards and seeing what other folks are doing in the city.
You know the community board has been offering like six or seven different kinds of trainings.
Okay, just a suggestion, I, think a lot of people were concerned about the four o'clock or whatever, and whether we should you know change that end.
, it's the new letter on number six and you have to enter that in your vote sheet with everything else, because we still need a written record.
