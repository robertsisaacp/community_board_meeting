I will enjoy and elise levy, who is a tenant or you're marie logan bit about tenants doing the pandemic and a little bit about non-payment cases, I'm, an attorney at hcc, lakeland set and tonight logan, and I will be presenting on Covid-19 updates to housing court and also about non-payment proceedings, which we anticipate will be coming up for more folks in the future.
There have been a few versions of the moratorium so far in the pandemic, and currently the one that applies to new york state is one issued by judge marks, which extends the eviction moratorium until October 1st 2020.
So some updates in terms of our housing court calendar is that new cases can now be filed, but they're, currently not being heard.
The court has chosen to dispense with the cases that are already on the calendar first, so new cases that are being filed are putting being put off for the moment, logan's going to talk more about what might happen if you receive a notice for non-payment and what an eviction proceeding for non-payment will look like the exception to new cases.
You should contact one of the numbers that we will be presenting throughout, to ask for an attorney and for legal assistance prior to the date on the right, hand, side of the paper.
Is: it depends right, and that being said, I think that many people have decided to move because they can no longer afford the apartment due to job loss or they have moved to care for sick relatives They themselves need to be need to move out of new york city for safety reasons or just for other health reasons.
Many people, as I've talked about, have moved out of new york city, some permanently, but When things are out when things calm down or the crisis, is over, but they're worried about being brought to court and the laird alleging that they do not primarily reside in their apartment.
I can't promise you that, if you've moved away for health reasons or to care for sick relative or for any other of the valid reasons that someone might move away from new york city at the moment that the landlord won't be able to prevail in a non-primary residence.
And she's, going to talk about the protections that tenants have been afforded by new york state through the safe harbor act, so pay close attention in those parts of the slides, I'm.
Also, a staff attorney with hcc, And I'm going to talk to you about non-payment, cases, because generally, these are probably the ones that are going to come up most frequently during this Covid-19 pandemic.
And they'll say that you owe this much money, but it is important to know that they can make a verbal demand for the rent as well after they do that and after that time period, that they give you expires, which is usually about 14 days.
Another thing that is important to consider with non-payments when you look at the rent demand or the ledger that you're given is whether or not the landlord can charge late fees under the executive, order.
Anyways and another issue for people who are facing financial hardships because of Covid-19 is: Can you use your security deposit to pay rent that you owe under the same executive, order?
The security deposit can be used to pay rent owed if the tenant is facing financial hardship as a result of Covid-19 19.
It does something kind of similar to the safe harbor act, where it just means that you can't be evicted for that between the time of up until december 31st after december 31st, you can, and during that time, even though you can't be evicted for those arrears fees and late charges will accrue still And, then the biggest thing is that, in order to assert it, you have to sign a declaration that the CDC provides on their website, and you have to agree to all of the paragraphs that they lay out and the paragraphs lay out very specific facts, and it is our advice that no one signs that declaration or asserts this defense without consulting an attorney before, because it has a lot of information in there.
Organizing, is the act of bringing people together to build power with their neighbors to win rights and protections and to protect their neighborhoods and a little bit about like what we won and what tenant organizing can do.
So like let's say that you you have one neighbor's number , you don't know anyone else in your building, call that neighbor and see who they can call- Do you build those relationships so starting out by like asking what people need and What issues?
Don't be shy and just go and ask those questions and then from there build community and build power, so holding an attendance association meeting, and you know, starting out with how long you've lived there.
If it seems like there's some similar situations, you can repeat that outreach that you did from step one and send flyers over there and see if you know, there's a way to build power together to take on common issues experienced by all the tenants with that with that landlord, and then here's just a few resources that you can use.
That's two one, two five, four one, five, nine six, but I will say that so in general, a couple of things: one is, if you live in a rent, stabilized apartment and a landlord has cut off some of your access to services, especially a bathroom or a common area that you used to have access.
One is by calling 311 and asking to speak with a tenant attorney and you'll be connected to a legal services provider who, at a minimum, give you some advice.
If you receive court papers or you have questions about tenants, rights, you should call 311 or the mayor's office to protect tenants or housing court answers or us hcc, especially if you live on the west, side.
