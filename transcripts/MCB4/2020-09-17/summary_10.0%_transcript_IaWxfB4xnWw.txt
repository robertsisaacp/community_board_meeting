We are also joined by Corliss Evans from the New York City Department of finance We'll provide a short presentation about the city's rent freeze program after Hcc's presentation, as requested we'll have asl interpreters, present, and I want to thank both of them for their service.
, I'm, an attorney at HCC, Lakeland set and tonight Logan and I will be presenting on Covid-19 updates to housing court and also about non- payment proceedings which we anticipate will be coming up for more folks in the future.
There have been a few versions of the moratorium so far in the pandemic, and currently the one that applies to New York state is one issued by Judge marks, which extends the eviction moratorium until October 1st 2020.
So some updates in terms of our housing court calendar is that new cases can now be filed, but they're, currently not being heard.
The court has chosen to dispense with the cases that are already on the calendar first, so new cases that are being filed are putting being put off for the moment, Logan's going to talk more about what might happen if you receive a notice for non- payment and what an eviction proceeding for non- payment will look like the exception to new cases being heard, are emergency cases and, as I said, pre- covet cases So any case that was commenced, pre- coped and had court dates.
Is the document that the marshal would have to serve you with meaning put on your door and mail to you in order to evict you, and so the important things to look at is the date the marshal's notice was issued and the date of the earliest eviction.
You should contact one of the numbers that we will be presenting throughout, to ask for an attorney and for legal assistance prior to the date on the right, hand, side of the paper.
Is: it depends right, and that being said, I think that many people have decided to move because they can no longer afford the apartment due to job loss or they have moved to care for sick relatives They themselves need to be need to move out of New York City for safety reasons or just for other health reasons.
What we look like, will be looked at by a judge in court to decide whether or not it was okay to break your lease and how much you might owe your landlord.
If you are brought to court for damages on breaking a lease, you should know that a landlord also has a duty to mitigate this means.
I can't promise you that, if you've moved away for health reasons or to care for sick relative or for any other of the valid reasons that someone might move away from New York City at the moment that the landlord won't be able to prevail in a non- primary residence.
So, if you can't pay your rent, it's likely that once your landlord decides that it's appropriate to start a non- payment, proceeding against you that they will Logan is going to talk a little bit more about all this And she's, going to talk about the protections that tenants have been afforded by New York state through the safe Harbor act, so pay close attention in those parts of the slides, I'm.
Also, a staff attorney with HCC, And I'm going to talk to you about non- payment cases, because generally, these are probably the ones that are going to come up most frequently during this Covid-19 pandemic.
It's a case that a landlord is going to bring against a tenant for non- payment of rent and what this means.
The landlord is bringing you to court to ask the court to order you to pay the money that they are saying is owed, and if they, if you do not pay and the court determines that you should have paid, then the landlord may be able to evict you, but because you're in court, you can dispute the claim that you owe money, or there are other defenses that are available to you and you'll have the opportunity to present evidence.
First, the landlord has to demand the rent from the tenant, and normally this looks like a paper form that you'll get They'll say that you owe this much money, but it is important to know that they can make a verbal demand for the rent as well after they do that and after that time period, that they give you expires, which is usually about 14 days.
The judge can say that you still owe that money and it'll be what's called a money judgment, but they can't actually evict you for it, and so a counter claim is a claim that the tenant gets to bring against the landlord.
Another thing that is important to consider with non- payments when you look at the rent demand or the ledger that you're given is whether or not the landlord can charge late fees under the executive, order.
Anyways and another issue for people who are facing financial hardships because of Covid-19 is: Can you use your security deposit to pay rent that you owe under the same executive, order?
Is, that, like we, can join together and make things change for the better for attendance in New York, so the basics tenant organizing, is the act of bringing people together to build power with their neighbors to win rights and protections and to protect their neighborhoods and a little bit about like what we won and what tenant organizing can do.
You do not know anyone else in your building, call that neighbor and see who they can call- Do you build those relationships so starting out by like asking what people need and Are you having trouble paying rent?
Do not be shy and just go and ask those questions and then from there build community and build power so holding an attendance association meeting, and you know, starting out with how long you've lived there.
I would like everyone to know that the outreach team is up, running and ready to facilitate rent freeze events virtually prior to Covid-19, which was on foot in the communities holding outreach.
The tenant must live in a rent, stabilized or rent, controlled or preferential rent apartment, and they must be paying more than one third of their monthly income for rent, and I would also like to introduce a new, a new system that the department of finance have it's called the tenant, access, Portal, also known as tap Once.
That's two one, two five, four one, five, nine six, but I will say that so in general, a couple of things: one is, if you live in a rent, stabilized apartment and a landlord has cut off some of your access to services, especially a bathroom or a common area that you used to have access.
You can also call housing court answers who can help you file an Hp petition without an attorney or, and there are some other options, but a lamp you know.
Perhaps your apartment may be subject to rent stabilization, someone's asking with a 646 number I think that is the court's number, so Manhattan housing, court.
The court is working on, like Maria said, is the court's working on trying to get through cases that were started before March If you receive court papers- or you have questions about tenants, rights, you should call 311 or the mayor's office to protect tenants or housing court answers or us HCC, especially if you live on the West side.
