The city began to act in a very expeditious fashion, moving almost a thousand people a week out of our permanent shelters, which they have been where they were located into hotels and with very little notice.
I, don't have the numbers as of yet, but I was informed that there will actually be additional security coming to the three sites on 36th street in the form of individuals whose job will solely be would be community engagement.
Obviously we're just waiting for the health guidelines to do so, but no one, no one, that's engaged in this work would like us to see it be in hotels for a second longer than we have to be just given the given the nature of these existing shelters that they're already have and have programming, and once folks can move back to their sites.
Only thing that would add to matt's points is that the community board has been very persistent and diligent in asking for us to create a monthly check-in system with all of our providers, density reduction, sites, and so that's something that we've committed and agreed to do.
I think it's a little over 100 on 52nd, street, okay, And, then the for the three hotels used for family with children.
So I think one of the things we need to understand as a community, then we're going to really have to open it up to the to the committee.
So the other issue we bring to is we've gotten many reports back the issue that the ability of these of these operators to provide social services is highly compromised, because the nature of the buildings are literally budget hotels ,, there's, no congregate, space , there's no ability to do things and we've got lots of reports back from people who are in the shelters that they just can't get the same kind of service, and in fact I was on one caller.
We know that you did it for the right reason: we're now interested as a neighborhood to maintain public safety and get people services.
And I have I, have two small children at home, The job that I have is going across new york city talking to individuals and communities regarding shelter.
I, always whenever I can want to give as much time, because the one thing that I've heard again and again and before I started this job and for previous administrations, it was exactly what happened during Covid-19 Was sort of the normal process for normal shelters and it didn't work communities, , dare I say this was a once in a lifetime pandemic, especially at the beginning, as we were, trying to scramble to do it, and so I understand that there's nothing that I can say.
These are situations in which clients are coming from and generally around sites that are, you know, usually around between 150 and 200 number that are dorm like settings that have shared meal space that were created to serve individuals in a temporary basis, as they find their way to permanent housing, and they were not created at all, as this is how we're going to be able to live.
While there's a highly contagious pandemic, and the city you know is obviously now in deep conversation trying to figure out I think we all are hoping and praying that these numbers remain low as we go through this next cold and flu season, and hopefully, as we can, you know, seeing as we can continue to take precautions as a city and continue to stay low as a state that we'll be able to figure out how to you know, transition people back from these hotels into appropriate shelters.
Is there any possibility to look across that entire list of contracts or can't the city leverage the fact that hotels have absolutely zero occupancy to find the right spaces that may have conference rooms that may have areas that are large enough for full staff to be able to spend that time during the time that they're supposed to be working with their clients to provide what is needed for our at-risk population, even just more room to use as program space?
In fact, people are connected with something, as opposed to just ending up on the street decompensating I'm gonna interrupt you because I'm not asking about the providers, I'm asking about leadership at dhs to actually manage the process for where folks are put, where their siting is for, where they're put so that it is appropriate for the population.
Sorry I just wanted to chime in that there's a lot of different ways that folks were trying to be creative in the beginning, with the pandemic, with the need to social distance, engaging clients, it was.
What happened to those people who were in family shelters who were whose lives were disrupted sure?
Issues, and I want to again bring you back to when we bring in people from west 36th street, These community residents are out of their minds.
We don't know if you're coming from a shelter or from the street and that's an ongoing issue.
Really it's an untenable, situation, and I, hear you saying sorry, but sorry doesn't suffice and what I know that the community is looking for is going to be action.
That's great, but really you know that what we were looking for, because we put it in our letter- was looking for a reduction on 36th street or removing one of the one of the shelter sites, because 800 people on one block is really is really too much, and I.
That people shared with me It's about families, but the thing I wanted to say is that I am understanding of the situation as we all shared why this needed to happen.
I will call to nelly to bring people in and out, and one of the things I want to say is that we now have 84 attendees, plus 17 panelists at this meeting, 16 raising their hands, I'm, going to call on people from west 36th street first, because those are the ones who are absolutely out of their minds and then nellie will bring you in and bring you out.
You guys have a heart out at eight o'clock an hour and a half is not enough time to address what is going on west 36th street alone, no less the entire community promises of monthly committee meetings.
Since then, I've been on tons of calls like this and repeatedly dhs has said that the safety of the of the shelter clients are their top priority with little no regard to the residents.
What I do want to know is what is dhs going to do to ensure that such a glitch doesn't happen when the people that are staying at the hotels in our district are eventually moved back to either a more traditional shelter setup or to other hotels, so that we don't continue doing this shuffling around and just shuffling the problem from one place to the other, because otherwise this is not going to end, and that's all.
I want to know who's actually going to say that on the record, because when you look at a population, just the brc that runs double was running cachet.
That, like there's daily outreach, I, find that really hard to believe I mean the people that we are seeing acting out on the streets.
We have a lot of senior citizens in hell's kitchen who try to make their way to food emporium or wherever else that they're going If I'm added to the to the group that joe and his team do, I want to see what is the comprehensive plan for October november december and January, because I think to get on calls and just have calls about you.
I. Just don't think you understand the dangerous situation with this density of the new newcomers to our community.
Everybody is at danger, as the last person said, not just the individuals that have been relocated onto the block, but the people as well that live there.
I think muzzy actually expressed a desire to be able to serve his community again, and I'm, just wondering what's the story : What's the plan for bringing those people back to where they have service is available to them?
I live on west 38th street And I have to say the neighborhood is really affected by the situation.
We need to have a working relationship with where, if people, whether they are homeless or not, they have 10 seconds.
You know I was on the last call as well and just very passionate about some of these topics, as well, specifically here in midtown , I walk from my office on fifth avenue up multiple times, I'm in a nice way, I'm, actually meeting a number of different single females, and things like that because they are cl.
So I live on 54th street, I'm, a former social worker, I'm, an hr consultant And I have worked with a number of organizations, doing homeless, outreach, supportive housing, etc.
Do think that, although the immediate concerns are what is most immediate, that the idea of also moving around very vulnerable people, as if they are pieces in a chest, came and need to be removed from where others are feeling threatened, as well as the availability of future proposals, etc, where the community will welcome service providers into their neighborhoods.
Thank, you first time at this kind of community meeting, I'm a little nervous to speak, but I live on west 44th street and really speaking about my experience near the skyline, I.
The person who spoke before me think it's important that dhs and this community board hear from viewpoints of people The loudest voices are people who are experiencing immediate dangers and need help and want to figure out how to deal with bad situations, so I have walked by the skyline hotel, daily.
You know just within the mix of people, just the homeless, People, I'm, I think, you're, doing your best in, good evening, everybody I live at 241 west 36th between 8th and 8th and 7th and 8th and first of all.
You needed to hear from a lot of the people in the worst affected area, which is right now 36 and 37th, streets, and I hope.
Need you to take charge to say how do you properly integrate people and manage difficult facilities in a community?, You can't tell us that the shelters were closed by October november december or March or April of next year.
You, don't know, and if we have to live with this, you've got to figure out a way to manage it, not just while we're here , You actually move people move the washington jefferson block because of all the stuff around it, and you know something it made a difference.
We are very concerned that I want to say this to the committee members and for all the people in the public.
Let's get them off the streets, so people want to witness them but put them somewhere, even if it's in the hotel.
You know one of the things that we have been really pushing for and advocating for which I think was actually communicated quite well through some of the members of the public.
You know that dhs takes a much more of a leadership role in recognizing they put this many folks into our district and how to manage them and how to coordinate that response on handling the quality of life and the public safety issues that arise, because, as folks on this committee know folks that have sit on other community advisory boards for other shelters that are in existing shelters that are in our district and and also supportive housing facilities in our district?
It sounds like dhs is finally coming to the table and saying yes they're, going to start those meetings, and I think.
You cannot have that many folks put implanted into a community into a block like that and expect nothing to happen, and so, as you guys already know, you've written a letter and they've written back.
Therefore, dhs has to come up with a plan in general on how this process gets managed both to benefit the shelter residents and to provide ongoing public safety for the community, because it has created problems where none existed.
Anecdotal issue, So Our requests in a letter are here Well come up with a plan, and you must reduce the density on 36 and 37 streets, because it's just not working, and it's not tenable.
Your point, before, which is very accurate, is that we need to make sure that dhs takes charge and doesn't leave it to the hotels to decide where people go.
What's, going on, I am concerned about the number of schools that we have in this community and how the opening of schools is going to be affected by the number of homeless people out in the streets, especially those that are persons that have committed crimes in the in the past.
We have, since we've received a great number of people in this community that are homeless.
A job of controlling the situation and keeping residences of these communities, safe, I, believe I, agree with everybody else that dhs needs and must do their job, properly, finally, and step up and take a proper leadership role and get control of this, and not wait for the hotels or politicians to tell them what to do.
The thing that stands out to me right now is that you know this is not about putting homeless people onto the streets right thinking about the letter that I just saw it's about what's occurring on 36 and 37, and for the people who have to live there and the density and the way that they are in fear of stepping out of their home even during the day to do normal kinds of things like go to the store And How they're being impacted and how they're being impacted in relation to their safety, their physical and their emotional and mental well-being.
When I found out, I heard that people on 79th street were going to be relocating.
I'm, the chair of community board, for I first want to thank joe and maria for running a great meeting tonight and for all of their efforts on all of this gail brewer's office Has been working on a letter to dhs as well, and that letter hasn't come out yet because I'm going to be quite frank here, Right now of the press to send a letter saying people need to be relocated.
