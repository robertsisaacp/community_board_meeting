We wanted to add something to new business at some point: okay, Agenda, all right, The first item on the agenda is the turning movement at 36Th Street in Ninth, Avenue.
The little context here is that this is the bike lane going down, ninth Avenue and at 36Th Street.
So, let's just try to put the fire out, but I think this is just another reason for us to keep D.O.T accountable for these mixing zones that we've long identified as dangerous, dangerous designs for bicyclists You know on a Wednesday night, because you're concerned about safety of people outside of your business.
I know that on 38- 9, this is my street You know D.O.T to retrofit all of them, But and now with the issues of budget Unless Colin, you have another one that you want to add in the same letter, and we can do that, I'm, not aware of him off the top of my head.
I, just read it because we were going to discuss The You know the budget, Oh, my god, and the fact that construction is happening at a particular location where there's a mixing zone.
The person who sent us the initial letter there actually were two people who raised this issue is Stefan.
He was just essentially complaining about his treatment at the barricades that he did not sign up to be interrogated by police officers about his whereabouts and his comings and goings as he came and entered his apartment also that it had it caused trouble for him with as far as like getting car services or ride, shares, and also it obviously, it interfered with traffic.
I live acrosss the street between 9th and 10th, but because I live on 54th, I, frequently walk down 54th with my stroller, with my children, which, by the way and I've, had a chronic problem with the police officers parking there They park on the sidewalk, sometimes they park so close to the police precinct that I can not fit my stroller in between their car and the the community Court or the precinct building itself, because there's a bump out with stairs there.
It's, completely gone now, so I think we're just sort of litigating their past mistakes now, rather than trying to change something, although I think we could advocate for them in general to not park their cars all over the sidewalk.
They were not allowing anybody onto the block, and I worked, I emailed with the neighborhood community officer and just sort of pleaded, my case, why do not you move the barricades back 20 feet and allow people just to get a CitiBike and come and go?
But I mean how is what is the situation with the parking right now Can you access the sidewalk and is it?
You feel like the entire curb is dedicated to the police force, but I noticed that they have painted lines on the sidewalk white painted lines for parking, and I was kind of rolling my eyes at that.
You know, if we're, if we're going to agree as a community that they're allowed to park on the sidewalk, which I do not necessarily agree with that.
You, know thanking them for reopening you know And, you know the sidewalk is a major issue and we need to have a better delineation between the cars and the pedestrians and making sure it's open and making sure that the people with strollers can go through Et, cetera, Et cetera and therefore recommend that they install those vertical ballards which are very inexpensive, but would be a good signal of you.
No, I think a couple of things and parking on the sidewalk is not permitted in New York, City.
I propose a resolution that we enforce the rules where you can't park on the sidewalk and let them know that would be my resolution.
I'm, just saying, like I'm, asking us as a committee to weigh the possible outcomes like we can tell them they're being bad actors in the civic space of the streets of the precincts, and they will say you know they'll trash Can, our letter.
I think that it makes more sense just to say that they can't park on the sidewalk, I'm, not really in any mood to like compromise with the NYPD.
You, know agitative, but I think also they're not supposed to park on the sidewalk, and so I do not think they should.
So I do not know if a resolution is going to be terribly effective without At least not to not said that NYPD.
I think it's got to go through the electeds, because the electeds maybe stand a chance at wielding some kind of power over a policy issue in the streets.
We need to show up and force to some of the police district meetings to talk about this, but it's a big issue in terms of us being subject to whatever the NYPD is going to do with this podcast.
We'll include the law in a way that does not say violent words right, but will you It's better worrying refer to the law, which says you are not supposed to be on the sidewalk, and this is still an issue even that the fact that the blocks have been reopened.
People can not go through the sidewalk for distancing and for ADA and for you know, strollers, and it really It is illegal to park on the sidewalk and therefore we are asking them to not park on the sidewalk and the emphasis on clearance for social distance, reasons, also and better communication moving forward.
It was a joint effort of the mayor's office and Oakland has eight City council members, seven by district and one at large, and they all participated as along with a bunch of other stakeholders like their office of Disabilities area, residents, cycling, groups and activists, and a couple of non- profit organizations, and then the transit stakeholders, such as Caltrans and Bart, were on their advisory committee.
They did a kind of master survey and they also employed what they described as an equity framework, and they also did very extensive, like in- person and social media outreach on any available channel to get input from the from the resident, and the plan itself has like a kind of built- in framework for focusing on disadvantaged groups who may not always have access to this to cycling as a means of transit, amen and referring back to what we talked about in a prior meeting.
There's lots of super interesting and detailed, recommendations, and I think a lot of them would have great potential here in our district and in the city at large, but I'm not really like advocating.
But it's not to advocate for, like Let's crib, their work We think our city should take on this kind of comprehensive plan, and you know, look at the same kind of like engagement of stakeholders, equity, framework, business development, strategy.
I mean in a sense, you know, is the city just going to say?
You know, there's no point in studying something if you do not think it's going to matter, because there people are just going to say, well, We've already gone down that road.
You've just confirmed that we should go down that road, so I think one thing that distinguishes this document from like just a data crunch, is that you know the it clearly outlines an equity framework which I do not think is part, especially of the RPA plan, for instance, and also that business development component, which you know here We, have a very large corporation, engaging in the most you know, important rollout of, as opposed to the Oakland model, which was let's bring up small businesses and especially small business POC on small businesses to meet some of our our needs for cycling.
You know that we that equity and transportation is a goal that we need to get to, So then you go to community boards.
Think if we want to try to think like more tactically, there could be an opportunity, obviously like the streets, master plan, where you know the first iteration is supposed to be released by DOT next December.
As, you know, we understand you are going to be working on this plan and just like try to engage in that way with D.O.T. You know an entirely distinct bike plan.
I. Think the angle would be to talk about the you know, equity and really the job developing some jobs.
The only way is to link it to veren that you know the question from your working group and maybe have you start to look at the report and extract from that, the things that could that fit in the working group and that could be a joint letter.
Up to now we have been working on sidewalk and we have talked a lot about the space you know.
By the issues of equity: There are about 3.6 million people who use the sidewalk and probably more, but I mean we use it in an intensive way to commute to to do the first leg of transit.
The sidewalk is really a place where equity is very, which is really very important, and one thing which is happening in New York City is since 2003.
You is there's a proposal to discuss how to ask for the sidewalk to be maintained by the city, certainly in our neighborhood and in other neighborhood, and so that we get to a level of equity between the people which are walking, of which many are you know, again.
Well, I do not know, but if we are saying as CB4, which we have said that we were trying to look in every committee and say, let's find some places where there is no equity.
That's, also an important issue that you know it's equity when it comes to accessibility, too I think equity is part of it, but it's sort of forward into it.
