They feel parents and perhaps educators, feel that they would be better positioned and would like to have greater flexibility in order to ensure that we have 41, it could have been three and we'll meet with them in the coming week, or so I would say, probably after election day and to figure out I mean the Department of education is impossible to deal with.
So that being said, I again remind people, we do not want to be outshone by other states that have had enormous response to early voting Thank you very much and everybody stay safe, Thank.
I, think the city Council, as I said, two- thirds, are going to be term, limited and half of them are running for other offices, and I.
Reopening working group did meet this month and the plan was to pass a resolution, but Valerie De, La Rosa, the chair of the committee.
Let me know that the we did not actually have the actual legislation at the time of the hearing, and so the committee would like have another opportunity to meet and further discuss some of the other details so that we can more appropriately comment on the legislation.
The only thing I do know was that they would have to have a permit from the fire department relative to their use of propane, but I still think that they also talked about it being secured outside of the city where the propane is stored in a locked box.
My question to you is pretty much knowing that at 25 occupancy, almost no restaurant can survive and all over the country I believe that the that we should be driven by science I think that in most places at this point in the city, except for some hot spots, we have maintained a very positive low, positivity rate, a very reasonable low, positivity rate, and so the safety You know.
So I see Martina, you have your hand up, but we're not going to entertain your questions just like when we're meeting regularly in person, As I mentioned before, we're not going to be considering the reopening working groups resolution on outdoor dining.
That's come out, so Dan Miller is going to our first vice chair is going to run the public session If you are going to be speaking about outdoor dining, just know that you're going to have another chance down the line, the valerie who's, our chair of the reopening working group, is holding potentially another meeting on November 9th.
So I would just like to put forward these two items from the Soho Noho recommendations which folks might want to hear about next Monday.
It's, eight bullet points of information and items that needed attention before we could do a scoping, so maybe city planning has done all this work.
He agrees and wants to support outdoor dining, and he says that none of the residents dislike the idea or intent of the restaurant.
Restaurant workers keep us going, especially during the pandemic, from old school sevilla, to Lartussi, to corner Bistro, to tavern on Jane, where everybody knows your name I personally, officiated two different weddings of West Village restaurant employees.
I want to talk about the mayor's upcoming Soho Noho neighborhood plan meeting on October 26th.
It looks like the Soho naho envision planning process is being fast- tracked, and the promises made by some elected officials that community input was essential, have been broken.
So corporate developers infiltrated the previously quaint neighborhood lined with architecturally beautiful buildings to make it appear that all the residents in Soho were entitled and wealthy, and let's look at what these corporate developers in the city of New York want to do, instead of the city working to find already existing, truly affordable residential units and working to support the small one, I'm afraid.
So it's complicated, but at least something small that we certainly advocated for the biggest issue, is Soho Noho I know: November we're going to plan a couple of our task force meetings to go through what we put down in terms of the planning, the booklet , that pete just showed you and we will go through whatever we can, because I know, there's a scoping session planned for December, 3rd.
The police department is asking that somebody look at like some 20 agencies that work with our streets.
So two community boards are going to be on the agenda to start planning for those two sections: we're trying hard to find a place for the pound police pound to go and, of course, pier 40.
But you hear the challenges you know them, I'm, obviously not in your area, but dealing with the homeless and seem like every other community.
And I am finding that in, for instance, district, not the single adults,, I think we've done about half everything, every single provider and asking what you just asked me and what we're finding, although I'm going to finish it Is the following: People have devices generally in the shelters, but guess what your device does not work.
You know business to bounce back and all our problems to be solved just when the pandemic, passes, and I do think that outdoor dining provides a phenomenal benefit.
I live on the up west side, but my entire area is filled with restaurants, and I, quite like the fact that when I walk home from the subway at 11 o'clock at night or 10:30 that there's people outside and there's activity, Please do think about.
And I own and operate two bar restaurants in our community, the spaniard on West, Fourth and barrow, and will finale and West fourth and Seventh Avenue South And I've lived and worked in our neighborhood for over 12 years.
I love it and I want to speak strongly in favor of the outdoor dining first year as a resident and a member of the community.
I think the outdoor dining has been a big part of bringing life and safety back to the streets.
We're as restaurant owners adapting to these rules every week they throw different rules at us, so I hope they also throw a little bit more oversight on it as we go forward, but as a whole, I think it's been an overwhelming positive impact on the life Thank.
I think the second concern is around the map that came around with this plan, which looked like to us.
You know our street has been effectively bought up by reits over the past 10 years and is now largely controlled by wreaths and not, and not the residents, and I think my biggest concern is the area.
In response to the Broadway League's announcement that Broadway productions are going to remain suspended until at least may 30th, I'm urging you know, support for Senator, Schumer's legislation on immediate federal relief and in the absence of that state funding, nearly 100,000 new yorkers rely on Broadway for their incomes, a lot of those good labor jobs and.
This is like kind of city planning that is doing this, not the council member's office.
Excuse me, a CUNY tech core to help small businesses adopt digital technologies, which we know they need right now during the pandemic, and another recommendation is to expand career and technical education in public schools, which is actually decreased.
Statistics that is, after a push from the comptroller's office in my last second, I, will give what what is the standard disclosure now that I too will be at the Monday meeting, certainly looking forward to seeing the mayor's plan and what he has in store as this process unfolds and look forward to joining future conversations around that as well, thanks, Luke and now moving on to Matt Green from Speaker, Johnson's, Office and Matt's here with us tonight, because today is Pat, Comerford's, birthday, so Matt green here with Corey Johnson's office.
We are also for the second year in a row partnering with aid for AIDS we're collecting unused and unexpired medicine for people who lack access to them, and this is going to be taking place on Wednesday October 28th from 12 P.M to 3 P.M at the New York City AIDS memorial park at St, Vincent's triangle.
Like, and the council will continue to look at ways to make sure the city is being responsive to the needs of the restaurants and nearby residents.
You know, I do hear questions about the fee and the concern around the propane, storage and You know it is a critically important program to small businesses and restaurants, and we want to make sure that it continues successfully And we're committed to working with the board.
So that, in our view, is definitely concerning and we're working hard to figure out what the best next step should be related to ensuring that folks are able to stay in their houses and in their homes same with everyone else related to Monday's meeting with department of City planning.
What's going on with that, we encourage everyone to vote early and that's all for me right, now, great thanks, Eliana.
Why I live on Thompson and my and Bleecker, and my friends in the West Washington Square Village, usually would be doing early voting at Saint Anthony's on Houston and Sullivan, and now we have to go to Madison Park, but people in Washington Street.
Or I do not even know how you get to the bus through public transportation from here, So like determining voting, I just wanted you know.
Do, not worry, but I want the community board to realize that we are talking about a serious epidemic which is going coming into its second wave.
So, it's very complicated, and I, really I just want to remind people that the meeting on Monday really should be focusing in on city planning and talking to them.
Specifically the sixth Precinct Community Council Actually looks like it came out all right, okay and third thing.
I wanted to ask you if what you're implying is that your idea of a properly spooky and disturbing Halloween is a personal greeting from Committee Board to Chair Carter booth read into it, read into it what you will thanks, cormac, all right, I believe, since we do not take our first vote so Valerie.
John Paul, De Verna, here, Doris Ether, Air, Robert, Ealy, Zillier, Mark Fitzgerald here for Max play here: After last month's full board meeting, there was three weeks that people could self- nominate and make their submissions to to district manager gormley for all positions, and then after that was closed, there'd be nominations from the floor, so I'm going to start off with a report from Bob. My apologies, there were five self nominations: carter booth nominated himself for Chair, Susan, Kent, the second Vice Chair Valerie De, La, Rosa, Secretary, Amy, Brenner assistant Secretary and Anthony Wong, Treasurer.
So I think that we should consider those first I probably should have started off saying this I'd like to do this as a block vote, so that we can just start moving items into an omnibus vote that we can vote on at the end.
Okay, seeing no objections, we're going to move all those into the omnibus vote.
SLA committee meeting number two sure we had 11 applications that we heard I'll just go through the first.
So let me know We're going to vote on sending this back to the committee.
