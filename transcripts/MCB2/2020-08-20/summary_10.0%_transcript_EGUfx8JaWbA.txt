Saturday event give me a second I: am calling from the mayor's office to end domestic and gender-based violence, I'd like to inform the public and especially cosmetologists, because we do offer free and confidential services to any survivor and their children experiencing domestic or gender-based violence at this time, despite their immigration status, despite their income despite their gender, despite any status and I'm reaching out to cosmetologists and salons, because right now, since salons are open, we'd have we have survivors who are entering salons and they may more feel more comfortable, speaking out to salons and cosmetologists, and so we'd like to reach out to those cosmetologists to better educate them and inform them how to treat a disclosure that they've received from a survivor So. If anybody is interested and I'll share my email, if anybody knows of any cosmetologist or someone that are willing to hear more about how they can better interact with the survivor when they do encounter a disclosure and then for also I, will be sharing my contact information and the family justice centers, where they are providing virtual services.
If there are any elected officials who would like to provide a report, if you guys could raise your hands- Welcome, hey everyone, luke wolf from city, comptroller, scott stringer's office, I just want to talk a little bit about our small business plan.
An hour plan has three sections really focused on main street businesses:: small businesses, mom and pop throughout the city The first section is on supporting struggling businesses, and that includes things like providing tax credits to cover reopening costs, creating a new york city tech corps to help small businesses adopt digital tools, so they can transition to online, which is more important right now than ever, or allowing businesses to cure periods.
You can also request absentee ballots, starting today, usually there's a relatively short window before the election You plan that vote absentee would be a good idea to begin requesting them now and get you know, get that process in early and get them in early, because, obviously, there's been a lot of complicated issues with the post office and with the boards processing them, and we also made it clear that ballots that are postmarked on the day of the election up to and including the day of election will count, and we previously passed a bill that said if they received the day after the election, even if they don't bear a postmark, they will also count.
That will exacerbate all kinds of problems, including the inability of people to pay rent, but we are so we're still pushing for a large infusion of money for a variety of things, but in this case, particularly to help cover rent, and we have a bill that we've been working on that is intended to make sure new york state is ready to move if that money materializes to cover people's rent and that's been pending for a while , we call it c-wrap the Covid-19 emergency relief, emergency, rent assistance program we're hoping to make sure that is safe and that the schools are ready to accommodate all of the students and the families and the school personnel that have to be involved.
You know people are having trouble paying taxes right now and as an inducement to get people involved in the program to overcome the skepticism of miss sands and others, and we're going to design it The goal is to design it in such a way that business people who are trying to do the right thing will have some incentives to do that and work with their tenants, both on the property owner side and the and the tenant side.
Now it's become a staple of keeping people in their homes over the long term, We're hoping that this kind of thing will catch on and become a normal approach, because there's a lot of public interest in making sure businesses continue to thrive in our thank you, yep thanks and one last question before we move on from janine kylie senator cavanaugh I just want to push another educational point, which is also resolution anywhere from three to five days a week, and we so whatever happens with schools.
Small group teaching my kids last year, one in kindergarten, a brief question, because we really need to well I will look at your resolution at night and that will certainly influence the way we think about this The school cuts as well, which you know is tomorrow at 4 pm I, will be sharing the aforementioned hearing on the courts.
Think Manhattan is pinching up more than other boroughs, but it's still not great, but just so you know we're trying every aspect that we can I want to just talk about the school because there's a little nuance, which will make you even more upset being than everybody else.
Picking up on what janine was talking about so we're now in conversations with the executive superintendent every single day in the part of Manhattan, we now have a list of all the schools who needs apparently, according to them the kinds of devices that are not happening or what the school needs to make and I agree with you 100 what the learning at home, better I, know: schools, middle school in a good neighborhood in terms of the quality of the students when students come from all over, but they have an excellent principal ap and so on It's pretty no matter what neighborhood you and good challenge in between high income, low income, big problems, so we have to improve, and the second thing is I totally agree: I can't tell you how many people complain that they were on for half an hour if that and then in the suburban schools, four or five hours teacher and student requirement, and then I would do arts and social emotional where necessary, Perhaps at the school.
The senior centers are not open, I haven't heard when they are gonna open Community I've got a couple of questions first from georgia Madam president, when you were here last month, you said you were going to be speaking with principals in the borough to sort of assess where they are in terms of outdoor learning You had that conversation and There are many reasons, but one of which is my the school in my neighborhood they're, really focusing on open streets to use for drop off and pick up and are sort of hesitant to use open streets for outdoor learning and play because of this DOE position that students need to be in the classroom for the five hours of instruction.
It's money for I would call it rich and mortar I'm, just wondering if you felt it would be more productive and efficient all around if the department of ed just stopped the fiction that they will open schools and admit that they won't, because you and I think know that they won't and spend some time trying to improve the quality of the remote education, because it wasn't good in this last few months and I.
So, let's change your focus, but you also, you feel a little upset, because when people tell you who are administrators at the department of education offline that they wish that the oe had spent months and months working on the virtual right, which is what you just said and did that during this time period, then you know what you just said is correct, but they didn't Those are the quote-unquote data, so I go visiting If, you can't be home.
If there's been any conversation because of the 48-hour turnaround period with partnering with DOE new york city, schools thanks I definitely will bring that back to our office and see if there's anything that we can do and if that's at all possible, because that's a really great idea and super important in terms of making sure that people are properly tested before they get in So I will definitely bring that back to our office and I.
But when looking back at our past meetings, we generally take a roll call vote on the first item, but we haven't been doing that, but I'm going to go ahead just a second Everybody we're going to move on to our first committee report of sla, licensing, donna or bob, which one of you is going to be presenting Crypto dens I think is how you say that restaurant wine, they were essentially transfers the same method of operation as before.
Reggio on mcdougall street That was a deny unless and then for 401 west grand was for a new op and a private members club, and that was a deny I read all of those I can't remember which one, but a number of the a number of them in our community board are closing so like in past months, I'm going to move to move all 12 of these items and these resolutions into an omnibus bill that we can vote on at the end of the at the end of the business session?.
Okay, seeing no objection we're going to move those two resolutions into the omnibus resolution vote and last committee report is the bylaws working group.
We would also have people having sort of a whole year of service before they're asked to vote so that they're best informed about what the offices are and who is running for them.
The main goal of this section was to eliminate the elections, the elections committee, which was which, over time, we felt really didn't, contribute much to the process and, in fact, could create variances from year to year, The point the whole goal was to basically create a detailed standardized process within our bylaws that will allow our candidates to for elections, to run smoothly and for information not to flow through any sort of temporarily established group, but directly to our members and, let's see number three being electronic voting.
Don't want to seem personal, eliminating the elections committee when when it was not just me, but it was other people as well and also that I'm interested in knowing why a secret voting and third , when we spoke, you spoke about new people on the board, Maybe not know who the people are who's going to be representing them.
No, is this second shirley second shirt, probably two section one, According to term limits, I would like to call out section three regarding what I think is an excellent section, but might need a little bit touching up, and that is electronic voting So it looks like people want to discuss sections one two and three.
So susan We realized that, if you, if we hold elections and terms of office, start as of december, one, anyone who will be term limited at or is in their last year will basically be barred from running for office, and this would include obviously, some of our most experienced members and it was It, was felt that it would simplify things a great deal if the term limit the terms of service on the board were aligned with terms of office, so that we wouldn't have people and there will be actually a large number of people.
First of all, as I said when we changed them five years ago, it was because we felt that newly appointed members, whose terms started in april really didn't have enough time to learn about the people they'd be voting for if elections were held in may so, which is the was the logic behind moving them to november If you're giving people more time to learn about the board and it- and I.
Think many of us have found that it takes months, sometimes years to learn that having people participate in their first election when they've been through an entire year in the life of the board, will actually increase their knowledge.
And you know, let's concentrate on electronic voting I, think the basis of it makes a lot of sense, but one when you run just the percent the odds of five people out of 51 choosing the eighth year.
Did the exact same thing that the current proposal is that we had an election for an abbreviated term, but I just I think that having two elections within four months is really a waste of time Other than that I support it I think what beau just said makes a lot of sense to me as well, but at the same time the whole reasoning behind changing the bylaws is a really good one which is aligning terms of office with the terms of other boards is really smart.
It aligns us with the membership committee rules, for instance, at the river park advisory written but, as surely was saying and in speaking with corey's office, they're really trying hard to eliminate that eight-year term limit, and there are a lot of years- I think I'm not opposed to the electronic voting or keeping it private so that there's no retribution against those and seeing those votes so that no one's punished for their vote, especially if it's an election, that's contested and I definitely think eventually that we should have elections that result in new officers in april and I had brought up the same question at exec last week because I just it just didn't make sense to me to do this separate four-month election I was glad some other people are questioning.
I understand all the surround that you're saying but I'm in favor of that route instead of the separate four-month election Thank you and thank you again to all the hard work by the bylaws committee meeting weekly to work on this and I know that your committee has really thought these things through and has thought and has had the foresight to think of all the different ways that this could go.
It sounds like there's going to be an objection to that, so some allow people to vote on the different sections when we, when we get to that point, I guess I, guess I'm in support of it as it's written In fact it's addressing a change in the law that has occurred.
There was a concern that if, for you know a longer term would do you know, deny the board as much say as possible, and this way maximizes it first I'd like to just say that for the last five years, as things have changed, I want to thank not only the hard-working committee members on the nominating committee of which I chaired as well as the election committee on which I chaired all of the members of my peers who voted for us, However I, do take exception to the comment that was made that the election committee did not contribute much to the process.
Okay, well, secret voting is the norm in our society and all of our elections In fact, the idea that we have open ballots is rather atypical and people.
Actually, the idea that it's I don't see how the public would be served because you know where this is I, think one of the board has it where it's it's mandated to be public I have never heard of anyone having taking personal reprisals against someone who did not vote for them.
My personal experience I was kept off the board for a year because I would not share who I was going to vote for chair of the board when I was originally appointed by former borough president virginia fields and Provided me with my appointment letter, even though I was called down and attended the training as having been appointed to the board I it made, it seem like someone on community board.
But I don't think that this vote, which does have ramifications king just said it and I, think that it should be within the board and I think that your vote is sacred to you and nobody should be looking over your shoulder and saying Ah, you didn't vote for me Now. You didn't vote for me, so that's where I'm coming I just want to make sure everybody on the board that we're clear that the votes within board members are very different from personnel issues within the office and I was getting ready to say that matt I was only going to mention that I was originally very hesitant to endorse secret balloting until I looked into it and most of the party leadership in dc, because it's a party election for who gets you know put up, for you know speaker of the house or whatever is by secret ballot, and it got me a lot more comfortable with the idea, as was the impeachment trial.
Okay, all right so have we concluded the discussions on the election of officers So now we're going to move on to the third section, which is the electronic voting I would like to, as everyone else has done, congratulate the committee on an excellent job of putting forward some very comprehensive recommendations to amend the bylaws and I'm only going to address the electronic voting, which I think is very complicated and difficult to figure out in the introduction.
excellent point: people who are going to be entitled to know how anyone voted but the rest of us First of all, as others have said, susan to you and everybody on your committee, great work, My law, stuff is ruling, and thank you addressing this section.
Their name in They could be a first term person or a first few months person and you don't know who they are no vote for Two minutes is an awful long time in communication terms, actually for people to speak and for people to talk and I.
You really there's people on the board, I, don't I, know better than others and for a whole lot of reasons and I'm sure the rest of you all can say that about yourself, but when it comes to vote to putting your name down.
Okay thanks, georgia, I'm honestly utterly confused about the different sections of this conversation at this point, we're discussing section two, the election of the officers right now and now I've sort of lost the thread because it's been a very long conversation When we might vote on this or as rocio Maybe, we could say that they have the option of speaking or sending in a letter , that's distributed to the entire board before the election, explaining their vision of what they want to do and I.
