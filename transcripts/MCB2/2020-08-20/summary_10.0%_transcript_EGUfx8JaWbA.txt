For wanting to speak to you tonight, very briefly, was just to inform you that we are going to be having our public board meeting on september, 9th at 6 00 p.m. Again.
I am calling from the mayor's office to end domestic and gender-based violence, I'd like to inform the public and especially cosmetologists, because we do offer free and confidential services to any survivor and their children experiencing domestic or gender-based violence at this time, despite their immigration status, despite their income despite their gender, despite any status.
If there are any elected officials who would like to provide a report, if you guys could raise your hands- Welcome, hey everyone, luke, wolf from city, comptroller, scott stringer's, office.
The first section is on supporting struggling businesses, and that includes things like providing tax credits to cover reopening costs, creating a new york city tech corps to help small businesses adopt digital tools, so they can transition to online, which is more important right now than ever, or allowing businesses to cure.
I. Just have one really quick update wanted to let everybody know that we're going to get a new green market at astor place, so it is next tuesday august 25th at 11 a.m. Carlina will be there, along with village alliance for NYC and other members, to have a ribbon cutting for a new green market which is located on east 8th street in lafayette.
Because, obviously, there's been a lot of complicated issues with the post office and with the boards processing them, and we also made it clear that ballots that are postmarked on the day of the election up to and including the day of election will count, and we previously passed a bill that said if they received the day after the election, even if they don't bear a postmark, they will also count.
The state housing agency, received about 90 000 applications for that they are processing them and that is again a limited program, but an important first step that will pay people's rent from April May, June and July They are low income and lost less their income due to Covid-19 We're still pushing for a much larger approach that will require federal funding.
That will exacerbate all kinds of problems, including the inability of people to pay rent, but we are so we're still pushing for a large infusion of money for a variety of things, but in this case, particularly to help cover rent, and we have a bill that we've been working on that is intended to make sure new york state is ready to move.
And, I think, still giving and receiving input about how that's going to work as that reopens, but we're hoping to make sure that is safe and that the schools are ready to accommodate all of the students and the families and the school personnel that have to be involved.
I'm glad you mentioned it, but you should look at the resolution that I believe the community board is going to pass tonight that the school's committee got together.
I know a lot of the private schools have made the decision that they're not opening at the beginning of the year they're going to delay and see how it looks.
We want, like the element of personal trust, does not obviate the need for a system-wide solution that is right to getting those questions right, because there's a public health, There's public health issues that go beyond the people who are actually in the buildings.
The school cuts as well, which you know is tomorrow at 4 p.m. I, will be sharing the aforementioned hearing on the courts at that point, And I will say we're going to have a hard time doing anything that people want.
So I strongly hope that you will consider that, and I would ask you to look at programs that have figured out a way to have live, zoom instruction, all day long with the kids having to even raise their hands to go to the bathroom act, just as if they're in the classroom, if they're not able to go to school or their family doesn't feel comfortable.
I heard this morning at the borough board and I'm sure you know, this- We have to change the open meeting law.
Just let you know we haven't, got an answer on that, but I have heard confidence from people who actually like to be able to participate in a different way.
Yes good evening, madam president, when you were here last month, you said you were going to be speaking with principals in the borough to sort of assess where they are in terms of outdoor learning, and so I'm curious.
We're gonna keep trying, but if your school needs help on something, let me know- Yes, can I'd like to talk if you want later off lying with you about this funding that brian gave to harlem to the school districts?
Hi, I'm, just wondering if you felt it would be more productive and efficient all around if the department of ed just stopped the fiction that they will open schools and admit that they won't, because you and I think, know that they won't and spend some time trying to improve the quality of the remote education, because it wasn't good in this.
Last few months, And I think all this time spent on this nonsense: they're not going to open the schools.
We know that so let's change your focus, but you also, you feel a little upset, because when people tell you who are administrators at the department of education offline that they wish that the oe had spent months and months working on the virtual right, which is what you just said and did that during this time period, then you know what you just said is correct, but they didn't.
If there's been any conversation because of the 48-hour turnaround period with partnering with DOE new york city, schools, thanks I definitely will bring that back to our office and see if there's anything that we can do and if that's at all possible, because that's a really great idea and super important in terms of making sure that people are properly tested before they get in.
Think that's all the elected officials that we had one second here, that we had that we're going to provide the reports.
I know this sounds fairly simplistic, but it really keeps the bins from overflowing and that's something that definitely a big issue And I believe that susannah aarons is going to be addressing that with a social services meeting next month, and we also had a committee meeting for the reopening working group, the restarting together universities that went very well The new school walked us through their plans for welcoming students back to campus, and that was of note for our local businesses and our community next month.
But when looking back at our past meetings, we generally take a roll call vote on the first item, but we haven't been doing that, but I'm going to go ahead And I'll take her just a second.
So, like in past months, I'm, going to move to move all 12 of these items and these resolutions into an omnibus bill that we can vote on at the end of the at the end of the business session?
Schools, therefore, be it resolved that community board 2 urges the mayor and his deputies to function as school reopening czars to ensure that the new york city department of transportation and depart in the department of education implement a fast-tracked and streamlined open streets program to close streets around schools before the expected start of the 2020-2021 fall public school term.
And I just want to thank the schools committee, especially for the second resolution, especially the third item, which is that school should only be reopened if they are safe, not just for children and teachers, but all the other staff that work at the school janitorial staff lunch staff.
I know you're going to say it's not safe forever, because they don't want to work.
We would also have people having sort of a whole year of service before they're asked to vote so that they're best informed about what the offices are and who is running for them.
The belief was that it was unfair to ask new members to vote for candidates whom they did not know, so the elections were moved from may to november.
Don't want to seem personal, eliminating the elections committee when when it was not just me, but it was other people as well and Also that I'm interested in knowing why a secret voting and third , when we spoke, you spoke about new people on the board.
According to term limits, I would like to call out section three regarding what I think is an excellent section, but might need a little bit touching up, and that is electronic voting.
It was because we felt that newly appointed members, whose terms started in April really didn't have enough time to learn about the people they'd be voting for if elections were held in may so, which is the was the logic behind moving them to november.
If you're giving people more time to learn about the board and it- And I, think many of us have found that it takes months sometimes years to learn that having people participate in their first election when they've been through an entire year in the life of the board, will actually increase their knowledge.
Think the feeling at the time was, is that they were going to work to try to take away tour And then these recent years charter revision comes very regularly and often, and as far as giving people the opportunity to learn about the rights.
I. Just think that the idea of having two elections within four months is really a waste of time, and if you, if you feel the need to change the term, which I think is a good idea.
Think what beau just said makes a lot of sense to me as well, but at the same time the whole reasoning behind changing the bylaws is a really good one which is aligning terms of office with the terms of other boards is really smart.
Written but, as surely was saying, and in speaking with corey's office, they're, really trying hard to eliminate that eight-year term limit, and there are a lot of years- I , think I'm not opposed to the electronic voting or keeping it private so that there's no retribution against those and seeing those votes so that no one's punished for their vote, especially if it's an election, that's contested, but anyway.
We call when we and obviously it seems like people are going to have different votes on different sections?
It sounds like there's going to be an objection to that, so some allow people to vote on the different sections when we, when we get to that point.
I want to reiterate what bob said much more eloquently than I could have and also say that the way that it is written is written in order to provide the board the most amount of say there was a concern that if, for you know a longer term would do.
Yes, first I'd like to just say that for the last five years, as things have changed, I want to thank not only the hard-working committee members on the nominating committee of which I chaired as well as the election committee on which I chaired was an honor, and I.
I, don't know if, if others who served in the last five years on these various boards would feel that way, but I feel compelled as chair to say that and second with the secret voting, how what well,?
Don't think we have anybody else left on this, but let me just make sure, and is there anybody else who wants to speak to number one, the special term, the important meeting I'll call you when I'm finished?, Okay, susan, you have any issue with moving to section two And I understand the will the interest in moving in a deliberate way, just to sort of reiterate the working groups.
Think we've concluded the discussion on section one on special terms, so we'll move on to section two, which is the election of officers.
Okay, thanks adam, I was just going to point out that I'm, not sure I see the parallel between you know our voting for our chair Then the american experience of voting for an elected official You know voting for the chair is a And I think that other deliberative assemblies have public open elections for those board positions, not necessarily universally about I'm.
But somebody from the board called me up and asked me who I was going to vote for, and I said I'm, not comfortable, sharing that with you and kind of my appointment letter, so that was communicated to the borough president.
I, don't know of other people who have worked in the last five years on these committees.
I understand this hesitation about making it public because people can well what team just said you know be upset with who you voted for, on the other hand, that maybe that problem or that intimidation should be addressed, and I am for open ballot because we're community representatives.
That's, an important decision, an important vote and people in the community are entitled to know who supported and how many- And you know, I just think that our votes should be public.
I. Think that's important, that people know where you stand.
I mean there are other things that we vote on in private people's raises We close the entire board to the public for that there's, No, foil, , there's no video, and I just feel that I'm not sure it's the public's right to know how you voted for chair.
You didn't vote for me, so that's where I'm coming I just want to make sure everybody on the board that we're clear that the votes within board members are very different from personnel issues within the office, and I was getting ready to say that matt I was only going to mention that I was originally very hesitant to endorse secret balloting until I looked into it and most of the party leadership in dc, because it's a party election for who gets you know, put up, For you know, speaker of the house or Whatever, is by secret ballot, and it got me a lot more comfortable with the idea, as was the impeachment trial.
Okay, I think, given the fact that there are those of us who don't agree with this secret ballot, that would that be a separate vote.
I, would like to, as everyone else has done, congratulate the committee on an excellent job of putting forward some very comprehensive recommendations to amend the bylaws and I'm only going to address the electronic voting, which I think is very complicated and difficult to figure out in the introduction.
I think we need clarification before we're asked to vote on this section as to how that would work.
You committee for your excellent work , The question: becomes:: are the records open for examination, The people who are doing the tallying know what the who voted for whom right?, excellent point, people who are going to be entitled to know how anyone voted, but the rest of us First of all, as others have said, susan to you and everybody on your committee.
We have electronic voting as opposed to the other Or Yeah, I'm, just going to jump in because gail actually addressed this when she was speaking to us, because this is determined by the governor's suspension of the public officer's law.
I think sandy did see something in the electronic voting, which is true, but the thing is: there's the We recognized that when we did it, but the caveat gives us time to work on it.
They could be a first term person or a first few months person and you don't know who they are, and I agree with shirley that you Why they're running and their experience and, as I said, there's, no, yes or No vote for Two minutes is an awful long time in communication, terms, actually for people to speak and for people to talk, and I.
Just don't think that it should be an obligation or requirement if people feel like people know me And, they can vote for me or not.
If, you really there's people on the board, I, don't, I, know better than others and for a whole lot of reasons.
Section one, which is the special term, is going to be one vote.
The special term is how people will vote on that section.
I- think when you phrase it as to vote yes on the secret ballot.
