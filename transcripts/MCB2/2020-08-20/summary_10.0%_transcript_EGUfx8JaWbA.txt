For wanting to speak to you tonight, very briefly, was just to inform you that we are going to be having our public board meeting on September 9th at 6:00 P.M. Again.
I am calling from the mayor's office to end domestic and gender, based violence, I'd like to inform the public and especially cosmetologists, because we do offer free and confidential services to any survivor and their children experiencing domestic or gender- based violence at this time, despite their immigration status, despite their income despite their gender, despite any status.
If there are any elected officials who would like to provide a report, if you guys could raise your hands- Everyone, Luke Wolf from City Comptroller, Scott, Stringer's, office.
The first section is on supporting struggling businesses, and that includes things like providing tax credits to cover reopening costs, creating a New, York City Tech Corps, to help small businesses adopt digital tools, so they can transition to online, which is more important right now than ever, or allowing businesses to cure.
The second section is on supporting entrepreneurs and new businesses, so providing tax incentives to entrepreneurs in high vacancy areas, which CB2 has some of or creating a re- entrepreneurship program, so that, if you're an entrepreneur, and you had your business for many years and are trying to retire.
We also have a piece of legislation called the Small Business Recovery Lease act, working on this with They, sent me over and Brad Lander and Keith powers, but this would create a new program where the city can link property tax abatements with long- term, affordable leases for businesses.
Because, obviously, there's been a lot of complicated issues with the post office and with the boards processing them, and we also made it clear that ballots that are postmarked on the day of the election up to and including the day of election will count, and we previously passed a bill that said if they received the day after the election, even if they do not bear a postmark, they will also count.
The state housing agency received about 90,000 applications for that they are processing them and that is again a limited program, but an important first step that will pay people's rent from April May, June and July They are low income and lost less their income due to Covid-19 We're still pushing for a much larger approach that will require federal funding.
And, I think, still giving and receiving input about how that's going to work as that reopens, but We're, hoping to make sure that is safe and that the schools are ready to accommodate all of the students and the families and the school personnel that have to be involved.
I think that there are many areas where the city can not act independently, and there are many where they can Obviously, we do not have the right to simply abridge or void contracts at any level of government in the without some constitutional questions being answered, but I do not have an opinion about whether it's, whether it's something they have the authority to do.
I'm glad you mentioned it, but you should look at the resolution that I believe the community board is going to pass tonight that the school's committee got together.
The ventilation system is a mess, so both the teachers and the children need safe, schools, and just please you know, do what you can to make sure that we do not open precipitously I.
I know a lot of the private schools have made the decision that they're not opening at the beginning of the year they're going to delay and see how it looks in late, September or October, and so again we're looking at it closely.
, I think we, I would say we need to get the system, our decision right, but even whatever we decide system- wide, you probably want some discretion for people to say: I'm, not.
You would have to have some longer- term affordability element to participate in that particular program, but we're hoping that the city will be willing to put real resources behind that and make the benefits generous enough to incentivize property owners to take the deal- And you know, I will just note that high unaffordability of storefronts to small businesses that we really care deeply about in our communities is not a it's, not a new issue.
I mean this really needs to be robust and there can not be minimums that I mean there need to be minimums at least that each school that each teacher, provides- And I, know that as a state official- You do not have a ton of power over this, but this is a matter of money, and this is a matter of pushing back on all the different entities that want to limit the quality of the remote learning.
The schools are all also seeing funding reductions at a time when they actually need more funding to accommodate the multiple ways, people are learning, so it is a big fight.
The school cuts as well, which you know is tomorrow at 4, And I will say we're going to have a hard time doing anything that people want.
Albert, hi, I'm, just wondering if you felt it would be more productive and efficient all around if the department of Ed just stopped the fiction that they will open schools and admit that they won't, because you and I think, know that they won't and spend some time trying to improve the quality of the remote education, because it was not good in this last few months.
And I think all this time spent on this nonsense: they're not going to open the schools.
You feel a little upset, because when people tell you who are administrators at the Department of Education Offline that they wish that the oe had spent months and months working on the virtual right, which is what you just said and did that during this time period, then you know what you just said is correct, but they did not.
If you know of anyone or any group who needs help with that, please feel free to contact our office and that's basically it for this month.
I think everyone knows it, but having all these public announcements encouraging people to get tested Three weeks, later, it's just completely a public disservice.
We've had a lot of people that are, you know, work in different things, reach.
If there's been any conversation because of the 48-hour turnaround period with partnering with DOE New York City schools thanks I definitely will bring that back to our office and see if there's anything that we can do and if that's at all possible, because that's a really great idea and super important in terms of making sure that people are properly tested before they get in.
Think that's all the elected officials that we had one second here, that we had that we're going to provide the reports.
I know this sounds fairly simplistic, but it really keeps the bins from overflowing and that's something that definitely a big issue With a social services meeting next month, and we also had a committee meeting for the reopening working group, the restarting together universities that went very well And, the new school walked us through their plans for welcoming students back to campus, and that was of note for our local businesses and our community.
But when looking back at our past meetings, we generally take a roll call vote on the first item, but we have not been doing that, but I'm going to go ahead And I'll, take her just a second.
So, like in past months, I'm, going to move to move all 12 of these items and these resolutions into an omnibus bill that we can vote on at the end of the at the end of the business session?
I'm, going to turn my video off because it says it's unstable, which must include daily, live instruction via video, professional development and planning time in trauma, informed schooling and three insist that the DOE ensure that school buildings reopen only when they are safe for all teachers, student and staff, which must include fully functioning HVAC, systems, operable windows and well ventilated spaces, city, funded, PPE and city funded frequent Covid-19 testing, again Okay, thank you, janine, and to your committee for all your hard work this month and in the past few months on all these items.
And I just want to thank the Schools Committee, especially for the second resolution, especially the third item, which is that school should only be reopened if they are safe, not just for children and teachers, but all the other staff that work at the school janitorial Staff Lunch, staff.
That's, not really reasonable, so I think, having some sort of definition at least sets a threshold, that's by some expert, not by just a very nervous, ill- informed parent This is a complex thing, but this is more of a political statement, because we've passed many resolutions that have had you know, ad nauseam, footnotes and whatnot, so The end of the day.
Just I feel, like the unions, are definitely they need to get their act together and figure out how to instruct these kids Well they're only focusing on safe right now , I, know you're going to say it's not safe forever because they do not want to work.
Seeing no objection we're going to move those two resolutions into the omnibus resolution vote and last committee report.
We would also have people having sort of a whole year of service before they're asked to vote so that they're best informed about what the offices are and who is running for them.
The belief was that it was unfair to ask new members to vote for candidates whom they did not know, so the elections were moved from May to November.
I do have a question about the purpose of Elect And I do not want to seem personal, eliminating the elections committee when when it was not just me, but it was other people as well and also that I'm interested in knowing why a secret voting and third , when we spoke, you spoke about new people on the board.
According to term limits, right, okay, one I would like to call out section three regarding what I think is an excellent section, but might need a little bit touching up, and that is electronic voting.
So it looks like people want to discuss sections one two and three so Susan.
If you're giving people more time to learn about the board and it- And I think many of us have found that it takes months sometimes years to learn that having people participate in their first election when they've been through an entire year in the life of the board, will actually increase their knowledge.
Think the feeling at the time was, is that they were going to work to try to take away tour And then these recent years charter revision comes very regularly and often, and as far as giving people the opportunity to learn about the rights.
Why should we be considering having two elections and they would be two of two full elections, regardless of even if one is only for four months, and why would we want to go to the trouble of that here, as it is we're going to have a tremendously challenging thing before us when we are doing the electronic voting?
Electronic, voting, okay, I, think the basis of it makes a lot of sense, but one when you run just the percent.
I. Just think that the idea of having two elections within four months is really a waste of time, and if you, if you feel the need to change the term, which I think is a good idea, why do not?
Great work, that's been done in this I think what beau just said makes a lot of sense to me as well, but at the same time the whole reasoning behind changing the bylaws is a really good one which is aligning terms of office with the terms of other boards is really smart.
Thank you and thank you again to all the hard work by the Bylaws Committee meeting weekly to work on this, and I know that your committee has really thought these things through and has thought and has had the foresight to think of all the different ways that this could go.
We call when we and obviously it seems like people are going to have different votes on different sections?
It sounds like there's going to be an objection to that, so some allow people to vote on the different sections when we, when we get to that point.
Yes, first I'd like to just say that, for the last five years, as things have changed, I want to thank not only the hard- working committee members on the Nominating committee, of which I chaired as well as the election committee on which I chaired was an honor, and However, I, do take exception to the comment that was made that the Election committee did not contribute much to the process.
If others who served in the last five years on these various boards would feel that way, but I feel compelled as chair to say that and second with the secret voting, What's the merit and secret voting Do not have this be too confusing about the election committee that did not contribute much to the process.
Do not think we have anybody else left on this, but let me just make sure, and is there anybody else who wants to speak to number one, the special term, the important meeting I'll call you when I'm finished, okay, Susan, you have any issue with moving to section two The interest in moving in a deliberate way, just to sort of reiterate the working groups.
So I think we've concluded the discussion on section one on special terms, so we'll move on to section two, which is the election of officers.
Even though I was called down and attended the training as having been appointed to the board, I mean this is not you know in that distant, the past, but I'm not supporting either way, because I think everybody's got their strong positions on this, but it has happened.
But somebody from the board called me up and asked me who I was going to vote for, and I said I'm, not comfortable, sharing that with you and kind of my appointment letter, so that was communicated to the borough president, who then declined to send the letter.
I do not know of other people who have worked in the last five years on these committees.
I understand this hesitation about making it public because people can well what team just said you know be upset with who you voted for, on the other hand, that maybe that problem or that intimidation should be addressed, and I am for open ballot because we're community representatives.
That's, an important decision, an important vote and people in the community are entitled to know who supported and how many- You know, I just think that our votes should be public.
I, think that's important, that people know where you stand well, If it has.
I mean there are other things that we vote on in private people's raises We close the entire board to the public for that.
There's, no video, and I just feel that I'm not sure it's the public's right to know how you voted for chair.
I would agree with you all things that we vote on that affects the public that we that resolutions it should be should be open.
I just want to make sure everybody on the board that we're clear that the votes within board members are very different from personnel issues within the office, and I was getting ready to say that Matt I was only going to mention that I was originally very hesitant to endorse secret balloting until I looked into it and most of the party leadership in Dc, because it's a party election for who gets you know, put up, For you know, speaker of the house or Whatever, is by secret ballot, and it got me a lot more comfortable with the idea, as was the impeachment trial.
Okay, I think, given the fact that there are those of us who do not agree with this secret ballot, that would that be a separate vote.
I would like to, as everyone else has done, congratulate the committee on an excellent job of putting forward some very comprehensive recommendations to amend the bylaws and I'm only going to address the electronic voting, which I think is very complicated and difficult to figure out in the introduction.
I think we need clarification before we're asked to vote on this section as to how that would work.
Becomes: are the records open for examination, the people who are doing the tallying know what the who voted for whom right?
Excellent point: people who are going to be entitled to know how anyone voted, but the rest of us First of all, as others have said, Susan to you and everybody on your committee, great work, And I know it was a lot of work.
We have electronic voting as opposed to the other Or Yeah, I'm, just going to jump in because Gail actually addressed this when she was speaking to us, because this is determined by the governor's suspension of the public officer's law.
I think Sandy did see something in the electronic voting, which is true, but the thing is: there's the We recognized that when we did it, but the caveat gives us time to work on it.
They could be a first term person or a first few months person and you do not know who they are, and I agree with Shirley that you Why they're running and their experience and, as I said, there's, no, yes or No vote for Two minutes is an awful long time in communication, terms, actually for people to speak and for people to talk, and I.
Just do not think that it should be an obligation or requirement if people feel like people know me And, they can vote for me or not.
There's going to be a vote on one portion of it, which is the secret ballot and then on the section as a whole, and then on section three and section Going to ask and people We can note the exceptions, so it would be voting for section one, which is the special term section.
The special term is how people will vote on that section.
I- think when you phrase it as to vote yes on the secret ballot.
