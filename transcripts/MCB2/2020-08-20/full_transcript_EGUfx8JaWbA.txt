I am here to speak with the community to ask and inform them that we do offer gender. We still have family justice centers that are open in each borough. Virtually we are taking in calls virtually, and so we would also trying to better educate anybody who does encounter a victim of gender-based or domestic violence, keep in mind client-centered. So we do. I can't understand xena we're having we're having trouble, they're asking you don't enforce or or we don't enforce or change their decisions in what they would like to do. So I will put my contact information: hey xena, we're having we're having a lot of trouble hearing you. If any way you can get to somewhere, where you have better connection and I'll. Allow you to give your testimony, because I think it's important again, but we couldn't hear the majority of what you've had with us xena. Can you hear me no okay, I'm gonna move on to our next speaker and and I'll recall, xena. Our next speaker is timothy harrell from the civilian complaint review board. Can you hear me now? Yes do you want to? Yes, we can hear you. Can you hear me now? Yes, okay, I'm gonna just have timothy go ahead and then give you a chance to get your connection there. If you're able to improve it- timothy, yes good evening, community booktube, thank you for allowing me this opportunity to speak, I'm to make it very brief. My name is isaina. If you could just hold on we'll recall you when we're ready. Yes, my name is timothy harrell, I'm an outreach coordinator with the new york city, civilian complaint review board, as most of you may or may not know we're a new york city agency independent from the NYPD, and what we do is we investigate mediate and in some cases we prosecute allegations of misconduct against members of the NYPD. My purpose for wanting to speak to you tonight very briefly, was just to inform you that we are going to be having our public board meeting on september 9th at 6 00 p.m. It is also a virtual meeting, it's held in a town hall fashion. Again these meetings are held in an effort to improve police community relations by inviting members of the community, as well as members of the NYPD to have a conversation and try to create a dialogue between these two. In an effort to improve that relationship, I will send more notice to your community board to all the community boards within Manhattan, and I'm asking if you could share this information community that you serve. Thank you great thanks, timothy and our next speaker is barbara. I have my handwriting sure, surely go ahead. Yes, hi timothy, yes hi! My name is shirley smith and I'm a member of the board. I was today in the times that 58 the law 58 been repealed. Did you want to share information about that on the border? That's not part of your presentation. It really wasn't part of my presentation, but what you read was correct. The unions had applied for a stay to at first, so what you read on what was shared as far as what I read as well to stop the the release of that information us from sharing that information with the public and the judge denied that. So we are at liberty to share our information of disciplinary records with the with the public, I'm not sure if that system is set up. Yet I can get that information and get it back to your board as to as far as how that information will be shared and what date that that the system will be updated to allow the public to view the information. As you know, we would like to deal with a lot of transparency and I'm sure that information would be in our data transparency initiative. So at this at this time I don't know exactly when that information will be shared, but I can always ask and find out- and I can get that information to you. Thank you. I think it should be shared with the with the send it to the board of the board office me personally yeah. Yes, I think it's a victory. It took 44 years, but you know 44 years is better than none. Yes, absolutely also a question from another board member in the or inquiring. Where is the mayor's office releasing arrest videos? Can you say that again, where is the mayor's office? Releasing arrest videos, the body camera videos, so they so through the mou through the memorandum of understanding they are to the NYPD is to when we request bodybuild camera footage. They are supposed to surrender that footage to us for review. I know that process had been slowed up with the ongoing climate. I'm gonna use that word, so we have been getting bodybuilding camera footage. It was a little slow sing it. Let me say that I do not know about that. I know that NYPD has been submitting the video footage to straight to our agency when we request it so again. This is the first time I'm actually hearing about that. So I can also ask and find out that information and get it to your board as as soon as possible. Great. Thank you very much. Now we're going to move on to our third speaker and then we're going to come back to xena, so I'll be calling on you after the next speaker is. The next speaker is barbara knight from save the post office. Saturday event give me a second. I will allow you to speak. I don't see you listed on the list if you could raise your hand, okay, I'm not seeing barbara, so I'm gonna go back to xena. Yes, is this better? Yes, much better? Okay! Thank you. My name is xena. I am calling from the mayor's office to end domestic and gender-based violence, I'd like to inform the public and especially cosmetologists, because we do offer free and confidential services to any survivor and their children experiencing domestic or gender-based violence at this time, despite their immigration status, despite their income despite their gender, despite any status. Really we don't have an we're. Not we don't have any disqualifications unless only if you're a survivor, you're eligible and I'm reaching out to cosmetologists and salons, because right now, since salons are open, we'd have we have survivors who are entering salons and they may more feel more comfortable speaking out to salons and cosmetologists, and so we'd like to reach out to those cosmetologists to better educate them and inform them how to treat a disclosure that they've received from a survivor. So if anybody is interested and I'll share my email, if anybody knows of any cosmetologist or someone that are willing to hear more about how they can better interact with the survivor when they do encounter a disclosure and then for also, I will be sharing my contact information and the family justice centers, where they are providing virtual services in the meantime. That is all. Thank you. Everybody, great thanks. Does anybody valerie? Do you recall what the pound is for the phones to mute and unmute, or does anybody else remember what that is? I just want to make sure our other it's star, six, all right, so I have a question sure go ahead, lois! Thank you. How do you prove that you're? A survivor? That's true, the speaker, that's an excellent question, so you would first do an intake and then through that they would do a series of questions to to basically get your understanding of how you were treated and then determined from there if it's a case of a domestic or gender-based violence. So where would you go the family, so you would contact the family justice center within your borough? I will put in the output in that information for each borough in new york city. You would contact them and then they would answer and you could go from there. Okay, do you need I. You can of course documentation that you had violence with the police with them, or domestic violence or police violence you're asking if you've encountered police violence, whether you're yes eligible yes, so I would have to delve in and ask more questions in terms of whether the police officer was anywhere the relationship you had with a police officer or police officer, or this was just a random incident, and then I would go from there. For example, if the poll always showed kind of your husband or was someone somewhat affiliated with you, that is considered a domestic violence situation? Yeah, yes, am I answering your question? Yes, thank you. You're welcome and then also to note our family justice centers are client-centered, so that means we won't enforce or push any client to do something they do not wish to do. For example, if a client does not wish to speak with an NYPD officer, we will not allow them or us speak to them as well on their behalf, hello zena. Can you give us now give us your hotline number for the gender violence yeah? I will put it in the do you want me to say it out loud or put it in the chat right in the chat you can share it in the chat. That's better! Okay, yeah, I'm gonna put I'm gonna put the contact for each family justice center in each of the okay all right. Thank you. Thanks tina carter, my hand is raised, oh sure, go ahead. I had it raised and it was lowered by I left it. I thought it was left from the last speaker, but go ahead. Sorry, yeah xena. I think it's interesting that you're talking about the outreach to ba to beauty shops but remember males, are also victims of domestic violence. So why aren't you guys thinking in terms of barber shops? Is she still on the line? Let me just check, maybe she didn't know she had. That was a question or a comment: xena can you're still with us. I can you hear us, she should still be able to speak, and I don't okay, I think, we've I think we've lost zina there, okay, but that's a great question, dr smith. Okay and I'm gonna go back to barbara knight. I still don't see you in our attendee list and said star six. To raise your hand is that correct? If you are with us, if you press star six on your phone, you might be able to see you and I don't see that we have been calling you this okay. So that's going to conclude our public section of our meeting and we're going to move on to the next section, which is adoption of the agenda. Everybody should have a copy of the agenda that was distributed by bob gormley, our district manager. Is there a motion to adopt the agenda so moves second, adopt the agenda and now we're going to move on to reports to the public. This we're hoping that this will be abbreviated. This is an august meeting, but we're certainly happy to entertain any reports, and I believe that bob has received some reports from elected officials that he'll be distributing if there are any elected officials who would like to provide a report, if you guys could raise your hands- and I will promote you and allow you to speak all right- I have luke start with luke. Welcome, hey everyone, luke wolf from city, comptroller, scott stringer's office. I will keep this brief. I just want to talk a little bit about our small business plan. We came out with it's called our safe main street initiative, and I do want to thank cb2 and valerie and the reopening working group. I was listening to those, and some of our ideas were definitely inspired by your conversation. So thank you for that. An hour plan has three sections really focused on main street businesses: small businesses mom and pop throughout the city. I'll briefly go through some of the main points, but there's 25 recommendations so definitely invite you to take a deeper look yourself. So the first section is on supporting struggling businesses, and that includes things like providing tax credits to cover reopening costs, creating a new york city tech corps to help small businesses adopt digital tools, so they can transition to online, which is more important right now than ever, or allowing businesses to cure periods. So, instead of getting fined for violations right away, they have a period where they can address those, especially during this moment of transition. The second section is on supporting entrepreneurs and new businesses, so providing tax incentives to entrepreneurs in high vacancy areas, which cb2 has some of or creating a re-entrepreneurship program, so that, if you're an entrepreneur- and you had your business for many years and are trying to retire instead of just giving up your business, you can actually sell it to an aspiring entrepreneur. We want to create a sort of network and marketplace for that, and the third section is on building stronger neighborhoods, so one part of that would be. How can we return more of our streetscape to communities like we did successfully with a restaurant program? How can we expand that to other cultural activities? Retail or really other sort of community uses, and also how can we be creative with vacant space? We think that the pandemic will unfortunately, to more vacant space throughout our streetscape. So how can we use that and repurpose that for community use to make sure that, on the landlord side, they're getting some revenue and on the community side, they're getting more benefit and that's not empty space on their streetscape? So those are some of the ideas that we're working with and hopefully the city will adopt, but would love for you to take more of a look and happy to get any feedback on that as well. Great thanks, luke, william. I have a question: hey thanks. Luke is that available online? Can you can you send a link to that or send it around somehow? Yes, I will drop that in the chat. Now thanks rocio. Thank you so much for presenting to our for today. Luke. We all appreciate this. I have a question: does scott stringer consider small mom-and-pop businesses to be benefited by this? I think that I don't know how directly it's addressed, but I think that some of this definitely would benefit a small landlord, so something like using vacant spaces creatively. We think it's for the benefit of everyone. If, for example, the city was able to take some of those spaces instead of having them stay vacant pay the landlord for some sort of community use for it. So I don't know if this directly addresses all small landlords concerns, but there's definitely some proposals in here, which we think would benefit small landlords as well. Okay, thank you. Okay, any other questions: hey thanks, luke and we're gonna move now to ivy rosado from council member carlina rivera's office. Second, here ivy hi, my name is ivy, I'm from councilman carlene rivera's office. I just have one really quick update wanted to let everybody know that we're going to get a new green market at astor place, so it is next tuesday august 25th at 11 a.m. Carlina will be there, along with village alliance for NYC and other members, to have a ribbon cutting for a new green market which is located on east 8th street in lafayette, so moving forward the market's going to be open every tuesday from now on august, 11th up until november 24th and the market hours are going to be from 8, am to 5 pm. So we're really excited to have a new resource for fresh food and vegetables in our district and in addition, our office has been collecting requests from community groups that are in need of PPE. So if you know of any groups that are still looking for masks, love sanitizers, please let our office know, and I will put our office email down in the chat box, so you can send it over to us. That's it great thanks ivy, I don't see any questions from board members, so thank you, and now we have eliana cohen from senator brian kavanaugh's office eliana, it's actually brian myself. Eliana is also on the line, but I'm here to chat with you all personally, so I appreciate the opportunity first of all again, thank you. All for keeping these meetings going and being so productive, it's very important that everybody has this forum just a few brief updates. First of all, the following up on luke's comments from scott stringer's office. We I support a lot of actually what scott. I think the report is terrific and just take a closer look. We also have a piece of legislation called the small business recovery lease act, working on this with you lean new. They sent me over and brad lander and keith powers, but this would create a new program where the city can link property tax abatements with long-term, affordable leases for businesses. It would basically authorize them to set up that program. They need state authorization to do that, so we're hoping to pass this law next time we're in albany, which will be probably at least a few weeks from now. At this point, but- and you know you- there was actually a daily news editorial today that cites a lot of scott's ideas and also this idea, but I'm happy to talk about it, give any questions, and that is expressly intended for small local businesses to give them the stability they need to. You know to reinvest in the community and stay long run and obviously to restructure their current liabilities. A lot of people have been very concerned about how people are gonna vote. This november we passed a bunch of laws. They were. A bunch of them were signed this afternoon by the governor to facilitate voting in the fall. This is authorizing people again. As we did last time, you will be authorized to receive an absentee ballot because of Covid-19. You just have to indicate that that's the reason you want it, you don't have to be ill yourself or have any of the other reasons that are normally have to be enumerated. You can also request absentee ballots, starting today, usually there's a relatively short window before the election. If you plan that vote absentee would be a good idea to begin requesting them now and get you know, get that process in early and get them in early, because, obviously, there's been a lot of complicated issues with the post office and with the boards processing them, and we also made it clear that ballots that are postmarked on the day of the election up to and including the day of election will count, and we previously passed a bill that said if they received the day after the election, even if they don't bear a postmark, they will also count. I'm also still pushing a bill that would extend the deadline for voter registration. We did a constitutional amendment last year. That said, you can register up to and including election day, but that can't go into effect because it takes several years to amend our constitution in the meanwhile, I passed a bill in the senate that would reduce the deadline to the constitutional minimum, which is ten days before election day. Again that has passed the senate. We are hoping the assembly will take that up when we return to albany briefly on housing. The eviction moratorium was extended through the end of the month. We had advocated for the courts to do that. Sorry, through the end of september, no one can get evicted, no residential evictions at all. You can call our office or any of your colleagues or the city tenant helpline. If anybody listening is having is being pushed toward eviction, there is some limiting limited reopening of the courts themselves to begin processing cases, and on that note we are having a joint hearing of the judiciary, housing and codes committees tomorrow, co-chaired by brad hoyleman, the chair of the judiciary committee and myself as housing and jamal bailey at codes to review. All of the issues related to courts, reopening both the safety of that and also the various implications that in terms of how criminal and civil matters are processed- and certainly I think, evictions and foreclosures will be a big part of that. Since we last met the emergency rent relief act program, application has been closed. This is a limited program intended to pay the rent of low-income people. They hcr, the state housing agency, received about 90 000 applications for that they are processing them and that is again a limited program, but an important first step that will pay people's rent from april may, June and july if they are low income and lost less their income due to Covid-19 we're still pushing for a much larger approach that will require federal funding. It's a huge problem. The federal government has allowed the pandemic unemployment assistance to lapse as of july 31st. That will exacerbate all kinds of problems, including the inability of people to pay rent, but we are so we're still pushing for a large infusion of money for a variety of things, but in this case, particularly to help cover rent- and we have a bill that we've been working on that is intended to make sure new york state is ready to move if that money, materializes to cover people's rent and that's been pending for a while and we've been discussing it with the executive branch and the assembly and with all kinds of other stakeholders to get it ready to go, and it's called, we call it c-wrap the Covid-19 emergency relief emergency rent assistance program. I think that I will a couple other things I could probably cover, but yeah, obviously we're all focused on what's gonna happen with schools and, I think, still giving and receiving input about how that's going to work as that reopens, but we're hoping to make sure that is safe and that the schools are ready to accommodate all of the students and the families and the school personnel that have to be involved. In that. I think I'll stop there. If I'm happy to take questions or comments, I think senator kavanagh looks like we have a few questions. I'm going to start with beau barra cabona yeah hi, thanks carter, hi brian, took two questions, one. I think you went over that so quickly. Right at the beginning, I think you were linking property assessments to small business or stores that are vacant or something could you just go over that again and I think if I heard you correctly that's similar to what they do with the scree program. I believe it's a it's like yeah. It's actually an interesting analogy: yeah. It is somewhat similar to scree. It basically would say that a la this is a program that would be. We would authorize it at the state level with some basic parameters. The city would be have the ability to refine it and put additional parameters, but basically, if you're a property owner- and you are willing to negotiate an affordable lease over the long term with 10 years of affordability, including restructuring any current outstanding arrears on that property. With that tenant, you would get the benefit of a tax break, a tax abatement that would extend for the for whatever period the city chooses to extend it. They could do it all ten years or they could do it. They could front load it because some landlords are having real trouble, paying taxes. Now and again, the lease would have to that. That's in a nutshell, that's it. The city could put a maximum. You know how much they're, willing and able to spend on this program if they chose to, they could say we're gonna forego. You know 100 million or 500 million, or a billion dollars in taxes in this matter, and they can set other parameters on it. But the goal now is to get the thing authorized, we're not likely to be in session throughout the fall. So the goal is to get it authorized through this piece of legislation, that's introduced and ready to go, and again, we've worked closely with brad, lander and keith powers on this at the at the at the council level and we're getting. You know: we've been speaking with the with the city and with the speaker's office as well, the city council speaker's office as well to try to get the program up and running. Well, obviously, the devil is in the details as usual, but it sounds like a good idea. The other thing I wanted to ask you about was your opinion. You know, as a state official of the city council's hiatus on the enforcement of personal guarantees and good guy guarantees, which to me seems on the face of it to be blatantly unconstitutional. You know to retroactively, amend a contract also. I don't think the city personally has the right to do that without state legislation. I just wanted your opinion on this. Obviously you want to probably don't want to opine on its constitutionality, but don't you isn't it true that the state should back up the city in this legislation? Is it wouldn't that be required? Yeah? I I'm not. I can't I I'm happy to sort of look into it and see if our lawyers have a an educated opinion about it, but I wouldn't opine on either the legality or the constitutionality of it. I think that there are many areas where the city cannot act independently and there are many where they can and obviously we don't have the right to simply abridge or void contracts at any level of government in the without some constitutional questions being answered, but I don't have an opinion about whether it's, whether it's something they have the authority to do. Obviously their lawyers decided that they do indeed have that authority, but I haven't looked at the legal question: yeah. Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you thanks. Thank you. Thank you. So much for taking my questions. I have two questions. One is backing up what beau ricobono mentioned regarding the commercial leases abatement of taxes. The devil is in the details and I am very hesitant to go along with any kind of program I as a small property owner, mom and pop real estate owner, I'm afraid technically to go with any government program such as this, because the city has been known. The state has been known to change the rules of the game as its. It starts with certain rules and when the end is coming all of a sudden, they change the rules and I'll give you an example. For instance, the rent of brain stabilization has to do the the counting, the vacancy rates, and it's supposed to be done this year with the census. All of a sudden, they decided they're going to change it because it's not convenient to know how many vacant apartments and there are many vacant apartments, and they don't want anyone to know how many are there, because then the rank regulations would not be in effect anymore, because rent regulations exist because of the emergency of too few apartments for people to rent. If the vacancy goes above five percent, then rent regulations go out the window and of course they don't want that, because there are too many regulated it's a political game. So I don't trust what the city does, because right now they say you know you can give them a benefit, for you can get a tax abatement for 10 years. We don't know, what's going to happen in 10 years, wait and the other question is, if you I haven't, heard it yet, but this isn't a time for people wait. I have a question please. My other question is regarding lien sales. I know they're beginning a lot of landlords are going to lose their buildings because people are not paying the rent and how are you going to stop the liens? How are you going to small property owners from losing their buildings because tenants are not paying the rent? How are we going to be made whole or made safe and not lose our buildings to big developers that come and will take all our buildings away? What's going to happen with the lien sales? That's the question: okay and I'll. Try to I'll try to address the points quickly. First of all, we are going to structure this so that it is state authorized. It would require a change in state law for the city to do the to alter the terms of the program, and it does expire in you know, expires after the period during which the affordability is required. So it's not an unlimited authority of the city, but obviously you'll have to decide whether the terms are sufficient. It would also be entirely voluntary by both landlords and tenants to participate just a point of information. The proposal to change the timing of the housing vacancy survey. I understand why you might be thinking that was for a particular purpose at this moment in our history it was proposed last year and the reason for that is the staff that report has been done for many years now by the same by the by the census bureau. Basically, it's been done under contract with the census bureau so about every 20 years, or so it's due during the year when the census is being done and they don't have the capacity to do it. So I actually passed a bill last year that would have extended that period long before this, the the heightened levels of vacancy were an issue this year. It's really there's not a there's, not a sort of dark conspiracy there, although I do agree with you that it'd be interesting to see the data this year, but we've been working on for a long time just and it's purely logistic. I promise you on the lien sales. There is concern. I think we want to distinguish there's a piece of legislation pending. That would basically put a moratorium on lien sales sponsored by senator leroy comrie. We want to make sure that there are some cases where lien sales really are a mechanism to get the building out of a kind of uns insecure status, where a landlord really has been neglecting the building and not paying the taxes. So sometimes they play a productive purpose of transferring ownership to a responsible party. We want to. I think this there's a goal of making sure we permit that to continue. But I think a lot of us, including myself, have sympathy with landlords who haven't been able to pay because they're not receiving the rent and they're having trouble with their taxes. We granted a blanket authority for the city to restructure taxes in that circumstance to lower them or delay them, but I also think it's fair to say that if we're not evicting people, you probably also shouldn't be having people's buildings taken away from them during this very difficult time, if they're, otherwise being responsible. So I will be working on that and it's senator comray has a billionaire. Take a look. Thank you so much my pleasure, william banish thanks senator for speaking. My question is just in regards to the definition of a recovery lease. How exactly is that going to be defined, and is there going to be some agency that's going to have to certify it? So is it going to be like if you do a discount of x percent on the existing lease? Do you have to get beyond the threshold? Is there the possibility to do percentage leases, as perhaps a component of a of a newly restructured lease? Have you just thought about kind of exactly yeah? We have we've done a lot of thinking, but haven't come to conclusions on that because so what we said is this we've. We laid out the basic parameters that the city can work with and they can't go beyond, but we've had conversations with economists with chambers of commerce. There was a release on this that lists some of the people we've been working with as well, but we're open to input and again the primary place where the details of this will be worked out is at the city level and we're not in we're not mandating. They do this in a particular way, but yeah they will have to define what makes it affordable and they'll have to define how you calculate how big a tax break you get and for what period the minimum parameters are. The affordability must extend for 10 years or more, and the tax abatement can go no more than 10 years and there is some assumption that they might front load the tax abatement because people have you know, people have a real need. For you know, people are having trouble paying taxes right now and as an inducement to get people involved in the program to overcome the skepticism of miss sands and others. But that's it's going to be a voluntary program and we're going to design it. The goal is to design it in such a way that business people who are trying to do the right thing will have some incentives to do that and work with their tenants, both on the property owner side and the and the tenant side. Great thanks. I've got two more questions or it looks like three. I have keen berger sandy russo and chanel spence, so keane right, hi brian thanks a lot for coming and on schools. I'm glad you mentioned it, but you should look at the resolution that I believe the community board is going to pass tonight that the school's committee got together. We don't want the schools to be open. I certainly don't until they're really safe and a lot of our schools. The ventilation system is a mess, so both the teachers and the children need safe schools, and just please you know do what you can to make sure that we don't open precipitously yeah. We are, I appreciate that and we are focusing on it and it's going to be challenging. I think gail brewer is on. I think she may have some opinions about this as well that, but I you know we're. The city's plan does need to be approved by the governor's office and I think a lot of people are gonna be scrutinizing very closely. I know a lot of the private schools have made the decision that they're not opening at the beginning of the year they're going to delay and see how it looks in, like you know, late september or october, and so again we're looking at it closely we're hearing from all sides. It is optional from the perspective of families, but obviously you know we're gonna, it's gonna be we're. I am very I mentioned I wanted to be. I wanted to keep it short because there's a lot of a lot of speakers, but I mentioned it because I recognize it's a very thorny issue with a lot of very strong opinions and a lot at stake, so we really do want to get it right and we are paying attention. So I appreciate it right and we'll take a look at this to the individual parents to try to figure out for their individual kids. All right, I get it that is pushing it way down. This should be a should be a system-wide decision. I think we, I would say we need to get the system our decision right, but even whatever we decide system-wide, you probably want some discretion for people to say I'm not I'm not comfortable and I'm doing what I need to do with my kids too, but I re yes, we want, like the element of personal trust, does not obviate the need for a system-wide solution that is right to getting those questions right, because there's a public health there's public health issues that go beyond the people who are actually in the buildings anyway. So I'm with you on that thanks brian sandy, I filled out a request for an absentee ballot today and you do it online, but for new york state you could not choose that you're requesting this ballot because of coded considerations. What time did you do that need mid-morning? Okay, the governor the governor this afternoon signed the bill effective immediately that should allow. I don't know if I suspect the board of elections at 7. 18 pm has not updated. They are supposed to promptly update it, so that was that was the rule in the primary that was a special rule for the primary. It was only signed into law, literally three or four hours ago, so as by tomorrow morning, if they're doing their job, you should be able to check that. Okay, thanks great thanks and and a question of in relationship to a prior question about less drastic or less traumatic than a something like a lien sale or being brought to there or not having paid the tax or whatever. It is on a situation where one has in good faith, negotiated new rents, they're simply not sufficient to cover expenses in the way that they were before. Is there something that can sort of short-circuit a problem yeah, so we we've tried to be we've been. We were trying to be respectful in albany of home rule on taxes. So we again we passed a bill and I was instrumental in making sure this happened. We passed a bill that allows every taxing jurisdiction in new york, broad discretion, to reduce taxes, to delay taxes, to waive penalties to do all those things at their discretion. In response to coving, we did not mandate that the city do that, because all of the a lot of the revenue that they get from the property tax system is the revenue that is necessary for them to provide the basic services and we would have been very upset if the federal government unilaterally altered our tax structure. So we decided not to do that, but the city has a lot of discretion to do that. The bill that I was talking about before is exactly designed to facilitate that kind of situation. You're trying to do the right thing, you recognize the tenants, don't have money, you're willing to do affordability, you would have to have some longer-term affordability element to participate in that particular program, but we're hoping that the city will be willing to put real resources behind that and make the benefits generous enough to incentivize property owners to take the deal- and you know I will just note that high unaffordability of storefronts to small businesses that we really care deeply about in our communities is not a it's, not a new issue in covert. It's been exacerbated very severely by kobe, but this is a long-term question. We are hoping that there's a mechanism- and somebody like somebody said scree, which is the you know. The senior citizen rent increase exemption for residential tenants was a new idea at some point. Now it's become a staple of keeping people in their homes over the long term. We're hoping that this kind of thing will catch on and become a normal approach, because there's a lot of public interest in making sure businesses continue to thrive in our thank you, yep thanks and one last question before we move on from janine kylie hi senator cavanaugh. I just want to push another educational point, which is also resolution anywhere from three to five days a week, and we I'm not working, I'm gonna turn off my. Does it sound better? If I turn off my video? Yes, okay, great so whatever happens with schools, reopening students will be learning remotely anywhere from three to five days a week, and I feel that 99 of the education conversation is about open and don't reopen and that's important, that's a safety conversation. But what I don't want to go away is the comfort the critical need to have high quality, remote learning. This means synchronous instruction, small group instruction connections daily with teachers, not self-guided, downloaded boring worksheets. I mean this really needs to be robust and there cannot be minimums that I mean there need to be minimums, at least that each school that each teacher provides- and I know that as a state official- you don't have a ton of power over this, but this is a matter of money, and this is a matter of pushing back on all the different entities that want to limit the quality of the remote learning right. That's it's a it's a good point. It's important and I also, I would add there are specific issues for students with special needs that are have been very difficult to address remotely. You know there are a lot of a lot of. We have been paying attention to those issues as well. I will notice it is very much the state's role to make sure the schools are properly funded along. Obviously, the city has responsibility for that. I will just note that the federal government again is discussing what to do now and we are, as the governor's office is, estimating a potential 20 reduction in funding for big school districts in the state. If we don't get federal relief so which is going to make it very difficult, we're pushing back on that and the legislature will certainly push them back, but it'll make it very difficult to do any of this properly. If the schools are all also seeing funding reductions at a time when they actually need more funding to accommodate the multiple ways, people are learning, so it is a big fight. It's an extent you're talking to about as you're talking to anybody involved in the federal government. I'm not sending you to lobby or your congressman over next necessarily is very good on this, but like really it is, it really is important to make sure the funding is available and, unlike the federal government, the state cannot run the kind of massive deficit spending that you can do in a crisis like this, that the feds can. So we are looking at revenue, enhancements and taxes and all that, but we do need the feds to really step up to make sure that education is made whole along with so many other things all right. I had already called last questions, but I three see three more board. Members have their hands up. If you have a one sentence, one sentence question and senator yeah. I know a number of people would like to watch some of the speeches tonight, georgia. It wasn't a question actually, but maybe I'll make it into a question. It's just supporting what janine just said and really pushing. Why can't our elected officials demand that all teachers in all classrooms in all grades in a school follow a standard in terms of live small group teaching my kids last year, one in kindergarten, a brief question because we really need to well. That was my question. I got it I'm I will I'm gonna. We are. We need to like the logistics of doing this are very complicated. We do need to hear from all we want to make sure the quality is high. We want to make sure concerns like yours are addressed. I think that there is a little bit more. You know a little bit more effort that needs. You know that needs to be made and figure out, what's feasible, what's possible. Are we really doing in person? What does it look like? So I I'm I we're again we're paying attention, I'm not ready to I'm not yet ready to make specific demands. I will look at your resolution at night and that will certainly influence the way we think about this. I note that janine has posted about a rally about the cuts. The school cuts as well, which you know is tomorrow at 4 p.m. I will be sharing the aforementioned hearing on the courts at that point, but but I mean there's a lot of activities and I will say we're going to have a hard time doing anything that people want if we don't have the funding great thanks, dr smith, quickly. In light of what janine said, it's not a question but a comment. We all know that, and with marginalized and disenfranchised kids in neighborhoods, where they are poor brown of color, even the kids, who were in classes with in-person teachers did not get a fair shake and definitely the ones now who are doing the remote, that's very questionable and if anyone's interested, it's a very interesting research report that just came up by edtrust that talked about how deficient and the remote learning has really affected. Kids of color and poor kids so and the board of ed, I don't think, have a standard at all. So it's a very, very bad kind of situation and one that even there's no data or very limited data on how effective, not only the in the in class teaching for black and brown and poor kids, but definitely they've gotten a very poor shake with this remote learning and I will respect in carter's desire for this to be a speed round. I say I will say we will check out the report and I share all of those concerns all right and then our last is coral. You'd come in yeah I just I will be sending both my children in five days a week to school in two weeks. I'm very grateful for that. Those are private schools, but that only widens the divide, if you don't have in-person options for those families that want to be able to send their children in. So I strongly hope that you will consider that, and I would ask you to look at programs that have figured out a way to have live zoom instruction all day long with the kids having to even raise their hands to go to the bathroom act, just as if they're in the classroom, if they're not able to go to school or their family doesn't feel comfortable, so they're still in the classroom, they're not able to just hide behind or just turn in or check boxes, they're, just as present as they would be in the classroom and those do exist. I hope you all look into them and I'm happy to connect you, okay. I appreciate that. Thank you great thanks, senator cavanaugh. We very much appreciate your you're joining us tonight, happy to be here sorry to take up so much of your time, but I appreciated the dialogue. Thank you all right thanks! So now we're going to jump ahead here to borough president brewer gail. Thank you very much I'll be quick. I want to just I'll get to the schools in a minute, because I have to agree with a lot of what you said and I'm up to here with the school. So just in terms of open streets, we went to chinatown today and we're going to be going to all 12 candy boards giving out the mass and the sanitizer and facials. But, more importantly, just so, you know six o'clock tomorrow night because we'll be 110 Lexington in the morning, but friday august 21 at six o'clock, rosa mendes has put together quite a schedule, so we'll be on 8th street and broadway walking south on our way to houston, just talking to people and giving out. If anybody wants to join us, you're welcome, but we are doing always from the bottom of Manhattan to the top for the next week number two. I know that we are all talking about getting funding and I think you know that the Manhattan community award program, which is our expense money. The funding applications are due tomorrow at five o'clock. We just put out our thursday newsletter, and I saw there was money available through an arts program and there's another. I think new, but I could be wrong, but it's like fifteen to twenty thousand dollars for small businesses who are making the cut. So just be sure you know this, as I will do everything I can to try to help those two, both the arts and small business. I know you're sick of the census we all are, but just so you know the empire state development, which of course is the state pbc they gave a long time ago. They said they were going to give funding to the five borough presidents, because they're giving them to the counties around the state. Well, we just we got them about a week ago when we were a hell of a materials to fill out, but we were the first for president to get it in. I think it was about. I don't know 40 groups or 50 groups that came, they were vetted by the state, we picked some of them and we gave out the funding. So yes, people are knocking on doors from the u.s census, but we're also trying to supplement that. So that's number one. You know they were given to groups that hopefully will be applicable to the communities or which they come number two. We contacted the board of elections with julie and we got the list of why it's an accessible list. It's a transparent list, it's an available list of the people who have left the city and gave a forwarding address, and we are writing to them and say please. If you have filled out the sentence where you are redo it and put down your permanent new york address it's a huge list, but those are going out immediately. Number three: we did our own postcard. We did 140 000 postcards about a month ago and we're doing another 140 000 now to the lowest, responding census tracts. You know I think Manhattan is pinching up more than other boroughs, but it's still not great, but just so you know we're trying every aspect that we can. I want to just talk about the school because there's a little nuance, which will make you even more upset being than everybody else, so we can have funding a lot of money to the schools every year, technology, gyms and so on. So last year, which is fy20, they haven't said the money. Yet so it's sitting there and when I was on the zoom earlier, I found out that senator brian benjamin in harlem. He also gave schools in harlem a lot of money and nothing has moved and all could be for remote learning, picking up on what janine was talking about so we're now in conversations with the executive superintendent every single day in the part of Manhattan, we now have a list of all the schools who needs apparently, according to them the kinds of devices that are not happening or what the school needs to make, and I agree with you 100 what the learning at home better. I know schools middle school in a good neighborhood in terms of the quality of the students when students come from all over, but they have an excellent principal ap and so on. 36 and last semester never opened the devices. So it's pretty no matter what neighborhood you and good challenge in between high income, low income, big problems, so we have to improve, and the second thing is, I totally agree: teachers need to have live teaching with the students. I can't tell you how many people complain that they were on for half an hour if that and then in the suburban schools, four or five hours teacher and student requirement. If I had my way, I would enhance the regional enrichment, centers they're called wrecks that work incredibly well, I have a lot of friends who are either emts doctors, nurses and they send their kids to the rest. The wreck was phenomenal. So if I had my way I would do wet because there are so many parents working for every fan who is going to work and then I would do virtual and then I would do arts and social emotional where necessary. Perhaps at the school that's what I would do, I'm not in charge in the interim. We sure need to find a way to get the fy 20 money spent, and we want to redirect you to something: that's appropriate for online learning. Fine, but we've got to spend the money. I know we talked earlier about sanitation. Your chair mentioned it this morning. Everybody did it tomorrow board. Just so, you know 65 cut to the weekday service and unless a council member emptied up 100 to the litter basket, pickup cut on the weekend, that's a problem in my opinion and then just finally, I just want to say we're working on two things. Just in terms of future one is affordable. Housing we've been meeting with all of the from the berman center to the non-profits, to the for-profit developers to build affordable housing at least come up with something that has to get done, because at this point I feel like we're just casting in the wind there's a building, here's the building and we're gonna. I don't feel like we have a plan. We don't have any kind of a policy. They were doing that something that hopefully would be improvement, and then I know that a while ago we wrote a letter, we've not done an answer yet on the issue of open meetings. I heard this morning at the borough board and I'm sure you know this- that some of the boards that purchased what I would consider sophisticated equipment to be able to enter the future. Have these kinds of conversations, even maybe more so than the zoom long story short we're going to have some virtual and some in person in terms of the cuny boards or other organizations. We have to change the open meeting law and I think carter knows better than that about why. But just let you know we haven't, got an answer on that, but I have heard confidence from people who actually like to be able to participate in a different way. We're still continuing to give food out to the seniors from the top of Manhattan to the bottom of Manhattan, the fresh director NYCHA and I do think for seniors in general. We have to think about the food for the future. The senior centers are not open. I haven't heard when they are gonna open and it's a real challenge for that community. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gail. I've got a couple of questions first from georgia. Yes good evening, madam president, when you were here last month, you said you were going to be speaking with principals in the borough to sort of assess where they are in terms of outdoor learning, and so I'm curious. If you had that conversation and what you heard and the reason I'm asking well, there are many reasons, but one of which is my the school in my neighborhood they're, really focusing on open streets to use for drop off and pick up and are sort of hesitant to use open streets for outdoor learning and play because of this DOE position that students need to be in the classroom for the five hours of instruction if they're in school. Thank you, okay, very quickly, a couple of issues again, we were on today with the and partner within executive superintendent, and I heard this previously. The agencies don't coordinate well, as you know, so, in terms of the open street, even before you get to outdoor learning. A lot of schools want to close those streets, but d.o.e has said. Oh, we won't tell you until october 21.. Well, that's not helpful, and so even I have I don't know, I must have 20 schools who are saying: please help us get our streets open. So I'm just saying that's one issue right there that probably deal with much sooner than october. The second issue is, we are having trouble with the aoe. To be honest with you, the Brooklyn council members are trying also to get them to agree. If a school wants to not everybody has the place or the interest to be able to get tense. So I can't say I haven't been trying. I can't say I've been extremely successful right. We're gonna keep trying, but if your school needs help on something, let me know- and I can find it case by case. Thank you great thanks, dr smith evening, gail. How are you good to see you I'm well? Thank you. Yes, can I'd like to talk if you want later off lying with you about this funding that brian gave to harlem to the school districts? Is there some way that I can you and I can talk or you can put me in touch it's the same funding. It's just state that we give we give money for. You know like I said, capital money for technology, gyms bathrooms, the roof, everything and that's the money. That's stuck it's it's not like expense money for programs, it's money, for I would call it rich and mortar. But technology comes under that. But I'll put my information in the chat thanks bo forward, hi gail albert hi, I'm just wondering if you felt it would be more productive and efficient all around if the department of ed just stopped the fiction that they will open schools and admit that they won't because you and I think, know that they won't and spend some time trying to improve the quality of the remote education, because it wasn't good in this last few months and we really need to improve it. Everybody agrees with that and I think all this time spent on this nonsense: they're not going to open the schools. We know that so let's change your focus, but you also, you feel a little upset, because when people tell you who are administrators at the department of education offline that they wish that the oe had spent months and months working on the virtual right, which is what you just said and did that during this time period, then you know what you just said is correct, but they didn't and so we're in them. As somebody I think, denise said earlier, when a really horrible academic, that's what I'm concerned about. I can talk about the learning, centers or learning labs. Those are the quote-unquote data, so I go visiting you know me. Oh this looks interesting. I stop in and it turns out. A program has been selected. A non-profit is a learning lab, which is the off-day location for students. If you can't be home, this is according to the mayor, 100 000 people a place to go. So I'm thinking what is a learning lab? What is child care? So I go and it's like it's a fabulous non-profit they're used to doing after school and weekends where they have been collected, but they don't know which students are coming. They don't know what grades are coming and if it's like, I'm making this up, they work in two schools. So if the students from those schools came, they could work on the academics because they know the teachers. But if 10 schools come there's no way, you'll know the teachers, and so the kids will not be able to get caught up on academics I'll leave it at that one when they get too upset yeah, I get it. Thank you very much last question from scott sartiano hi for president brewer. Thanks for your time, yeah I just want to know. When are we going to be able to open restaurants? You know today I could go to home depot and buy enough stuff to build a kitchen. My wife can go to czar and buy yes, kids are going to go to school. What more needs to be done so that people can eat restaurants, and we literally and figuratively feed people in new york city and we are all going out of business, what's happening, I'm on the governor's recovery task force. It comes up at every meeting. I will try to find out that I can't say that I know I feel this is just the feeling because we got through the gym and the rate. As you know, it's extremely low. It feels like it's gonna happen soon, but I don't want it. It's a very really hard response. I'm aware yeah, it's also just contradictory. You can go across a body of water and eat. Inside of a restaurant, you can rock subway in new york. It just you know we're at a loss. Okay, I can't give you an answer. It is a governor, but I will bring it up again tomorrow. I have brought it up. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Boro president brewer. Thank you very much, mr chair, and I think that's all the questions that I see from board. Members thanks for joining us tonight, definitely appreciate it. I have one more public official report and that's siobhani gonzalez siobhani hi everyone. Can you hear me? Yes, all right, so I'll, keep it very quick. So the biggest thing I want to say is that the assembly member has partnered with health and hospitals for a mobile Covid-19 testing. So it was this week from monday to friday, so tomorrow's the last day, no appointment, no insurance necessary, and you can just show up. Also you get your results within 48 hours, which is we are learning, is very quick. So if you are interested and want to go, get your free covent test, it is at the intersection of cherry street and market slip in the lower east side from 10 to four tomorrow will be the last day, but we also would love to plan more things like this and definitely keep you posted. If those things come up, that's basically the biggest update additionally, we're still doing PPE distribution, food distribution. So if you know of anyone or any group who needs help with that, please feel free to contact our office and that's basically it for this month. For me great, thank you very much and we've had a few other elected officials reps on the line, but I think that they've all submitted reports in lieu of in lieu of speaking, I see one question from coral. If you had a question yeah I do. I have a question about those free tests. How quickly are the results? Coming back, because I've been shocked at everyone going in the last 10 days saying they still haven't gotten their results? Yeah I mean it's definitely a massive problem. I myself got tested a city md, I think, and results took I think, 18 days which, at that point they're just not helpful anymore. So, but the reason that we really were happy to partner with health and hospitals for this is that they are guaranteeing results within 48 hours and of our staff, who's gone and people. We know who've gone that has remained true, they've gotten their test results within 48 hours of the test being done, but that includes the go health centers right because that's health and hospitals. So this is actually just like a separate mobile testing event. So I'm not sure about just health and hospitals in general, but I know with this mobile testing unit that we are sponsoring and partnering with. Specifically the results are 48 hours. I can't really speak to the rest of them, though I'm not totally sure yeah. I would just really urge improvement on that. I think everyone knows it, but having all these public announcements encouraging people to get tested and it's free and you get results and everyone goes and they get worthless tests. Three weeks later, it's just completely a public disservice. I don't even know what the data means at this point. So it's really. It's upsetting. We've had a lot of people that are, you know, work in different things, reach out, and I've tried to help people and they just don't get results or someone pays 800 to get them because they're not insured and they still don't get the results yeah. Absolutely all these public campaigns need to stop saying it's free, easy and effective. It's not working sure. I absolutely agree- and it is it's very like it's problematic and it's upsetting to not get your results and not be able to have that valuable information when you do and it's too late- and I definitely agree- and so that's why we were really happy to work with this mobile testing unit, specifically to be able to have those very quick results and hopefully that'll become the trend within new york very soon in general, and hopefully that our office will be able to host more testing sites like this, where they are able to have that really quick turnaround. But yes, so tomorrow's. If you want those fast results, if you want to refer anyone the last day is tomorrow from 10 to four at cherry street markets. It's been, it's been like really great and easy, and quick, so yeah thanks carl one other or two more questions. Georgia. You had a question. Yes, I do have a question, I'm curious. If then, the office will partner with schools, the DOE is saying- or I guess the uft is saying that teachers and students must be tested before they enter school buildings, and if it's taking two weeks for a result, then you're potentially sending asymptomatic people into an indoor space. So I'm curious if there's been any conversation because of the 48-hour turnaround period with partnering with DOE new york city schools thanks yeah, that's an amazing question. I definitely will bring that back to our office and see if there's anything that we can do and if that's at all possible, because that's a really great idea and super important in terms of making sure that people are properly tested before they get in. So I will definitely bring that back to our office. Thank you so much for that suggestion. Great thanks and one last question from matt letzger, I'm okay carter. Thank you. Okay! Thanks matt, I don't see any other questions siobhani. Thank you very much. Thank you! Guys, okay, and I think that's all the elected officials that we had one second here, that we had that we're going to provide the reports. We're going to move on to the chairs report, as as we distributed to everybody, really sad that one of our board members, tom connor, had passed away this month. Very sad news. Tom was an incredibly strong advocate for senior issues and always spoke from his heart. You know we as board members. We've all had an opportunity to hear him speak very eloquently on a lot of different issues that he felt very strongly about. I wanted to have a moment of silence just to acknowledge him for a few seconds, and tom is also a member of vid, and I know that they had a gathering for him yesterday and I've been in touch with tom's niece, who indicated that they're, putting together a memorial service with greenwich house and that virtual memorial is going to be taking place on september 23rd, and we have more information. Bob will share that with everyone on the board. As far as I'm going to keep the rest of the report very brief, one of the things, as you heard, the dsny, the trash bin pickup, has been curtailed quite a bit one of the ways that we can really make some sort of an impact on there is encouraging people not to put household trash in the corner. Bins I mean. I know this sounds fairly simplistic, but it really keeps the bins from overflowing and that's something that definitely a big issue and while seemingly simple it's something, if you see any of your neighbors, if you could encourage them, not to do that, issues of homelessness have obviously been on the rise. I believe that susannah aarons is going to be addressing that with a social services meeting next month, and we also had a committee meeting for the reopening working group, the restarting together universities that went very well nyu and the new school walked us through their plans for welcoming students back to campus, and that was of note for our local businesses and our community next month. They're going to be inviting museums and cultural institutions to join us and share with us how their reopenings are going and the status on that for the most part open restaurants is going very well. I think most of you seen that in our community there are a couple of new streets that are going to be participating. This weekend we have spring street in little italy or lolita. I know a lot of you still refer to that as little italy and the same portion of elizabeth street between spring and houston. We do still have a few issues that are actually in that area that we've heard of as far as the sanitation, trucks and fire trucks being able to navigate when there are when they're seating on the road bed on both sides of the street. I think I'm going to keep it at that. One last note: one of our biggest fans who joins us on most of our meetings from the public side. Pete davies, it's his birthday today, so I just wanted to wish him a happy birthday and with that and move on to district manager's report, bob all right. First, I just want to say that I'll be out of town the next couple of days, so josh will send out the information regarding the virtual memorial for tom. I just sent all the board members an email which contains more information about my report. I want to keep mine very brief, because I know we all want to get home today. The first item just had to do with permits from the parks department, or rather the police department, is not issuing permits for their fields or their courts and again, if you want more information, it's in the email. Secondly, I was just going to talk a little bit about the hudson park library, it's one of the 30 libraries in Manhattan, that's open for grab and go. I sent the link to the library's information and the email also included a report from assemblymember yulin knew and and that's it except for happy birthday pete. Thank you. I see one hand up coral. Did you have a question more? I thought that you know this decline in sanitation. Services is doing a disservice to the restaurants that are having to operate outside, because you have lots of pileups, at least in soho right next to the tables and chairs that are set up and the restaurants can't move it, because it's residential trash too. So this is the service cutbacks at this point are not in the residential pickups they're in the corner, bins the trash bins, it's the one pickup a day. I've just noticed it a lot this past week, there's a lot more trash in soho a lot more. I don't think that the residential pickups have changed. So maybe it's people who are returning back to the city, so it just it's hard for them. I mean the restaurants are grumbling about it because they have like all the stinky trash right next to the table. So it's just something to know yeah bob. Maybe you can. You can follow up with with the our local garage. That's an interesting question and with that we are going to move on to our business session. We're going to begin that with the approval of the july minutes bob had distributed the july minutes to the board. Has anybody everybody had a chance to review those minutes, starting the objection to approving those minutes. Their motion to approve them so moved? Second, okay, great! We are going to move on to standing committee reports, but when looking back at our past meetings, we generally take a roll call vote on the first item, but we haven't been doing that, but I'm going to go ahead and have valerie just take a quick roll call attendance, because I noticed that we had a number of board members that joined us. We're not here. Valerie, let's see akilah as queen here here carter booth here, katie bordenaro I'll take her just a second. I see her on there, anita brandt here, amy brenner, here, rich cacopolo, here, ritu chauchi, coral dawson, john paul de verna, yep great, and I believe, doris diether here bob ely here mark fitzgerald here for mac flynn, yeah joseph gallagher, here david yeah, quadler, yeah susan ken here, jenny and kylie here.

Thank you great thanks. Everybody we're going to move on to our first committee report of sla, licensing, donna or bob which one of you is going to be presenting. I'm going to do it, so we had five applications this month. All the decisions were unanimous. There were two le pen. Crypto dens, I think, is how you say that restaurant wine they were essentially transfers the same method of operation as before. That was deny unless blossom restaurant, which is moving out through them item by item I don't have to well. We have to just put them onto the records okay, so the la panducam quito den one was on grand street. That was, they wanna just go through in the order that we have them on the report. The number one is boston union square, okay, blossom union square, that was a new restaurant wine that was denying less and then le pen on 100 grand street restaurant wine, essentially a transfer that was a denying list, another one on eight ten fifth avenue restaurant wine essentially transfer. That was a deny unless and cafe, reggio on mcdougall street. That was an upgrade from an op, no change in method of operation. That was a deny unless and then for 401 west grand was for a new op and a private members club, and that was a deny and that's it, and then we had items six through twelve or layovers no shows yep. You want me to do. I read all of those. No that's okay. Does anybody want to discuss any of the items number one through 12 or call any out for discussion? Okay, I see shirley, you had your hand up, oh still, muted. Okay, here I am, I just have a question. The question is on number two and number three le panco tidian. I thought they were closing. So what's happened, were they new ownership or what it's new ownership? A new group bought them out and is they're reopening? Oh okay, thanks though yeah there was, there was a group that bought it a portion of them not all of them, so a number of them are closing and we have another one. That's coming back. I can't remember which one, but a number of the a number of them in our community board are closing. So that's a number one question: yeah. Okay, thanks! So is there any other discussion on items one through twelve, okay, so, like in past months, I'm going to move to move all 12 of these items and these resolutions into an omnibus bill that we can vote on at the end of the at the end of the business session? Is there any objection to that and if anybody would like, we can call out any item for an individual vote? If, if that's what you'd like to do so, is there any objection? Okay, I don't see any objection. Okay, we're gonna move on to the next landmarks and public aesthetics can all expense I'll summarize things of the interest of time. 462 broadway is an exceptional building that has been beautifully restored to what I described as mint condition, and the proposal is on the corner to put in a bank in particular to atm machines that would invade the infill in two spots and we recommended flat-out denial as nothing being suited to the building itself or attempt to integrate into it, 121 west 11th to replace windows, rooftop edition and a rare edition. All in all, we approved the application, with the exception of, and it's a generator on, top of a rooftop edition that is just egregiously, visible from assorted places in the public thoroughfare of the and something about the windows on the rear facade not being in keeping with the building 247 west, who installed new windows, it's a building that they showed the original with one kind of windows and the ones there are actually better suited to what was a complete renovation in the 20s approved, 257 west 4th street, a rooftop bulkhead and a rear extension, and neither is a projection or approved. Thank you. That's great thanks! So items one through four. Anybody want to call out any of those items for discussion. Let me say one sorry one thing in the broadway: we had exceptional and very good testimony from the numerous members of the neighborhood which, for which we were grateful, and that was that was on the first item: 462. the bank of broadway. So I don't see anybody. I don't see anybody hands raised, don't see anybody making any motions to call out any items, I'm going to move to that. All four resolutions are moved into the omnibus bill, which are the boat that we're going to have at the end of the meeting. Is there any objection to that? We'll move those in connect with schools in education? Okay? We we had two resolutions this month, both unanimously passed. The first is a resolution in support of open streets and parks to support the safe reopening of new york city. Schools, therefore, be it resolved that community board 2 urges the mayor and his deputies to function as school reopening czars to ensure that the new york city department of transportation and depart in the department of education implement a fast-tracked and streamlined open streets program to close streets around schools before the expected start of the 2020-2021 fall public school term. That should be at the typo and number two. The new york city, department of parks and recreation, hudson river park and other public and private open spaces provide priority access for school students on school days. The second resolution is resolution to prioritize remote learning and ensure the safe reopening of schools and therefore be it resolved that community war ii has repeatedly demanded effective, equitable and excellent education for all new york city students during the pandemic, through resolutions will be passed unanimously in may June and july to the department of it's remote learning for fall. 2020., I'm going to turn my video off because it says it's unstable, which must include daily, live instruction via video, professional development and planning time in trauma, informed schooling and three insist that the DOE ensure that school buildings reopen only when they are safe for all teachers, student and staff, which must include fully functioning hvac systems, operable windows and well ventilated spaces city, funded, PPE and city funded frequent Covid-19 testing again both were unanimously passed. Thank you. Okay, thank you, janine, and to your committee for all your hard work this month and in the past few months on all these items. I know it's a lot of it's a lot to keep track of, and things are changing every day. I see I have one question from frederica: did you want to call out either item, or did you want to make a? I just wanted to ask janine a question. Who is the second resolution? What agency is that directed at and in response to what, in response to I mean that resolution will go to the mayor and the chancellor for the lack of direction, I mean, I think, what we've heard from we're losing you janine it'll go to both I mean we might. You know, maybe we'll copy the unions on this as well, but that's who we're gonna send it to. Thank you. Okay, do we have any other, any other questions my hands raised? Oh sorry, george. Go ahead. That's okay! It's not a question. I just it's a comment and I just want to thank the schools committee, especially for the second resolution, especially the third item, which is that school should only be reopened if they are safe, not just for children and teachers, but all the other staff that work at the school janitorial staff lunch staff. So there are a lot of stakeholders in this and they don't have they don't have all equal voices. So thank you for including that in the resolution yes and yeah thanks a lot great thanks and then coral yeah I so I just have a question as to what safe means, and maybe it needs to be defined in the resolution, because I mean what does that mean you know, we'd intentionally did not define it. Yesterday the uft came yesterday. The uft came out with a press release with, I think, a two and a half page list of safe requirements. So, depending on who you talk to, we are not. You know we're not the center for disease control, so our you know we're just broadly defining safe. It is not. You know, we are not epidemiologists doctors, physicians, we're advocates, so we did not go into detail. Lots of different organizations have gone into that detail and and somebody's gonna disagree with three of them or maybe 10 of them or 12 of the 12 of them. The no. The mayor is not going to look at our resolution and say. Ah, okay, I mean this is really more of a political statement that you know we need to prioritize safety, but we also need to prioritize the quality of the education. Okay. I just might suggest saying, as outlined by the CDC period as a friendly resolution, because otherwise I mean there's always going to be someone that says: if there's any possible risk, it's not safe. That's not really reasonable, so I think, having some sort of definition at least sets a threshold, that's by some expert, not by just a very nervous ill-informed parent yeah, and I think we did that in one of our past resolutions. Let me just check the whole point of this was to be short and it ended up not being as short as we wanted it to be. No, I get it. I mean, I appreciate what you've done, and this is a complex thing, but this is more of a political statement, because we've passed many resolutions that have had you know ad nauseam, footnotes and whatnot, so I'm sort of inclined to leave it out because I don't want it the end of the day. Cb2 is not defining what safe is, and even the CDC is getting kind of political and each organization is having their own. So I'm sort of inclined to just leave it simple. Okay, I mean I just I feel, like the unions are definitely they need to get their act together and figure out how to instruct these kids and yeah well they're only focusing on safe right now, I know you're going to say it's not safe forever, because they don't want to work. It's unbelievable, I'm not sure the motivation but anyways. I made my point, but I just I think I can't support that yeah in our resolution. In our resolution in july, where we went into a three or four page resolution on in support of open streets for schools and the safe reopening of schools, we have several footnotes. We talk about cdc's guidelines on may 19th. I have not gone to see if those have been updated. We had covered planning cover, 19 planning considerations by the american academy of pediatrics and physical activity. Those are all great, so those are referenced in the previous resolutions which are referenced in this resolution. Okay, thank you, hey. Were there any other comments? Okay, is there any unwillingness to put those two resolutions into the omnibus vote? Okay, seeing no objection we're going to move those two resolutions into the omnibus resolution vote and last committee report is the bylaws working group. Susan counts: okay, okay, I hope everyone had a chance to look at the report that the working group put together. This is part of an ongoing process. The review of the bylaws our first because of timing considerations and the fact that next month starts an election cycle that we first addressed the general topic of elections. The four parts of the report reflect what we feel are all of the relevant issues regarding elections. I think I will go through them one by one. The first one is the special term, and this was a something that the the committee felt was important because of term limits which has taken effect as of last year. We felt that it was in the best interest of the board to align the terms of office with our terms on the board to, in order to prevent sort of to avoid having members become ineligible, to run for office, because their terms of office would their terms of office would end prior to their I'm sorry. Their terms of service would end prior to their terms of office. The. In addition, there are benefits in the sense that we felt that by moving it to where to march, we would be in a month which does not is not influenced by holidays and therefore not by reduced attendance. We would also have people having sort of a whole year of service before they're asked to vote so that they're best informed about what the offices are and who is running for them. The what we did is we basically mirrored what was done five years ago, which was to create a special term of four months when it was moved five years ago. The belief was that it was unfair to ask new members to vote for candidates whom they did not know, so the elections were moved from may to november. However, now that we're in the situation that we're in it was felt advisable to move them to a peri to the period that we're now recommending to be clear, the special term is a four-month window. Anyone who's running for office will be running only for that for that four months. If they wish to continue, they will have to run again. While it is true that the term limits that are currently exist in our bylaws do not apply to this. That would be true whether it is someone who is currently serving or someone who will be serving in the future. The belief is that this would give the board a sort of maximum flexibility in terms of you know who they were choosing and, at the same time, maximum transparency, so that no one is serving without, except at the pleasure of the board. If there are any questions about this, if not, I will move on. I will I see carter there go through and present the full report and then we'll go back when people want to speak about what we can call out the different sections that people want to talk about. Okay, the second section is the elections process itself. This section would replace what is now the elections section, article 7 of our existing bylaws. The main goal of this section was to eliminate the elections, the elections committee, which was which, over time, we felt really didn't, contribute much to the process and, in fact, could create variances from year to year. The point the whole goal was to basically create a detailed standardized process within our bylaws that will allow our candidates to for elections, to run smoothly and for information not to flow through any sort of temporarily established group, but directly to our members and, let's see number three being electronic voting, of course being in the situation we're in. We all are aware that, for the foreseeable future, zoom and electronic communication is how we're going to be doing things our bylaws currently don't provide for anything. So we created a process whereby we can. You know conduct hopefully conduct our elections in an efficient and transparent manner and then and at the same time have our results. You know in a timely manner, you know number four being the special elections is currently our bylaws basically provide that if there's a vacancy most important, the chairs vacancy, but of that there's simply a an order of succession that you know if the chair, if the chair becomes vacant, the first vice chair steps in and they sort of move up the ladder the committee felt that it wouldn't be in the boards it would. The board's interest would be better served if we were dealing with an extended period of four months or greater that the board have an opportunity to weigh in on. You know whom they would like to see as chair. At the same time, it was felt that it would, it would be a burden to ask a first vice chair to automatically assume the chair chairmanship and that it would, while the first vice chair could certainly run and then assume the chair. At the same time, it would give the board an opportunity to have input as to who would be serving if you're talking about you know eight nine months or more it was. It was really a way of maximum participation. I guess if that makes sense, any questions, specific items to discuss stroke, yeah about your vocals, so I'll start with dr smith. Your first did you want to call out a second request. Yes, I'd like to call out, I wasn't keeping up with the sections. Well, why don't you just tell me which section instead of calling them out? Okay. First of all, I'd like to say that you guys did a great job spend a lot of time, and you are your document that you produced was very well put together. I do have a question about the purpose of elect and I don't want to seem personal, eliminating the elections committee when when it was not just me, but it was other people as well and also that I'm interested in knowing why a secret voting and third, when we spoke, you spoke about new people on the board. You know having to not. Maybe not know who the people are who's going to be representing them in these executive offices. I know. In the past we had said we had mandated that people who were running even if they were running on a post for the offices should at least speak about what it is, what vision they have for the board. It knew our old members would be interested in that now that it is optional, as opposed to mandatory okay. So that's section two, so we'll call out section two. All of three things I mentioned are different: all of them were section two, I believe so yeah so section two and then, and then surely do you want to call out a section? Oh, is it my turn now this shirley's turn? Yes, no is this second shirley yeah second shirt, probably two section one, please one to do with the term limits and revisions according to term limits right, okay, one yeah and then michael. I would like to call out section three regarding what I think is an excellent section, but might need a little bit touching up, and that is electronic voting. Okay and then janet. Oh sorry, I'm just calling out the change in terms also okay, so that's that section. This special term is what you're talking about section one actually right and then cormac. Oh I'm sorry, michael already called it out. I'm good I'll, wait for that discussion. Okay, so it looks like people want to discuss sections one two and three so susan, you want to start with one okay, as I said before, we originally, you know we I mean term limits are now part of the city charter. They took effect as of last year. We realized that if you, if we hold elections and terms of office, start as of december, one, anyone who will be term limited at or is in their last year will basically be barred from running for office, and this would include obviously some of our most experienced members and it was. It was felt that it would simplify things a great deal if the term limit the terms of service on the board were aligned with terms of office, so that we wouldn't have people and there will be actually a large number of people. One might assume. That would actually be barred from running for office in order to have the max the greatest possible participation by adjusting the election cycle. This sort of eliminates that problem there is also there are other benefits that are realized from that. First of all, as I said, when we changed them five years ago, it was because we felt that newly appointed members, whose terms started in april really didn't have enough time to learn about the people they'd be voting for if elections were held in may so, which is the was the logic behind moving them to november. However, if you're giving people more time to learn about the board and it- and I think many of us have found that it takes months sometimes years to learn that having people participate in their first election when they've been through an entire year in the life of the board, will actually increase their knowledge, it might even motivate them to want to to run for office. The addition there's the additional benefit is that our elections, when held in november, we tend to have lower than average participation in november as a holiday month, whereas when you hold it in the spring, you avoid that march being a sort of normal or average month. So all things considered and the fact that we do not, you know we don't review our bylaws on a sort of a scheduled basis. It's something that we only look at every couple of years, so it was felt that, if we're dealing with the subject of elections, we should be looking at the entire topic in a holistic way and therefore the idea of aligning the election cycle made sense to do now. Okay, shirley, I see that you have your hand up, can't hear you shirley secunda. I see that you have your hand up. I can't hear you, okay, I'm unneeded now! Yes, I can. I speak to this now. Yes, oh, okay, great okay! First of all, thank you so much susan and thanks to the bylaws committee, the hard work you did was so outstanding and obvious, and the professional manner in which you approach this. I just think it's tremendously impressive. I have to admit I was kind of surprised that the whole bylaw issue even was coming to us this month at first, but then I realized that there is a necessity to address the idea of electronic voting. So we do need to address that. I understand that I am totally perplexed as to why we're addressing this issue of term limits and aligning people's terms with term limits when term limits has just kicked in and it's going for eight years and this kind of concern about voting for a chair who may not have a full term. This isn't going to come up for years and years and years. So from my point of view, I really am kind of opposed to addressing this kind of thing. There can be all kinds of changes as these years go on. There was opposition tremendous opposition by the way to every borough, president, but one including very vehemently by our own gail brewer, certainly by many council people, including our own council, speaker corey johnson, and I think the feeling at the time was, is that they were going to work to try to take away tour this term limit requirement whenever the next charter is done, and then these recent years charter revision comes very regularly and often and as far as giving people the opportunity to learn about the rights. That was what we were all about in changing our bylaws last time to allow you appointees to board time to get to know what the world is about. I just feel it really strongly that now is not the time to be urgent about. I guess formulating these new bylaws to do its charitable limits. I think it seems rising first time. Second of all, I think that there is at this time of all times. Why should we be considering having two elections and they would be two of two full elections, regardless of even if one is only for four months, and why would we want to go to the trouble of that here as it is we're going to have a tremendously challenging thing before us when we are doing the electronic voting? So I will tell you I'm kind of opposed to that and I feel there's time and I feel even that's safe. The bylaws process is going to be going on and going on for a while from what I understand so there's some time if we have to address this still within the process, but a little later give us a little time to get our feet wet with this new term limits idea- and you know, let's concentrate on electronic voting. Okay, great thanks, charlie janet. Thank you. So I mean I agree too. I think it's noble, I think the basis of it makes a lot of sense, but one when you run just the percent the odds of five people out of 51 choosing the eighth year. You know you wind up with a first a fairly small percentage chance that this will actually happen, but that aside, I just want to sort of second what shirley said in that look at this meeting like we are in crazy times it's and our plate is so full that there's just no rush like it's a great idea. I just don't think this is the best time to address it, and perhaps when we have less to address in two three years, we can revisit it, but I support the other things and support the feelings behind it. Thank you thanks janet bo, and I were just thinking I don't see it seems to be very inefficient to have two elections. I can't hear you. I can't hear you both. I hear you well, I'm unmuted. I don't know what to say. What can you hear me now yeah, you need to be closer to your speaker anyway. I just think that the idea of having two elections within four months is really a waste of time, and if you, if you feel the need to change the term, which I think is a good idea, why don't we just have an election in november and increase the term of whoever gets elected in november by those four months and then we'll be in sync and we'll have one election and it's pretty clean? I don't know why we wouldn't do it that way. If I remember correctly, I think you said it was five years ago. I think we we did have a similar situation where we increased, we had a one-time increase or was it a decrease? We did the exact same thing that the current proposal is that we had an election for an abbreviated term yeah all right. Well then, I retract what I said, but I just I think that having two elections within four months is really a waste of time. We should just increase the term and that'll, be it okay. Other than that, I support it. Thanks bo dan thanks, I I just want to say that there's been a lot of great thought. Great work. That's been done in this and I think that everybody has really compelling arguments. I I think what beau just said makes a lot of sense to me as well, but at the same time the whole reasoning behind changing the bylaws is a really good one which is aligning terms of office with the terms of other boards is really smart. It aligns us with community boards. It aligns us with the membership committee rules, for instance, at the river park advisory. It also provides that learning curve for incoming new board members. So I really do think it's very smart and well written but, as surely was saying and in speaking with corey's office, they're really trying hard to eliminate that eight-year term limit, and there are a lot of years- and I see it as maybe either it shouldn't be a rush to go ahead and do it right now, so that the board actually can decide who gets that longer term in a different way. I think I'm not opposed to the electronic voting or keeping it private so that there's no retribution against those and seeing those votes so that no one's punished for their vote, especially if it's an election, that's contested, but anyway. I do want to commend the bylaws for thinking of this, and I definitely think eventually that we should have elections that result in new officers in april. Hey thanks dan, just a reminder to everybody we're just speaking with section one right now: rocio rossio you! I thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to voice my opinion on this one. I thoroughly agree with shirley bo and janet. Regarding this. I think I know that I think it's a bit premature and I think that I'm okay with the electronic- and I know that you, susan you, put a lot of work in your committee- did a lot of work, but I think that the comments that were said actually, I was in favor of this, but I changed my mind because I hear my fellow board members telling me these things and they make sense. So I would like to oppose that section. Thank you thanks rocio susan hi. Thank you. I agree with shirley and beau and rossia now and I had brought up the same question at exec last week, because I just it just didn't make sense to me to do this separate four-month election, and I and I said at the time- and I you know I gave more thought I was glad some other people are questioning. It just seemed to make more sense not to have the separate four-month election when the next year is voted on. We then extend it the four months there and it keeps it simple. I understand all the surround that you're saying, but I'm in favor of that route instead of the separate four-month election. Okay thanks susan valerie, thank you and thank you again to all the hard work by the bylaws committee meeting weekly to work on this, and I know that your committee has really thought these things through and has thought and has had the foresight to think of all the different ways that this could go. So I would like to voice my support for section one and that I think that it's, I think it's a checks and balances on the volatility that we're currently experiencing right now, instead of locking someone into that longer term or perhaps giving someone a chance to try out maybe one of the other offices, but I just I think that, just with the volatility and we're still in the state of emergency, there's still all of these states on this advisory list, there's a budget shortfall at the state and local level we're not getting federal stimulus anytime soon. It just seems as though this is a just a checks and balances for the board, and I think I put my trust into the bylaws committee that they've proposed this to us. I will be supporting this section. I do have one question as to how will how will we be voting on this? Will we be voting on this by different sections or as a whole yeah, when we call when we and obviously it seems like people are going to have different votes on different sections? So when we do vote on this, we'll people will be able to vote on item. I guess we'll sec, we'll section them out as item one two, three and four and I'll clarify you know. If somebody wants to have a dissenting vote or an informative vote on any section, they can indicate at that time you can vote on it as a block or you can voice well. It sounds like there's going to be an objection to that, so some allow people to vote on the different sections when we, when we get to that point. Okay, thanks bob ely yeah. I guess I guess I'm in support of it as it's written. I think I think the criticism that I've heard and- and I understand it, but the criticism that I heard in opposition is that this is premature and, to be honest with you, I don't think it's premature at all. In fact, it's addressing a change in the law that has occurred if that change in law goes back. If somehow it gets reversed, then we, as a community board, have the option again of changing our bylaws to conform with the change. In term limits, if they're, if they're taken away, but at this point in time we have term limits, so I just don't I mean there's a criticism, that's premature, but I don't understand how that criticism should prevent the progress, that's necessary and is quite reasonable and well written. Thank you thanks bob matt. I want to reiterate what bob said much more eloquently than I could have and also say that the way that it is written is written in order to provide the board the most amount of say there was a concern that if, for you know a longer term would do you know deny the board as much say as possible and this way maximizes it. I don't think it's premature, I think it's pretty measured. I certainly will be supporting it. So thank you great thanks. Yes, first I'd like to just say that for the last five years, as things have changed, I want to thank not only the hard-working committee members on the nominating committee of which I chaired as well as the election committee on which I chaired was an honor, and I thank all of the members of my peers who voted for us. However, I do take exception to the comment that was made that the election committee did not contribute much to the process. I don't know if, if others who served in the last five years on these various boards would feel that way, but I feel compelled as chair to say that and second with the secret voting, how what well, how did that come about? What's the merit and secret voting yeah? Surely we're not on section two yet so I just want to just oh wait. Oh I'm sorry, the secret part is, I just want to just okay. Do not have this be too confusing about the election committee that did not contribute much to the process. Is that three? No, that is that, is the election. Tell me all of them with three: what which one is that one? That's the section two, the election of the officers? I don't think we have anybody else left on this, but let me just make sure, and is there anybody else who wants to speak to number one, the special term, the important meeting I'll call you when I'm finished? Okay, susan, you have any issue with moving to section two you're muted, susan you're muted. I know I recognize no. I appreciate all the comments and I understand the will the interest in moving in a deliberate way, just to sort of reiterate the working groups. Sort of mindset was that we were dealing with the subject of elections as a whole and we did not want to do things piecemeal. Didn't it didn't feel that it was fair to sort of just kick something down the road for the next committee or working group to deal with and as it's been said, you know, there's been a change in the law and I work based on the current state of the law. So I definitely see the other side to you know we have time, but just the consensus of the group came out the way it did so. That's it, but thank you, okay. So I think we've concluded the discussion on section one on special terms, so we'll move on to section two, which is the election of officers. Did you want to briefly address anything susan before we? Let's hear I mean dr smith, had let's go back to what she was saying? Okay thanks. I thank you. I thank you for that susan. I don't have to repeat what I said about taking exception to the comments. I don't know. The members on who served in the last five years on those committees also felt the same way I do, but as chair of all of them, and that's what I wanted to definitely take accepted too. The second thing is secret voting. Why are we changing it? What was the thinking behind secret voting? Okay, well, secret voting is the norm in our society and all of our elections. If, in fact, the idea that we have open ballots is rather atypical and people, not many people over a long period of time have expressed concern that someone could go back, look at who voted for them, who voted against them and make decisions based on whether or not they received someone's support. Your vote should be your vote and you shouldn't have to be answerable to anyone for that we certainly will be keeping you know. Things will be just as secure but yeah it's the idea that peop someone could be penalized for voting their conscience. Basically has that happened with anyone on the board to your knowledge? Yes, yeah. Actually, yes, and actually I'm gonna, I'm gonna call on david next, because he had spoken about this at the at the meetings david. You want to go ahead, yeah. Thank you, clara. We have had in the past a problem with other chairs and not anybody in current memory, but we've had other chairs who have, especially in a contested election, who have looked in and saw who voted for who. This is really a personnel issue and, as susan said, it's the american tradition. Now vote should be sacred, it should be secret, it should be have no ramifications. It should have no consequences, whether you get appointed to this committee or that committee or whether you're, not in favor with the chair. It has happened before it hasn't happened in recent memory, but it's happened before so. I am very strongly in favor of keeping our votes confidential. There's no reason why they shouldn't be confidential and you vote your conscience and it with no ramifications and that's why we put it in there and I feel strongly about it, and let me say this since votes. Also, we are public and we make public. Are those vote, those decisions, a vote? Can't someone come in and look at it publicly, because we are a public body. Well, the feeling was that this comes under the sort of the personnel where we shut the board. Just for the for the community board to be clear, the election has to do with a purely internal matter. As such, it isn't something that is open. It's it doesn't require the same level of public inspection. It doesn't it does what about open meetings law. It doesn't it's not applied that does not apply. This is a purely internal matter. That's why there's no public action that we're taking the shirley secundum. Okay, I just want. Can you hear me now yeah? Okay, I just wanted to point out section two, the process I have no objections to, but the dates are already stating the proposed change of dates so, in other words, the change from the current process of starting in september and then voting in november on these. The dates that have been inserted here are the starting in you're, absolutely right and if January and then voting in march. Back to that alone, I wouldn't vote for it because it is related to section one and the whole idea of formulating this new schedule around the new term limits. I think it's fair to say that if section one does not carry that or if it that the second is automatically amended, I don't, I don't think yes, I will accept a friendly amendment to adjust the the dates to conform to our currencies. No problem there right. Okay, thanks adam, I was just going to point out that I'm not sure I see the parallel between you know our voting for our chair and then the american experience of voting for an elected official you know voting for the chair is a it's a part of our deliberative assembly process and I think that other deliberative assemblies have public open elections for those board positions not necessarily universally about I'm. Actually, not I'm to my knowledge, the norm is that votes are kept confidential and they're not subject to review and, as was mentioned, the possibility that people could have their votes held against them. I think is a compelling reason. I actually the idea that it's, I don't see how the public would be served because you know where this is. As I, as I said before, it's an internal matter. It has to do with who we're choosing. I don't know what else to say about that, and just for clarification. It's for all offices, not just for one correct most of the other boards. Only. I think one of the board has it where it's it's mandated to be public. I think all the other boards, you know, have moved into having these votes confidential. Dr smith, yeah. I just it's very interesting. I don't I've already made my case, but no one has been definitive unless it's a thing you don't want to share I've been on the board for quite a while, and I have never heard of anyone having taking personal reprisals against someone who did not vote for them. Well, surely case. I think he and I might I might I don't know I'm he might have been on longer than me, but I know I've never heard of it. So if you want to share that with me sure I'll show sure my personal experience, I was kept off the board for a year because I would not share who I was going to vote for chair of the board when I was originally appointed by former borough president virginia fields, and I never they never. Provided me with my appointment letter, even though I was called down and attended the training as having been appointed to the board. I mean this is not you know in that distant the past, but I'm not supporting either way, because I think everybody's got their strong positions on this, but it has happened. You know in the past and thank you for saying that, but virginia was not a member of our board. She was the board of president. I it made it seem like someone on community board, 2 had been affected, no community board community board too. No, I'm not sure what position he had at that time, but somebody from the board called me up and asked me who I was going to vote for, and I said I'm not comfortable sharing that with you and kind of my appointment letter, so that was communicated to the borough president, who then declined to send the letter. I see thank you and shirley I'd like to apologize. If I gave you the impression or I gave anyone the impression that the nominating committee or the elections committee has not been an important part of our process to date, it was simply something about having more of a standardized. You know the I know. Last year, the elections committee produced a very lengthy and well-detailed report. It's I think we felt it would simplify the process if the requirements were actually set out in the bylaws instead of having a committee generate a new report every year. I thank you for that, but I still take exception to not contributing much to the process. So if that can be worded in some other way, and that could be, you could strike that kind of that verbiage. Then I would not just me I don't know of other people who have worked in the last five years on these committees. We did the very best we could with the directions that we were given, but I do thank you, susan for your first for your comment and if it's, if you're, seeing it as an apology, I accept it. It's just that I just took exception to not contributing the verb did not contribute much to the process. Okay, I I've got three hands up. I've got a bobby lay and then georgia, and then keen sandy, russo and oh and then sandy sorry, I didn't I've got more people than fit on my screen. So if you're waving and you're not on my screen, I can't see you so okay, so bob yeah, I would just say just to pinpoint the one issue as to the confidential voting. It's the potential okay that it could occur. Okay, we do have evidence that has happened in the past. You know it's digging up things that we probably don't really want to talk about, but the reality is. It causes a potential for that to occur and there's absolutely no reason for that and in a confidential vote, there's also a chilling effect. So you're looking over your shoulder, because you know your votes public as to who you're voting for and you know, look when it's a competitive voting situation. You want to vote for the person that you want to vote for and not you know who you think might get elected, because you're concerned that they'll get elected and then they see that you didn't vote for them. So there's multiple factors into why it should be confidential. Thank you and georgia hi. Would the public be able to request information about who voted? How is that something? That's happened in the past, I mean it's in the chat right now. I think that that somebody had mentioned that they had access. To those I mean that's public foiable information. So yes, as it stands now, he stands now but keem and I don't see okay now. Can you hear me? Yes, we can yeah okay. I personally experienced retribution for one of my votes for chair, so I just want you to know it's a real thing. That's it thank you keane for sharing that with us sandy. I understand this hesitation about making it public because people can well what team just said you know be upset with who you voted for, on the other hand, that maybe that problem or that intimidation should be addressed, and I am for open ballot because we're community representatives, you know when other you know when our state assembly- and you know senators, we know what they voted for and who they vote for, and I think that that's an important information that the community is entitled to. You know who are you vote? Who are you voting for? Who do you support to be chair of cb2? That's an important decision, an important vote and people in the community are entitled to know who supported and how many- and you know I just think that our votes should be public. We demand that of other politicians and other community representatives. So why not? You know demand it of us. Well, all of our votes in terms of how we vote on resolutions or any of those things remain public our positions and where the positions we take and who joins them and who doesn't is public record and that doesn't change. So I think so why shouldn't the vote? Be public record? Yes, I know everything is public record. I know everything is recorded and people can ask to hear the recording or get a print out. You know a transcript, but so I don't see why there's one particular act which is really important. You know who are the chairs and co-chairs and going to be for the next two years or whatever. I think that's important, that people know where you stand. Well, I don't I mean to reiterate it's like if it has, if it has a chilling effect, if it inhibits people from choosing, you know you know causing them to alter the votes, then it has a compelling reason. You know that's the problem. You got to address the intimidation before we go back and back and forth. I think sandy. I think your point is very clear and well. You know made very well as far as you know. That's and david do you want to. Oh I mean there are other things that we vote on in private people's raises: how much we're going to pay them. We close the entire board to the public for that there's, no foil, there's no transcripts, there's no video, and I just feel that I'm not sure it's the public's right to know how you voted for chair. It is an internal matter we're not taking a public policy on anything sandy. I would agree with you all things that we vote on that affects the public that we that resolutions it should be should be open, but I don't think that this vote, which does have ramifications king just said it. I also have had some ramifications with it and I'm not going to get into it. But carter has so there's a problem here and I think that it should be within the board, and I think that your vote is sacred to you and nobody should be looking over your shoulder and saying. Ah, you didn't vote for me. I'm the chair. Now you didn't vote for me, so that's where I'm coming yeah thanks david. I just want to make sure everybody on the board that we're clear that the votes within board members are very different from personnel issues within the office, and so, let's not confuse those two issues, because that is that is separate as far as employees of the board right just saying that we do have clarifying because you and separated those out matt. Thank you for that clarification. I was getting ready to say that matt I was only going to mention that I was originally very hesitant to endorse secret balloting until I looked into it and most of the party leadership in dc, because it's a party election for who gets you know put up, for you know speaker of the house or whatever is by secret ballot, and it got me a lot more comfortable with the idea, as was the impeachment trial. There are a number of instances where large bodies have agreed that it is the better way, and I think it is here too okay. I just I had a question because I'm for you, susan, because I'm hearing clearly some different issues- is that something that you might consider that we vote separately on that one item, because that everybody- I didn't, hear anybody speaking to any other issues in this section. I wouldn't the goal here, I'm just throwing this out, because when I get to the vote part of this, I don't want it to be complicated. So I'm trying to address that beforehand. Absol, you know absolutely the goal here is that we have consensus and that, if it's an element that would you know that can be you know taken as a separate I'm you know I'm not I'm not insisting that it's an all or nothing, absolutely, not. Okay, I think, given the fact that there are those of us who don't agree with this secret ballot, that would that be a separate vote. I see yes, absolutely so is that you accept that as a friendly amendment, but we'll just we'll have that. Yes, we can vote on this. Absolutely we can vote on this. Okay, so we'll pull out that one section just on that. Okay, is there any other discussion matt? Did you have a matt, or did I not lower your hand? No you I'm sorry, you didn't lower my hand. Sorry, okay, all right so have we concluded the discussions on the election of officers. Everybody is good. Okay, so now we're going to move on to the third section, which is the electronic voting. I think matt you had excuse me, michael veen, you have yes, I I'm sorry am I on yes, you are michael okay. I would like to, as everyone else has done, congratulate the committee on an excellent job of putting forward some very comprehensive recommendations to amend the bylaws and I'm only going to address the electronic voting, which I think is very complicated and difficult to figure out in the introduction. It says due to the cove crisis and I think electronic voting in the future may be necessary for other purposes, not just because of the covert crisis, so I'm glad to see that it is going to be a part of our bylaws. My problem here is: I'm not clear on one aspect of how the voting would work. It says that the district manager shall distribute ballots to all of the members present based upon a roll call just prior to the distribution. Then it says the ballots shall be collected and distributed to the three member tally committee. It doesn't say how it looks as though it might be complex. Do the ballots go to each individual of the three members which makes it very cumbersome or are the ballasts collected then by the district manager who batches them and sends them to the tally committee? It seems like a very complicated process and I think we want to make it as simple as possible for the tally committee. So that's my first question. I think we need clarification before we're asked to vote on this section as to how that would work. District manager distributes the balance. The ballots go back to the district manager and the district manager then distributes it to the tally committee. I believe that this is what was intended by the bylaws working group. My second comment- and I see susan raising her head, so I think we just need to make sure that the language is amended to include that number. Two. There is language that says, or there can be another process that the district manager would initiate, whereby electronic balloting is done in a different way other than the system that is described above so I'm wondering is that language going to show up in the bylaws as well or are we just going to go with the language described with the tally committee? How would that look in the final version of the bylaws that we are being asked to adopt the tally committee and or a different system that the district manager might want to implement in the future? It's a little bit unclear as to how we would be making a decision tonight, susan. If you could answer that, I'd really appreciate it. I think that boiler's working did a group did a great job. This is a complicated section. I congratulate you on it, but it needs a bit of clarification. Absolutely you know that's what we need to hear, because when you, when you're when you're you know a small group of people looking at this it doesn't it's not always apparent. If there are ambiguities, the first, the description that is in 7a, I mean in subsection a is what exists if we do not ha, I mean I should say the the subsection b exists so that if the district manager can present an application from a third-party source, whether it is commercially available, it is free. It is provided by the city that simply streamlines it. It's really sort of a complement to the proceeding section in that. If you don't have an exist, an app that will do this for you, then we have a process where using email that will allow us to communicate, but that if we can have an app that will allow us to send out the ballots and have them come back that if it's, if it's reliable enough and if the board approves it, then we can. Then we can rely on that instead now lacking that, though, if we are going to use the process whereby the district manager distributes the ballots email, that's sent to every board member, that's an individual email and either it's going to come from specifically a separate email that the board establishes like elections at cb2 manhattan.org or it will include all three names of whomever. Is the tally committee so that when you reply it goes to all three. So it goes automatically to all three members of the tally community either without going through the district manager, the district manager would be included. It's just like if I sent you an email and I sent an email to susan kent and sandy russo. You know if I send it to you and then you hit reply all and everybody is on there and gets the email back same way and let's hope that it will all work in one night. It is a complicated procedure and I think it's well thought out and I'm really hopeful that it can work within the time frame of one meeting. Thank you committee for your excellent work and I see sandy is making a lot of gestures, something that she hasn't spoken on this so I'll call her dandy. Well, there goes the confidentiality right. There's there wasn't a way, it's completely disappointing, with the section before that we were talking about anonymous versus dynamite. Well, I think it's nuts well there I would say. Yes, you are right that there is an electronic record. The question becomes: are the records open for examination, the people who are doing the tallying know what the who voted for whom right? And it's not anonymous? It's okay, excellent point people who are going to be entitled to know how anyone voted but the rest of us, it's nuts, it's nuts, dr smith! Thank you carter. I am not sure you said for me when I was talking about the candidates and how it was changed for them to speak required and you guys said it wasn't required. You said that was three. Is that section three? No, that was section two. Do you wanna? Do you wanna speak to that? Well, no! Well, I want to speak to the followers. If you want to continue with three, you guys can go on, but I want to go back to that and make my point: okay, fair enough. You did bring that up before, so that that's we'll go back to that. Okay, cormac yeah! So, first of all, as others have said, susan to you and everybody on your committee, great work- and I know it was a lot of work. I really appreciate it. My law stuff is ruling, and thank you addressing this section I want is something michael touched on in the little preamble you make reference to Covid-19, but nowhere where I read this and I'm not a lawyer. So maybe I have this wrong. Does it say that electronic voting is only for the duration of the kovic crisis? It's it suggests which suggests to me that we're basically putting the bylaws to have electronic voting in the future, but we also do not specify anywhere here under what circumstances or conditions would we have electronic voting as opposed to the other or whose discretion you know? Who makes that decision yeah, I'm just going to jump in because gail actually addressed this when she was speaking to us, because this is determined by the governor's suspension of the public officer's law without that suspension, we're required to meet him in person, and so that would essentially eliminate this. So unless there are any changes to that, all I want to know. Thank you, I'm out and I'll be voting for this dan. When it comes to anonymity, you can give codes on a surveymonkey or other types of ways to vote without maintaining your anonymity. So there are very simple free programs out there that could make this possible and very quick and not take up any board time where everybody fills out the survey with their code number. So it is possible, it doesn't have to be done by email. That's all I wanted to say right indicating let me just make sure she can katie I'm trying to unmute you, but I cannot. You may have to do there. You go okay there. I am. I didn't raise lower my hand in time I was agreeing with daniel. There are other systems that we can have anonymous voting. We just haven't investigated all of them yet but they're a double-blind system. So I think we should continue to pursue it to get the exact mechanism that works for us, but it's not it's not necessarily going to be a problem and enough systems out there. Thank you great thanks david did you have something else you wanted to do last night. I think sandy did see something in the electronic voting, which is true, but the thing is: there's the there's, the caveat that we put in, and we have time to figure out exactly how to do it. Dan is talking about other methods, other methods, so is katie bordenero. So we could make it confidential and you're right sandy the way it stands now it there's a floor in it. We recognized that when we did it, but the caveat gives us time to work on it. Thank you, okay. Is there any other discussion on this session valerie? Just so everyone's clear? Can you just reiterate who sits on that tally committee in case that was brushed over thanks? It's a three-person committee. It is the representative of the borough president, it is a representative of another elected official and it is a committee chair chosen. You know, however, we can vote on. You know we can. We can ask for a volunteer from among our committee chairs and it's those three people. Okay, is there any other discussion on section three? Okay, dr smith, you had you had a comment that you wanted to make on section two thank you carter, yes in the past and for the amount of time that I've been on the board. I you know people always because they feel they either want to, for whatever reason they nominate themselves, and it was said that- and we always be required in the past- that, if even if it wasn't a and if it was an uncontested line, that the person should at least spend about a cup five minutes talking about who they are, what they bring to that and what would be their vision and their? What plans would they have for moving the board forward if they are elected to the position? And now I see that it is not required, but it is, it is recommended and I feel strongly that it even uncontested people should say who they are. What is their plan for moving the board forward, not just to be voted into an office, and you don't really see any kind of real leadership? Okay. Well, we what we have here it is at the option of the candidate. I think it was. It was felt that since it's certainly in a candidate's interest to want to speak that you know just for someone to forgo that would really you know they'd be doing themselves a disservice and, of course the people who are voting can impute the fact that somebody doesn't really want to share. You know what their thoughts and plans are and can take that into account when they're voting, hey thanks, lois. Well, that being said, susan there's no yes or n no vote and on the ballot as it is right now. So I agree with shirley smith doctor that the person who is uncontested should speak the two minutes or that I read it was two minutes, but I think they should have three minutes, because in the past there have been, if you call them candidates, because they're automatically voted in because there's no contest that you don't know who they are, they put their name in. No one runs against them. They could be a first term person or a first few months person and you don't know who they are, and I agree with shirley that you it's an obligation that they should say who they are a little bit about their interest of. Why they're running and their experience and, as I said, there's no, yes or no vote for so the person automatically gets in thanks comments, no comment or mac. I have a comment. Quarterback sorry, I suddenly realized. I was all masked and muted, so yeah I mean I just want to say that I really strongly disagree with the views just expressed. I think it is true that candidates should be given the opportunity to express themselves if they want to, but there's something that I feel is not only unnecessary but just kind of cruel and slightly undemocratic about compelling them to make. You know a speech or statement, and you know, and dan miller can talk to this. Two minutes is an awful long time in communication terms, actually for people to speak and for people to talk, and I just don't think that it should be an obligation or requirement if people feel like people know me and I'm just putting my name up there and they can vote for me or not. I think that's good and the idea that no, we must make them do a dog and pony show, and we must make the rest of us sit through the dog and pony show. It seems to me utterly ridiculous and, frankly, a little bit mean-spirited. Cormac. Thank you for sharing that I'd like to I'd like to respond. Yeah, dr smith, is raised. No, I said I was calling on you. Thank you. Obviously I do not agree with the statement that was just made. Everybody here is a volunteer and, yes, we know people, it depends on. If you really there's people on the board, I don't, I know better than others and for a whole lot of reasons and I'm sure the rest of you all can say that about yourself, but when it comes to vote to putting your name down, this is a leadership. Let's not forget that it's not just the title, it is. Where are we taking the board? What kinds of new things are you going to do? Or is it just because you want to be the chair? Vice chair, you have maybe it's important for you because you plan to run a public office or you know everybody uses I've. As I've said, I've been on the board a long time. I've seen the good, the bad and the ugly, and so that is my opinion, but I think to say that it's mean spirited is not a good. I don't think that that's necessary to say, because everybody has an opinion, but I don't think you need to color it. Who was the last person that spoke? Oh yeah, cormac yeah, I just as another note. I don't recall in my length of service on the board anybody running for the first time for an office ever not speaking even before when we didn't require it so just pointing that out. For you know, subsequent elections, that's true, but just as a point you're younger than me, so your memory might be better than mine. I don't I'd have to think about that. So I have no response to what you just said other than you could be right. Thanks rocio, you haven't had a chance to speak on this yet well. I think I go back as long as shirley and ed mom, which is a long time right, shirley right, we've gone back, shirley, cicada, actually and edma and doris. We are the longest observing the serving board members of this board, and this thing about speaking started just a few years ago, maybe about seven years ago that it was almost mandated that people have. I didn't really think it was necessary and you know it's a thing, but I'm listening to everybody speaking and I'm thinking you know, I don't know if everybody is in agreement with everything that is being said, and you change my mind and some actions here. So maybe we should consider sending it back to the committee so that we could actually iron out the differences that so many of you are saying it might be worthwhile doing it. There is no urgency to have this vote tonight. Can we all sleep on it? Maybe next month we can take it up. Is this something that you might consider susan actually elections? We there is a time sensitive, because the election cycle does start next month and it's would be inappropriate to change the bylaws affecting elections during an election cycle. That's why that's why the committee worked. You know met as often as it did so that something could be presented to the board so that we could we would have you know our bylaws would be updated to reflect voting policy. Okay. So the some of the provisions that you have presented are I'm okay with the electronic. I think it's a must. I think we should consider passing that at this time, but I don't know if the rest of the items need to be passed. Okay, thanks, georgia, I'm honestly utterly confused about the different sections of this conversation at this point, we're discussing section two, the election of the officers right now. I know, but we've been discussing this bylaws section and taking it piece by piece and now I've sort of lost the thread, because it's been a very long conversation and I'm curious when we might vote on this or as rocio just suggested- maybe push it to next month. Appropriate doesn't mean that it can't be inappropriate, doesn't mean that it can't be done. I'm just sort of I just want to say it's 9 21, and it is the week of the democratic national convention. It is, I believe, it's the last evening. Thank you, okay, david yeah. Maybe we could say that they have the option of speaking or sending in a letter, that's distributed to the entire board before the election, explaining their vision of what they want to do, and I don't think that we have to hear from from the secretary. I think that's the thing for the chair. So if that ameliorates the problem, I don't think it's a problem, but a letter n or the option to speak, and would you accept that as a friendly amendment? Well, the id the opportunity to send in a statement is already in there. Okay, so we're so. We have to speak after they've been nominated okay. So we have the statement and it's distributed to the entire board. So I think that does it right and I would like to say, I think, very highly of my fellow board members. I think that they want the opportunity to speak and to share what they you know, what they think of the board and what they think are the issues, and I would trust in their discretion if they, if they feel that, if somebody felt they didn't need to speak it's because in their opinion, everyone knows where they stand. So I will just leave it at that: okay, amy, yeah hi, I I'm I've been listening to. I I'm backing georgia and russia that I think tonight we could vote on three because we do have to agree to do electronic balloting, but I think there's enough conversation here and enough disagreeing with opinions and there's so many numbers that maybe we put off everything else tall next. We can't even wait well until next month, because I agree it may be not usual, but maybe we needed a little more time on this and have a few more conversations before voting on it as a whole. Three doesn't work. Unfortunately, three does not work without two, because three is a is a mechanism for making two work in a virtual world and also we still have another section to discuss so, dr smith yeah. I think we should we have another section. Okay, I think we should call. We should vote tonight, okay, and so I'm not seeing any other discussion on this. Let's go to the to the last. I didn't want to use that right. I don't think that anybody had called out the last section, but it's just on special elections. I just want to make sure that that's the case, I don't, I don't see any hands, okay, that are going up- okay, so, oh god, so the items that are before us and it's obvious that that the vote on this is going to be a little bit. So we're going to have section hold on back here section one, which is the special term, is going to be one vote. We're going to have section two there's gonna be a vote on one portion of it, which is the secret ballot and then on the section as a whole and then on section three and section four is that is that correct susan? So everybody understand that's my understanding, okay, so what we're going to do as we go through, and I can clarify this as we're going through valerie's gonna, ask and people. If you have an exception to any one of those, we can note the exceptions, so it would be voting for section one, which is the special term section. Two is the election of officers. The subsection to that is whether or not vote is secret. Then there's section three, which is on electronic voting and then section four on the on the special election. So is everybody clear on that partner, kayaking sure go ahead with regards to section two: did they accept that friendly to remove the requirement to speak? I don't I susan did not remove it. So if I'm unhappy with a particular section, I have to vote down the entire bill or that part of it there you're in a sense that it's not it's, it's speaking, is at the option of the nominee. Okay, that's different than I understood the discussion earlier right. Also, susan special elections, that's different from the four months correct that is to fill vacancies when they are of when they occur and they occur yeah. Yes, I want to be sure, thank you, okay, great, so so valerie. I want to start obviously we'll do this at the roll call, yep bylaws section one term limits this is what are we am I'm asking I'm sorry you've been calling each person and they can get their okay perfect and, if you're siding with the committee. What is that is a voting in correct and you can vote different ways on each section? That's why we're breaking it up and right. Anybody has a question on what the specific things are. I can clarify it as we call their name. So is there a special? Is there a special event? I will repeat the votes number one we're voting on the sorry to have in front of me. The special term is how people will vote on that section. Two is the election of officers. The subset is whether or not it's secret right. Section three is: is the electronic voting electronic voting? Thank you charlie and then four is the special elections: okay valerie great akilah as qui, so I guess I'll. Just ask individually, bylaws section. One term limits: yes, okay, section: two election of officers for the entirety: yes for section two election of officers, the secret ballot. Yes, my last section or section 3 electronic voting, yes and section 4 special elections. Yes great! Thank you point of information. Yes, go ahead! Man! Sorry! I think when you phrase it as to vote yes on the secret ballot. Voting yes would be voting against the I'm sorry voting again. Voting yes, would be with the board with the committee or without that's correct, with the committee. Okay, and also if people you can jump ahead and say if you support all of them as well, just interesting time, yeah, okay yeah, that would be great yeah as soon as great yeah. If you support others, when you want to call out, is voting differently, then please do that and that'll make us go quicker, not that I don't mind getting each individual and it individually just won't need to speak it out. Okay, william banesh, every yes to all is written by the company; great okay, keem burger. Yes to all. Thank you! Carter, booth, yes, except for the secret ballot. I vote against that which number is the secret ballot gallery? It's section two and it's the it's remember we're voting on section two and two separate things is one is for it holistically and then one is for just the secret ballot and a four of the third.

Yes to the rest! Okay, let me look at what we have here so for hold on. Let me just freeze okay for bylaws, section, 1 term limits. We have 33 4 9 against one abstain and zero recusal for bylaws section two. We have 42 section 2 as a whole election of officers, 42 4 0 against one abstain and zero recusal for bylaws, section 2 election of officers, the secret ballot section. We have 31 4 11 against one abstention and for bylaws section 3 electronic voting. We have 43 4 0 against zero abstain and zero recusal oops hold on and then for section 4, just one. Second, we have 42 4 special elections, zero against one abstention and zero recusal. Okay, great with that said, we have a few more items to vote on. I'm sorry. I should have thought about this earlier that maybe we should have done this all together, but that seems like it might have been a little bit cumbersome, but we also have before us the omnibus vote on resolutions which include the sla licensing committee resolutions numbers one through twelve. The landmarks and public aesthetics resolutions numbers one through four and the schools in education resolutions number one and two: is there any unwillingness to vote on those items? No, could we simply ask for those who disagree with the omnibus rather than going through everyone who does agree? That's a good point. You know. Let me let me just put something before the board and see if we have agreement on this, since we had just considered an extensive roll call vote. We do know who is present and I don't believe anybody has dropped off the vote since we've taken that vote, and so, if there's not an objection, maybe I can get a voice vote. We can vote on the omnibus by voice vote with anybody stating their distension abstention. Their recusal is that there is everybody in favor of that. Yes is there. Anybody opposed I'm staying refusing from voting on the omnibus bill by voice. No, I don't care anybody, okay, so all those favor of the sla license committees, one through twelve items, resolutions, one through twelve excuse me the landmarks resolution, one through four and the schools in education items, one through two, all those in favor say: yes, anybody opposed, okay, any abstentions or recusals and joe your dog. You know he's barking, okay, okay, so the rest of the resolutions carry unanimously. You know I just want to conclude this meeting and again you know my thoughts are really about tom and really going gonna miss having tom on the board. It's something that you know he's a very active member of the board and somebody that transitioning to electronic- or you know, meeting in on zoom, really just changed the dynamic with tom a lot, but I do miss seeing him and I thought I'd end on that note. Is there a motion to adjourn? Okay thanks, everybody so much second yeah, don't forget to vote and to fill out the census? Okay, you.
