I just want to let you know before we start Stephen, that we ask you to keep it to two minutes, and this is just testimony from the public There's not going to be any opining or back and forth unless a community board member has a question for you.
Except it's larger, and you have someone who's trained to assist the person in and out of the vehicle It's for anybody that wants to use the service New York City wants to make the city more accessible to everybody.
This is not a shared right, service, very good, question, Robin rothschild you almost just answered, I was going to say.
So much for the presentation, very valuable for our community to hear our second speaker is Nathaniel Weiss who's going to be speaking about 72, West, 11Th street renovation, proposal.
There's, a jewish cemetery that actually predates 11th street There's, a little fragment of it left on the south side towards sixth avenue, and it's a treasure It's been in need of preservation and renovation for many years, And we're going before landmarks next week with a proposal to fix the wall and Refurbish And we're just hoping that you'll pass a resolution of support.
Yes, I just wanted to thank the group, the congregation and the community people helping for this.
Voting and I want to remind people that if you get an absentee ballot and you're concerned about the mail, you can return it at a polling site either during early voting or on election day.
I think that week will not be as busy as election day It's a great opportunity to actually cast your ballot in person.
It is important for people to get out to vote as well as obviously the president, and this is a crucial year, but the census early voting I have a hearing coming up on Tuesday on the impact of Covid-19 on financial aid for students.
We are asking that the opportunity programs which support educationally and economically disadvantaged young people, that they not be cut any more than 10 percent same, is true for funding for our public colleges and universities.
Social distancing, but wearing masks is very effective and I did not feel at risk, so things are coming back a little bit at a time and, of course, the issues that people are concerned about with more homelessness.
We have a couple questions for you, but I do want to let everyone know that Valerie posted some very important links on the chat if you'd like to see links to the census, as well as the absentee ballot.
Where I work, it's actually in Tribeca , CB1 Is, it legal for me to give neighbors Well, I, you know I'm not completely and utterly conversant in what their procedures are, but if they took down the phone numbers, it's usually because they're going to contact them.
They have had 22 years and other municipal uses have in fact been removed from the park and there have been both with elected officials, Community Board representatives, at least two, if not three meetings with the police department DOT the mayor's office, with a myriad of suggestions of how to I personally in the 21st century, do not believe that they have to rebuild a large structure that meets all of their specifications for height and so forth.
Still you know, because those jobs are important, yes, But, so are the jobs that are paid for out of city and state revenues, teachers, health care workers, first responders, and so we believe those jobs are critical too.
We would have to organize everything else, but I do think that it's a good location available to the bulk of the population and if we needed extra seating, the park is there, so it seemed like doing it outside was a safer option than trying to find a large indoor location, but we would want people to register in advance so that we can know that we are spacing people.
I'm sure many of you have heard that shortly after 10 A.M today, the mayor announced for the second time a delayed start for public schools which have been expected to open in just two school days on Monday September 21st.
Oh no, I really want to go to school on Monday teachers running the class Heard about it for the first time from their students according to an email Children who are enrolled in fully remote programs will still begin full day instruction on Monday September, 21.
So I'm doing the bill jointly with you lean new in the legislature and Brad Lander and Keith powers are both pushing the same concept in the city council, so we're hoping that the state will authorize this and then the city can use as a tool to try to address some of the needs of our small business, which I do not think I have to tell anybody.
I think that although Newsday did a great job of exposing this on long island, it really is an issue in most of the United States and throughout, certainly throughout New York state, and you know.
I think you know the courts have actually stepped up here, but it really is time for the policy- making political branches of the of the government to step up the governor, and the legislature really ought to extend this legislatively.
The, larger plan, which many of us have joined, pushing the federal government to fund would involve a hundred billion dollars, nationally, which you know seems like a lot of money, but in a world where they're doing trillions in packages when they get around to acting New York state, we get about 10 billion dollars for perspective.
That is intended really to address the inability of people to pay and all the consequences of that for landlords, not just property taxes, but also mortgages, and you know the costs of operating and maintaining the buildings and paying employees short of that.
So the city is going to have to design a program that is sufficiently specific to ensure that you know people are interested in taking advantage of it.
There's a lot of enthusiasm, we've been having conversations with the fiscal policy institute and economists and the hospitality alliance, which knows a thing or two about how leases work and what's going to be necessary to make this program viable, but that the city, because the city meets City Council meets every other week.
If there's any indication of schools it'll be minute by minute, so restaurants, barricades, NYPD, we , I think we're making some headway in a sense that to the credit of our letter, but then also every time a reporter meets with the mayor.
As, we know, there are barricades and have been in some cases blocking off a street, sometimes which is fine, just the building, sometimes no barricades around NYPD station houses, but it really does mean that there is a disconnect between community and police, at least in some day, because it really adds to the challenges that the police are having I've just been on the zoo for the last two hours with different school districts.
I do not know where the mayor's going to get 2500 teachers in a short time, period, etc- But I wish that we could succeed from the board of on the board of education in the borough of Manhattan, because I think you all would be able to figure out what to do.
You know it was not the New York Times, but based on our selection, there was quite a bit of online press and so on and the day before the announcement that we made they were going to close, but based on our announcement and based on the fact that customers showed up they're, staying open, so little things, matter, congratulations is all in your community, boards.
As you know so many times they do not get paid their full allotment and now what's happened on the state and city level in terms of the human service, they often do not get what they have been promised, so they paid for the PPE for their staff.
It's, an an issue that we learned about actually through the controller's report, some time ago, and we wrote a resolution asking the city to at least look at possible solutions for it.
Then, what's going to happen, thank you during my report, but I'm going to thank you in person now While you are looking for him, if you do not mind, I'm going to read, hello, He may not be with us, He. Just wanted to speak about the next two issues that we're going to speak about the public session, which is the DOT proposal for university place, I'm, not sure, because his email did not actually say his position, but I believe he was questioning the dot's study.
What is currently happening on 13Th Street university place, is, I think, beyond the pale right now during Covid-19, there's limited traffic, and so essentially it's not as acute as it would be, but make no mistake as soon as as soon as traffic resumes to quote unquote normal levels.
Continues, I just want to thank Carter and Bob and the board for their work on this new kind of innovative idea.
On how you know, department of correction has been handling the pandemic through the last I was going to say, perf a couple months, but it's more than that and on Friday she'll be sharing another hearing to follow as a follow- up hearing on hospitals to review the program, contract tracing and receive more updates on that other than that.
I know, there's been a lot of talk on the school reopening, so just want to share that with you that Councilmember Chen had sponsored resolution 1410, which was also led by council member Mark, Traeger who's, the education chair to only open school buildings that meet health and safety standards prescribed and the Uft checklist.
This letter was signed by 25 City council members, which includes the Speaker Corey Johnson and the chair of the Health Committee Levine, and we asked for immediate and consistent guidance on the city's vision and stagings for reopening with detailed information on timeline funding and community Outreach.
So just wanted to acknowledge that and the last thing on Monday September 21st at 10, A.M Council member Chen is going to be holding an oversight hearing on the future of senior centers senior centers after Covid-19, and we encourage you to join and share your thoughts with the city and how the better support senior centers that will be coming up on Monday September 21st at 10, The city council will also be hearing legislation that office introduced, which is Intro 2030, to extend the 50,000 maximum threshold for screen injury until 2022, and those are my announcements.
We know another big challenge has been transportation for students, especially given this year with MTA service cuts, school buses operating at limited capacity and the need for more social distancing.
If there's places where you know, you see a lot on the street contact me, maybe I can help get them over there We would work with them to adjust their schedule so that they're around on the weekends and we've.
Last weekend we held our second cleanup day and we were joined by Jane Charles Grove Bedford, Bounty, Downing, Street, Block Association, and we are continuing to work with the Department of Health in the Parks Department and local restaurants on rat issues in our parks.
Slash question just want to use this opportunity to let everybody know on this call that we are having a joint meeting about museum reopenings on the 24th, including Janet, the Whitney and Jane.
Rebel scooters were suspended in the city, but if you see any issues, if you could let Shirley- And I know they'll- be at traffic and transportation next month- And I do not know if Bob had this in his report, but I noted it in my notes, which we had the I think one of the first movie shoots outdoor movie shoots, which was on Jersey Street, which is a good signal.
My end, I just wanted to remind all CB2 members and as well as members of the public, that CB2 committees will be including discussion of budget requests to be recommended to the New York City agencies during their meetings in October, social services will be doing it at the end of September.
The New, York City budget process allows community boards to recommend 40 capital and 25 expense, budget expense, budget expenditures, and so anyone interested in this discussion is encouraged to attend these meetings and and give us your opinions just to follow up a little bit on carter, who mentioned the adopt- a- basket program, and we've also, I think.
I think I read last week that the mayor had restored some monies to partially restored some of the budget collection of the basket collection, but I have not received an answer yet from sanitation as to how that's going to affect our district, but I did want to add on.
We're, going to be discussing open, streets, restaurant programs this coming month at the reopening working group , there's still some issues with the structures as far as snow plowing other things that you know maybe need some tweaking, but but for the next for October they're, all slated to be running, concurrently.
We currently have 17 streets, so they're designated for open restaurants and a large number of them were just extended to other days of the week.
We've been a couple of us here have been in talks with Council Speaker Johnson's office and just trying to knowing that there are a lot of new.
Unless a board member wants to specifically call out an item for a separate, vote.
Department's overarching goal is that older, adult centers provide a range of high quality, services, programs and resources that attract meet the needs of and enrich the lives of the diverse group of older new Yorkers, and looks forward to providing continued input to the process of developing an innovative request for proposals for new models and is sensitive to the concerns expressed by the leadership at Greenwich.
So I'd like to motion that we move this the social services resolution into the omnibus bill and vote on the block.
And I know some people that that's easier, great thanks, so we're going to move that on there.
It was in response to a proposal by the New York City Department of Transportation D.O.T to reverse university place to runway Southbound from 13th street to 12Th street and you've heard some of the input tonight from the public on their impressions.
I. So by saying so by saying university place could be a shared street from Union Square to West sports you're, saying It's still possible, you're, leaving it up to DOT to go out and study it again and then figure out some solutions, and what we're also inferring is that they should take another look at the way the bus way is being handled now and indeed the right turns that are being required at every intersection, because patterns have changed and there may be some room for a more balanced approach.
We can ask a question which is: do people support a more strongly worded resolution or whereas sorry, thereby by stating that we do not support the current D.O.T proposal?
I just saw that the other week too, it's with the turning lane going south So I mean I, just like to say: I mean first, I wanted to say that so I mean I've been in Europe and there are indeed there are shared streets in which you know certain of the items that share it.
Now the traffic and transportation resolution, which I support, suggests that the DOT study ways to relieve the congestion issue on 12th, but it does not prescribe to them that what they have to do is change that direction on that part of university, which is what I know some member of the public who was saying before was insisting that they wanted to see.
You know think that it's actually work to have it.
I can't raise my hand because I'm still a co, host, but I think truly would be helpful if we kind of describe the traffic flow as it exists, right, now, and that it's actually running north up university The idea is, it's not working.
When we thought about it, neither thing would work, of course, and that the best approach was what we had previously recommended, which was to have the full university place as a shared street and by the way.
This was also in response to a really large consensus of the community asking for that themselves, which we found really amazing and delightful, and just for clarification at the committee meeting that it seemed very clear that the committee at this time did not support what the DOT was presenting, and maybe we should just clarify that, and that was what they were asking and then One of the main focus points of D.O.T at the meeting was that Fifth Avenue was causing the congestion on 13th street, because there was not enough room to pass to take a left turn on fifth and they created more space at the intersection of fifth and thirteenth.
There was a permission to demolition for the remaining portion of the building, with the provision that the ironwork be preserved and retained, and the building we was presented to us did not mention or acknowledge the restrictive declaration, and it is brutalistic with large windows super modern design and the numerous, whereas clauses state many of its shortcomings, as well as those at the end that deal in detail with the restrictive declaration of the It's a denial for the application and that the landmarks determine the status of the restrictive declaration, which is to the same owner that it was at the time of the demolition and that it be if they are preserved and can be located that be incorporated, presumably in the original way, into the new building.
The problem I have with this is the regulations that landmarks have to replace them with wood and painted wood, and they need to be maintained if we start approving an application to allow that you're, then setting up a regulation where anybody who does not want that kind of window has to go through this very expensive hearing process, so either landmarks to change the regulations equal for all You know you approving it because they cost more landlords.
If we start deciding that you can not make these owners go through these extremely expensive of work to replace the windows just because they look a slightly little bit different or because you do not like the way the aluminum looks.
On, and I would like to vote against this resolution, because I believe that the case, the reason being is the expense of the windows and the expense of the maintenance of the windows that have to be painted every few years, because wood has to be maintained and we have to get with the times.
So that's resolutions, one two, three five to seven in the first report and item number one in the second report and now moving on to the Bylaws Committee Susan The bylaws working group met this week to address to address that there were two.
It really is an existing place that has new ownership, and that was a deny unless, with stipulations that are consistent with the former method of operation at the location, unanimous vote, number two is t-: This has a lengthy history, which is reflected in the resolution.
There, You bet, surely your hand up as well: you're, muted, okay, looking at number two again and all the reasons why people voted against it.
There were so many negatives about it and there seemed to be opposition, oh and by the way, Other thing that you had said in the resolution about the SLA itself had turned them down twice these very same reasons, so it is kind of confusing It's why it was approved by the committee.
Surely one is the lawyer that had represented him before did not do a very good job, and basically, the impression was is that he said: oh, do not worry about the community board you're going to get approved, and so he already moved in his business has already moved in And, so he's there, and, to that extent I think that folks felt that as long as he got a letter of no objection, which is part of the stipulations that put into it that and that he he's going to have to put in some sort of soundproofing to his business when he has to move back into the business Like, he would he would get his restaurant line license.
All the resolutions, which would be one through 19, including the resolution number 19, stating that the applicant is going to return to the committee next month and as they agreed not to file with the liquor authority in the interim.
Now we're going to move to the omnibus vote and let me make sure I got this all correct.
Do not think that for 201 sullivan we need to do a separate vote, but somebody could mention that if they wanted to that's a So , it's item number three in landmarks, and the first report is what we will have a second vote: on.
At the same time, the Bylaws Committee report for items number one and two, those will be part of the main omnibus vote.
All of the resolutions that were presented tonight will be part of the omnibus vote, except we will have a separate vote on item number three in the Landmarks committee, which was for 85 Christopher Street, and that was with respect to the windows and for item number.
The second, is the landmarks item number three at 85, Christopher Street and the third vote is for Haisa the restaurant at 142, Sullivan Street.
So people want to vote separately on that.
So people want to vote separately on that.
Rocio sans, I'm, going to vote no on landmarks, number, three; no on traffic Yes, on landmarks, no on SLA, yes for omnibus And you're, calling out I'm voting against the resolution on landmarks.
