We start stephen, that we ask you to keep it to two minutes, and this is just testimony from the public There's not going to be any opining or back and forth unless a community board member has a question for you.
So much for the presentation, very valuable for our community to hear our second speaker, is: nathaniel, weiss, who's going to be speaking about 72, west 11th street renovation.
There's, a jewish cemetery that actually predates 11th street There's, a little fragment of it left on the south side towards sixth avenue, and it's a treasure We're going before landmarks next week with a proposal to fix the wall and refurbish And we're just hoping that you'll pass a resolution of support.
Voting and I want to remind people that if you get an absentee ballot and you're concerned about the mail, you can return it at a polling site either during early voting or on election day.
I think that week will not be as busy as election day It's a great opportunity to actually cast your ballot in person.
It is important for people to get out to vote as well as obviously the president, and this is a crucial year, but the census early voting I have a hearing coming up on tuesday on the impact of Covid-19 on financial aid for students.
We are asking that the opportunity programs which support educationally and economically disadvantaged young people, that they not be cut any more than 10 percent same, is true for funding for our public colleges and universities.
Social distancing, but wearing masks is very effective and I did not feel at risk, so things are coming back a little bit at a time, and, of course, the issues that people are concerned about with more homelessness.
We have a couple questions for you, but I do want to let everyone know that valerie posted some very important links on the chat if you'd like to see links to the census, as well as the absentee ballot.
They have had 22 years and other municipal uses have in fact been removed from the park, and there have been both with elected officials, community board representatives, At least two, if not three meetings with the police department DOT the mayor's office, with a myriad of suggestions of how to I personally in the 21st century, do not believe that they have to rebuild a large structure that meets all of their specifications for height and so forth.
Yes, but so are the jobs that are paid for out of city and state revenues, teachers, health care workers, first responders, and so we believe those jobs are critical too, and we also understand that the country is not going to have an economic recovery without the economy of new york, illinois, California, texas.
Today, the mayor, announced for the second time a delayed start for public schools which have been expected to open in just two school days.
So I'm doing the bill jointly with you lean new in the legislature and brad lander and keith Powers are both pushing the same concept in the city council, so we're hoping that the state will authorize this and then the city can use as a tool to try to address some of the needs of our small business, which I don't think.
We actually went to state supreme court in albany to enforce those subpoenas with some panelists who had told us they were coming and then declined as of last night, we've now rescheduled in some negotiations with a judge and the lawyers for these brokers, we've rescheduled, the sort of second part of this hearing for next friday and they've now agreed to participate, but we're taking this very seriously, and you know everybody understands.
The, larger plan, which many of us have joined, pushing the federal government to fund would involve a hundred billion dollars, nationally, which you know seems like a lot of money, but in a world where they're doing trillions in packages when they get around to acting new york.
Those are all that we probably should you know we should stay in touch with you as we design this I mean the idea is to create a state statute that is sufficiently directive so that it creates parameters to the program, but that the details of that would be worked out at the city level, and so again we have a bill.
So the city is gonna, have to design a program that is sufficiently specific to ensure that you know people are interested in taking advantage of it.
There's a lot of enthusiasm, we've been having conversations with the fiscal policy institute and economists and the hospitality alliance, which knows a thing or two about how leases work and what's going to be necessary to make this program viable, but that the city, because the city meets city council meets every other week more or less.
Do you kind of envisioning those things working, together, assuming they're, I, think that brad's bill is more intended to deal with kind of a the emergency now like give it give some relief So in our bill in order to participate, the landlord and the property, the sort of property owner and the business owner would have to do a lease that addresses any outstanding arrears.
I've been skeptical of that approach in the residential setting, Thank you great, and if anybody wants to take a look at the chat, there's a link to senator cavanaugh's young people's civic engagement, there- Girls, I'm ready, but first of all, kavanaugh knows more than I.
I, don't know what's gonna happen, if there's any indication of schools it'll be minute by minute, so restaurants, barricades, NYPD, we, I think we're making some headway in a sense that to the credit of our letter, but then also every time a reporter meets with the mayor.
As, we know, there are barricades and have been in some cases blocking off a street, sometimes which is fine, just the building, sometimes no barricades around NYPD station houses, but it really does mean that there is a disconnect between community and police, at least in some day, because it really adds to the challenges that the police are having I've just been on the zoo for the last two hours with different school districts.
Teachers, I don't know where the mayor's going to get 2500 teachers in a short time, period, etc, and there are a lot of parents on this discussion and you know better than I do all the challenges, but I wish that we could succeed from the board of on the board of education in the borough of Manhattan, because I think you all would be able to figure out what to do.
You know it wasn't the new york times, but based on our selection, there was quite a bit of online press and so on and the day before the announcement that we made they were going to close, but based on our announcement and based on the fact that customers showed up they're, staying open, so little things, matter.
As you know so many times they don't get paid their full allotment and now what's happened on the state and city level in terms of the human service, they often don't get what they have been promised, so they paid for the PPE for their staff.
It's, an an issue that we learned about actually through the controller's report, some time ago, and we wrote a resolution asking the city to at least look at possible solutions for it.
Thank you during my report, but I'm going to thank you in person now While you are looking for him, if you don't mind, I'm going to read, hello, He may not be with us, He. Just wanted to speak about the next two issues that we're going to speak about the public session, which is the DOT proposal for university place, I'm, not sure, because his email didn't actually say his position, but I believe he was questioning the dot's study.
Continues, I just want to thank carter and bob and the board for their work on this new kind of innovative idea.
So we want to give D.O.T the power to be able to use the cameras for that purpose, and then a second One piece that we are getting a lot of questions about is how it will apply when people see that it'll apply to a condo or co-op that is assessed at 300.
Thank you, great thanks jacob and let's see next, I've got I'm just going down the line in the order that everybody raised their hand, iraq from city council, member colleen, rivera's, office.
I know, there's been a lot of talk on the school reopening, so just want to share that with you that councilmember chen had sponsored resolution 1410, which was also led by council member mark traeger who's, the education chair to only open school buildings that meet health and safety standards prescribed and the uft checklist.
This letter was signed by 25 city council members, which includes the speaker, corey johnson and the chair of the health committee levine, and we asked for immediate and consistent guidance on the city's vision and stagings for reopening with detailed information on timeline funding and community.
So just wanted to acknowledge that and the last thing on monday, September 21st at 10 a.m. Council, member chen is going to be holding an oversight hearing on the future of senior centers senior centers after Covid-19, and we encourage you to join and share your thoughts with the city and how the better support senior centers that will be coming up on monday, September 21st at 10 a.m. The city council will also be hearing legislation that office introduced, which is intro 2030, to extend the 50 000 maximum threshold for screen injury until 2022, and those are my announcements.
We know another big challenge has been transportation for students, especially given this year with mta service cuts, school buses operating at limited capacity and the need for more social distancing.
If there's places where you know, you see a lot on the street contact me, maybe I can help get them over there We would work with them to adjust their schedule so that they're around on the weekends and we've.
Last weekend we held our second cleanup day and we were joined by jane charles grove, bedford, bounty, downing street block association, and we are continuing to work with the department of health in the parks, department and local restaurants on rat issues in our parks.
The first thing on my list was thanking thanking the borough president for offering a new training module, which is for an unbiased training which we had been asking for a number of months, so that should be available When When, we have more information, number two is you've heard from a number of people: sanitation department, the cuts really starting to have an impact in our community, especially with trash blowing around as their service cuts on the garbage cans on the corner.
Rebel scooters were suspended in the city, but if you see any issues, if you could let shirley- And I know they'll- be at traffic and transportation next, If bob had this in his report, but I noted it in my notes, which we had the I think one of the first movie shoots outdoor movie shoots, which was on jersey, street, which is a good signal , at least that there's starting to be a little bit of activity in the community, board.
My end, I just wanted to remind all cb2 members and as well as members of the public, that cb2 committees will be including discussion of budget requests to be recommended to the new york city agencies during their meetings in October, social services will be doing it at the end of September.
New york city budget process allows community boards to recommend 40 capital and 25 expense, budget expense, budget expenditures, and so anyone interested in this discussion is encouraged to attend these meetings and and give us your opinions just to follow up a little bit on carter, who mentioned the adopt-a-basket program.
It's a result of the sanitation department's budget was cut, all city agency budgets were cut and they I think I read last week that the mayor had restored some monies to partially restored some of the budget collection of the basket collection, but I haven't received an answer yet from sanitation as to how that's gonna affect our district, but I did want to add on.
We're, going to be discussing open, streets, restaurant programs this coming month at the reopening working group , there's still some issues with the structures as far as snow plowing other things that you know maybe need some tweaking, but but for the next for October they're, all slated to be running.
We currently have 17 streets, so they're designated for open restaurants and a large number of them were just extended to other days of the week.
There aren't heat lamps, as I just explained, in what most people are familiar with the outdoor dining state, the status from my understanding under the D.O.T program, which is what all outdoor dining is under now, I believe, ends on halloween so And You've got to have a registered architect, providing the plans, but I just wanted to since the open.
We've been a couple of us here have been in talks with council, speaker, johnson's office and just trying to knowing that there are a lot of new.
Unless a board member wants to specifically call out an item for a separate, vote.
Department's overarching goal is that older, adult centers provide a range of high quality, services, programs and resources that attract meet the needs of and enrich the lives of the diverse group of older new yorkers, and looks forward to providing continued input to the process of developing an innovative request for proposals for new models and is sensitive to the concerns expressed by the leadership at greenwich house.
So I'd like to motion that we move this the social services resolution into the omnibus bill and vote on the block when we get to the end of the meeting.
It was in response to a proposal by the new york city department of transportation, D.O.T to reverse university place to runway southbound from 13th street to 12th street and you've heard some of the input tonight from the public on their impressions.
I. So by saying so by saying university place could be a shared street from union square to west sports you're, saying It's still possible, you're, leaving it up to DOT to go out and study it again and then figure out some solutions, and what we're also inferring is that they should take another look at the way the bus way is being handled now and indeed the right turns that are being required at every intersection, because patterns have changed and there may be some room for a more balanced approach.
I just saw that the other week too, it's with the turning lane going south So I mean I, just like to say: I mean first, I wanted to say that so I mean I've been in europe, and there are indeed I understand if it's a little bit outside of people's imagining right now, because we haven't had it here, but a couple of years: ago.
Now the traffic and transportation resolution, which I support, suggests that the DOT study ways to relieve the congestion issue on 12th, but it does not prescribe to them that what they have to do is change that direction on that part of university, which is what I know some member of the public who was saying before was insisting that they wanted to see.
They suggested this alternative which, from everything the community said, was just as cuckoo and Neither thing would work, of course, and that the best approach was what we had previously recommended, which was to have the full university place as a shared street and by the way.
This was also in response to a really large consensus of the community asking for that themselves, which we found really amazing and delightful, and just for clarification at the committee meeting that it seemed very clear that the committee at this time did not support what the DOT was presenting, and maybe we should just clarify that, and that was what they were asking and then One of the main focus points of D.O.T at the meeting was that fifth avenue was causing the congestion on 13th street, because there wasn't enough room to pass to take a left turn on fifth and they created more space at the intersection of fifth and thirteenth.
And I think I do mention that in the resolution too- If one wanted to pass on the 13th street west and It gave a little more leeway, I guess at the same time, giving a safer term of the fifth avenue by putting in that narrow, wedge.
Didn't mention or acknowledge the restrictive declaration, and it is brutalistic with large windows super modern design and the numerous, whereas clauses state many of its shortcomings, as well as those at the end that deal in detail with the restrictive declaration of the It's a denial for the application and that the landmarks determine the status of the restrictive declaration, which is to the same owner that it was at the time of the demolition and that it be if they are preserved and can be located that be incorporated, presumably in the original way, into the new building.
The problem I have with this is the regulations that landmarks have to replace them with wood and painted wood, and they need to be maintained if we start approving an application to allow that you're, then setting up a regulation where anybody who doesn't want that kind of window has to go through this very expensive hearing, process, so either landmarks to change the regulations equal for all You know you approving it because they cost more landlords.
If we start deciding that you cannot make these owners go through these extremely expensive of work to replace the windows just because they look a slightly little bit different or because you don't like the way.
On, and I would like to vote against this resolution, because I believe that the case, the reason being is the expense of the windows and the expense of the maintenance of the windows that have to be painted every few years, because wood has to be maintained and we have to get with the times.
That suggests to the landmarks commission that they may want to look at this just going forward to raise the issue about it.
So that's resolutions, one two, three five to seven in the first report and item number one in the second report and now moving on to the bylaws committee, susan kept okay.
It really is an existing place that has new ownership, and that was a deny unless, with stipulations that are consistent with the former method of operation at the location, unanimous vote, number two is t-k-o-k-a-o, which is dba, hazia, 142 sullivan street.
There, You bet, surely your hand up as well: you're, muted, okay, looking at number two again and all the reasons why people voted against it.
All the resolutions, which would be one through 19, including the resolution number 19, stating that the applicant is going to return to the committee next month and as they agreed not to file with the liquor authority in the interim.
All, right, great, so I don't see any objection to moving those items into the omnibus vote, so we're moving all those, and also the announcement now with the with the new process.
Don't think that for 201 sullivan we need to do a separate vote, but somebody could mention that if they wanted to that's a So , it's item number three in landmarks, and the first report is what we will have a second vote.
At the same time, the bylaws committee report for items number one and two, those will be part of the main omnibus vote.
Second, is the landmarks item number three at 85, christopher street, and the third vote is for haisa the restaurant at 142 sullivan, street.
Yes, it's on sla, so sullivan street and sla are the same thing: So 85, christopher's landmarks, no one at no one's, Yes on omnibus, no on landmarks, number, three, I, think and no on sla number two., rocio, sans, I'm, going to vote no on landmarks, number, three,; no on traffic So, yes on landmarks,; no on sla, yes for omnibus And you're, calling out I'm voting against the resolution on landmarks.
I just want to make sure that bylaws on monday and social services on tuesday- This is on tuesdays, going to be discussing getting updates on the homeless issues in board.
