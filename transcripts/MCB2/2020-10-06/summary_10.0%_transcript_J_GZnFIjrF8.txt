Everyone welcome to the quality of Life committee meeting of Community Board 2.
They were on our agenda for last month for the MOCA workshop and window Exhibits Museum of Chinese in America on Howard Street, between Center Street and Lafayette Street, and it's for a sidewalk and curb lane closure for both sides.
The events already happening, and I think we have Nancy Yao Mazbach from Mocha who's here to talk about the application, I'll open that in a another window, are you there nancy?
You know it's a new email address for people to receive, so We've the museum of Chinese America has suffered sort of a number of looming and active crises, and We did have this fire on January 23, at our collection space, where 85,000 items were in jeopardy.
I wanted to share, especially with cp2, is just today: We've taken additional space at 3, Howard street, where yeah we've opened up 4,000 square feet of temp space, and we have it really nicely done with a young architect who has helped us to outfit that space and as I was you know, preparing for this meeting.
We're naming the space the workshop It's meant to be a window into conservation, also to help really Yeah build the character of the work that we do, but also for people who pass passerbys pedestrians to be able to look in, and it's a welcome public space.
So there'll be active public computers that people can use, as well as housing and conserving the space The main floor, and the second floor is the space that we've taken to help just repair that and the repair to just let the CBT know is a six year.
This is a free non charged event, but the windows are getting installed right, now, both on center street, which is a main opening to the museum.
But, we did want to have sort of like a formal launch of it on Friday Saturday Sunday, with stanchions keeping close to the frontage, so that I know is possible and permissible by DOT and then also having them start at 215 center go down the plot to Grand Street, make a left onto grand Street then make a left onto lafayette and see the exhibits on lafayette and then make a left onto Howard Street.
The request to close Howard street is part of a broader initiative for us to bring people back to the community to take a look at these exhibits and then also with the MOCA Workshop opening at three howard for them to reconnect with the fire, because I think a lot of people in our broader community had a lot of emotion around the fire.
Those will also be socially distanced in 15 to 20 segments of no more than four people and one unit visiting the space to see that we were able to bring back the items and then they would hopefully then also to try to help develop the patronage of Tiger restaurant that just opened at one Howard.
People feel comfortable, but at no time are we expecting more than 20 people at any place, because we know that we can't manage it, but we'll be giving out face masks if they do not have one We have a sanitizer also when people slide in, but we will be reserving slots online prior to those days So it's a street closure, then for howard.
You know, delayed and they'll be staff, I guess throughout just kind of moving keeping the queue moving or keeping people moving absolutely, and we have a really good team of people who are very versed in that And when there'll be markers and way, finders on the street, there'll be people at the corners directing them and making sure there's no bottleneck to We're just really sensitive to the businesses that are trying to get back to life.
You know to come to us and so to expose the Community Ball Committee Board CB2, to have you know: And you'll benefit from your cultural and museum.
I know it's a small street in Arrow Street, but the path that people will be taking is viewing the windows on lafayette and then coming around to the temporary space on the narrow, street.
Basically, like ongoing funding things that we've requested each year, If there's any new requests- and the one that I pointed out here at the bottom is because the composting has been because of budget cuts suspended at this time.
I mean, that's a budget cut I think, they've been better about it in the last few weeks, but that you know people might have noticed that garbage cans are just overflowing because there's many more pedestrians outside and less department of sanitation workers, emptying them.
Joe people do not even know how to or want to even recycle properly So. But, unfortunately, I think the department of sanitation has been sad.
That might be coming that we want to make sure you know that they're important to us.
I guess we just pass a resolution and then the full board will vote and we can let SAPO know that you know our meeting is until their event is already happening.
So if they you know they come to have this excellent exhibit, I think, expecting a lot of people will come to celebrate their recovery.
