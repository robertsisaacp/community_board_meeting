I'm going to try my best to manage this I've got a lot of people who allow them to speak and members to stay on at the end, for an executive session where we have a personnel matter to discuss with that turn over to dollar a dollar.
My building at the subcommittee meeting last week, the applicant agreed to put in a swing door, but the space is too now and it worked for two years- loud music, which applicant uses to attract business is not as gone long past midnight and made life at my building.
Let me just say to everyone in the board that I and my entire staff upstate downstate, wish everybody to stay safe, and you know this is unprecedented and in Albany we passed a couple of bills and we did so by having a very limited number of people in the chamber to debate.
You know the governor's been clear that this the city is not walking down, but we are all asked to stay home unless we're doing something like walking a dog or going out for a jog or doing shopping.
We have a pretty robust set of guidance for city, state and federal resources, and we are happy to try to help make sure that people are getting connected in the right.
Also need spy working for support for renters, in addition to those with their mortgages, people with student loans trying to backfill funding for mass transit on Tuesday.
That's, four million folks in CB2 that are stranded abroad because of commercial flight cancellations, and we are saying we want to make sure that we are providing funding for the State Department to be able to repatriate those standard.
It is absolutely harmful and unacceptable, and the assembly armor calls for the community to continue to stand together and remain educator, ANCOVA 19 and keep an eye out for all the misinformation that is circulating These days to see what comes up on Twitter and gets flat out very quickly in terms of our work, we have done two letters to Governor Cuomo, one Was for at- home testing kits for equipment.
So far, and we will continue to work along with the community as we go into very new uncertainty, I would say, and by only for my office, we're pushing everyone I'm, giving your family the bus and please have a good night Thank you and that you and your families and your neighbors are all staying safe and healthy and practicing your best social distancing.
During this time, I want to speak for a moment what we're doing to make sure the city's economy is protected and their workers to small businesses, who are the most vulnerable right now, are protected during this time.
This time, we've also called our number of proposals to be enacted at the city and state level or at the company level to make sure that small businesses and families and workers are able to survive this downturn.
We know that many of them are struggling or forced to close making sure that when their workers are protected-- and that also goes for the arts and creative communities and the independent gave workers who right now might not have their normal income stream during this time.
We also, lastly, want to thank all of our state and federal partners who are working so hard and advocating for new Yorkers and our office is once again open on the clock.
I had introduced a bill a week ago that will allow this kind of teleconferencing under the New York State Open Meetings, laws.
And I know that the president mentioned its signing up for text alerts at six nine, two, six, nine, two or calling the New York State Cobin 19 hotline, which is available on my website for more information.
So I really appreciate that yesterday that the Legislature passed comprehensive, paid sick leave for those subject to a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine and As, the economic impact of the virus becomes more evident to us, I'm calling on all levels of governments is for a restaurant rescue, plan, a small business bailout and a wage worker and gig workers support fund so that we can save as many jobs as possible.
If, you know of someone who has medical, experience, they're, looking to bring those folks out of retirement because we're going to probably need them in the next weeks and months ahead, but This is showing me really truly how strong our community is.
So I wanted to thank all of my colleagues and government and the Community board for all the work you've done.
You're right, New Yorkers have very specific questions that we do not get to read about in the National crust like what's up with the park bench, you know, and that was Two things with respect to health care number one is: Are there plans to loosen the requirements, the HIPAA requirements for Medicaid recipients in order to allow broader appointments through telephone and video conferences, issue will follow up and see what the state is recommending to the feds.
Thank you very much thanks Eric, and thank you guys for all your work and the trees to who I spoke with the earlier today is also on with us, and also Eliana, feeling, okay, and getting some fresh air with social distancing still in mind, with the focus on senior centers naturally occurring with retirement, communities, youth organizations, nonprofit small businesses, Like everyone, has been saying, I heard from a lot of folks in the community and we're doing our best to make sure we're listening to what folks are saying, and one thing that I think someone brought up that we're.
So any of those government regulations that can be moved in to help that would always would be very hopeful, but times like this, where people really want telemedicine.
Thank you to community board too, and all the members for you know getting us the opportunity to speak to you guys, tonight.
We've been working on staffing contingency plans so that if our healthcare workers do get sick, we were able to pull resources from our vast system to make sure that we're operating at 100% capacity so to the sort of clinical front symptoms.
Yes could be signs that there may be a more serious infection going on Not everybody that comes into the emergency department at this point were able to test and sort of echoing what Alex had said as our system, Not only core lab we're, also partnering, with LabCorp and Quest, and some other private labs, as our capabilities to test expand, we'll be able to test more and more people.
So the sick people are going to get tested for sure and trying to discern whose labs get processed first.
That's here on the east side, So we're trying to find the right balance in terms of keeping the right people in the hospital and making sure that the folks who are sick have other mechanisms to get tested.
That would be the you know: take- home advice, I have for them, and the folks on the call tonight is that everyone should sort of have a contingency plan and do a little bit of research on their own so that if they do feel sick and potentially not sick enough to go to the hospital that they at least have alternative mechanisms to get tested.
I do not know that the tests would be separate there and as far as the drive- throughs are concerned, quite honestly, not sure how that's working a couple of days, ago.
We do have it we're trying to control it so that we do not run out, but I will tell you one thing: Yesterday, specifically many community members came to the hospital to deliver pizza for the staff Coffee cookies, and there was one individual woman that was outside She said no I do not want a mask.
I've also got a really good question from one of our board members and people who do not have a primary care doctor.
It may be something different for everybody listening to the call, but certainly if you do not have access to a health care, provider, you're feeling ill, you could certainly come to the ER to get evaluated and that's what a lot of people have been doing and will continue to do.
You know what is safe, what precautions should older people take they're going shopping at the grocery stores?
Should they be doing if I'm sitting in the King Board conference room right now , I'm acrosss, the street from Morton Williams When I came in I saw a couple of people older people going in What should people be doing it I know a lot of the delivery services on thing things up to apartment, so they're leaving in doorman.
So again, it's challenging space is limited here in New, You know whatever resources you have available and really keep the space issue, we're using ten feet as a number that we're sort of telling folks in the hospital is a safe, distance.
How do you clean your building hallways It's constantly updated along with York State Department of Health website and CDC, as we kind of move forward tonight, I'm, trying to keep the committee reports, succinct, Wanted to thank Bob, Josh Florence and even in our office.
As we go forward, we are going to have a weekly executive community meeting, virtually unzoom to just sort of discuss where we are each week.
We have two items from in our community board before them next week and I believe that people are requesting that those be adjourned until April, 15th, just People understand that some businesses is moving forward in different agencies in different ways, and we have we play a role in that process and to not have committee meetings.
Cb2 Manhattan also strongly supports the strategy that most specific criteria will then be identified by CB twos arts committee or equivalent to be applied by the appointed arts advisory panel during the application process for these spaces.
The applicant stated that they're working diligently to get up to code with all relevant city rules and regulations and cleared up all violations from the last two years, including getting a landmark permit for the existing mural, which is adjacent to the unenclosed sidewalk cafes,, Some lights or some other things like Mike said there may have been an objection on the Sun Street there I'm, not sure the suggestion have it without this being like certification, that the landmarks have been corrected.
Think we're going to take a few weeks break for committee, meetings.
You know we reacts to applicants and if people are going to be making applications, we do not want to give up her voice and provide those.
Members, directly, and You know I'm going to send out another one in the next few days and ask people if it would be okay.
So if people wanted to be involved in an open, discussion, I think that would be a good format and also with our weekly executive committee meetings that were going to be doing You know we're going to figure out ways that we can better keep the community informed of specific issues that are happening from south of 14th Street, north of canal, west of Bowery and 4Th Avenue, and to the river.
We as a community board, are here and are serving our purpose, and you know It's wonderful and sort of the new way of life.
Is that we're going to have a lot of people who are sick in our community and around us?
And I know that Brad's office has been sending out updates and as well as our other elected officials, so signing up for their emails as well is a good way to keep on top of things.
12 hours we've got new information and staying it up in front of that is really important, and it's a big part of why I keep pushing the links for the Department of Health for the city for the state and CDC they update.
Please send the ideas you know to me in to my colleagues and elective offices, before we're going to move into executive session to discuss a personnel matter, so there any other.
