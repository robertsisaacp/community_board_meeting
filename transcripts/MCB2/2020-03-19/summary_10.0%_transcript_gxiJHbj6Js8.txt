Declare in this day, I'm going to try my best to manage this I've got a lot of people who allow them to speak and members to stay on at the end, for an executive session where we have a personnel matter to discuss with that turn over to dollar a dollar.
Let me just say to everyone in the board that I and my entire staff upstate downstate, wish everybody to stay safe, and you know this is unprecedented and in Albany we passed a couple of bills and we did so by having a very limited number of people in the chamber to debate.
You know the governor's been clear that this the city is not walking down, but we are all asked to stay home unless we're doing something like walking a dog or going out for a jog or doing shopping.
The whole point is to try to stop the spread, and you do that best by staying inside, to the extent that you can, you know special emergency services working for the Transit Authority.
All of those are viewed as essential jobs and so we're all working from home and school children are at home So I don't want people to be panicked.
We have a pretty robust set of guidance for city, state and federal resources, and we are happy to try to help make sure that people are getting connected in the right.
Under this, with asking folks to shadow their doors nonprofits to theaters, to stay dark, small businesses for The Small, Business Administration allowed authorized New York State's application for an atomic disaster which allows for emergency loans to be made.
We also need spy working for support for renters, in addition to those with their mortgages, people with student loans trying to backfill funding for mass transit on Tuesday.
That's, four million folks in cb2 that are stranded abroad because of commercial flight cancellations, and we are saying we want to make sure that we are providing funding for the State Department to be able to repatriate those standard.
It, is absolutely harmful and unacceptable, and the assembly armor calls for the community to continue to stand together and remain educator, ANCOVA 19 and keep an eye out for all the misinformation that is circulating And It's kind of wild these days to see what comes up on Twitter and gets flat out very quickly in terms of our work, we have done two letters to Governor Cuomo, one Was for at-home testing kits for equipment.
The residents have told us that they have not seen much of an increase in terms of the cleaning, especially in high-traffic areas, so that was one of our letter calling for them to really be fully aware of the areas that need constant cleaning where people are touching a lot or just brushing past all that, and that is as far as what we've done so far, and we will continue to work along with the community as we go into very new uncertainty.
This time, I want to speak for a moment what we're doing to make sure the city's economy is protected and their workers to small businesses, who are the most vulnerable right now are protected during this time.
This time, we've also called our number of proposals to be enacted at the city and state level or at the company level to make sure that small businesses and families and workers are able to survive this downturn.
We know that many of them are struggling or forced to close making sure that when their workers are protected-- and that also goes for the arts and creative communities and the independent gave workers who right now might not have their normal income stream during this time.
We also, lastly, want to thank all of our state and federal partners who are working so hard and advocating for new yorkers and our office is once again open on the clock.
So I really appreciate that yesterday that the Legislature passed comprehensive, paid sick leave for those subject to a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine and As, the economic impact of the virus becomes more evident to us, I'm calling on all levels of governments is for a restaurant rescue, plan, a small business bailout and a wage worker and gig workers support fund so that we can save as many jobs as possible.
If, you know of someone who has medical, experience, they're, looking to bring those folks out of retirement, because we're gonna probably need them in the next weeks and months ahead.
So I wanted to thank all of my colleagues and government and the community board for all the work you've done.
Oh hi, there, two things with respect to health care number one is: Are there plans to loosen the requirements, the HIPAA requirements for Medicaid recipients in order to allow broader appointments through telephone and video conferences, issue will follow up and see what the state is recommending to the feds.
Communities, youth organizations, nonprofit small businesses, Like everyone, has been saying, I heard from a lot of folks in the community and we're doing our best to make sure we're listening to what folks are saying, and one thing that I think someone brought up that we're looking into right now.
So any of those government regulations that can be moved in to help that would always would be very hopeful, but times like this, where people really want telemedicine.
We have been going through surge plans for all of North well over the 23 hospitals and hundreds and hundreds of amatory practices and We're looking for open at site locations, even in Greenwich Village we're looking at certain spaces that may be used for overflow, Thank you to community board too, and all the members for you know getting us the opportunity to speak to you guys, tonight.
Yes, could be signs that there may be a more serious infection going on Everybody that comes into the emergency department at this point were able to test and sort of echoing what Alex had said as our system, not only core lab we're, also partnering with LabCorp and quest, and some other private labs, as our capabilities to test expand, we'll be able to test more and more people.
So the sick people are going to get tested for sure and trying to discern whose labs get processed first.
So we're trying to find the right balance in terms of keeping the right people in the hospital and making sure that the folks who are sick have other mechanisms to get tested.
That would be the you know, take-home advice, I have for them, and the folks on the call tonight is that everyone should sort of have a contingency plan and do a little bit of research on their own so that if they do feel sick and potentially not sick enough to go to the hospital that they at least have alternative mechanisms to get tested.
I, don't know that the tests would be separate there and, as far as the drive-throughs are concerned, quite honestly, not sure how that's working a couple of days.
We do have it we're trying to control it so that we don't run out, but I will tell you one thing: Yesterday, specifically many community members came to the hospital to deliver pizza for the staff Coffee cookies, and there was one individual woman that was outside She said no I, don't want a mask.
I've also got a really good question from one of our board members and people who do not have a primary care doctor.
It may be something different for everybody listening to the call, but certainly if you don't have access to a health care, provider, you're feeling ill, you could certainly come to the ER to get evaluated and that's what a lot of people have been doing and will continue to do.
So again, it's challenging space is limited here in New, You know whatever resources you have available and really keep the space issue, we're using ten feet as a number that we're sort of telling folks in the hospital is a safe, distance.
How do you clean your building, hallways, I'm, trying to keep the committee reports, succinct, Wanted to thank Bob, Josh Florence and even in our office.
They can email the office we're going to be taking a break As far as any committee meetings as we go forward, we are going to have a weekly executive community meeting, virtually unzoom to just sort of discuss where we are each week.
We have two items from in our community board before them next week And I believe that people are requesting that those be adjourned until April 15th People understand that some businesses is moving forward in different agencies in different ways, and we have we play a role in that process and to not have committee meetings.
Cb2 Manhattan also strongly supports the strategy that most specific criteria will then be identified by CB twos arts committee or equivalent to be applied by the appointed arts advisory panel during the application process for these spaces.
The applicant stated that they're working diligently to get up to code with all relevant city rules and regulations and cleared up all violations from the last two years, including getting a landmark permit for the existing mural, which is adjacent to the unenclosed sidewalk cafes , some lights or some other things like Mike said there may have been an objection on the Sun Street there I'm, not sure the suggestion have it without this being like certification, that the landmarks have been corrected.
Less of an of a need, I think at this point for us to schedule at this point any committee meetings something certainly we'll consider as things come, up.
You know we reacts to applicants and if people are going to be making applications, we don't want to give up her voice and provide those.
I had a discussion that evening before the meeting of the late afternoon, with respect to the agenda items on our land, You know, I'm gonna send out another one in the next few days and ask people if it would be okay.
So if people wanted to be involved in an open, discussion, I think that would be a good format and also with our weekly executive committee meetings that were going to be doing You know we're gonna figure out ways that we can better keep the community informed of specific issues that are happening from south of 14th Street, north of canal, west of Bowery and 4th Avenue, and to the river.
We as a community board, are here and are serving our purpose, and you know It's wonderful and sort of the new way of life.
That the best way to get through this crisis is that to make sure that no one feels isolated reality is that we're gonna have a lot of people who are sick in our community and around us.
We've got new information and staying it up in front of that is really important, and it's a big part of why I keep pushing the links for the Department of Health for the city for the state and CDC they update.
