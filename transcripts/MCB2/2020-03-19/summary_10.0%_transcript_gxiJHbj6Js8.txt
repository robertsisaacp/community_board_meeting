Meeting, obviously we're under some interesting circumstances right now, and our meeting tonight is to essentially complete our precoded 19 business and move forward into the world declare in this day , I'm going to try my best to manage this I've got a lot of people who allow them to speak and members to stay on at the end, for an executive session where we have a personnel matter to discuss with that turn over to dollar a dollar and I'm gonna may have to wait a second for people to unmute themselves as we go through the attendance okay, Katie bar Space is not conducive to a sidewalk Cafe, which reflects people's chatter across the streets.
If you wanted to debate, and then in small groups we arrived to vote when the We legislation to assist them with either paid or unpaid leave, but guaranteeing their job We will have detailed information on that going out tomorrow and the good news today for folks who will be there lost a job or laid off or have had their hours shortened and have a mortgage The governor has gotten a 90 day.
You know the governor's been clear that this the city is not walking down, but we are all asked to stay home unless we're doing something like walking a dog or going out for a jog or doing shopping The whole point is to try to stop the spread, and you do that best by staying inside, to the extent that you can, you know special emergency services working for the Transit Authority All of those are viewed as essential jobs and so we're all working from home and school children are at home and so I don't want people to be panicked.
A couple of things that we are actively working on is to make sure that we're providing support for contract, freelance gig workers, A seeking payment of about two thousand dollars a month for every American for the next as we are while we are in the health places as a direct payment to people, We also want to make sure that we have credit support for small businesses and nonprofits, both of which are deeply strained under this, with asking folks to shadow their doors nonprofits to theaters to stay dark.
The issue that the mayor said is that there outdoors, on the other hand, they are close to each other, so the whole construction issue comes up often so, from our perspective , it's the seniors we're trying to get that early morning time when they can shop, It's, the construction question and, of course, massive amounts of questions about small business which I'm sure you're getting, and congratulations on your technology Thank you very much and let's see president's office, okay.
Last week the SMU attended one of our final press conferences to discuss some of our concern chunk of the nineteen in my community It is absolutely harmful and unacceptable, and the assembly armor calls for the community to continue to stand together and remain educator, ANCOVA 19 and keep an eye out for all the misinformation that is circulating and it's kind of wild these days to see what comes up on Twitter and gets flat out very quickly in terms of our work, we have done two letters to Governor Cuomo one was for at-home testing kits for equipment.
The residents have told us that they have not seen much of an increase in terms of the cleaning, especially in high-traffic areas, so that was one of our letter calling for them to really be fully aware of the areas that need constant cleaning where people are touching a lot or just brushing past all that, and that is as far as what we've done so far, and we will continue to work along with the community as we go into very new uncertainty.
We know that many of them are struggling or forced to close making sure that when their workers are protected-- and that also goes for the arts and creative communities and the independent gave workers who right now might not have their normal income stream during this time We also, lastly, want to thank all of our state and federal partners who are working so hard and advocating for new yorkers, and our office is once again open on the clock: people's backgrounds that he's got this ocean in the background We want to make sure that community boards are not You know caught in the void here.
The governor's office is seeking those individuals and you can go to the governor's web page, which you can find on my web page You know of someone who has medical experience, they're looking to bring those folks out of retirement, because we're gonna probably need them in the next weeks and months ahead, but this is showing me really truly how strong our community is.
Youth organizations nonprofit small businesses, like everyone, has been saying, I heard from a lot of folks in the community and we're doing our best to make sure we're listening to what folks are saying, and one thing that I think someone brought up that we're looking into right now, Please feel free, I'm, just gonna broadcast my personal cell phone number If anyone needs to connect with our office, we're using our regular line as well.
We use it within the hospital system for telepsychiatry telestroke till I see you even tell a hospitalist now, and it is beginning to move in to the private sector That would always would be very hopeful, but times like this, where people really want telemedicine, they don't want to go out of their homes and go to the doctor's office It's becoming more and more important and then I'm gonna hand it off to dr levy for some clinical updates on Co bed 19, but just to go through some specific questions that were sent to us.
There was a question about bringing a relative into the hospital and if they would be exposed to Koba 19, so currently our policy and what's been sent out from the state Of course, if it's a minor, if it's an end-of-life situation or something like that, of course, we look We do allow people to come in, but we're really strongly suggesting that if they're not necessary that they do not come in and they do again something like this as we're in this age of technology, and there is bed capacity there as far as Lennox Hill Hospital, they are licensed 603 two beds currently operating at 450, and they have 48 ICU beds So with what is happening now, we have been going through surge plans for all of North well over the 23 hospitals and hundreds and hundreds of amatory practices and we're looking for open at site locations, even in Greenwich Village we're looking at certain spaces that may be used for overflow, Thank you to community board too, and all the members for you know getting us the opportunity to speak to you guys tonight.
What do you do if you're feeling sick We're really asking folks to try to manage at home, so hydrate rest Yes could be signs that there may be a more serious infection going on everybody that comes into the emergency department at this point were able to test and sort of echoing what Alex had said as our system, not only core lab we're, also partnering with LabCorp and quest and some other private labs, as our capabilities to test expand, we'll be able to test more and more people However.
Wayne, do you want to add anything in before we take a couple questions and that you're muted hold on a second all on me view or a few other organizations, Some of our non-essential staff are working from home or we are fully medically staffed 24/7, as dr Levey said, so people should be comforted in that and that other than that I can certainly understand the need to project calm, and you know that it is under control, but I guess.
In other departments we transition on and off, though we are trying to do things to preserve the staffing they don't need to be, and also people like me was administrative So. If one of us get sick, somebody else can pop in their place and we can keep the place running thanks, Are you seeing anyone getting sick because on your staff, because you don't have the right materials so we're doing really well, but the toughest part of this from a PPE, a personal protective personal equipment perspective are the n95 masks.
We do have it we're trying to control it so that we don't run out, but I will tell you one thing: Yesterday, specifically many community members came to the hospital to deliver pizza for the staff Coffee cookies, and there was one individual woman that was outside She said no I, don't want a mask So now, May I will tell you when we're in crisis is when you really see the good of people come out, and we've really seen that here.
Should they tell someone in terms of tracking It's, basically saying if you don't have a primary care doctor you're at home, he gets sick and taken care of yourself I think some, a public health perspective You know with close contact, not wearing a mask with anyone in terms of if you're not feeling It may be something different for everybody listening to the call, but certainly if you don't have access to a health care provider , you're feeling ill, you could certainly come to the ER to get evaluated and that's what a lot of people have been doing and will continue to do.
I think one of the most real questions as far as the community Should they be doing if I'm sitting in the king board conference room right now, I'm across the street, from Morton Williams and you know, I when I came in I saw a couple of people older people going in and what should people be doing it I know a lot of the delivery services on thing things up to apartment, so they're leaving in doorman, and you go out in the supermarket I think for at-risk people wearing a mask is not a bad again trying not to be in close quarters with people If, you see someone who's, coughing or sneezing turn your back creates the distance so that the best way to mitigate transmission is going to be distance and protecting your face and nose from someone who could be potentially sick.
They shouldn't go to the emergency room, really sick, right , Bendigo health are really good partners of ours down here, but yeah I would say to check the NGO health is a fine place to you know an urgent care is fun place to go first at least ago, Health they've put in a mechanism where, if you're, making an appointment to go and see them, they'll communicate with you before your appointment and ask you if you're having any true like symptoms, and if the answer to that question is yes, they'll arrange for someone to meet you outside of the urgent care and hand you a mask before you come in, so that they can at least create an environment, that's safe for other patients, for maybe in the waiting room.
Some agency updates information we really receive from agencies so that they're posted regarding public hearings, meetings and events, The Landmarks Preservation Commission has canceled all public hearings for the remainder of March They have scheduled wonderful, April, 7th that subject to change, didn't change and the best ever want to please check the website for regular updates, has temporarily suspended all of New York City's land use decision, making processes, Also, D, Planning Commission meetings, including public hearings and votes required as part of the EULA process, are suspended and the time periods for hearings and votes will not run We've been receiving notices by email over the past week or so from the mayor's street activity permit office that events that they have permitted have been met.
We have two items from in our community board before them next week and I believe that people are requesting that those be adjourned until April 15th People understand that some businesses is moving forward in different agencies in different ways, and we have we play a role in that process and to not have committee meetings should we need to in the coming weeks and months would be to sort of abdicate our responsibility, providing for providing guidance to those agencies.
So if people wanted to be involved in an open discussion, I think that would be a good format and also with our weekly executive committee meetings that were going to be doing, and you know we're gonna figure out ways that we can better keep the community informed of specific issues that are happening from south of 14th Street, north of canal, west of Bowery and 4th Avenue, and to the river It's really our world and well trying to get as much information as we can about that participating in able to entertain all the business at hand.
We as a community board, are here and are serving our purpose, and you know I, really it's really impressive- and it's wonderful and sort of the new way of life They be a different link for every meeting for the different meetings at this point able to conduct our meetings in this fashion because of the executive order.
and I Think, that the best way to get through this crisis is that to make sure that no one feels isolated reality is that we're gonna have a lot of people who are sick in our community and around us.
