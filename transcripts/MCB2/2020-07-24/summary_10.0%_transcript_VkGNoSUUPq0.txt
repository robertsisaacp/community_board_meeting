Here I think we've got just making sure we do not have any board members that have registered in the public side of things.
We want to let Senator Boileman speak first Brad Thank you for joining us thanks for having me we're just back from Albany, literally carter and Dan The wonders of virtual technology, I'm here in New, York City, but I passed 13 bills over the last three days.
You, know, abuse case or just be with a family member And They will hone in on them and arrest them for attending court, and that obviously, is a huge barrier to justice, because we need people to go to court and court.
That kind of punishes you know, restaurants, who may not have you know who may not be responsible, there's a lot of responsible restaurant owners who are doing the right thing and a few bad apples, as is often the case, but it's So we've looked at potential amendments that would tighten the the governor's executive order in that regard, but I think I'm going to leave it to the governor to step up enforcement or at least make it more routine and predictable for everyone before we try to pass a bill at this stage, great First of all.
So I, would you know, I'm, going to be stepping up my public campaign and in connection with that, I, sent out mailings and put it in my newsletter to my newsletter, this week, but we have to do I , think, in all hands on deck approach before we lose out on lots of federal aid and You know the issues around policing, I think, are important.
Here in the state of New York, we had our own pfest debacle in a in a small town and and resulted in you know a lot of people who may develop health conditions down the road, including infants and children.
I just want to let everyone know that questions are only reserved for the Community board members and it won't be open to the public.
I wanted to support the resolution, because I think it very accurately reflected the testimony in two different SLA committee hearings against the bill: The union.
I also supported the resolution, because it admits that New York, State Liquor Authority currently has no ability or legal mechanism to enforce transgressions by patrons drinking in the public, domain, and I hope.
In, the first place, I believe the governor's executive orders have basically gutted the ABC laws, and I am opposing Senator Heyman's bill and in favor of the SLA committee resolution, because I think that bill would also gut the ABC laws.
And, then we're going to go to gail Brewer after this one , public comment: I want to offer my support to the very clear and detailed resolution that you've prepared that so emphasizes the problems that this particular bill offers.
My neighbors and the board members recognize that New York state is in his 15 billion dollar deficit and what I was trying to do was provide some sort of economic lifeline to these businesses.
You, know initially, and then we saw the explosion of violations of social, distancing and people not wearing face covering so like with a lot of legislation.
It's not Washington Heights, it's the East side and board too so on July 31, with the Us census and people who have ipads from four to seven we're going to be walking around the Soho community, and we will make sure where we meet.
Last semester, 178,000 summer school, kids, You are educators on the community board and there may be principals and teachers listening, but my friend who's, the principal said that he's not sure most of his teachers are not coming back.
I personally am going to call in my office every principal of every school in the borough, Manhattan, just to find out what they're thinking and if there is hope for something outside.
I know that this is an endless story, but with Europe starting again in August, as we understand it and the issue affordable housing we're talking again to all the people and the groups who have been working on this issue forever and just trying to see if we can have a real, clear understanding of what is or is not possible.
Every New York, City, Public school student is going to get 420.
The task force that the mayor called together, And it's based on something that happened in the 50s and 60s here in New, York City would allow for students to have in- person education every day and combined with outdoor schooling.
We have a resolution tonight, so CB2 will be discussing it, but we wanted to get your support for really helping to fast- track open streets or play streets for schools.
There's obviously opportunity costs, but there is no cash outlay to open up streets adjacent to schools, to create additional space for social distancing, but we need everyone's help to cut through the bureaucratic red tape and make sure some of these things can happen by September.
We already know that Ps3 Ps41, Cydia's school and likely 75 So we're going to move on to our public session as a reminder.
Please support providing access for our public schools to the streets that are right outside their doors.
So, it's nice to see so many familiar faces, I'm here representing a group of community members who are people of good heart and conscience who want to support the city's attempts to deal with the homeless crisis.
I, do not think that there's any chance that you would be able to squeeze 90 people plus 25 staff members in that building, even if it did get approved, but there is a way to bring the whole community together.
But the way to do that is to give people a little bit more time, more diligence, more information and make sure that it's an informed choice by this community board to approve the project and with that I just want to.
This project, renewal's proposal to house beds for 90 homeless women in this small building, plus a staff of approximately 15 to 25, will have a severe impact on all residents of West 11Th street.
Residents, smoking outdoors, impacting the buildings on either side behind also behind West, 12Th, Street, plus the egress and fire hazard issues are a great concern.
With regard to issues of community safety, public health and fire hazards, therefore, I would like to suggest that the Community Board delay their recommendation in order to give time for the community to fully evaluate and have input into this situation.
I was delighted to see that the Social Services Committee, voted to, I think strongly support was the language the proposal.
I understand, it would be unusual for community Board to usher in a shelter and perhaps unprecedented in New, York, City history, but I think this is an opportunity we can seize for the village in downtown to show the way to do right by our distinct cultural legacy and to strengthen our community's sense of purpose.
This shelter in our community, which of course, would be amazing, but 90 people is a little bit too much for the space Thank you for giving us your point of view, Eric, Rosenbaum, President and CEO of project renewal.
We shelter, a thousand people, every night, acrosss, seven shelters, another 1,000 individuals and permanent, supported and affordable housing, we're one of the largest providers of direct health care to homeless, new yorkers, with over 100 doctors and nurses and clinics throughout the city.
The shelter at West 11Th street, we'll combine our shelter and housing expertise with employment programs to help women exit homelessness through work, we're happy to discuss programming in greater detail offline and we can share with anyone the presentation that we gave to the Social Services Committee, which the rest of the board members have.
We need to find a way to find a legal moderator and find out what we want to welcome these people into our community.
Think project renewal has given a pretty strong indication that they're willing to work through those issues with the community and certainly follow all the rules and regulations of the city.
So I'm, going to summarize her letter that she wrote to the community board, which is very much a lot of the points we just heard from Richard and other speakers that were not in favor of this particular development at this very moment, but is welcoming of homeless, shelters and affordable housing to our neighbor and neighborhood in general.
Next to the first presbyterian church, which continues despite calls to 311 over the last eight years, Amy respectfully asked that more thought and planning goes into our community's investment in project renewal and seeing no other questions that ends the public session, handing it over to Chair Carter Booth, hey thanks, Dan. There a motion to adopt the agenda she's, distributed to all the board members good mode back The agenda is adopted.
Excuse me for reports of the public from the elected officials If, you could raise your hands as the attendees and we can we'll have you speak in the order that you are called all right , I'm, going to start off with Luke Wolfe from the controller's office.
First, in the economic side, thinking about the paycheck protection program, we did an analysis and what we found was that if New York City was a state, it would be 49th out of 50th in terms of the amount of businesses percent of businesses that were able to access the program.
We also need to make sure our businesses know how to access that federal support on the school reopening side.
Council number 10 worked with their colleagues to make sure that funding for seniors, Education health services and food pantry programs got to communities who can't afford to wait for release.
We may What we may ask is that the elected official offices not provide updates, if there's nothing of too much substance in order to allow it to be a business only meeting okay, we can move it along for all the board members in a timely manner, but that was one of my few items during my chairs report.
But you know we've heard many of the same concerns we're actually working on a response to DOT and the administration in a letter kind of talking about all the different aspects of open, streets, open, restaurants.
We at the council, and actually met with the New York City Board of Elections Commissioner Mike Ryan today to voice a number of concerns to him directly.
I think that there's been from what I've heard, not necessarily judging whether it's appropriate or not the violations that have been issued, but it seems that there's been some overzealous enforcement of establishments that are trying to follow the rules and have been working really hard in limited enforcement on places that are blatantly breaking the rules and that's raised a lot of issues within the restaurant community.
And, let's see at the borough president or excuse me at the at the Borough board meeting this week , there's a presentation by Revel scooters, which I think is going to come to us in the fall.
What the reason that we chose them was because they had already attended community board meetings, so they were familiar with the process in which we worked, and I think that when they first went to Cv3, that was something in discussion with their district manager that she had indicated being familiar.
I do not know like a lot of folks, but I do not know when the staff will be coming back to the office, certainly Maybe after labor day, I'm, not sure, If that's even an accurate projection right, now, tomorrow, at the borough service, cabinet, Meeting Department of citywide administrative services will be giving a presentation regarding reopening city, offices.
The considerations that we need to concern ourselves with before we can open the office, and people can come back for our situation.
To social service, to mental health, to seniors to all the things that we care about, and it's going to help countless people.
My office has been working closely with the Department of Health and sanitation and parks on rat mitigation efforts in the West village and in the south village, and during the upcoming months my team is going to be doing a series of walk throughs with those three agencies, the residents, the building owners, the block associations.
More, I could talk about, but I just wanted to give you some highlights of some of the things that we've been working on and some of the things we're able to do in the budget and, as always, I'm on CB2 for your leadership during these hard times, and your partnership with my office to continue to work on behalf of the residents in community board 2 and for the small businesses.
If I could just ask people if they've got just brief, one- sensing questions, that would be great georgia, it's more of a comment, I guess, or a request, in the same way that we're going to bat for small businesses and open streets.
If, you or members of the Community board have suggestions for us on particular schools or particular streets, feel free to pass them along to my office, And we'll speak to the chancellor's office in the mayor's office about some of those suggestions.
As you know, rat ice is incredibly effective and The parks Department, as at least as of last year, was limited in its use of it, because in order to get rat ice, it had to spend an entire day going out to the one distributor in Brooklyn or the Queens, and getting it, and I asked even Mitchell silver why they could not make the rat ice come to New York, because I'm sure it's a pretty big contract.
But now that we're several months into it, I wanted to ask you to comment just on some of the threats that the Trump Administration has come up with in terms of sending in federal troops into cities, including New York.
Thanks for all the work, you're doing I mean we all know how things work in New, York, Critical, I think, to the school's reopening is the uft's position, which of course, you know, You know if there's any threat to the health of teachers, no matter what the mayor comes up with they're not going to do.
Think their opinion is the uft's opinion is that the DOE and the mayor's office have not really done what they need to do to create that type of plan to give people the peace of mind that there would be a safe possibility of reopening.
You know no one, I think, has started to sort of plot that out we're kind of looking at the other type of industries and seeing if we have a secondary spike in infections over the next many months and that's what will determine some of the other things that are going to impact.
Unlike many other places, as we've been slowly reopening, I will talk to the mayor's office into the Department of Health and see if there's going to be a continuation or a new effort, as well as the governor's office about more public service announcements related to mask wearing.
First one is a resolution in support of open streets for schools and the addition of outdoor and indoor school sites to support the safe reopening of New York City schools, therefore.
The second resolution is in support of immediate solutions to reduce the digital divide by fall, 2020 for New York, City Public school students, and this has been identified by many advocates as one of the most important equity issues.
Our third resolution is in support of New York, University and Trinity real estate commitments to New York City for the Bleeker school in Hudson, Square, school and public recreation space and therefore be it resolve that community board 2 urges our elected officials, New York University and the Department of Education to ensure that the Bleeker school option is exercised and continue to explore the possibility of creating a DOE public school program for dyslexic students at the Bleeker school site.
Thank, you very much, janine, I'm, not sure the advent of footnotes I attribute to the starting use of those to Matt, but I know he's on your committee Is. There any unwillingness to move these three items into the omnibus vote?
We will move those three items, the three resolutions we're moving them into the omnibus vote, which so we're going to do a roll call at the end of the end of the meeting, unless somebody'd like to call it out.
The committee heard a bunch of additional people coming in against it just like they had the first time.
I lost them, therefore, be it resolve that committee board 2 Manhattan submits that the vagueness of Senate Bill 8392, as proposed and written, represents an unacceptable risk with regards to public health and safety at this time and therefore be a further result.
2 Manhattan recommends that any revisions to the bill incorporate the suggestions detail above to limit off- The amount of alcoholic drinks per person, the ceiling of the container, the label and warnings to be placed on the container and the types of alcoholic beverages placed in the community, okay, It's a very good resolution and Is there any objection to moving items, one through 12 from the SLA licensing committees into the omnibus vote?
So am I correct in saying that there is no formal action by any city agency that will come before this community board for approval , that everything that we're doing here is for information of the board and to indicate the support of the board for this project.
My question is: How do you feel about that susanna and do you think, perhaps that the resolution should encourage more dialogue between the neighbors and project renewal before going ahead?
The discussion does not include the community board where you know again we're weighing in on this, because we want to support this project and we want to outline the concerns and that's what the resolution right.
I mean the process itself is going to take time, and actually I think it was pretty good that DSS pushed us to have this meeting to me.
I, think there's we have an applicant who's really interested in working with the community, and I also want to call the question since I do not unless there's other questions, but I do not see any.
So we're going to move the resolution from the Social Services Committee into the omnibus vote.
But it does not limit the occupancy, and so the information is so that your gives you the choice of whether you want to board or not based on how crowded the bus is, but they have not determined an occupant, a safe occupancy right on the bus, No right, okay, so that just I think, the more I think about it, robin we're asking MTA, New, York City Transit to do certain actions.
Would you like to phrase that, in that way, I understand what you're saying carter, in other words, a request to MTA New York City Transit, to determine what the safe number of occupancies or save social distancing I'll know not to get on the bus.
Any objection to moving resolutions, one through three with three is modified in the manner suggested by Robin into the omnibus vote: If you're going to vote against something you can't be in the omnibus I mean if you need to vote differently on it than you would otherwise, If you wanted to vote against one two or three in traffic or transportation, if you just keep track specifically, thank you.
So I'm, suggesting that we allow the removal of the Worcester Street side fire escapes which are from the 70s, but on canal, that we retain them as a nod to the mid 20th century Soho, which I think is important.
So I do not know how China wants to handle this, and how parliamentary procedure would dictate that we do this, but I I'm, suggesting that we allow the removal of the Worcester Street fire escapes, but maintain the Canal Street small fire.
We've got a number of people who want to speak on this Bob ely I mean it's very easy for any community board member to look to see what it is.
I think we should hear from a few more people hold on There was a lot of sympathy for the history of Soho and the fire escapes in this building.
So no, if you want to put a substitute, is that what you're suggesting as a substitute resolution or we vote on what the committee recommended?
