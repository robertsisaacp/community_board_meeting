Sexual abuse, survivors, newspapers, journalists, and they drag them into court on really thin grounds of on issues like defamation, and they basically try to intimidate critics by these lengthy lawsuits that bankrupt a lot of small organizations and advocates , I think, protect the first amendment The other bill.
You, know, abuse case or just be with a family member, and they will hone in on them and arrest them for attending court, and that obviously, is a huge barrier to justice, because we need people to go to court and court.
That kind of punishes you know, restaurants, who may not have you know who may not be responsible, there's a lot of responsible restaurant owners who are doing the right thing and a few bad apples, as is often the case, but it's So we've looked at potential amendments that would tighten the the governor's executive order in that regard, but I think I'm gonna, leave it to the governor to step up enforcement or at least make it more routine and predictable for everyone.

I just want to let everyone know that questions are only reserved for the community board members and it won't be open to the public.
I wanted to support the resolution, because I think it very accurately reflected the testimony in two different sla committee hearings against the bill: The union.
I, also supported the resolution, because it admits that new york state liquor authority currently has no ability or legal mechanism to enforce transgressions by patrons drinking in the public, domain, and I hope.
That's, why we have alcohol beverage control laws in the first place, I believe the governor's executive orders have basically gutted the abc laws, and I am opposing senator heyman's bill and in favor of the sla committee resolution, because I think that bill would also gut the abc laws.
It's a wonderful life for bourbon street I think that there are other ways to secure revenue for new york state that do not involve alcohol, and I.
My neighbors and the board members recognize that new york state is in his 15 billion dollar deficit, and what I was trying to do was provide some sort of economic lifeline to these businesses.
You, know initially, and then we saw the explosion of violations of social, distancing and people not wearing face covering so like with a lot of legislation.
It's the east side and board too so on July 31 with the us census and people who have ipads from four to seven We're going to be walking around the soho community and we will make sure where we meet.

So, it's nice to see so many familiar faces, I'm here representing a group of community members who are people of good heart and conscience who want to support the city's attempts to deal with the homeless crisis.
I. Don't think that there's any chance that you would be able to squeeze 90 people plus 25 staff members in that building, even if it did get approved, but there is a way to bring the whole community together.
The way to do that is to give people a little bit more time, more diligence, more information and make sure that it's an informed choice by this community board to approve the project and with that I just want to.
Residents, smoking outdoors, impacting the buildings on either side behind also behind west 12th, street, plus the egress and fire hazard issues are a great concern.
With regard to issues of community safety, public health and fire hazards, therefore, I would like to suggest that the community board delay their recommendation in order to give time for the community to fully evaluate and have input into this situation.
It would be unusual for community board to usher in a shelter and perhaps unprecedented in new york city history, but I think this is an opportunity we can seize for the village in downtown to show the way to do right by our distinct cultural legacy and to strengthen our community's sense of purpose.
We shelter, a thousand people every night across seven shelters, another 1, 000 individuals and permanent, supported and affordable housing, we're one of the largest providers of direct health care to homeless, new yorkers, with over 100 doctors and nurses and clinics throughout the city.
The shelter at west 11th street we'll combine our shelter and housing expertise with employment programs to help women exit homelessness through work, we're happy to discuss programming in greater detail offline and we can share with anyone the presentation that we gave to the social services committee, which the rest of the board members have.
We need to find a way to find a legal moderator and find out what we want to welcome these people into our community.
I spoke to bob and he told me to speak to project renewal, but right, I'm, looking for a middle person to work the problems through someone with an impartial middle I'll reach across the aisle, but I want there's someone to be in the middle to kind of negotiate.
Think project renewal has given a pretty strong indication that they're willing to work through those issues with the community and certainly follow all the rules and regulations of the city.
So I'm, going to summarize her letter that she wrote to the community board, which is very much a lot of the points we just heard from richard and other speakers that were not in favor of this particular development at this very moment, but is welcoming of homeless, shelters and affordable housing to our neighbor and neighborhood in general.
Next to the first presbyterian church, which continues despite calls to 311 over the last eight years, amy respectfully asked that more thought and planning goes into our community's investment in project renewal and seeing no other questions that ends the public session.
We also need to make sure our businesses know how to access that federal support on the school reopening side.
Council number 10 worked with their colleagues to make sure that funding for seniors, education, health services and food pantry programs got to communities who can't afford to wait for release.
If there's nothing of too much substance in order to allow it to be a business only meeting okay, we can move it along for all the board members in a timely manner, but that was one of my few items during my chairs report.
But you know we've heard many of the same concerns we're actually working on a response to DOT and the administration in a letter kind of talking about all the different aspects of open, streets, open, restaurants.
I saw you're working on the resolution on open streets for schools, so really excited to kind of see more of that and again any more thoughts.
I think that there's been from what I've heard, not necessarily judging whether it's appropriate or not the violations that have been issued, but it seems that there's been some overzealous enforcement of establishments that are trying to follow the rules and have been working really hard in limited enforcement on places that are blatantly breaking the rules and that's raised a lot of issues within the restaurant community.
And- let's see at the borough president or excuse me at the at the borough board meeting this week, there's a presentation by revel scooters which I think is going to come to us in the fall.
Even though we don't have any resolutions in front of us, this month, I just wanted to acknowledge that our three working groups that are currently running right, now, The, bylaws, working group, the equity working group and the reopening working group.- I'm going to move on to the treasurer's report, anthony Hey everybody.
What the reason that we chose them was because they had already attended community board meetings, so they were familiar with the process in which we worked, and I think that when they first went to cv3, that was something in discussion with their district manager that she had indicated being familiar.
I just want to let everyone know that, like many other people, the staff are still working from home, we're trying to get work done by phone email text and zoom.
The considerations that we need to concern ourselves with before we can open the office, and people can come back for our situation.
We, restored hundreds of millions of dollars, 700 million dollars in cuts from the mayor's proposed executive budget, to education, to social service, to mental health, to seniors to all the things that we care about, and it's going to help countless people.
My office has been working closely with the department of health and sanitation and parks on rat mitigation efforts in the west village and in the south village, and during the upcoming months my team is going to be doing a series of walk throughs with those three agencies, the residents, the building owners, the block associations.
I could talk about, but I just wanted to give you some highlights of some of the things that we've been working on and some of the things we're able to do in the budget and, as always, I'm on cb2 for your leadership during these hard times, and your partnership with my office to continue to work on behalf of the residents in community board 2 and for the small businesses.
If I could just ask people if they've got just brief, one-sensing questions that would be great georgia, it's more of a comment, I guess, or a request, in the same way that we're going to bat for small businesses and open streets.
If, you or members of the community board have suggestions for us on particular schools or particular streets feel free to pass them along to my office, And we'll speak to the chancellor's office in the mayor's office about some of those suggestions.
To give people the peace of mind that there would be a safe possibility of reopening, I mean, I think, the we have not seen fatalities amongst children- Very few, not just here in new york, but around the world in the united states, If you're going to ask teachers and staff to go in, you need to make sure that you have a plan, and then you need to make sure you have to be concerned about If kids can bring it home.
You know no one, I think, has started to sort of plot that out we're kind of looking at the other type of industries and seeing if we have a secondary spike in infections over the next many months and that's what will determine some of the other things that are gonna impact.
, You, know people just don't wear them We get some public service announcements and try and sort of beef up the advertising on this issue?
You have to wear a mask, but if people aren't doing it, you know, I think we kind of have to use some peer pressure.
Unlike many other places, as we've been slowly reopening, I will talk to the mayor's office into the department of health and see if there's going to be a continuation or a new effort, as well as the governor's office about more public service announcements related to mask wearing.
First one is a resolution in support of open streets for schools and the addition of outdoor and indoor school sites to support the safe reopening of new york.
Strongly urges the new york, city, department of transportation and the department of education to implement a fast-tracked and streamlined open streets program to close streets around schools which will provide much needed recreation space and.
The second resolution is in support of immediate solutions to reduce the digital divide by fall, 2020 for new york city public school students, and this has been identified by many advocates as one of the most important equity issues.
Our third resolution is in support of new york, university and trinity, real estate commitments to new york city for the bleeker school in hudson square, school and public recreation space and therefore be it resolve that community board 2 urges our elected officials, new york, university and the department of education to ensure that the bleeker school option is exercised and continue to explore the possibility of creating a DOE public school program for dyslexic students at the bleeker school site.
Thank, you very much, janine, I'm, not sure the advent of footnotes I attribute to the starting use of those to matt, but I know he's on your committee Is. There any unwillingness to move these three items into the omnibus vote?
That, in general, cb2 encourages our elected supposed turning over pop space to developers for commercial infield purposes within cb2, because I think that the resolution lays out the case for that with our very limited pop spaces within our community Is there any opposition to moving these two items into the omnibus vote that we'll be voting on at the end?
I lost them, therefore, be it resolve that committee board 2 Manhattan submits that the vagueness of senate bill 8392, as proposed and written, represents an unacceptable risk with regards to public health and safety at this time and therefore be a further result.
It's a very good resolution and Is there any objection to moving items, one through 12 from the sla licensing committees into the omnibus vote?
So am I correct in saying that there is no formal action by any city agency that will come before this community board for approval , that everything that we're doing here is for information of the board and to indicate the support of the board for this project.
We heard testimony earlier during the public session from residents of the area who felt as though there might be a way that community board would be opining on this of this proposed use.
My question is: How do you feel about that susanna and do you think, perhaps that the resolution should encourage more dialogue between the neighbors and project renewal before going ahead?
The discussion doesn't include the community board where you know again we're weighing in on this, because we want to support this project and we want to outline the concerns and that's what the resolution right.
I think there's we have an applicant who's really interested in working with the community, and I also want to call the question since I.
So we're gonna move the resolution from the social services committee into the omnibus vote.
What to consider a chirp so just to clarify what robin's point so that the app provides the information, but it doesn't limit the occupancy, and so the information is so that your gives you the choice of whether you want to board or not based on how crowded the bus is, but they haven't determined an occupant, a safe occupancy right on the bus, No right, okay, so that just I think, the more I think about it, robin we're asking mta new york city transit to do certain actions.
Would you like to phrase that, in that way, I understand what you're saying carter, in other words, a request to mta new york city transit, to determine what the safe number of occupancies or save social distancing I'll know not to get on the bus.
Any objection to moving resolutions, one through three with three is modified in the manner suggested by robin into the omnibus vote: If you're going to vote against something you can't be in the omnibus I mean if you need to vote differently on it than you would otherwise, If you wanted to vote against one two or three in traffic or transportation, if you just keep track specifically, thank you.
I, don't see any objections, so we'll move those three items into the omnibus vote and now we're moving on to the last committee report, which is landmarks and public aesthetics, chanel spence.
We've got a number of people who want to speak on this bob ely I mean it's very easy for any community board member to look to see what it is.
I think we should hear from a few more people hold on There was a lot of sympathy for the history of soho and the fire escapes in this building.
I support bo in this You know we have sprinklers everywhere, but to me they're iconic, almost in the realm of the water, towers, and So no, if you want to put a substitute, is that what you're suggesting as a substitute resolution or we vote on what the committee recommended?
