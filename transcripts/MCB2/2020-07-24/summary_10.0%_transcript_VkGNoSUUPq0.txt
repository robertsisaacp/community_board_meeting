Our first vice chair is going to run the public session thanks very much We want to let senator boileman speak first brad I'm here in new york city, but I passed 13 bills over the last three days.
We need a public hearing on service and that's what this bill would require and I don't know you may have heard about those are You assemble at home without serial numbers, so they're not traceable by law enforcement and because we have such tough gun laws in the state of new york, which is a great thing.
We're gonna need federal aid to dig ourselves out of this crisis, not to mention you know the health crisis that still is ongoing and then a final word carter on my legislation to make permanent the governor's order for alcohol to go and as well as deliveries , I we're putting that we're putting that bill on ice right now, given the really disappointing response by many patrons who are violating social distancing laws and causing havoc on our blocks, we're going to you know continue to evaluate the governor's order.
who may not have you know who may not be responsible, there's a lot of responsible restaurant owners who are doing the right thing and a few bad apples, as is often the case, but it's so we've looked at potential amendments that would tighten the the governor's executive order in that regard, but I think I'm gonna leave it to the governor to step up enforcement or at least make it more routine and predictable for everyone before we try to pass a bill at this stage great, we do have three more questions from you from the community board: Let's wait for senator boilerman to get back to a c and then ed.
Well, speaking of pfas, there's a great movie called dark waters, which I think is streaming now starring mark ruffalo and it really encapsulates the whole fast environmental crisis takes place in a town not far from where I grew up in rural west virginia parkersburg west virginia, which was contaminated by a pfest plant Here in the state of new york, we had our own pfest debacle in a in a small town and and resulted in you know a lot of people who may develop health conditions down the road, including infants and children One of the things we did pass this session is a bill to make illegal dumping a felony and to really toughen those penalties.
I just want to let everyone know that questions are only reserved for the community board members and it won't be open to the public.
The local autonomy I think has a clear answer : Thank you senator hoyoman for help, so many legislation instituted by you in the past few weeks and regarding the local, the public health So actually you know, senator holman We actually have two speakers public speakers that are speaking about a bill that I believe you wrote that might be interesting for you to stick around since we're going to talk about senate bill.
The unanimous opposition by residents at both of those hearings I also supported the resolution, because it admits that new york state liquor authority currently has no ability or legal mechanism to enforce transgressions by patrons drinking in the public domain and I hope.
My neighbors and the board members recognize that new york state is in his 15 billion dollar deficit, and what I was trying to do was provide some sort of economic lifeline to these businesses, Many of them who are so cherished in our neighborhood, like jeans, like knickerbocker down the block from me, for example, some of them have been here a century or longer and are disappearing like nyx, which is a great vegetarian, You know initially, and then we saw the explosion of violations of social, distancing and people not wearing face covering so like with a lot of legislation.
I know we're sick of it, but just a there's, a wonderful cuny census, hard to count map and I think you've heard that the state of new york is around 57.9 The city of new york is 53.7 Manhattan Some portions of board two are at 46 47 49 and where your office is 62, but it is the lowest in Manhattan and it's partly because people aren't here, it's not harlem.
I have you know some hope for the chancellor and the mayor and everything Last semester, 178 000 summer, school, kids and you are educators on the community board and there may be principals and teachers listening, but my friend who's, the principal said that he's not sure most of his teachers are not coming back.
I personally am going to call in my office every principal of every school in the borough, Manhattan just to find out what they're thinking and if there is hope for something outside That's the only way to address this very challenging health issue.
First To see you again, I just wanted you to repeat what you said about the education Every new york city, public school student is going to get 420 new york state introduces the state program is called p e b, t p for pandemic, and it gives every new york city, public, school, family, 420 per child fact That's very that's very important and will be very helpful to people Have.
We have a lot of different ideas in our resolution, but this is one that is essentially budget neutral because you know other than staff putting an NYPD barrier on there , there's obviously opportunity costs, but there is no cash outlay to open up streets adjacent to schools, to create additional space for social distancing, but we need everyone's help to cut through the bureaucratic red tape and make sure some of these things can happen by september.
But it was great to hear all those updates are the museums community affairs manager and I wanted to check in and share an update on the institution and talk a little bit about our reopening planning, So, first and foremost, we're following all government guidance and we're looking to new york state in the city.
This task force has developed a set of procedures on topics like capacity management, ticketing strategy for visitors, The visitor journey will look like, but before they arrive and once they're at the museum facilities, management and cleaning and staff training to all have a uniform, safe experience for people that choose to visit the museum once we all reopen and these procedures are guiding the museum's reopening planning with safety top of mind Once we receive that approval to reopen and the institution decides on its reopening date, we plan to share out our reopening plans more on those procedures or hours, exhibitions that we'll have on you and the opportunities for new yorkers to come into the museum, so I'll be in touch with the community board at that time and in the meantime, we continue to fulfill our mission by offering virtual programs I'm grateful for the board president for including in her newsletter that our summer studios program for six weeks this summer, we're offering free online classes for kids of all ages to experiment, create and learn together with at-home art materials.
The governor has stated in unequivocal terms that patrons going to restaurants because they're all outdoor now the a patron sits in a seat at a table to dine alcoholic beverages are up to them whether they want to order one- is a quality of life issue that a lot of us are dealing with and when people call into the community board the law of the land.
You're a governing body you're already familiar with the open streets application program, Please support providing access for our public schools to the streets that are right outside their doors, We assumed there would be temperature checks and information to fill out before entering the building.
I don't think that there's any chance that you would be able to squeeze 90 people plus 25 staff members in that building, even if it did get approved, but there is a way to bring the whole community together The way to do that is to give people a little bit more time, more diligence, more information and make sure that it's an informed choice by this community board to approve the project and with that I just want to.
The shelter at west 11th street we'll combine our shelter and housing expertise with employment programs to help women exit homelessness through work, we're happy to discuss programming in greater detail offline and we can share with anyone the presentation that we gave to the social services committee, which the rest of the board members have We, commit to deepening those relationships through the process of developing opening and operating the shelter which we believe will probably take about two years.
So I'm going to summarize her letter that she wrote to the community board, which is very much a lot of the points we just heard from richard and other speakers that were not in favor of this particular development at this very moment, but is welcoming of homeless shelters and affordable housing to our neighbor and neighborhood in general.
Also, there's ongoing drug activity and homeless encampments on the north side of the street Next to the first presbyterian church, which continues despite calls to 311 over the last eight years , amy respectfully asked that more thought and planning goes into our community's investment in project renewal and seeing no other questions that ends the public session Is there a motion to adopt the agenda she's, distributed to all the board members good mode back The agenda is adopted, Now we're going to move on to reports from the public Excuse me for reports of the public from the elected officials representatives, all the elected official representatives If, you could raise your hands as the attendees and we can we'll have you speak in the order that you are called all right , I'm, going to start off with luke wolfe from the controller's office.
, Everyone, I, hope you're staying cool today just want to start off with some of our office updates, with upcoming events related to workplace protections Now that folks are coming back to work so the first one, thursday july 30th at 3 pm Councilmember chen, will be joining the new york city commission on human rights.
At councilnycgov Councilmember chen has been exploring the tools to help make sure tenement buildings in chinatown little italy and the lower east side stay, affordable, housing, rent stabilized tenants, we're facing rights and operating expenses, family of small property owners and family associations have been asking for some relief, so council member chen passed legislation to help small property owners who have been affected by Covid-19 19 at to defer their july 1 property taxes to october 15th at a reduced interest rate from the 18 percent that was originally down to 7.5 and my last second last item 21 budget After months of negotiation, the city budget was passed by the council on july, met with the preliminary budget that zeroed out the summer youth budget and threatened seamless cuts to safety net programs.
So you can find one near you and that concludes my report and I will drop my contact information in the chat box for you I know you guys are not meeting in august, so enjoy your month summer Actually we may We may oh okay, because I understand some boards are not meeting in august and But what we may ask is that the elected official offices not provide updates, if there's nothing of too much substance in order to allow it to be a business only meeting okay, we can move it along for all the board members in a timely manner, but that was one of my few items during my chairs report.
One issue obviously was the election we just recently had that I think is having votes still counted as we speak, We at the council and actually met with the new york city board of elections.
Commissioner mike ryan today to voice a number of concerns to him directly regarding the the operations that happened and basically calling for a number of changes, teammates that we don't have the same issues happen in november, particularly providing more early voting sites, drop-off boxes, if possible, for absentee ballots and more I may, most importantly, a tracker so that people can identify where their absentee ballot is in the process, so they make sure they get it on time and that it's getting heard and actually counted and then, finally, a quick update on a local issue.
I work on transportation for the councilwoman I know, there's been a lot of concerns from folks in cb2 about the bus way and the way that DOT went about making that permanent We conducted a walk through a bunch of cbt residents in december brought up a lot of improvements that we wanted made to the program street sign changes, marking changes, Some potential traffic pattern, changes that residents brought up that we communicated DOT Unfortunately.
Today people had to submit had to submit their request to speak by then, but do we have any other public official reps that are on the call, if so raise your hands that we missed barbara I wanted to say please that I support the large schmont Some number of different people are on vacations and andrew we've already heard from from bro president brewer, so we're gonna move from that and now on to the chairs report, it's already 804, which has been quite a while since we haven't started our business session I'm going to keep it brief next week is the census.
but I, don't know when the staff will be coming back to the office, certainly not before a month or two ago Right now, tomorrow, at the borough service cabinet meeting department of citywide administrative services will be giving a presentation regarding reopening city offices, so I guess they'll the considerations that we need to concern ourselves with before we can open the office and people can come back for our situation, It's not just coming into the office, and this falls under the category of some of the expenses that anthony just mentioned.
I could talk about, but I just wanted to give you some highlights of some of the things that we've been working on and some of the things we're able to do in the budget and as always, I'm on cb2 for your leadership during these hard times and your partnership with my office to continue to work on behalf of the residents in community board 2 and for the small businesses.
If I could just ask people if they've got just brief, one-sensing questions that would be great georgia, it's more of a comment, I guess or a request, in the same way that we're going to bat for small businesses and open streets.
To give people the peace of mind that there would be a safe possibility of reopening I, mean I, think the we have not seen fatalities amongst children very few, not just here in new york but around the world in the united states, but we do know that children can pass kovid to each other and to adults.
just I think the community feeling of what would actually be safe some of the other things that are gonna impact Is there any way the city can do some public information stuff about people wearing masks?
Reopening I will talk to the mayor's office into the department of health and see if there's going to be a continuation or a new effort, as well as the governor's office about more public service announcements related to mask wearing One thing.
So we're going to move into our first standing committee report, janine kyleigh for schools and education committee hi good evening First one is a resolution in support of open streets for schools and the addition of outdoor and indoor school sites to support the safe reopening of new york city Therefore.
The second resolution is in support of immediate solutions to reduce the digital divide by fall, 2020 for new york city public school students, and this has been identified by many advocates as one of the most important equity issues.
Our third resolution is in support of new york, university and trinity, real estate commitments to new york city for the bleeker school in hudson square, school and public recreation space and therefore be it resolve that community board 2 urges our elected officials, new york, university and the department of education to ensure that the bleeker school option is exercised and continue to explore the possibility of creating a DOE public school program for dyslexic students at the bleeker school site.
That would allow customers to enter the cafe area from the plaza rather than directly through the restaurant, and they were willing to explore the feasibility of a walk-up window that would a restaurant That would allow the public to purchase items directly from the plaza and a brief canvas of the committee members didn't change any minds about our decision and the be it finally resolved, maybe at the very end of that within community board too , that, in general cb2 encourages our elected supposed turning over pop space to developers for commercial infield purposes within cb2, because I think that the resolution lays out the case for that with our very limited pop spaces within our community Is there any opposition to moving these two items into the omnibus vote that we'll be voting on at the end?
Tonight, therefore be it resolve the community board to Manhattan strong number One strongly supports project renewals plan to operate a shelter at 27, west 11th street for homeless women, with no significant barriers to employment and to recognizing that its district houses.
You for your report, We heard tonight from people who are opposed to the shelter who feel that the process requires more time and we heard from people who are in favor of the shelter who felt that more time should be taken So. My question is:: how do you feel about that susanna and do you think, perhaps that the resolution should encourage more dialogue between the neighbors and project renewal before going ahead?
The discussion doesn't include the community board where you know again we're weighing in on this, because we want to support this project and we want to outline the concerns and that's what the resolution right.
This resolution in the and one of the concerns that was raised tonight was the density in too many people and I've had relatives stay at the former hotel there I think there's we have an applicant who's really interested in working with the community I'm, not seeing any any objection to moving this into the omnibus vote.
She doesn't know when too many people are on the bus because they haven't determined what a socially distanced maximum occupancy is, so that if you were threat, you know, if you had some health issue, that you really didn't want to get on it In other words, a request to mta new york city transit, to determine what the safe number of occupancies or save social distancing, right?
Your social distance intervention and it would be translated in the app since they have it, and people use it Any objection to moving resolutions, one through three with three is modified in the manner suggested by robin into the omnibus vote: If you're going to vote against something you can't be in the omnibus I mean if you need to vote differently on it than you would otherwise and we will So if you wanted to vote against one two or three in traffic or transportation.
Okay We've got a number of people who want to speak on this bob ely I mean it's very easy for any community board member to look to see what it is.
