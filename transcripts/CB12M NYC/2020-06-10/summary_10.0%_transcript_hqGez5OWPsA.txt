You, if you are there, when is a please set up a committee member running cruel you folks that we're waiting for Carmen once we have chrome we're going to start the meeting you folks.
They do have information that will be critical to the licenses for this okay, I got a call they now when I saw you start spoked without turning for precinct they're going to be joining us in two minutes.
This is I just spoke with someone at 33rd and I, trying to get some officers on board I think we should start and hopefully that by the time the dogs step in we'll be on our way.
It's my pleasure to be sitting before you, even British, Pearlie I'm, happy to see you all happy to see our committee members here, Rosie, always a pleasure to see you actually, while these the new faces of the license committee welcome once again so surely I'll see you guys know not.
You know your background, your community, because we don't want to kill more of an intimate feeling as to who's who and why you guys are mean to a community so I'm, going to start with ID right leave me -, Roy, dangle I, believe you here with the seizure on the rest of our committee, members, Ashley hi, everyone Ashley, Fernandez I, am on licensing committee under Ysidro and yeah I'm living in Washington right, Robin, Cruz, Rosie, hi, everyone, my name is Rosie got something about me.
The fact that you guys mean anything with a PD put your lives at risk every now and then makes us to think that you know we have to make sure that we treasure what we have and I'm glad that but I know of we have had an excellent relationship and it's something that I'm going to continue to make sure that is emphasized, because this idea that the NYPD communities can now work together can be acting found in this community.
Yes, I respect the work that you guys do and I understand that you know we're going to work on this community to push it forward, because that too many inches affecting our communities and the last thing that we need is to have divisions within the community.
Yeah, yes, I know the Sindh, it's not online, yet she usually takes care of the stipulations but I'm going to ask perhaps Rosie and I'm not I'm, not sure when other steps, but we do.
So, as usual, we're going to listen, an entertaining application on the and we're going to listen from the merchants after we listen from the merchants, we're going to listen from the priests and then the restaurants and then I, say committee, we're going to decide or vote on each applicant when the residents have a comment, they're going to get a two minute time limit dear ah, who will be keeping the traffic alert and if the residents have any questions, please do raise your hands and we'll be more than happy to entertain your common on your concerns.
In other my hand, do I have representative from brown sugar I have can I say, can I say something real, quick, I think there's a member, a board member that would like to be added as a panelist.
Manhattan borough, president Gale Brewer that evening Thank You Natalie, welcome aboard, do I have presented it from a brown sugar yeah for the purpose of the minutes.
Well, so ask he is a renewal from for this license based on previous four solutions, fast right, this Takamine report, the last time you came on board I was turning 18 and there was no objection from this Community Board I'm, going to pass out before creasing of Japan on any comes from 32 operation.
We have positive comments from our neighbors and the priests and I recommend that committee members to our police are considered put on this application right away.
Oh sorry can hear me now: oh yeah, because I'm pologize I'm, actually driving okay I just wanted you to clarify what are you the president of on the Broad Street Bridge?
Pardon me I'm, sorry is number three are wolf, so number three is when the prior 33rd precinct, okay, both I'm sorry, so looks like what I'm sorry you're right, I, second, that if you want to go in episodes, no committee members yeah, let's do it.
Let me a quick question before we proceed how long you have been having this license going on six years, I transferred it over from Broadway to me since 2014.
They I don't think they have an objection so, but it looked anyway go ahead, I'm, sorry, okay, let's proceed in with agenda and now we're going to move to agenda item number 6 and there'll be a new liquor license Tweel m-sport pong incorporated doing business as TVA no DBA, yet it's located 13 SEC 40th Avenue between 211 and 212 Street.
Yes, let me ask you these said police with any rule, obviously management.
But once we are, as we are saying, wait, I mean I, don't say we will inform the community board and ask them to assist us for local help.
Yes, I'm here to be the manager there right, yes, I'm, the owner and a manager also great, so you know that this, like really hard you're Tony, just said that you to come back after lies has been approved.
So do you like to know what the plan is all about and how that's going to get done?
For many years, so we know like lots of people of the community and we definitely be working in that area.
You see that, although recommendation I would give so, the business owner is just make sure you put signage or hiring local and that you have developed some sort of flier that you distribute amongst the community because there's gonna be a certain need for employment after this pandemic.
Now my question is more around and the reason I'm here is because I would like to have a dialogue with the licensing committee as the chair of a business development on how we're gonna move to truly tackle this issue of racism.
You know we're looking at situations like defunding the police, just because of that represents, but also have to be able to step up as community members to hold each other accountable, so I'm interested in knowing what would you say or potentially how would you seek to combat any sort of discrimination as a new business owner, uptown?
Okay, so I mean being an immigrant I, have like no discrimination at all for any kind of race or religion or anything, and even if it's an employee or customer, we everybody's welcome.
I, don't know if that answer your question yeah sure so I'll keep in contact with receiver, because I want to be able to work hand in hand with him on this, but I just want you to let you know, welcome I, know, you're doing an investment in Washington, Heights and Dyckman, and about discrimination and race be tolerated in Washington, Heights and we'll look.
The idea is not to punish just a business but sure that we come together as a community, and we have the same approach that we can not discriminate against anyone for anything and we're going to be very vigilant because I think that any time that we collect one small, regardless how small the issue might be, can become big and we're going to address it right away and very harshly so again.
This is past my community, that you put a sign, adjuster Domingo, indicated to hire local, because I think this is going to be a good.
You're right, yeah, I, just want to I just wanted to touch on something that kind of began last meeting where it was the first zoom meeting and our format that we've been sexually successfully fought for many years that kept these very disciplined very focused and everybody got to speak sequentially as we spoke I'd like to get back to that.
If you don't mind I kind of like to say what our format is and what the format has been and it gives space for everybody and time for everybody but sequentially and it respects an order and it you know that way, we move forward and it's not a four-hour meeting so typically for the past number of years, and we could always change it, but that would be under new business at the end.
It precinct speaks right after that, the applicant after that, it's the committee members on the committee.
We started changing the meeting where we allow the merchants to speak first, but before we could do that, yeah purchase for in the present residents or members committee members, so I see no Thiele Marilla neglected are not calling you time.
I just had a question about the application that was put forth and is there a time that it becomes like that we would get to see it that it becomes more public I hear you see that are reading off some of the information that's on it, but I was just wondering if there was a time that I would be able to review it, or this information is given to the committee members for them to review it.
But if you need to have access to that, you can always I check the staff and they'll be more than happy, because this very well I'm going to also now recognize a Jerry : Jerry minutes getting back to the actual business.
Again, we closed shut, what's gonna happen, I mean I was not related to the old business there, but we definitely open to listen to the community and we could make those practice well.
There was a lot okay, so if I were you, I will check back with them about the great things that this place used to do for the community, and hopefully you could, you know, attach summaries.
The district office refused to give me the information about different applicants prior to the meeting after and the minutes and I'm sure Rosie did like the best she could, but she was probably it was not informed that she had to provide more information in the minutes.
So right now, I, don't know when we get to the general meeting, I'm, not sure exactly what I'm voting on, because I don't have full information.
As far as the minutes are concerned, you know we have our own different, unique styles, I'm gonna work with Rosie, but do take into account that, because of the pandemic, everything was thrown off I'm, not giving out excuses, but I think that the substance of meetings that has taken place- and they will continue to do that as far as staff- not providing documentation to the rest of the memberships.
Okay on the record so committee members, any issues are: do we want to provide some steps?
Stick there was product by the Wingo who is the chair, the common community, because again it's good that we work together, because Domingo Yukimi will be more of an extra leverage, because now I can put any more pressure in making sure their businesses do bind by the principles that they are assigned to, which would be to hire local and easy little and I think one important thing.
So, what's a Tony mind, so please write down this stipulations is because they're going to be requests that you get to assign them not erase them and send them back later on to other community board.
Yes, very well, Dana we're going to request that we have a good neighbor sign posted, so the patrons that would not stay outside I mean our quarantine.
Yes, based on these four stipulations, does the rest of the committee for your comforter to move forward, or should we add some more steps come to the forward saying that let's move forward unless the photo is our I did the item above our number six I give our please start at about zero.
Six, yes, is one abstention, so that you're not get passes process at 6:01, community and I hope you guys prosper.
Are you going to give that to me so that it's signed by my client or do I make one up on that so check right to the staff or the community board?
If they'll be okay with the committee members and the residents attend, the item number two is flora deep, and this is every new one officer, concepción I, don't know lieutenant young so lieutenant.
I see non-record Ysidro, somebody from Cisco actually was asking for the NYPD verbatim, so the NYPD do we have any updates on those who were involved in that shooting I know that this was not the location specifically if I'm not mistaken, but yeah.
Okay with the location I know that any a representative from attended either number three in the house.
It's actually its own has been the person running the location, the entire time, but she has a partner Jose who's like 75 or 78, so the co zayday's coming out and Sonia is just gonna.
Was that asked a question in the Q&A I said your panelists, but he said that he's a new board members.
You should be do because usually I will only trust myself and only the vice president vice chair, the committee to see those notice have been posted because I'm not going to take anyone's word now that I do not trust you, but because, if there isn't an error, those reasons are going to get blamed and I want to make sure that we have to write accommodation for that recall, I always took pictures and I always showed it to you guys.
You know this is what I say in the beginning, because we are virtual things we'll miss it just point it out: that's all I'm, not blaming anyone yeah here we know that it's just attempted, but I just think it was a mishap, though you know, but the committee member brought it up and then you know in APIs, as committee members, you have every single right to rectify a problem that you see if you see that I'm wrong, if you're, free and reach out- and let me know right away- no problem with that, but I wanna make sure that this is clear.
Guys I think that, for this particular applicant same as the one before I had to ask that'll be a signage to hire local it once they open and I.
I was just giving reference to different restaurants locations, but this one once open will also have a sign posted on the front door for hiring locally, very well committee members, any other recommendations, guys all right.
For the three days, - officer, Pena, wish you the very best and I and I know I know many people feel that have been on this committee for many years residents showing up that care as much as you guys do, and the effort that you made in terms of getting great information was made out of an interest for the community and of concern so that people can sleep at night and live in peace and that businesses can thrive.
This is a meeting and I just want to let everyone know that I spent three hours going over the video now, if I missed something I apologize, but you guys can give me suggestions, I'm, always open to it, but don't tell me what to do and how to do it.
Yes, absolutely was not judgment by anyway, I'm, sorry, if it was sound this way, but I know for a fact that it took three over three years to get to the minutes.
Maybe you've always done that I, don't know, but I think that that's a great way of making this a really like a community board and not just some sort of like approval process- is that there are commitments that people make I.
Think just the way you ask questions about where people live, where they've done business I think that kind of commitment to the neighborhood's I think is what's going to make the community stronger, especially after pivot, so that was really nice to see Thank You Mariela and you know it's a new member.
How documents will be you know, kind to the community, so all of that was fine-tuned thanks to the effort from both our art and OSI and was what I was saying so also recall that the minutes will usually be up to gobis right in the minutes, the format, the questionnaire.
That's consistent, so that everybody feels when they step into their space, whether it's the applicant, the precinct many members residents and others electeds and then committee votes that everybody really feels that they had their time in their space and everybody gets to see and feel more comfortable with so I just wanted to say that's why I said that earlier it was not in response to any blast me of that, maybe was just you know.
Member first of all, I want to echo my dnr sentiments and in regards to making sure that we prioritize, like our local businesses, commitment to the community.
I have sat through community board meetings that have gone on for four and five hours, so it like really it's something to applaud that the fact that we were able to move so effectively and efficiently this time around.
What helps here is that between the committee members and myself, most of you have grown up in this community, and you know this place inside out.
We will at the same time we will get to know issues that are affecting the clients and emergent, and we will always bring that up because we want to be a very transparent community.
Trust me, the members and the rest of you will come to this million dollars now, but angel and really you know, welcome you guys- can now always check with the president of the board to see Jenna be part of this committee.
So I, don't know if you guys want us, art like I, can send people emails to try to brainstorm or ideas, and then that way we presented in September and how we can go about that.
