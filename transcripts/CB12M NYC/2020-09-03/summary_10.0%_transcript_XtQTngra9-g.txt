You know trying to get as much resolutions do as possible, and you know I want to make sure that you know, while things are still very, you know, uncertain right now for the community, the city at large, what's going to be happening with regards to many of the services that we depend on throughout our community, we're having a bit more of a kind of a broader discussion than what we've already had these past few months between march to june.
just you know our membership that has been with us for years, but it's, I think, another level now to say thank you to the new members who have decided to join throughout all that's been going on and find ways to try and be even more active in the community in ways in which they have already been previously.
You know even past that previous experience of three years working here in the community, with the tenants and with that I want to pass along to oc.
That is the reason why I remain on this board so that work can be done, but I have done advocacy in this community for over a decade, probably two decades in the areas of housing, human services, education, criminal justice.
, I'm the first vice president of the indictment resident association, duly elected representatives to NYCHA, for the residents of dyckman houses, brought me to the committee Basically, that's a collection function, so one of my subordinates might be going to knocking on your door coming to the store and trying to resolve your tax issue and welcome everybody and glad to see that everybody's back and healthy and let's have a productive, dr beer.
, what the research they've been finding is showing about really the rate of homelessness throughout new york city, and you know, I think, that for my own goals this year, I want to ensure that we have the opportunity to really actually interact with some of the homeless service, homeless, shelter providers, because they are probably dealing with really just a huge influx of families either, because some of the very recent I'll call them loopholes that exist that have caused families to get vacated, whether it be because I'm not sure if people have been following new york, one they've been talking about vacate orders just from landlords refusing to actually make repairs throughout this time period that you know it's an unfortunate circumstance that that's a kind of way in which landlords are essentially forcing families out, and you know.
You know the pandemic and we're being a little bit more responsive to the needs of those that particularly are in these kind of home housing situations that really are just not decent and are not livable circumstances and with that I'll pass along.
For instance, the committee had the intention on reviewing what was happening with dhcr, to bring dhcr to a point, to put forward a resolution to make dhcr more accountable to the community to tenants so that there would be visibility about information related to when people's tenants rights right most of what is happening in dhcr is weighted on the side of the landlord.
previously now it's 50 for people who are fleeing their countries to come here So again, those are some of the ideas that I have, but I think that also what we need to be working on is the structure within this board so that the work that we do is not in vain and so that we are taking the positions on behalf of our community, that we should be.
I'm kind of questioning: how is it possible that the office doesn't forward resolutions to the government officials, as they should well see that that issue is one in a stack of many, not only my own personal experience, but also people in the community have come to me to express certain concerns they have when they make requests to the office that the office is responsible to do also having been a member of the executive committee, there are things like that have taken in executive that the office has dropped the ball on as well as far as making a complaint.
Despite my asking questions about it and what one of the primary things the primary responses was to send it back to committee and we almost redeliberated it Of course, they're still part of the function of the board, but I do want to just try and make sure that we're sticking to the agenda item in the capacity just to bring up many of these concerns, You know I can imagine that there's a few different issues that, whether the board members the public committee want to raise Okay, just my one point that I would like to raise and is the I would like to pass a resolution at some point, after speaking to a professional in the field about the 100 000 apartments.
So, as long as I am on the housing committee, this is my goal to pass a resolution in support of such initiative and Could you actually give a little bit more detail about really what this program focuses on, so this program is focused on giving a homeless people an apartment and pay for the rent and give them an opportunity to live in a house in a home that and then that program is also attached to some social services like helping them.
it's a program that include different things: to lift people up from the street to become you know, to have a house to feel like you know, most of all of us so, and I feel from what I heard and what I read that it's a very successful program, and I think this is something that we should push to have here in new york city, which we don't have.
How, when we have programs, like you, know giving people an actual home to live in that they're, providing the supportive services?
What has rather, what has not been in their own community for some time, so you know, I think that that's one of the areas that in which we do even within housing human services, we do need to discuss a bit more.
so, for instance, you know on let's say the next meeting we are going to invite a service to rider that focuses on the shelters that are within the community board or a community district right.
This is something that the committee might have already addressed in the past year or two, but I am sort of involved with the northern Manhattan community land trust- But let's think creatively right now, as far as like, affordable housing and thinking of long-term solutions and bringing that conversation, especially as we're now facing the the 2021 elections, are right around the corner, we're going to see major changes as who's representing us at all levels of government here in new york city-wide.
and I think for many years we've known and heard from people in our communities about applying for affordable housing How sometimes people who seem to have just applied, maybe the previous month get you know an apartment before someone else, that's been on the list for many years I mean, I know that there are priority levels, and sometimes that may be the reason, but there's also seemingly internally within housing, but also within the shelter system, where preference is given to some and not others, and I think that that's something that we should be looking at, so that there's equity in that regard and so that we're serving people properly NYCHA, rent overcharges, specifically for those whose income has changed, is another issue.
The impact of real estate tax programs on the housing stock where affordable housing is concerned, we've talked about 421a previously in the past, and other programs like it, but there's still issues that exist in those areas that I think this committee should be looking at.
I'm probably going to draw a blank on accurate naming right now at this moment, but the intention there now that the resolution has gone forward to the elected officials was to build a coalition of the institutions in our community who serve the those who are immigrants to make sure that there's a across-the-board cohesive plan ideas and supports for that community, and it goes also hand in hand with the work that you did last year or before we left session ariel in regards to the impact on immigrants as well.
At this point the so where homeless is concerned, I feel like we talk about homeless wholesome, but I think that we need to kind of drill down and look at the different ways that homelessness manifests.
When I was on the education committee, I had gone to a a conference at the new school where they spoke about school homelessness and, at the time, the committee, the ed committee for this board, thought that there it didn't exist in our district and in fact, when I pushed for more inquiry where that's concerned, we found that to not be true, I'm interested to know what is the status of that right now, because for at least one school in our city, there was like 50 of the kids in the one school were homeless, and it also goes into the area of the gerrymandering that happens where education is concerned.
We were supposed to continue that this past year the 15 wage, how that impacts, people's eligibility for hra programs, because it's great that people can have more income, but it's putting some people into a situation of hardship because they may have been receiving food stamps cash assistance, rent assistance and now that 15 wage increase makes them ineligible, and and I think that we maybe need to address how hra's qualifying them for those benefits the community land trust.
So I think that those are things that need to be looked at, but also that impacts those people in their housing as well.
Yes, okay, I'm very concerned about what's going to happen once these high-rise buildings get built and the landlords get 3 500 4 000 a month in rent and other landlords in the neighborhood figure out that they could be getting the same amount of money in rent and start paying people to move out of their rental units or harass them out, and I'm wondering if the committee has any plans for how to go about addressing those situations when they arise.
What happens in each individual committee is that, like I was mentioning before, is that when these items are essentially suggested by their committee members, the individual committees, they go back and they pretty much vote to find out, which ones will come in a certain ranking, and I think this is kind of bringing back to my good old times of ranked choice.
I can't remember all the agencies at this point, but I want to say hpd I think our former committee chair would be upset at me for not knowing the full report of us to what's happened there, but they've had a lot of work done.
but you know, as the committee discusses this, it tends to kind of push up, maybe some new items every year, or We had been focused on one of the concerns that was brought up previously with the homeless shelters, particularly not necessarily serving individuals that weren't identifying with a specific gender right and because of the very nuanced way in which dhs might work.
Sometimes it creates a barrier for some individuals seeking service, and so one of the items that we suggested last year as an expense was really putting forward more programming within what was the dwdc shelter that had been specifically set up for youth that perhaps might have left their homes recently, given the kind of environment they were in coming either whether it be coming out to their families as part of the lgbtq plus community, or perhaps you know not, you know not necessarily conforming to a certain identity, and I think that was an item that was just a huge concern at the time, for I think myself and aisha, given that there was a report that had come out of one of the committees I apologize.
But it's another example of how work that is done by this board is not followed up on, because in fact those people were out of their apartments almost 10 years, with the right of return with nothing being done on those buildings, and it took all this time for anything to even start.
That being said, I think we should be also seeing what the board voted for what the committee proposed as well like what the final vote was for those items, as well as the the city's report when they returned it to us stating what was funded and what wasn't and how the city is going to handle funding of those matters or not.
Ultimately, what happens with you know, you're, seeing those individual priority items on this sheet here, like let's say for the first item, 40 you're, seeing three one, two: zero one that none of us none of us are going to be touching- We as committee members right here.
Okay, I'm really hoping that this committee and the board can help the people in our building who are really suffering and experiencing a lot of problems because of community options.
What I ultimately hope for is that the board would be willing to reconsider the previous resolution that it made six years ago, approving community options to have the two units in our building, because now we have six years of documented experience showing that this has not been a good situation for any of the parties involved, that something really has to be done to change it, and I'm hoping that if we had an opportunity to present to you why it has become such a burden, whether that be in a small meeting next month through this committee, whatever you would recommend that, after we presented that information, that you then would be willing to have an open hearing or something where we could ask for a different resolution to be passed six years after the first one, sorry I'll, let sally go first members.
Well, does anyone have any response to where you know we might be able to go within this community board with our problem and we might get a resolution on the issue.
But what I wanted to point out to you is that, with a little bit of research, I found out that six years ago, in 2014 community board 11, which I believe is just south of ours, was also had a building.
just it's, not the people, it's really more, the environment, plus the total lack of supervision, and I will say that community options has been placed on early alert they own and operate 11 group homes throughout the five boroughs of new york city, but opwd early alert is like probation and basically means they're not doing a good job, but opwdd is not transparent at all.
Oh, if I might, I think what the committee should be doing is looking at any status from opwdd, and maybe this is an opportunity to address some of the issues that you're posing in regards to how opd is communicating with the buildings in which some of these organizations are placed and providing services, I understand you do, but I understand that you could have some sort of persuasive value if you were able to have a resolution What I'm saying is that we may be limited in the types of resolution we can put forward as we are in normal, like what is the room that we have to put a new resolution in regards to this matter is my is a question that I have.
I'm sorry I got interrupted just say what you, if it's a concern of what that kind of you know it falls out of the lines of what we do as a community board right, That's also very active in the community who came by and talked about issues in our building right when there's individual cases like that It's not to what there's the public policy regarding people with mental health problems.
An example of that is when we vote on the eulip process in this regard for opwdd, we community boards are a part of that process of when a unit is going to be proposed or a building that is in relation to the rights of people with disabilities to have housing.
That was built a few years later and, as I said, people are experiencing first-time home ownership, and you know it's bringing life to the neighborhood, I mean you put down flowers on the outside someone from a resident from community options, pulled them out and destroyed them, so it's just become.
So I think the community should have a state- and you know one of the things in the resolution that you guys did pass six years ago.
So I don't think there is any connection, and you know at the time community options said: , yeah we'll do it no problem, but they do not take people who have some connection to washington heights.
So you know, I do think that it can be helpful for the organization to try and you know, definitely improve upon its services, and I think that's where we come in with really bringing forward a resolution that talks about those issues right.
