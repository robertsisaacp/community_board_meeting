You know at least with some thoughts out of my head, but you know: isidro is involved with a lot of different business organizations in the community and I think- The one question about the re: it's a good idea to do it jointly with the business development committee, but they've already met this month, so it pushes this back.
You know the resolution, the letter, you know the concept I think mary should read out what she's drafted so that we have some idea of what we're voting on I can do that, so I started out with, whereas covet 19 created a hardship for everyone causing businesses to close, whereas when businesses were allowed to reopen, restrictions were put in place for everyone's safety masks, social distancing, limited number of people inside etc, whereas these restrictions created unusually long lines of people waiting to enter grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, post offices, etc, whereas seniors and disabled are unable to wait or stand for an unusually long period of time in lines, creating a severe hardship on them being able to meet their needs, whereas priority for entry to these businesses need to be given to seniors and disabled.
I was writing this in the park yesterday, when I was sitting in the park that was perfect, The only thing I would think is perhaps instead of skip, you might say something like be prioritized to enter first or something , I was just gonna say that I think it sounds better to say that seniors and disabled people be given priority in the line.
The first question, on my mind, is okay, which is the closest center that we have I've heard about this one, I think, is on port washington on 163rd, but I'm right, Maybe if I could get a listing and maybe especially my building, I don't think that we're very familiar with that, and maybe I could put up a flyer and just letting people know no idea.
Coming to the aging committee, I mean, I think the issue of technology is just an across-the-board issue and even in terms of the senior centers and people being able to connect to virtual programs, you know one of one of our members mentioned a tablet to me How can we get devices to seniors and how can we, you know, offer ways and help people learn how to use the devices, so I would say, there's a another approach, so I think that one is an important one that I am working on in several ways, but the other approach is making the phone more usable.
Okay and many are confined to their rooms because of the Covid-19 You know if people have magazines or books to contribute or anything that you think that the seniors might use, or if anybody wants to make a contribution.
Number four increase funding for transportation for seniors by restoring prior budget cuts to expand access and outreach number five increase access and outreach to healthy food programs for seniors with medical and health related needs number six increase funding for naturally occurring retirement communities or multi-family housing.
For instance, people involved with isabella they're wondering if, because you know no, because isabel is the one that's running those right- The one at fort george hill is funded by the state and the one at river, terrace and 169th street are funded by the city, so it has to do also with what cuts might happen from whom and the resource center carol ben at the resource center or whoever is in georgia now is actually overseeing all three.
then number five increase access to out and outreach to healthy food programs for seniors with medical and health related needs, for how was that the food distribution and whatever is going because I know that my was eliminated, so I'm not giving food anymore.
You know as their priority needs for those centers and that population I'm happy to call today The real question for us as a committee would be if we want that food issue to be higher up in our expense request, because that's sort of where we can weigh in I or it was it all about health.
You think before mental health, meaning even if you could maybe right, because in other words this is something that's across the board.
It's tough, all right so back to increase access and outreach to healthy food programs for seniors with medical and health related issues.
I have a whole bunch of applications and since the senior centers are not open, I just don't know how to reach those people.
Yes, the northern Manhattan agenda, as a group has decided on september 17th as voter registration drive day and our three senior centers nimik is going to have a table out in front of its facility on wadsworth and 175th cloth, dwdc they're doing something, I'm concerned about the homebound, not the people who are walking on the street, and you know up and down broadway and san nicolas avenue.
So if you give me a list of people that you want absentee ballots dropped off to, we can make that happen with transportation one day I mean the last monday, the numbers of people that we you know we helped to fill out essentials.
So where I mean I'm trying to reach out to anybody that I know my point is like I would take a step back saying we're concerned about getting seniors to be able to vote so there are different pockets, those that are in the senior centers that are connected to a senior center.
