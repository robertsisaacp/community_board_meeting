So I like to again I'm extremely humbled and happy to share this platform with so many well-intentioned people, people who really and truly care about their community people who are willing and able to give up their time and effort and energy to make sure that we that we coming to a civil understanding as to how to bring city agencies the police department to come and sit down and discuss some of the issues that that are affecting us directly and again.
I'd like to also say before I pass the baton to steve simon will be introducing the panelists that when we come and unite as one we can do wonders, and I'm sure that all of you were participant and mindful of what the rebel scooter issue had been happening in our community in our voice and in the letter and the push by congressman esparya helped our wonders.
They will be followed by christian klosner, the executive director of the mayor's office of special enforcement geraldine kelpin, the director for air noise policy and enforcement for the department of environmental protection, deputy inspector benny mccants, the director of city-wide operations for the parks enforcement patrol, emily goldman, the deputy director of beta nyc and last, but certainly not least, dr arlene bronzaft, a long-time board member of grow, nyc, formerly known as the council on the environment and recognized for years.
We then moved up our hearing, and I might I I did send something late today, but I guess it didn't make its way to you, but I'm sure there'll be a plenty of opportunity for you to provide input as we get to the public session, and I certainly appreciate your participation sure you're, very welcome the deputy inspector andrea good afternoon, everybody pete andrea 34 precinct.
I got a little bit of an understanding that it might be about some noise complaints, but I'm just going to go over the status and the state of the the 3-4 precinct currently and some of the things we're experiencing currently a 3-4 precinct, focusing on major crimes and violent crimes.
We're actually doing very well compared to the stuff that you see going around the city we've been able to make sure that that kind of environment did not foster itself here in the 3-4 currently overall crime, in for the year-to-date in three poor priests and is down about eight eight percent 653 versus 7-eleven this time this year.
You know just just hang around for a few minutes and see see if that anyone's bothering them make sure they do what they got to do and then they leave- and I think, that's kind of helping us deter a lot of the robberies and bring our numbers down.
People are, you know, breaking into the lobby, stealing the packages again like I said it's just the residents and the communities our eyes and ears.
People are just jumping in taking off we're in the highway, so a lot of people going over to the bronx to jersey, and I think that's the three major crimes for the 3-3 as far as shootings were down for the year four compared to five last year, so we were doing really really good this year compared to last year again thanks to community thanks to the ncos and our sectors and precinct people working together all right.
Captain christian klausner from the office of special enforcement- and I guess I should mention- although you probably will that your office has a special role to play and is of special interest in our community, because you're monitoring the the the restaurants and bars right now in during this covert 19 period.
Not only were we assigned to deal with reopening around restaurants and bars, but in phased reopening in general, including all kinds of retail, any basically any place that wasn't allowed to be open and now is our office fields, complaints and coordinates with a number of different agencies across the city to get out and look at the conditions on the ground and make sure that as businesses reopen they're doing it in a way that's safe for both the community, the customers, the workers and the business itself.
The the main thing that we did was set up a 311 complaint line, and so residents of this community board should know that you can go to the 311 website or you can call 311 and make complaints about businesses that are are opening, but not in compliance with guidelines.
We have people from all different agencies, department of health department of buildings, fire deputy sheriff's office and department of sanitation, department, environmental protection, but the key point is that the city is going to respond and make sure that the place is operating in compliance.
We are definitely seeing that as restaurants open up that they can draw crowds, we're we're seeing two different permutations, we're seeing restaurants that are breaking the rules and we're also seeing restaurants that are following the rules, but large crowds are gathering outside and we have a sense that that's ongoing in this community board and we're making sure the resources are available to look into it.
Yes, okay, I wasn't sure if I was still muted or not yeah, so I have been with cep for 35 years now, but we'll put that aside for the moment and let's talk about noise, the noise code and some of the issues that we're seeing, especially with so many people having to stay home and probably an increased sensitivity to normal.
Should we need police backup, so I took a look at the the complaint types that were coming in from community board 12.
I think because so many people are within their dwelling units that the ice cream truck guys play so that people know that they're outside and maybe come out and you know buy from the truck it's a it's a difficult time for them, because they've lost a lot of street business.
We probably should make clear that that maybe most of the complaints that people have had in the community lately involving the late night parties and fireworks and cars racing up and down the streets- those probably don't go to you.
Our next speaker is emily goldman, the deputy director for beta nyc and she has been analyzing and cataloging the three one one complaints generated from our community and just yesterday she works in association with the borough president's office, and just yesterday the borough president's office released a report showing the various statistics broken down by community board and, and there are like five different categories of noise complaints- I'm hoping emily can run through this for us hi everyone thanks for having me yeah, so I work for beta nyc.
One complaints broken down in like in numerous different ways that are actually specially tailored for community board purposes.
The other thing to keep in mind is that the new york city, open data platform itself right now and the 311 data specifically is experiencing some lags, and that is due to like the unprecedented volume of three-on-one complaints coming through relating to the kovid situation and also the fact that that 3-1-1 workers are are working remotely, so you may notice some lags.
I could check real quick if, if need be, but different types of noise complaints, the main agencies that deal with noise complaints are the nypd dep, and I think also like edc- has a couple of categories of noise complaints that go to them, but the majority of them go to the new york police department, but there are really are like, like almost a dozen different types of noise, complaints, noise, commercial noise, residential noise street sidewalk, just building construction, construction, noise, noise at places of worship, helicopter noise and then within each of those categories, there's subcategories so, depending on what exactly you want to look at, you want to be aware of those distinctions so that you can get your get your data in the most sort of relevant way to what you yourself are looking at and mainly today.
There were at least five noise categories that must have been, maybe in that top 10 tier of complaints generated by people here in board, 12 yeah, so in board 12, I'm looking quickly at what aldrin bonilla came up with he, he just plugged this into boardstat and basically for the year 2020 for specifically for community board 12.
So that probably accounts for why that complaint type is the sixth highest in community ward 12 over this past year of 2020, followed by illegal parking, unsanitary conditions, water issues and then finally is is: is noise commercial and I think the interesting thing to notice about that is that noise, commercial is often one of the the highest complaint types of the fact that it's substantially less than noise street sidewalk noise, residential noise, vehicle non-emergency police matter and illegal fireworks even is clearly representing the fact that commercial businesses have been mostly shut down.
So, yes, so that that's just a quick sample of the top complaint types in community board 12 this past year, there's a lot of different ways.
We could cut this data, but that's kind of the most the most overview way we have of looking at it, and I said- and if I'm not mistaken, the number of street and the noise street sidewalk complaint category.
Dr arlene bronzaft a board member for grow nyc used to be known as the council on the environment and she she probably launched her career in inwood, working on behalf of the students at ps98, in a groundbreaking study where she found that the students who had classrooms on the side of the building closest to the elevated subway tracks were suffering because their lessons were continually disrupted by the noise from the subway and the people on the other.
So as far as I'm concerned, there are generations of students at ps98 and in the community as a whole that owe dr bronzeff a huge debt of gratitude and we're so happy that she has continued a role in this issue and has agreed to help us once again, dr bronze left, I hope, you're still there, hello doctor, I see her, I think you're a mute doctor, she's, muted, steve, all right doctor.
I worked with the ta and they said they would ameliorate the noise at schools similarly located near tracks, but people also live near the tracks, and so the ta agreed to start quieting the tracks with the procedures that were developed in inwood, we came up with solutions.
This is 2020 and the covert situation has added another element, but I strongly believe that what we're talking about particularly 18 000 complaints about sidewalk noise, but I think if the people got together as they did, then they would be able to come up with a solution.
It is a health issue when we talk about noise and we know that people need their sleep their rest.
I think the people in the community now the police, department, dp and all the members of the board can very well do what we did all those years ago.
The problems that you've addressed tonight are similar to the ones I've heard from people in south brooklyn from the bronx from other parts of manhattan, and so again you could sort of lead the way by coming up with recommendations of trying to lessen the din and recognize it's difficult.
I understand the stress of coed coven, but I think that we can, if we work together, come up with solutions that will reduce the level of sound in the community and improve the health and the quality of life.
Okay, that's it all right looks like we have a lot of people in in the chat who want to be able to speak is somebody keeping track of of the names yeah jonathan?
Yes, okay, great first of all, I I want to to thank dr arlene bronzaf for that wonderful presentation and to steve simon for hosting this forum today.
What's gonna happen next, we we need to think about how we're going to hold each other accountable for addressing these issues, because I can say that I have been reaching out to people elected everybody about this issue begging for help, and I would like to know what is how we're going to address it, and I I would propose that we think about starting a task force, and that would help us to move forward to address this.
But I think that we need to find a way to not just talk about it tonight and then it just goes away, but that we actually have a mechanism in place in order to like make sure that we are addressing these specific issues and in really targeting solutions for different issues and that that task force, you know, can be made up of other people a lot of people here, as well as of the community members who are directly impacted by it.
There was a stripper, a naked stripper that actually performed in our community around a bunch of guys, and this is what the community had to look at, and I just thought that everybody here if this is what the community had to endure, everybody here should see it and have to see what we go through, and so you know I just want to to pitch that and say that we should think about how we're going to be accountable, because I've been very disappointed in the response to what we've been enduring here, and I know I've been fighting as a community board member for years about this issue.
All in be all on having the community board deal with this issue, and I expect the committee that I chair, which you're a member of, will continue to look into this and act on this issue.
He had a haitian kind of sick accent, I'm not really sure his name, so I apologize for not knowing his name, so he was talking about culture in our community and I got very offended.
I don't see nobody giving out tickets double parking, all the bad things that can make you hate this community I've seen so I like to know what are we going to do from this moment on to get this fixed as a community we're ready to work, and I hope the 30, the 34 present community board 12 is ready to work.
I see people here looking a little bored right now, but we really need to get it done because we live here.
I hear how everybody's feeling- and I think it it's important- to move beyond just understanding that this issue goes beyond a lot of us.
You understand this is nothing new, but I think what the times have is teaching us is that we have to go beyond just looking to be well a lot of these issues when you involve police- and you involve a lot of these different agencies- they disproportionately impact people of color.
What I think is and- and I think tanya raises a good point with the whole developing a task force for this- is how do we go beyond just thinking of what we think when we think public safety and start holding people accountable, but we also have to look at the stats for what they are.
You know, but what I would say is, let's think, outside of the box and let's start thinking of ways of being able to redefine public safety where disproportionately people of color are not going to be impacted, because some people don't understand intersectionality.
Okay, let's move on to the next one, the next one is wendy life wendy you wanna, do live all right, go ahead, hello, I'm speaking for the residents of chittenden avenue, which is for the 34th precinct, and we have had problems even before the covet of people parking on our street and hanging out and become unbearable and unlivable.
We've been working with officer brian poster, who was our neighborhood precinct contact person no help at all and what's been happening, is that now people have come, they take their chairs out of the back of their car.
We are desperately in need of street parking, so change the sign on the west side of chittenden avenue to let the residents legally park and that way we would get rid of the problem of people coming hanging out, and I mean we have all kinds of things you're talking about strippers.
We did an intel report on it and we're waiting to hear a response, but it it also needs a little push from other people in the community right, not just the police department, so any help along anybody in this forum.
We must also understand that when we go to our local restaurants and bars to spend our local money we're helping small businesses, if you see a problem, address it right and then with the management address right there and then, because you want to be part of the solution, you want to be part of the process, so I'm willing to work out with people that want to form a task force, and I think it's really a cool idea to do that, but really grateful for the work that nypd is doing all along.
I also agree with what isidro just said in relation to some of the commercial activity and with the trucks and things like that, but I want to speak to the fact that some of this board's actions also contributes to some of the dynamics.
I'm not really sure why, but it's like being in the middle of some type of drill, with with an extremely loud alarm blaring through the community, I'm not sure who they're trying to reach with that, because I would assume if the alarm is going off, that there should also be a quiet system that they are able to alert the police.
There are communities that actually have fireworks celebrations right and I'm I'm looking at the people in my community, some who are just like.
Yes, okay, so I'm in I'm actually in the 33rd precinct and last last saturday night there was a party along until four o'clock in the morning when, finally, after I would say, 20 calls to the switchboard at the 33rd and 311 complaints, most of the people were closed as unfounded or not necessary.
I mean that's my that's my layman's assumption of all of us all right yeah, please one more thing that we were talking about the subway noise in front of the train in front of the schools the subway still has to run.
That being said, do you have any examples of cities that are doing it correctly through either zoning or you know, task force where we do come together and we can figure these things out like do you have any examples of any cities that are doing that that we can learn from and and try to apply, dr arlene you're on news?
Yes, okay, I'd like to talk to the crime issue, because I have written papers on crime and noise and you're.
The second thing, let me tell you new york city, is quite good when it comes to the noise issue, because it has served as a leader in the past to other cities as to what you can do to lessen noise, and I think the people who have spoken have come up with excellent suggestions.
However, if he is not, let's get creative there's a ton of do-gooders in our city that have plenty of money that they come in here and create programs to give people opportunities, because the reason why this is happening is because people are unemployed, they don't have jobs, they don't have places to go and they don't have other things to do, and so, if we do not provide opportunities for these individuals, we're going to continue to see the same problem.
If we I understand that the city budget and the state budget is terrible at this moment, however, there are opportunities for public and private partnerships where we can bring in these do-gooders, come in and create create programs, job opportunities for people in this community all right.
I think that, and I'm it's taken me all of this meeting to calm down, because this is a psychological issue, as the doctors rightly said, and it is a form of violence perpetuated on the residents of this neighborhood with the level of noise and what happens here.
I've lived here, like I said, a long time and what I think one of the causes are as to why people flock to this part of the city to do whatever they want to do is also linked with a permissiveness see the businesses in our area that serve alcohol and that had a club-like atmosphere have repeatedly broken their licensing agreements over time, and that also includes the issue with la marina and la marina was closed down.
If you talk to long-term residents who live all throughout the neighborhood, this is something that's been going on for quite a few years and covid made it worse and yes for people like me, who've been unemployed for four and a half months, there's very little that I feel that I'm left able to take psychologically, but also to the frontline workers that are my neighbors.
They don't want to be on this call because they don't see the point we feel fundamentally let down by our elected by the police and by the community board and I'm one of those people that believes wholeheartedly in divesting funds from the police into community resources and groups.
We have gone many phone calls in the last in during covet time, but also throughout the years in washington heights, about noise, affecting students with autism noise, affecting students with adhd them, not getting sleep having to react to fireworks outside having to react to the parties happening all day all night.
I can only imagine how this noise pollution, how the parties, how the intensive group gatherings that I've seen all over my neighborhood are going to affect my students and I'm speaking in a very passionately way, because my kids are being affected like they literally cannot sleep.
If I remember I think, steve simon last week at the committee of the whole, I'm not sure if he had said that out of all the coded deaths in new york city, there was something like 900 and somewhat people in this area that died of covet, and you know, given everything that new york city went through.
Children's hospital and three blocks from my house is columbia: okay, the emergency room and the pardon the hospital and every single night, and sometimes, during the day, I'm hearing people blasting their car stereos that my windows are actually shaking and I live on low floor.
I know thank you for calling detective stahl like two weeks ago, so I think that's really important that you kind of build a relationship with the police department and the community affairs officer, the ncos.
Great so just call just call us and we will send a sector car or the nc all over okay, so who's whose responsibility is it to enforce when they're, seeing large groups of people like partying now and everything else whose responsibility is that?
The concern is that people are gathering without masks is that they are also doing so in a disruptive way and that and that the police department still is being tasked with addressing the underlying conditions of the loud disruptive behavior, and so you know, I strongly suggest that people take advantage of the resource that was just offered all right.
The only politician that has responded to our area has been gilberto, so I say to you: when you're sitting here, having this meeting and you're listening to a lot of things coming your way, you need to be problem, solvers!
We want that kiosk shut down and if you guys aren't going to do it, the community will do it because we're not getting any help from anybody in this community, and I feel sorry for so many people who have complained tonight because their problems are not resolved, but I appreciate you at least you're listening.
In the middle night, we come to the community board with complaints, petitions, everything and nobody's listening to us, our local college politicians the same thing so all right to you is we don't need to.
Some enforcing of the illegal activities of you know summons, and things like that that happen, and also I just want to bring up one thing with the parks, because there's these elaborate parties that have been going on that I know is so stressful for any of the parks.
Silly string, I mean that's just part of the noise and then but, like I said we're here, to help we're gonna keep keep the task force going, and I can actually give you a little taste of some of our fireworks.
I've had 9-1-1 callers worried about my safety when I called they thought I was being shot at, and I just want you to know that and thank you so much we're here to help and make sure none of this happens in the coming months.
Cb12 has 15 times the noise complaints of some other community boards.
We've worked with our precincts here in the bronx and you know they have helped us, deter the noise by actually patrolling the streets, making sure they're, giving summons and taking speakers away, and I know recently they've been working with the 34th.
So I just want to give thanks to 34th as well, because they've been closing streets down on 9th avenue, which is where most of the noise that gets the bronx get hurt.
I think it's the best solution just to just get back on that and take away, because this will help deter most of these people from coming and, like many have mentioned before, we have license plates.
The biggest problem we're having now is we're getting pushback we're getting people out in the street that want to challenge officers and and and try to get them on videotape, taking a proactive approach to things where they may have to end up, locking a person up, and so the officers have to be very careful on how they approach every situation, because we want to continue to foster a good relationship with the community by still addressing the the noise complaints and the quality of life conditions.
I will sit down my sol and try to come up with a more precise plan, maybe to help to to zone in on 193 and say nick, but I assure you, we've cleaned up a lot of other growing conditions, as one of the gentlemen was saying, I believe is mr king, from from across the river and cedar avenue, cedar route used to be a location in the bronx where it looked like the fast and furious that was going to go happen in front of behind g dubs.
First of all, I want to actually echo what chairperson bueno said at the beginning of the meeting, which is that we're all in this together and I really appreciate the opportunity of being able to come together to meet with all of you and to have met so many of my neighbors in the past, while so to introduce myself on may 17th, I founded thinking it was going to be a very small thing.
I know the song, but you know that I'm just saying from 1 to 3 30 a.m. It wasn't possible to sleep, and so because we have 600 people in this group and we'd all like to work together and find some solutions.
We've created a list of some ideas and if it's possible we'd like to know where we can direct all those ideas and work with you together in this task force, I'm sorry to interrupt claudia, we're at three minutes 30 seconds all right, but if you can, if you can, in the questions, chat, put up a link to your facebook page and any other url you'd like to direct people to because I think you were doing that in the end, but we we do have to hurry this up.
Jonathan well, actually we'll have like 15 people right yeah.
Definitely look at the community board schedule when we're back in session and you we can talk about this all the time right.
I think that we need to look at what we can do collectively to communicate with our neighbors, how to be respectful of other people's rights regarding a quality of life issues that impact them.
We understand that the only way to make an impact is by funding programming in our community, but at the end of the day, this is about going out and finding the solutions, and I look forward to doing that with you all and continuing the conversation.
I go to a lot with community boards, as you know, and I really want to congratulate you- the chair, the chair of the health committee and all the members who spoke, how you treated the wonderful way in which you treated the public and how everybody got to speak.
They listen and try to come up in a non-judgmental way with solutions, and I think one of the other issues- and I want to thank beta nyc because their data is important, and I want to thank the chair for inviting them.
Some way, I also want to say I get confused and I'm supposed to know this who's doing what in terms of city agencies, and I have great respect for the work that christian is doing on the special enforcement.
I also live in southern washington heights, as I think many of you know on 163rd street, where we've had a lot of challenges with noise so far this summer, and this is a problem that we all have to work together to solve.
This is something being done successfully in other parts of the country, not in new york city, but it's an important way to ensure that that limited spaces in our community are not taken up by folks coming from elsewhere, and I think it might have a secondary benefit of helping to alleviate some of the problems that are described here, and you know in in the context in which we're all extremely sensitive to the need to avoid any kind of overly aggressive enforcement, particularly on young people of color.
There are enforcement options we have at our disposal that are unique to going after the vehicles and and I'd like to work with you in in my capacity as a council member and chair of the health committee, to do that and and lastly, I know the royal president and others- and I really believe in data transparency, and I don't think we quite resolve the questions around calls to 3-1-1 and the way in which those are being cleared very quickly.
