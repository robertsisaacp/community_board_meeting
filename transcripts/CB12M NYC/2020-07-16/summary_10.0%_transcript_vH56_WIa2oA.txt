So all of this could contribute to that particular segment of the population, seeing an increase in positive cases, but what we really want to make sure people are aware of is to maintain the core four, which is stay home if you're sick, maintain social distancing whenever possible, you know pretty much always wear face covering in public if you can't maintain social distancing and wash your hands frequently.
Have you do you have any data on where those cases are coming from, because I can tell you at our open street on dikeman, it's a super spreader event every day, so yeah right.
I appreciate that any other questions- steve yeah, ms barna, yes, hi, tanya- hold off for a moment- oh sure, but paola.
She has he's on now, yeah he's on okay, very good, all right tanya, I'm sorry go ahead.
Yes, I actually, I saw a question in the box that said someone asked claudia asks: has anyone considered whether the uptick in positive cases in 20 to 29 year olds has anything to do with fireworks and motorcycle parties?
So maybe I don't know paul pauline if you wanted to address that, so I don't believe we have any specific data as to what could be causing this uptick right now.
You know, but we have heard that there have been a lot of gatherings where fireworks have been used and other things I haven't heard about this motorcycle situation, but you know any time where people are gathered in large crowds, not practicing social distancing and not wearing the proper face coverings can all potentially be contributing to this uptick.
So while I don't have that specific information, this information about these parties and fireworks and gatherings, is it's something you can call into 3-1-1 and have the mayor's office of special enforcement send out people like if you know, there's a particular party that happens every single night or every single saturday at a particular time.
I think that would be really helpful to let the mayor's office know so they can send out folks to either hand out face masks or you know, do some education break up some parties again.
We don't really want to be sending nypd out to these situations at this point, but I think it's really important that people still understand that covid19 is still a concern and we don't want to go backwards and start closing things down again, like other states have had to do well.
I'd say what we have in this community are: are people who are just hanging out on the streets at night having their own little parties and not wearing masks, and you know they bring out their beach chairs or whatever, and they just sit on the sidewalk and they stay out all night long.
I mean it wouldn't hurt to let them know- and I know the mayor's community affairs unit has also expressed that if communities are seeing particular issues and concerns that they should be notified as well, so I am thinking that they would potentially send out inspectors from various agencies to come out and see what's happening with regards to any restaurants and the open, dining stuff.
I think the governor just announced, because he's very concerned as well that there's a three strikes in your closed rule, so if they are notified of a particular establishment that is not following any of the guidelines, and you know, inspectors are sent out three times and they're found to be in violation there.
I don't know how specific they can get geographically speaking yeah I mean it might still be a little bit early, but I'm pretty sure they have preliminary data as to what zip codes they're seeing more of a uptick in positive cases, so yeah, I think it wouldn't hurt to reach out to h test and trace to see what their, what they're recording pauline.
I wonder if it makes sense for department of health and mental hygiene to have a direct conversation with department of transportation and the mayor's office of special enforcement, so that at that level you can actually address those problems and reiterate what the regulations are.
We can always call and complain, but I haven't heard of one successful open street open restaurant- it's just not working, it's not being enforced, and if we talk to our police they say well, people can't have mass on because they're eating- and it's you know it's not just that.
Absolutely, I think city hall is very well aware of the situation where people are gathering- and you know, restaurants are not following the rules, and I think now the governor is very concerned too.
It was more about educating folks and not trying to find them right away because, of course, they've been out of business for a while, and we didn't want to be punitive towards them, but I think now that they've had a chance to really understand what's happening.
It seems like there was this time period where businesses were allowed to keep their establishments and kind of operate, as you know, in an effort to get their businesses and make some money after being out of work for such a long time.
That was a great example of what the possibilities are, but my concern is: we have the grace period, for you know for several almost a month now right and then now we're saying the three strikes, I'm not sure if waiting three times for the infraction is the right approach.
That was the point I was trying to make earlier that that I think a part of this problem is the people just hanging out on the streets having their own late night parties outside their buildings.
You know bringing out chairs and just hanging around on the sidewalks and here's the thing steve what they said to what you know the police show up right, they say: well, we give these people some, we give them some, you know a summons or whatever, but then they're right back doing it there's no way to like stop people from doing this.
You know for to people like, as curtis was saying, keep allowing people to keep doing it again and doing it again and again and there's no penalty, then what I think there needs to be some type of penalty.
Nypd is not enforcing for discussing, and you know I think that there's a lack of enforcement happening right now in the community and it is concerning so I do agree with tanya.
That's right, but I mean you know if a complaint is filed and I don't believe that the police are the right people to enforce it anyway, I'm trying to get them out of the business of import of them right all right, maybe we're closing out complaints as soon as they're filed yeah.
You're gonna talk about an initiative they're working on in terms of providing increased mental health services to the northern manhattan area, so harold and linda I'm just going to turn it over to you.
It has affected every single citizen in our community in all kinds of ways, not just the added stress that they experience, but the grief that families have had to deal with the impact of unemployment, the impact of the exacerbation of existing mental health and addiction problems that has gone on, and it has had a significant component that is affecting not only sort of people getting hit by the virus and families, but it's affecting everybody, young and old, of all stripes, and it's also laid bare.
Not just the tremendous exist existing needs for behavioral health in the community, but also the significant disparities that are faced by different populations that have been traditionally underserved, and so that's really called our attention to figuring out how to deal with some of these issues.
Obviously, the advances in telemedicine, telemental healthcare, using technology in different ways and also the way in which people have begun to think of ways that specifically, are dealing with some of the unique stresses that come up in the context of they come up in the context of a pandemic like this.
What could we think about in terms of proposing to try to make things better and try to deal with the both the existing behavioral health needs that are facing our community and disparities that exist, but also to address the impact of covet 19 itself?
We want to support the existing community based network and social care network and organizations in the community, but also as we do this- to serve as kind of a local and national model for how to address behavioral health needs.
So what we put together is a composite of six different ideas that are all kind of linked and integrated, but are based upon sort of our experiences and some of the tools and and resources that we've, you know, think that are needed for this area.
The past several months had a huge impact on the on the mental well-being of our healthcare workers and, as a result, we developed a very innovative approach to try to deal with some of those issues that we've called coke columbia and I'll come back to that in a bit and linda will also sort of expand on that number two.
We think that an important element of a strategy to respond to these needs is also to build linkages and support with existing licensed behavioral health facilities in the community.
Number three is that we also want to make sure that there's linkages to existing community-based organizations that are providing primarily social services, because many people who come through, who have these social service needs, are significantly affected by behavioral health problems and that are exacerbated by the pandemic number.
Many of the of the primary care providers in the community see what's going on in terms of mental health, stress, depression, anxiety, increased substance use and they need additional support so to think about how we can advance integrated primary care and behavioral health care with local primary care providers.
People in the community lay people in the community and train them in providing behavioral health services, providing supervision for that, integrating them into these other four components and then, finally, we want to do this in a way we can continually assess how we're doing continuously improve the work that comes out of these initiatives and really make it a sort of national example of a learning health system and community partnership model.
You have community-based organizations that have their own boards that have been providing services, including the fqhcs that are sitting right on the screen in front of me this morning and that do a really good job.
Then you have the services that actually the state runs and pays for you know our washington heights community services and inpatient unit, and then we have new york presbyterian and everybody tries hard.
Everybody does good things and there are always some new and innovative programs, but for the average person, including myself, when we go to find care, we often can't, even though these services exist- and one of the things we'd like to do by bringing these organizations together in a more robust manner, is make no door the wrong door so that there would be actual referrals between them sharing of information and really it would appear seamless, and it would be a seamless experience for the families living in the community from the elderly really to young people.
We expect in the coming months, but they're not going to put their arms around this particular community and say we can work together, better everybody always wants to, but it's hard to do.
I think the other thing is the community organizations, including the churches in the community, are a great source of information and comfort, particularly with the grief that people are dealing with, and I think again, the state plans are making some online resources available to them and all the citizens in new york state.
What we'd like to do is make psychiatric consultation available to them, as they do screenings and identify people from the faculty at columbia and do that virtually because a lot of treatment is now going on virtually and in addition to that, take this behavioral health core that we're discussing and train them really to be care managers.
One of the things I'm personally very passionate about is that the behavioral health core, which are community members, have a career path and I've seen it done in other places where people are able to move on then to college, to professional degrees, to nursing and really you know to gain the on hands-on experience and we would help them along that career path.
You know colombia is a big piece of that community and I think we have to be good neighbors and give support where we can and so we're very excited about the possibility of doing more and being an even better resource.
Some of it could be billable in insurance, but we're just at a beginning stage, and so what we may need from you is help as the city and the state look towards funding, they're gonna get to deal with covet 19 that some of it be allocated to the you know, projects we've described.
Well, when people start having to be indoors, will we see you know a real spike and you know how much can people tolerate most people will do okay with just a little support and help, but when you look at people, my age actually and the kind of high-risk groups, you know people who have comorbid physical illnesses, people over 60, I mean you have people in the community who will get increasingly frightened if this happens in the fall and there's another spike, and I think we have to be there for them all right.
Well, I think I'm not going too far out on a limb by saying that the community board would welcome the opportunity to work with you to make this a reality.
Oh, I try not to use lingo, but you know we always fall back into our league, though all right- and actually I am hoping that that we can establish some cooperative arrangement between you and and the ryan health center.
I'm going to have the ryan helsing to make a presentation next, so maybe you guys can hang around for it by the way we also, I mean you know, we we've laid out kind of an outline of what we think makes sense, but we definitely want to engage the community in further refining that all right, very good.
I know queens has been very heavily hit and I was in elmhurst recently at elmhurst, the city hospital and they really were devastated at one point: we're not looking at that right now, but it doesn't mean that couldn't happen.
You should definitely be talking to all right because I would like to see them get more involved in our community, and maybe this is one way to bring them in and and certainly this is a definitely an organization that has years of expertise, I'm sorry decades of expertise dealing with mental health issues.
My concern is that in the new york presbyterian system it looks like we're down now 80 beds, so well, I wonder how we're going to address the needs of the seriously mentally ill, both in our neighborhood, with the failure to reopen- I guess alan, but also what's going on at brooklyn methodist and while I think this is a great need.
Well, I'm you know, I can't speak to any of the inpatient facilities in terms of the new york presbyterian, but certainly we would not be excluding people with serious mental illness.
So if people like health care workers can't sleep that takes an enormous toll on their mental health, can some of you speak to that in terms of what's been happening in our community?
I just think if there's a way to communicate to the community board, so we can get that information out, because there are resources that our community isn't aware of in terms of health, especially for ptsd y'all are doing a lot of good work in that area.
I you know we have people right now suffering our community because of this these issues.
One of the things that we can do is reach out to our school of public health, because this is one area where we can partner with them to work with the board on addressing this, and this is something that we've done in the past and we can connect the right people at our school of public health to work with you on this yeah.
That will give a complete answer to you, but I will say that for the committee to aggressively freight and to the share of the environmental department and I'm sure that we have a lot of interest to come back with if they don't know the answer, I have to say: let's look into the issue all right, all right, that's a good suggestion.
It looks like fern has a question, and then we can yeah all right.
All right, fern go ahead: you're, muted, fern, okay, thanks, oh yeah!
I you know, I see a correlation with public safety also as we talk about public health as we talk about public safety as a and the issues that we are facing now with noise pollution uptick in crime uptick in you know things like the uses of fireworks.
Obviously you know I have had experience with research and I do think that there could be a correlation between some of these byproducts of covet with some of the things we see in the community right now, and if we can make a case to say that well, these are also symptoms of cobit they're, not they're, not separated from covet right.
It doesn't make it right, but there's a lot of there's a lot of things that are happening in the community as a byproduct of our quarantine, our confinement, our mental instabilities and our complete, you know disregard for others.
You know right now, so I do think that, as we dive deeper into this conversation of researching the impact of covet and the health additional health disparities, not just people of color dying at a higher rate than others, but looking at the disparities with their with the mental instabilities and the traumatic experiences that it has been has caused.
So people in our community people in our community are welcome to hang out on the street, but there are limits when it comes to affecting how other people can can he can survive in their own apartments and enjoy the use of their apartments daryl yeah, just from the chat line also, I just wanted to mention a few things that were said recently, someone pointing out another intersection at 204 and post avenue where that's been a problem.
Well, I'm hoping that we'll have an opportunity to sit down with you with a on some other occasion and with you and ms rosenberg, dr lantigua, with ross with sandra and go into further detail about the program and help you perhaps flesh it out and make it happen, and certainly if, if you're submitting applications for funding, let us know if we can provide any letters of support or do anything we can to be helpful thanks so much we really appreciate it all right.
We are pretty excited about the site that we're going to be opening up in september before I go in I'd like to give a little background on ryan health, and before I do that, I know it was a question a minute ago.
Is a right, not a privilege- and this was first articulated by congressman william f ryan, who obviously we are named after and we live that every day and that goes back to every person that comes into the center needs to be treated with respect and dignity, and it doesn't matter race whether what kind of whether they have insurance or not, they should be treated with that dignity and respect that we all deserve.
Two years ago we conducted an external needs assessment because we were, we are in expansion mode, and we said you know we and we wanted to be go further north into manhattan, and the needs assessment found that the greatest need was in the washington heights in the inward area.
We've actually talked to all the elected officials staff about how we can how we can be in the community and helping out and hopefully we'll get some feedback, and you know- and then we can.
You know, as I said, be in the community as far as the family planning we right now, our family planning largest site is down in the upper west side.
That you know can provide those services, we're gonna, we're gonna be and sam mentioned earlier same thing: with specialists, we're gonna evaluate what the needs are and then, if the needs is for a certain specialty- and maybe it's one or two days a week, that's what we're going to be.
I just wanted to know if you are planning any special services for the older adults in the community betty.
So they know I work at isabella, which is 191st street and audubon avenue, and we provide a number of services in the community for older adults.
I know you're planning on a as doing a survey, but I'm wondering if you have anything at least from the start along those lines, yeah actually two things.
We also are gonna, have a social worker at the site so that we will be able to provide some behavioral health services and again, as we see what the needs are, the community that or- and it sounds like from the presentation we heard earlier- that may be a significant need that we- and actually you know, brought that up to us with assembly woman.
Yes, that's our plan steve, and we definitely want the community board to be present and we would definitely appreciate any help that the community board can provide in spreading the word about the opening of the center right.
There was no balcony, no all right, but let me tell you something: well, you know by the time I was around in that neighborhood.
Yes, thank you and appreciate your meetings and if presbyterian doesn't sign that backup agreement, let us know oh and our next, our next natalie.
I just wanted to reiterate the women, the single women's shelter on audubon right there and the ps132 about a block from where you are setting up your shop now, which is a community renewal school that is high, need for both the students and the families there, also where I started my distinguished education back in 1970, so so please, it's a great neighborhood welcome count on us for support.
Presbyterian hospital, the director of community affairs, julio batista, thank you, steve, I'd like to also echoes natalie's sentiment there and welcome the ryan senator to washington heights.
I believe, because you know a lot of people get the flu and think they're.
You know they have coveted, so it is, it is going to be quite interesting time come the fall, so one of the things that I want to present here and I'm sorry if some of you already saw this is really we prove produce an a very brief close to four minute educational video around the use of telemedicine, telehealth and the reason we want to show it is because you know there's you know as we wanted people not to enter the hospital.
So if you bear with me for a second, I want to be able to just show that, to you tell me one more time: what was the parade that in which the acn had a double its normal intake, so that was that was from march 1st through may 31st, okay yeah.
If you want, you can stop the video and kind of like relaunch it and see if it gets you an option, because if we can hear you through the laptop, then it has to be your video, like the actual vimeo, has to be shooted, because we can hear you okay, I don't know if you are able to see it there yeah you can see.
If we come here, we can hear you yeah okay, so what I'll do is I'll share the video with everyone and I'll also make sure that you know we'll send the english and spanish versions, just in case you wanna with some others.
We can try to show it again in september sure- and I think you know the purpose of really was to generate start- that discussion around it.
So we will be more than happy to have dr mingus come to the september meeting and provide a little more information around telehealth, and what are we doing around encouraging people to actually use it all right, all right, so we'll mark that down for september as well sure- and my and my apologies- I don't not don't know what happened.
What were you were able to get some of the statistics that I requested or not well right now, in terms of kovit, you know, then, the stats that we have is really within our hospital up in northern mahan, which allen tony and, of course, the hospital we do have 4 74 inpatient covet currently, so those numbers are, you know, continuing to go down, so that's the number that we have right now is 74 patients 74 in tony milstein, and up at allen correct, that's a combination of all three right: yeah, okay, all righty steve.
A lot of those barriers were lowered, thus enabling the growth of telemedicine- and I think, that's one area where we're not going back from the you know.
If the patient happens to be in pennsylvania during the telemedicine visit that doctor can be accused of practicing without a license in pennsylvania, even though the doctor never set foot in pennsylvania, so what's one of the great you know sort of regulatory challenges that we need?
You know just getting ready, there's a second surge, so there is no to monster to this point, to be able to put that psych unit back to what it was in the near future until we figure out what's going to happen in the future with corvette, and what is it?
But I heard you guys talking about you know the nurses moving to gracie square yeah.
Well: okay, as long as we have the two of you on board at this point, betty I'm gonna push you off for another few minutes, so alana and chris, do you have anything more that you wanted to tell us about the situation with the allen psych unit and also julia's on the call?
Psychiatry with 30 beds is slowly trended down because one they couldn't find doctors to provide coverage and that's the reason why they kind of downgrade from 30 down to 22 and slowly I mean nobody wants to work at a place that you know, nyp is trying to close, so they've been having hard time hiring doctors, I feel so.
You know little to no income they're homeless, they have medicaid, they live in the underserved areas, so they need that support and mental health services.
We want to help our people as much as we can definitely, but they said we'll come back in may they promise us may we'll come back to allen hospital we'll take care of our patients.
So we don't get to know about that like we, don't really hear much about that, but so keep that in mind and then keep in mind that the psychiatric units that are open are going to be at three-fourths or half capacity.
What's going on yeah all right, I so steve.
We've started reaching out to our elected officials who are covering their presbyterian, and actually we already had a virtual visit with senator jackson and today, right before we got on this meeting, I received the letter that we requested from senator jackson's office, demanding it's a letter to new york, presbyterian that they've delivered to new york presbyterian and it's demanding to open the allen psych unit which, with the same concerns that we have, and if I may just share the screen, I wanted I actually emailed it to you.
I think we have the basis for doing our own to doing a follow-up letter ourselves steve I just wanted to let you know.
Can you hear me I just want to let you know that senator jackson's representative is actually in the other part in attendees.
I don't know that dr colwin is is going to be somebody who can be easily persuaded on this question and I think the state needs to realize the ramifications of that executive order.
We discharged over 700 people a year and, of course, part of safe discharge planning is to give them a safe discharge plan back into the community, but those you know there are some people who come back, but for the most part that gives you an idea of how many people, our small unit, helps every year right.
Yes yeah, but it says it said we had 23 questions, that's right!
Yes. This year was worse, but I think when you, this stuff has been building up and building up and allowing to be this way for a long time for those of us who live on certain parts of this community.
Okay, the group is, is called wahi and inwood for respectful decibel levels, wahi and inwood for respectable, respectful decibel levels, and I can't because I can't share anything in the chat or anything so I'm gonna yeah people will have to just find us that way, but yeah and I had a question for you from me because I know where I live.
Can we let some of the people who are on the community like tell their own experiences, because I can't speak for everybody?
Can we open up and unmute people, so they can talk absolutely so I mean I don't know how to do that, but we should do that.
Oh so I can give people permission to talk yeah like, for instance, you can say six nine, four, the number ending in six nine, four, I'm gonna give you permission to talk now, and so you hit allowed to talk and that person- oh okay, I see user 694.
Actually, I don't know, what's going to be done about the noise in this community, but it's just really out of control, and this is something that we all said over and over and over and over and over again, where are the elected officials common de la rosa, the donnie rodriguez, when they want to go in somebody's pocket to get money?
Where are these people where and what is the community board going to do to help us?
How are they going to help us why they are not on this call, that's what I like to know all right.
You know I sent him to curtis and he was like this huge long list and finally, I got in touch with the nco and he was pretty cool, but he told me there's only certain amount of stuff that they're allowed to do and I think it's ridiculous they're I mean it's even a coveted hazard.
If I could just say to you to one of your earlier points too, and just so people know this, there are members of the board.
It is an absolute disgrace to see that you know our elected officials twice within two weeks were able to have press conferences on dickman to promote the open streets, but then they were nowhere to be found to advocate for the community under this condition that when that has gone on and it's still going on in certain areas, I'm hearing over at inwood hill park on that end and people are still being terrorized not to the same extent, but it's still happening.
I think a lot of people are thinking about votes for the future and they're not trying to piss people off they're like oh, you know we're gonna, just let this go because I'm to need their votes in about a year.
Now this community cannot be you know, put in the trash, because you want to appease people whose votes you think you're going to need for your next upward mobile, climbing of your on the political ladder that needs to be dealt with.
You know those people who are out there until three four in the morning said or fireworks.
I don't want to wait for them to come up with something, so my suggestion would be that when we reconvene in september we do a resolution, which is the way our community board transacts business, and we send a resolution to the mayor and to all the elected officials saying that they must come up with a strategy for next year that deals with this problem.
So I know that this has come up before, but steve is right.
There was one with fireworks too yeah the councilmember, the council, member, that I previously worked for stan michaels, actually passed a law declaring a noise-free zone around isabella or around nursing homes in general, having additional fines for noise violations around nursing homes, but in this particular situation did do you know whether isabella called upon the police to deal with any of these fireworks issues which probably were occurring right outside your building?
Yeah very good point now I do want to make this a joint resolution of as many committees as as would be relevant in order to make sure we line up enough support within the board.
They might get me you know like yeah.
What so you know I want them to be accountable and actually, instead of telling me this is sparkle, and I will say people who say it's part of culture you're.
You know so all they have to do is enforce the laws yeah, but it's still about political will right exactly if there's not a consensus in this board of 50 people who represent this community, then there's not a consensus and we're talking to each other, but it isn't going to make change.
The change happens with the political will of the majority of us wanting the same thing, and we just don't know if that's entirely true, I would suggest including traffic and transportation and aging in this conversation, because the signage is traffic and transportation for sure that's absolutely right.
Oh yeah, definitely good point there and also isn't this a an issue that the public advocate might want to absolutely, since nobody is doing anything, maybe we should reach out to them, I'm all about who's going to be responsive if you're not going to be responsive to your own community.
I don't see any reason why members of the public wouldn't be able to shouldn't should be able to call into that meeting as well and voice their opinions on this question, and I would encourage people to do that, and you know I think someone else said too.
That needs to be checked with the board office because unless they're going to have you know the meeting, it is in the calendar.
I do know yeah, I think it's on.
I I'm not sure if this was addressed before I was out for a moment, but it was just going back to noise and you know the political will for enforcing it.
Right now I mean that's like almost the number one question facing new york city at the moment.
Well, I don't know I would like to see the cameras used to stop the people from bringing in the fireworks from out of state.
We didn't have this huge fireworks issue, but- and I you know you know- maybe this is one thing we need to go back to, but with the cameras specifically, I think it's there's also a a budget issue like it's a capital, the capital request.
