She had mentioned that she wanted to try and present previously and discuss a little bit more about inclusive communication within the human services field, and so of course, I reached out to her this past month and made sure that we schedule some time so that she could present to us a little bit more about inclusive communication in the human services view.
I think this well, not that I think this can go on for as in any way, people can be included for various different reasons, and so here are just five guidelines that I've set up for us, at least as a committee, that I think that we should at least adopt as community agreements, because I think they're important in the field that we're particularly focusing on and just in general and everyday discourse.
So our five guidelines are stay consistent with people first language, so using nouns before we use adjectives using active and positive language, so avoiding victimization and always putting a positive instead of a negative connotation using universal language, so avoiding idioms and ensuring that we're speaking play language using gender neutral language and not assuming individuals pronouns.
A lot of individuals were mentioned were referring to individuals that live on the street as homeless peoples or people that are domestic victims of domestic violence, and I think that, if we're going to be having conversations- and our aim is to help these populations- that we should be make sure to be centering their humanity and make sure that we're talking about them in the most respectful and appropriate way.
Another thing that I think is important for us to know is instead of saying poor person unfortunate or less fortunate people, we should say a person that is experiencing economic disadvantage or a financial hardship, a person experiencing poverty or a person living before the poverty line.
So now I'm going to move on to the second of the guidelines, which is use, active and positive language, so we should avoid using phrases like suffers from a victim of because it assumes that individuals are suffering or identifies as a victim and when we're having these conversations, we don't necessarily know that everyone, that is a survivor of domestic violence or a person that is living with hiv or a person living with some disease, necessarily identifies as suffering or that they're a victim of it.
So I think that we need to be mindful and very cautious about the way we talk about these things, because again, if we're trying to help this population, we need to center their humanity and make sure we're being as inclusive as possible, so avoiding language that connotates pity and trying to use the active voice when speaking about things that happen to or are done to, individuals.
I mean, instead of using this person, with rate to be in a battered by we want to say that x person did this thing to this person right, so we're using the active tense and not necessarily putting individual like making describing things in a passive manner.
Something else that I wanted that I didn't include here, but I did want to bring up, is the idea of a person like hiv positive person again, if we're practicing the people first, we want to say a person living with hiv and not necessarily suffering with a person that is living with diabetes, a person that is living with, but dealing with obesity right and these things that don't add negative connotations to the circumstances that individuals find themselves in third guideline is using universal language.
This one is not something that's like regularly brought up, and I think it's something that I really wanted to bring up because of how much how charged language is and how important it is for us to be mindful of the things that we are saying and the connotations that they're associated with.
So it's just like a rule of thumb on what I said is our rule of thumb, for this slide is secrets and coded language don't make friends and the reason I say that is because if we speak in idioms or jargon or acronyms, we exclude people that may not necessarily be experts or like well informed about the conversations that or like the fields that we're having conversations about.
I think that, because it's so dis dissociated from its original meaning that no one really knows where it comes from, but the term actually is rooted in the fact that in the early 20th century, black people were forced to sit in a balcony that was often referred to as the peanut gallery or the n-word gallery.
So I just want us to be mindful of the way that our language is coded and the words that we choose the idioms that we choose, even if we're going to speak figuratively, just being mindful of how we're communicating and ensuring that we're not excluding certain populations.
The reason I included this is because I often find members not necessarily from our committee, but I know definitely from the larger on board, referring to the chair as a chairman, and I think that if we should move away from that language, because not all people prescribe to the gender binary right- and this is the rule of thumb for this slide- it's not everyone identifies as female or male, and we need to respect that.
I just try to repeat non-gendered language in my head five times so that I know like when I'm going to say this.
Neither of the two chairman and chairwoman, just chair they're, our chair, they're, leading us, and then I've included the congress, like the elected representatives wording, because I think it's often very relevant to the work that we do and we're in constant communication with these offices.
You should just ask I'm in the habit of introducing myself and ensuring that I state my pronouns, which are hers, but I think that it's really important for us to discuss pronouns, because for many people this is a relatively new phenomenon and they're not comfortable with the concept of pronouns or they're, not necessarily comfortable, but they're, not used to it and they're, not very aware or in the practice of using pronouns or asking about pronouns regularly.
We should become familiar with, but I think we should definitely at the very least know that pronouns relate to a person's gender identity, particularly how they want to be addressed when they're not being spoken to when they're being spoken to or about without their name being used.
Given you the permission to do that, I also want to know which I haven't included here, that a person's pronouns can change whenever they decide that they are changing right and you're.
So this is just the end of it again like I said it was really brave, and I just wanted everyone to know that practicing inclusive language is only the beginning of an inclusive environment right.
There's body language, there's behavior, there's making space for people that are less fortunate or people that are more impacted than us and just ensuring that we're creating spaces where everyone feels comfortable having conversations and contributing to conversation or not, if that's what they decide to do without making them feel like they have to right, and so I wanted to focus on inclusive language, because I feel like in the time of search of coven 19 and having virtual conversations.
I think that this is also a great presentation to be done at the general meeting for the purpose of put furthering a possible resolution, but also so that we are informing not only our full board but our community.
Amazon doesn't do good in a lot of areas, but seemingly in the tech environment, they're very, very much progressive in making sure that everyone feels accepted and that there are safe spaces for all types of people, and I, for that was the first person that I saw it done so like it was so immersed in the practices and also in the discussions and meetings that we had that.
The last thing that I want to speak to is exercising this type of spirit, not only in the words that we use, but also in our practices that in this board, specifically that there be safe spaces for people to express themselves about all things, and I honestly personally, don't feel that I have, I feel, very often targeted in different ways, and I've also seen it happen to other people over the years.
I've been on this board for seven years, so I would like to also see this same type of spirit exercise in practice in general, and not just related to these things that we talked about in this presentation last.
The reason why I included that last slide about languages from the beginning to inclusivity is because I feel like there are a lot of issues specifically and I'm going to be explicit about this racial issues that are going on in the board and gender issues that occur and confrontations that happen or spaces that aren't necessarily comfortable for certain people, certain races or certain genders, and I think, that's problematic.
The reason I focused on the things that I did focus is just to be specific to the committee that we're on and like the language that we use regularly, but I do think that, if given the opportunity to make this, like a resolution and present to the board, I do want to include things that are relevant, more relevant or more specific to race and gender expression, because I feel, like those are the most common types of tensions that exist throughout the world.
I am not an expert at all, but I definitely think that if you all have any questions or want to have a conversation or talk about a time where, like I used to share with you that you misgendered or you were misgendered and how that made, you feel I think these are important conversations to have so that we're normalizing these things right.
I just wanna also make note that one I'd like to try and get this sort of presentation to be shared with really the entire board, and so I guess this also kind of leads into a question of well aisha.
I know that there is an lgbtq task force, which I am kind of part of, not sure, because it's relatively new- and I definitely would like to consult the task force about this presentation before I do it and possibly make it a collaborative effort to ensure that all everything that we decide needs to be talked about.
But I also think that just like whatever they decide right, because I am not, I don't identify as a trans person, but there may be someone that does and doesn't feel included.
Otherwise, actually you can you can take it away again, but no, I was just gonna say I think partnering with lgbt is actually the best that makes sense, but the second, the second part as far I just wanted to know other committee members thoughts as far as implementing what exists, for instance, in city council, in the assembly, et cetera, but as far as crediting people who bring ideas to the board as sponsors is done in any other.
What I was actually going to say is that I would, I would even want to go further because we discussed really just the opportunity of providing for a by loss, task force right, and I think that there's been quite a bit of discussion about what we'd like to try and set up, as I guess just a more inclusive environment, but also in structure in terms of what could be included in our own bylaws for every member to receive upon starting service.
I think that you know like yes.
The resolution, of course, is still out of the word of you know things that we're following, but I think that it also says a lot if we're putting it in the bylaws for every single member that might join in the coming.
And, of course, I think that, if you know you have the opportunity kind of like manisha was saying to really go back to talk to the individuals that would be on lgbt task force and maybe even try and start to study what other boards are doing in terms of their own inclusive language.
I think that it might be beneficial as well to have included in a potential amendment are bruce and oc still there yeah, I'm here, I'm here, I'm just I'm just really not clear as to are we voting on a resolution right now or naisha is going to take it to the task force for discussion and then bring the resolution from the task force yeah.
You know I generally just wish that we will have now the future opportunity to present to the board and use really what you've already put forward before us, we'll continue, potentially making changes where possible in a potential amendment.
We're going to share the presentation with in our community thread on now, so you all can feel free to share with whoever and if you're, not a committee, member and you'd like the live sent to you, can just write, drop your information in the chat box and I'll make sure that you do as well.
You know you, I think, also, if so, if people don't so again, just like reiterating parts of my presentation, if people don't feel comfortable speaking, we should also allow them to stand in their silence and feel I'm sorry so hi everyone for those who I haven't met.
So I think we were all just discussing here that, of course we're supportive of trying to have this being brought forward before the entire board yeah.
I think that, right now, what we're looking to do is give a bit more time, because now nice shoes mentioned that she'd like to try and go back to the lgbt task force and also potentially discuss do a bit more research on terms that you would also like to add into the presentation currently yeah.
I find myself in the same position since I joined legal aid last year I have gone through several of these type of trainings about you know, prop proper use of pronouns about the type of language we're using and how we could be more inclusive, and it's made a huge difference in my relationship with people in my understanding of communities that are different than I am so based on my few interactions with the board with the general board.
Okay, so hearing none right now, it has been referred to specifically the budget and revenue committing so just check the individual actions by clicking on this little tab here right so that seven or so yeah and below you'll see now a summary establishes a billionaire mark to market tax, taxing residents with one billion dollars or more in net assets and directs revenue from such tax into a worker bailout fund establishes a worker bailout program providing workers traditionally excluded from wage protection programs access to unemployment benefits, I'm glad they do so I'll, just begin scrolling on down.
So you know really, it would be to move to say the very least: it's not going to take a total fall this bill and potentially yes, but there's also the potential to bring back another session even during this the summer months, whether that happens right I leave up.
You know that we're already here in our own committee talking about individual issues right, there's this an assembly counterpart and do you want to do a reso about them?
Actually I'm, assuming that some of the what we discussed in april was it in the resolution regarding coronavirus and you know making sure that people that are affected get benefits and things of that nature.
In addition, although this is more so the language being specific to your workers, I think it also falls in line with trying to make sure that we're providing resources for those that are in need.
I think that have definitely been huge advocates in discussions of trying to ensure that there's equal opportunities being made and available for those that are identifying as they're not having a certain status or, specifically, you know, being documented.
I think that those individuals, visual institutions have tried to try and you know, pull together whatever resources are available to make a recommendation based on the data that they could find because, right now you don't have to be a resident of the state or even a legal resident to pay taxes.
If you take the time, hopefully a little bit later, you'll see there's a number of other bills right that are just being loaded here, but I just want to just try and focus on the excluded worker fund.
The booking institute was highlighting their own data that they had been collecting themselves and really fine making the argument that you know the current restrictions in place on unemployment insurance are failing, many working-class individuals and even scott stringer's supporter, I think, really hurt too much, but I think that there there's ample amounts of data that could add to much of the discussion already being had, and I just highlighted some main things here.
Yes and again, I just want to also highlight the new york post, also kind of yeah, just hitting at a what was just being mentioned prior.
If you want it, please don't spam me and ask what's on the links, so little emails about all the money that was left to you by a strange family member that you never know about, because I don't [Laughter] okay.
Oh sorry, we're documents, so I'm just going to pull up a word document, pretty much very items that now I was mentioning before in one moment me again, just language that I pulled from countless documents right that was shared in the previous month.
So, but I don't I'll see if I find anything, that's more specific to our district yeah I mean, but I I'd of course you know be happy to take in any language that would add to the things here.
Like you know you go to the website and it just starts playing okay, so I am going to switch now back to jared all right.
But if I ask for money, they're going to question me speaking to like he's in need now other people because of his status, and there is the feed that anyone.
Look, it's fine, so I think it's all important information we may just want to put an asterisk next to things that are more background, information which the board can be told what that is so that if that comes up as a concern, we will know like what can be.
You know in the actual paragraph, but if you put a little like a, I don't know a star or something or even a number, and just on the bottom put the source of where you took the data from yeah, and I think that should also become a part of our general practice across the board for the board that we're using standard practices for citations.
Perhaps we can maybe include where you know when we're sending over the resolution once passed to let's say the governor's office that gets sent with it right.
I know not a committee member, yet I'm wondering whether saying how poor non-citizens are is necessarily useful to this resolution.
So I think that in mentioning how the difference is between a non-citizen and that of someone who has permanent, you know permanent residency as it's labeled, it's really just getting out where the need is, but if you know, of course, if that's language that we'd like to take out I'm happy to do so, I think if we knew when the status of them being liquid acid poor is derived like, is that now it do in this during this pandemic, then that brings it home in the way that okay, well they over time they pay this amount of taxes.
This is this, isn't so maybe then it might be beneficial to say, then, I'm just curious, because if we're concerned about helping undocumented immigrants because of the impact of covet right and my concern really about what their status was before like how liquid poor, like okay, to use the words here that how poor they were prior to covet, are we just concerned more about like if you're making the case you're saying hey these people contribute a lot.
I err on the side of keeping it specifically, because I know that there are people that will argue against how appropriate it this is, and maybe not from our community but others, and so I feel like the fact that they can get this money back, speaks to the need to uplift that community, who have these disadvantages of being liquid acid poor, for instance, and the poverty rate, and that's so that's that, for me, is the why that is part of the.
What did you say just changing it from the word undocumented to make consistent with the second third sentence and what I think might be beneficial because of the additional language here in the first line: okay, foreign, I'm dropping the link web street from the new yorker.
Okay, yeah, like you know, we can use some of those individuals.
It'll echo my sentiment, but I also just want to make sure before I continue moving along that I ask everyone: can we consolidate the two, whereas is that, like the within essential retail, immigrants were partly high shares of pharmacists, and I mean leave it?
So I think the of course you know that kind of specific data is great.
So it's kind of like it's the same context, same source, but I don't know what everybody else thinks I mean.
This can probably be moved up higher because I think it's also pointing out other governments have already done this fair to say we can move this one on up top where so, probably after this this, whereas right here, okay, good, I thought I had it- maybe not, but I write up an additional.
Okay, I mean we can, of course, also put it as according to cnn right, okay, yeah, because if we're quoting, we should you know so now, then that language we can continue going down from here right.
We may need to put a little work into that because part of the issue was members, didn't, have gmail and didn't want to apply for a gmail and admit not to say that that's going to happen here again, but that was part of the obstacles.
But what was also discussed with microsoft is our resolution agenda, minutes office staff, responsibility, chair process and that was brought to a full halt, because the intention was more on let's pitch and hold aisha, because we don't like some of the things that she says despite whether they're true that- and here we are so yes, we're absolutely right- that's very important work that needs to be done.
You know this was never potentially either shared or passed, but if that is evident, let's just bring that so I mean what you're saying is that this resolution was not shared with the entire board.
As things of importance, I will get more background information on them and forward that to you guys, and maybe we might need to do something on the executive level before general- just wanted to put that out there.
I just wanna circle around about what's happening in terms of racial justice and like all the things that are going on, I wanted a.
Sorry arya, if I see like I'm imposing, but I just wanted to provide space for people to speak about it if they needed to and for people to know that you don't have to say it here.
You don't have to tell me now, but if you need to talk to someone or just to like express yourself, I know personally, I've been dealing with a lot of people.
Really is the only way that I can put it, but I just want to let everyone know that I'm here to have a conversation and to like can I have resources.
So I just wanted to bring that up and offer the space for people to reach out to me if they feel that they need someone to talk, but also again bring up the protests, not the protests but like there's an event happening in washington heights in support of the black lives matter.
I think that I wanted to try and give also the opportunity at the very end, because I do know that this it's also it's also just very exhausting for a lot of individuals mentally spiritually health-wise.
I think that even right now, even amongst the executive committee members, you know I'll just also state here that there's kind of I think just a very strong, problematic understanding of how to address this kind of concern, and I and I don't necessarily agree with some members that have already started making certain comments, but I do want this entire board to have a conversation going further than it has to address race to address racism, to address.
If we're honest about the dynamics that people are experiencing, I know that the tangent of that is recently happened in the community and I think it's important to recognize the same way in the same vein of what naisha presented earlier in this meeting, that everyone's experience is different and we cannot assume, because we have a specific experience.
That can be happening that there's a 21 points document that says yes, this is a problem, but yet me not knowing the document exists, bringing up some of those things and other people doing the same and being treated like.
I know I won't see you all for three months, but I just wanted to acknowledge and respect everything that was said and say that I value it and I think there's so much work for us to do and I'm so happy to be doing it.
I have a question you know so some new girl and I'm still trying to figure everything out here so and I hear that the community board is still working out about their bylaws and whatnot.
I do think that we will need to discuss a bit more, but also potentially even work with some of the other committees.
