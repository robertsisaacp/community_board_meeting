They would like to share their findings, and then we have a few new business items, including discussing our committee priorities for the fall, as well as starting to our conversation on capital and budget rankings for the month of october.
Second, I just want to ask if it's if we haven't generally received the addresses for the 311 complaints, and my concern is that it may be too public too much information about people's personal.
So could you just share what has been your response to those sort of three-on-one calls on noise, and imagine mentioned that came up several times as obviously a big issue in the community during the summer months there was.
So I just find it to be a level of information that I think is helpful for the community, but I'm not sure if it's completely helpful for like the public- and we've never had that level of data.
and we know that it's like probably just one person who's who is concerned about an issue that the other 60 people in the building may not even be aware of So is that possible officer to have that level of data to know if these three one calls that are recurring, particularly for noise and some of the other issues that you mentioned, that are larger issues if they're coming from the same person or not?
People who make frequent 3-1 calls to try to come to some resolution by working with the neighborhood coordination officers.
and you can see in the chat that there are people asking about 311, calls getting closed out very early because this has been going on for several months where a 3-1-1 is made and it is closed out within minutes, sometimes with a comment saying unfounded or police, were there no action needed when clearly nothing happened and nobody came, and so I'm curious as like who's taking the three one ones who decides how they answer it and who's accountable for this good question?
Whether it was summons, was issued or not, or if the individual left the scene or if the complaint no longer exists, because there's no music at the location, is it possible to report that data in your monthly reports average time from like the three one call to the response?
Okay, so it seems like we have a lot of a lot of conversations surrounding 30311 calls and complaints that we need to kind of flesh out and advance in the next meeting to have more data and more information shared with our committee and the public.
so cynthia you want to go first You know we had a sector d, build the block and there were over 50 people that came to this meeting and last week, and this was a common complaint of many people, and most of it was for noise street noise, where they literally were closed out within minutes and said.
Public lewdness, double parked cars parked in front of the fire hydrant directly outside the driveway to my building, and I would like to know from the police officer from the 34th precinct.
Like I said, we encompass 96th street all the way up to 242 in the Bronx, so they have a lot of a lot of area to cover, but we're working on trying to hit the stations where the station managers, the general manager station managers pretty much where we're getting feedback from were the worst worst hit areas to try to try to help people offer them services and to get them at least out of the subway station out of the cold and then eventually out of the cold weather for the winter.
We, a few months ago, we had someone from the community come to our meeting and propose having a booth at 169 that could possibly help with this sort of issue.
I said I'll talk to the midnight platoon commander as I have, and then when the ncos are working, we always make sure we hit that station and specifically stand in that area for multiple times of the day to make sure that people are moving.
Again, sometimes the response time will be a little longer because we do they do jump in if there is a higher priority job and unfortunately, crime is an uptick in the 3-3 right now, So I can definitely tell you that that's inaccurate data, this person, emailed the co captain bellow, which and then so myself and captain bello- had the nco sergeant personally email, this particular person concerning her issue, and so, if she was reached out and it was followed We have one 9-1-1 job on that date for for that 28-day period for motorcycles racing.
I know the precinct council, they have not been meeting, so it's been really difficult to build those individual relationships, but I do encourage you all to go to them to meet people, because it's always There are lists that you all can share with us, so we can share with the public.
In our own neighborhoods of washington heights and inwood, the 33rd and 34th precincts have a long history of treating our community as the enemy systematically antagonizing and over policing us, while repeatedly turning a deaf ear to our people's demands.
Today, I'll be talking to you all about these two precincts histories and patterns of misconduct and about the deep bribes they have left in their wake, as well as a call to action in developing ways of caring for and protecting our community beyond the police.
Okay, so taken together, the 33rd and 34th precincts have the second highest number of summons for Covid-19 related issues in all of Manhattan, especially when it comes to black and brown people.
While I was still active, 34th precinct police officers openly planted evidence and violently intimidated our community, though this neighborhood has become one of the safest in the city.
They have received thousands of fine which are still likely compounding where these complaints get ignored by the 33rd precinct, and many feel the fear that whenever the police are present, they could be arrested, have evidence planted on them and be charged and indicted without any way to fight back.
Obviously, you know it's important for our community to work with the precincts to in, to hold them accountable and also help them do a better job.
There are a lot of people working on different issues and sometimes the family feels more comfortable sharing information with you know the congress, member senator or the assembly person- So, but I do, I do appreciate you braving it up, because it's obviously a concern to me as a man, a black man.
We want to continue to have the police officers report on the statistics, but we also want community members to be able to discuss and to voice these concerns and with the ultimate goal of being able to work with the police and try to find solutions to a lot of our issues, and then I guess one more thing.
Okay, people want to go out there outdoors because there's we can't be indoors at the moment, and so you have to give people an opportunity to also enjoy themselves, and this people aren't just coming to inwood because there's an influx that there's no absolutely no policing here, because that's a complete and total lie and social media It's going to get in summonses, because people were talking about two thousand and three thousand dollar fines on communities where the majority of people are making under 35k a year on working class families that can barely pay rent and you want to give them summonses so that we can create further displacement and increase gentrification in our neighborhood.
So I know people had concerns about the sidewalk space, but we're getting a new, secure, offense that was budgeted over two years ago We, of course, make sure to try to keep the area clean, try to make sure that the population is not doing anything to bother any of the residents and we, as always, continue to be a good neighbor.
