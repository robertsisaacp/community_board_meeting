Enforcement agencies, as well as a few others, to share just a few updates. So before we move into the agenda, I would like for my committee members and other board members who are on the call to make yourself known by saying your name, and you know how long you've been on the committees started. With my assistant, chair, you're, mute danielle. Can you hear me? Can you guys hear me yeah? Okay, sorry, I'm danielle jetu, I'm the assistant chair, I've been on this committee, I can't remember perhaps a year and I've been on the board for two years. Someone else can jump in I'm graham cerallo, I'm a public member. I've been on the committee for a little under a year and a half. My name is maria legrand, and this is my third month on the community board at my first meeting at public safety. I believe you have one more. I don't really know if I'm on committee or not anymore, I mean I was on the committee six months ago and then I went it was returned back to land use and now I was kicked out of blind views. So I have no, I have no communication with the chair, so I have no idea what's going on so I'm here, hi everyone well we're happy to have you oc. Thank you. Mariella also have to figure out what her placement is. I did receive two updates of the current of the roster and it seems like there's, been some changes and we need to get to the bottom of who's on the committee, and I will do that follow-up after this meeting. Okay, thank you all right and I believe we have representatives from the 33rd precinct. Please introduce yourself from the 33rd and then we can have introductions from the 34th precinct and any other law enforcement agents on the call I'm like I'm, not sure if different formats, I'm not sure who you are so if you want to just go after the 34, if you can so if you're beginning with the 33rd, you have to unmute yourself, it could so I just saw before that was captain chung, but I don't see him on the screen anymore. Yes, yeah, okay, I don't see him, I don't see him either all right. We will move on and do we have someone on captain chang? Are you still there captain chang if you're there please introduce yourself and share your role at the precinct with the community? Please, okay is jonathan on the call by any chance. Maybe he can help out is chanel is working chanel. Do you know what what's happening with captain chung's? I don't know because he's unmuted so should be. We should be able to hear okay all right, we'll move we'll come back to him. Do we have any other anyone else from other precincts would like to say something and introduce yourself curtis. I just wanted to mention. I just sent him a message and he responded and said he's having technical issues wasn't able to hear anyone, but he can see everyone. Okay got it. So we'll go to the 34th precinct, and I see that on the line we can. We can have him. I apologize. I had to find a spot in a locker room. Otherwise it's not really too quiet, but I'm from transition. Three all right! Thank you very much and I could pay to prepare. 34 presents and lieutenant carmen semioni. Thank you. Thank you all for joining. Thank you all for joining today. I'm going to go ahead and share my experience. Please yourself, could you please mute yourself if you're, not speaking, so we have a pretty light agenda this evening. We will start by having our updates from our precincts. As you see on the agenda here, followed by a presentation from a community group. That's done some research on police accountability. They would like to share their findings, and then we have a few new business items, including discussing our committee priorities for the fall, as well as starting to our conversation on capital and budget rankings for the month of october. So without further ado, we will start with the 33rd precinct to give us updates on the last few months. Okay, so captain chung is still having difficulties. How about we go to the 34th precinct, lieutenant semioni from 34th free I'll start with talking about the crime, complaints for the 28 day period in the 34th precinct, the 34th precinct we've had a total of for the 28 day period. We have total of 10 complaints for grand larceny auto there. That's an 80 decrease from this year of 18.. So last year, 2019 10 this year, 20 18 80 increase when we go to the grand larcenies, that's a 46 for last year and a 33 for this year, so we're looking at a 28 decrease for the 28 day period for burglaries. Last year we had 15 total burglaries in 28 day periods versus 20 of this year, so we have a 34 increase and felonious assaults were down by 56 last year being 30, and this year being 13.. Robberies have gone down in the 34th precinct for the 28 day period. 23 this year versus 26 last year, a drop of 11.5 percent and rapes have gone down from in 2019 from four for the 28 day period to 2020 of two, so a 50 drop and we have 100 decrease in 28 day period for murders. Now we'll go to 3-1-1 our top 10 3-1 locations for from august 3rd of this year to august 30th of this year starts off with 213 nagel avenue, being noise residential as well as two complaints of graffiti and one complaint of animal abuse. 108 elwood street total of 92 calls that's going to be 73 calls for street and sidewalk noise 3 for commercial noise, 10 for noise coming from a vehicle and 6 for noise from a residence tied with that for 92 is 107 post avenue, 70 for street sidewalk noise 6 for illegal parking, 9 for noise from residents and 7 from noise from a vehicle 37 hillside avenue is the next location and that's 59. Total calls 43 from the street and sidewalk noise from a vehicle being 14 illegal parking, one and traffic. One number five is 6 16 academy street 47 total calls 44 emanating from the street and sidewalk three from illegal parking. 120 vermillia avenue has a total of 42 calls noise, street and sidewalk being 30 of those calls and noise from the residents is 12.. 109 post avenue has 39 total calls noise from a vehicle being 33 street and sidewalk one illegal parking for annoys from residents once can I stop you for one? Second, I just want to ask if it's if we haven't generally received the addresses for the 311 complaints, and my concern is that it may be too public too much information about people's personal. You know complaints being made for particular buildings, I'm not sure. If that's something the committee finds to be helpful, knowing the addresses, I definitely don't think it's the street. Okay, all right! Excuse me for post avenue: 39 total calls 33 from the sidewalk I'm screaming 33, emanating from a vehicle one from street and sidewalk four for illegal parking and one for noyes residential hayson avenue has 35 phone calls 29 coming from street and sidewalk three illegal parking: two noise, residential and one noise from a vehicle coast avenue again, 34 calls street and sidewalk being 32 of them illegal parking, one, a noise emanating from the vehicle, one post avenue again: 31 calls well from a vehicle three from a residence, eight illegal parking and eight per street and sidewalk noise. Okay, alrighty! Well! Thank you very much for that information. That was really enlightening. So could you just share what has been your response to those sort of three-on-one calls on noise, and imagine mentioned that came up several times as obviously a big issue in the community during the summer months there was. There was data that was released by the Manhattan world president's office. We have the highest number of noise complaints which we do every year. So what has been your response to this sort of pattern and 311 calls? Well, the response from the 34th precinct is always to try to come to a reasonable outcome to the noise complaints. We speak to the individuals that are alleged to have made the noise complaints. I assume that are making the noise that is giving somebody the reason for calling. So we speak to those individuals on the street. Let them know that there there's been noise complaints and they need to be respectful of their neighbors and make sure that they're taking care of the noise. So if they have a radio on, we ask them to please lower it. If it becomes a problem, then we have to do our job in issuing summonses and take enforcement thereafter. Okay, are there any questions about the information that was shared from the 34th precinct? I do I have a question. Okay, we have our committee, our committee. First, we have lc our board members rather mm-hmm. Are there the board members who like to question danielle oc danielle, and then we have nancy okay. So I would like to know if you can give us some information. As far as you can about the animal abuse case was that resolved well, which animal abuse case are you talking about? You mentioned that there was one animal abuse case in your report. You're talking about for the 311 complaints. It wasn't a three one. I don't think it was a three one. It was in the day period report yeah was that the nagel avenue address for animal abuse- everyone. Yes, it was a three one phone call and not eight nine, eight nine one phone call that I would have to look into further. I can't comment right away. I don't have that specific 911 phone call to see what the outcome was, but I can look at that and find out the information. Can you get back to us on that? Maybe at the next meeting or something yeah I'll? Do that? Okay! Thank you! Okay! Danielle! Thank you. So much for your report. I guess my question is more for you curtis, I'm just wondering what the concern is around having the report mention specific addresses. I find that to be full. I think it's helpful to understand exactly where the issue is coming from. I actually was interested to know whether we could even could be even more specific so as to identify the number of calls that were coming from the individuals like number full sample like if it correlated with like if it was a one to one like one person making one complaint or if there were like multiple people, making multiple complaints but yeah. I guess I'm just interested in understanding what the concern might be yeah. I think that is the level of detail. I think is probably more helpful to see if there's one person making calls over and over and over again versus the number for a particular address. I know when some people call 301, they call they they're reporting it's anonymous, it's an anonymous call. So I'm not sure if the addresses that are provided are those that were making anonymous calls and that's the level of data that you know shouldn't be shared publicly. It also just welcomes you know unnecessary targeting of particular buildings. It could lead to additional like just targeting or if there was someone who disagreed with this sort of action. They would know that this building is the one that's making all 301 calls. So I just find it to be a level of information that I think is helpful for the community, but I'm not sure if it's completely helpful for like the public- and this is live stream right. Okay, all right and we've never had that level of data. That's why it stood out to me as well that we've never had addresses being shared with us on work through when calls were coming from what the micro data, I think, is extremely helpful. Knowing if there are reoccurring calls, because if one person in one building is making a hundred calls each month- and we know that it's like probably just one person who's who is concerned about an issue that the other 60 people in the building may not even be aware of yeah. Definitely yeah. So is that possible officer to have that level of data to know if these three one calls that are recurring, particularly for noise and some of the other issues that you mentioned, that are larger issues if they're coming from the same person or not? Is that level of information available to you all? We could look into that because a lot of the times like you stated, there's a lot of anonymous complaints. So we, if there are people who frequently make the same complaints on 3-1-1, we have an officer at the precinct. One of his duties is to make this to contact. People who make frequent 3-1 calls to try to come to some resolution by working with the neighborhood coordination officers. Okay. Well, thank you very much for the update. If there aren't any additional questions, we'll move to the 3-3. Oh nancy, I'm sorry yeah! Thank you yeah! So I'm in the 34- and you can see in the chat that there are people asking about 311, calls getting closed out very early and I'm wondering if you can enlighten us as to the process, because this has been going on for several months where a 3-1-1 is made and it is closed out within minutes, sometimes with a comment saying unfounded or police, were there no action needed when clearly nothing happened and nobody came, and so I'm curious as like who's taking the three one ones who decides how they answer it and who's accountable for this good question? So if you could answer that, that'd be great okay, so the three one ones are at the precinct desk the desk officer c311 and has the officer that's assigned to the telephone switchboard, assign it to a sector or response order on the street once those sectors or response orders get there. They already know what the complaint is for. They have access to that on their department, cell phones and tablets to know what the 3-1 phone call is exactly for and we'll use an example. Let's say 220th street and broadway. It is for noise complaints coming from you know, I'll give you one that I went to. It was at the corner of post avenue and dickman, and it was for a red vehicle noise coming out of the vehicle. This person had their stereo system blasted for the whole block to hear their music. So that call when I was on the desk was dispatched out. The unit went there and said the car had left the scene and three one ones are answered. They are, they are a cause for concern and we do take them seriously, but if a sector is responding to a assault in progress or what we would call a higher priority job, their main concern is to get to the assault or to the robbery victim or anything like that, and once that has subsided, they go to those 311 jobs. So when they go so going back to this complaint for the noise emanating from a vehicle, they went there and they said the vehicle had left the location. My I myself, knowing that this complaint came over, they went there and they found that the complaint was unfounded. Now, when we mark it as unfounded, it doesn't mean that the person made a bogus complaint, it's more so that when we got there the noise, the person wasn't there all the time, though, market has gone on arrival, the individual left the seat prior to police arrival. The following day. I was not on the desk, I was on patrol. I took it right over to dickman and post avenue and did see the same vehicle from the previous day. The complaint saw the owner he had his car was double parked spoke to him. He was issued a summons for the double parking and we also spoke further about about his noise and his need to be more caring and the understanding of neighbors not wanting to hear the music coming emanating from his vehicle. So that's one way that we do handle these 311 complaints. They are taken seriously, but some it depends on each complaint handled differently, depending on who we interact with and whether their understanding of what we need to say and if we have to take further police action. Okay curtis can I jump in for a second yes, but who's that danielle? Sorry, what I'm saying? Yes, please jump in. Oh no, thank you for your response. I just one follow-up question it just. I just want to make sure I'm understanding. It sounds like all three one calls get answered by one of your officers, if not immediately, because sometimes they are committing competing priorities. Is that correct? Okay, like let's say, for example, like a tour change, even with a tour change, for example, a call would be responded to an officer would always respond to it. Yeah in the system we have to. We have to document who we gave the actual 311 complaint too. So, for example, if it's I'm going to say if it's a complaint in sector adam and it's on saint nicholas avenue, we have to make sure that 30, the third platoon to 4-12 ship on the evening sector adam, is assigned 311 complaints for the corner of 183rd street and st nicholas avenue for noise. That's all documented! We have to put in what time we assign them with the 311 complaint, and when these, when the sector gives us the final they we have to also put in the time that they finalize the 311 complaint and how they responded to it. Whether it was summons, was issued or not, or if the individual left the scene or if the complaint no longer exists, because there's no music at the location, is it possible to report that data in your monthly reports average time from like the three one call to the response? Is that would be something that we would have to look at because we never we don't. We don't really compile data when it comes to response times from 311 jobs. The prior our priority jobs are the ones that get the response times, such as the burglaries, the robberies results and so forth. Everything that's in progress, so I'd have to look into that to see if that would be possible to get like a timeline of how long it takes for officers to respond to a specific or the 3-1-1 complaints in general. Okay, so it seems like we have a lot of a lot of conversations surrounding 30311 calls and complaints that we need to kind of flesh out and advance in the next meeting to have more data and more information shared with our committee and the public. That seems to be where we're going. So I will email you a list of how I'll discuss with my committee some data points. We would like to see for the next meeting and we'll send that to you in advance, so you can do digging and come prepared to answer all the questions that we've been posing to you. I also want to just clarify, because I don't like cyberbullying but ed did, make a comment directed at me saying that my he was concerned about my comments. I wanted to say that my comment was directed at protecting the privacy of people who make through one calls. It was not to withhold information from anyone. It is really important for us to also be aware that some people call 31 anonymously so having addresses shared is an effort to protect someone's privacy and not necessarily to publicly share individuals from what their addresses and what they're, who what they're calling about so curtis yeah. This is cynthia auburn. I had my hand up okay, and let me also say that it is very. This is a new platform, so I don't respond to you. I'm trying to read the comments, so thank you ed for I'm happy. I clarified and you're satisfied with my answer. It's very challenging, reading the chat box and seeing the hands. So if I skip over you, please charge it to the heart and not to my head or my head, not to my heart so cynthia you want to go first, I see cynthia and that that'll be our last question from for the 3-4 we'll go to the 33rd after that. So in particular thanks, I'm sorry, but that my question wasn't answered about that. What's happening with the three one ones that real no one is responding to. You know we had a sector d, build the block and there were over 50 people that came to this meeting and last week, and this was a common complaint of many people, and most of it was for noise street noise, where they literally were closed out within minutes and said. You know and it was closed and nothing happened and people were there watching and they did not see police respond, and this is you know, so, that's you know. I wanted to know the process of how the 311s are going. Thank you for doing that. But is there any insight into why this is happening? Has happened so frequently which which one specifically, I think we have a few people here that can fight the specific ones but a number on over on dikeman and through you know, throughout sector six sector date. They can't come on because there's a lot of three one school yeah calls that come through. So without being specific, I can't give you specific response, so we can probably get some of that information to you, but there's a pattern. There's so many that there's a pattern and that's what we're concerned about yeah, so I think I don't want. I know we have. We know this is a big issue. It's been an issue all throughout the summer. We've heard it several times. I've been I've received several emails about this, so we would like to have a clear and concise answer so nancy. If you want to send over some exact some examples we can, we can. I can send an email to them and get some answers for us to share, to share publicly and also be reflected in them in the meeting minutes for our general body meeting later this month. Does that sound like a good way to move forward? I can I can do that. We've collected some 311 data, okay, perfect, and so there was so cynthia auburn. Please take it away thanks nancy for jumping back in. I was going to follow on to your question because I didn't also receive a clear answer to your question. So I live on indian road directly across the street from inwood hill park, which has been a total absolute and complete due for the entire summer, and there have been loud professional amplified on the peninsula and on the front lawn, which is clearly against the law unless you have a permit for them. We have filed residents of my building and the two adjacent buildings have filed multiple 3-1-1 complaints about this, as well as violations of open container laws. Public lewdness, double parked cars parked in front of the fire hydrant directly outside the driveway to my building, and I would like to know from the police officer from the 34th precinct. Are you under orders to stand down on quality of life issues, because I have seen a qualitative and quantitative inc lee bad situation in inwood hill park over the summer? And so I just need to know. If you see amplifiers, can you take them away? Can you issue summonses? Is there anything you can do about violation of painter laws and public lewdness or, as I have seen over the summer, is the modus operandi to simply drive by in the sector. Car people turn the volume down drive away and then two seconds after you're out of sight, the volume goes back up again. I just don't know what to think. Well, there's no concerted effort to not take these quality of life offenses seriously. So that's. That goes without narrative to say something like that. We take these of you, take these offenses seriously and I'm not sure if it was you. I spoke to this past sunday regarding a loud music coming from indian road, the park yeah. I believe that was you called the recent yeah, so that was that was me. You spoke to on the phone. I remember that specific incident and I did send my sector out there. It took him a little while to get out there because they were on a vehicle collision prior he get out there and when they did come back to the precinct, they did state that this there was loud music. I had sex with david, actually working that afternoon, the nco david. I told them to also go out there and address the situation, and they said they did that we went out there. We try to use you know we try to talk to members of the community taking enforcement action. We try to get compliance before anything else. So there's so to answer your question: there's no effort to look away from quality of life. Offenses! Okay, I mean I understand that you guys have a lot on your plate. I really I understand that, and I appreciate it and I did see the patrol car out in the park this past weekend and we all appreciated that, but what's gone on in inwood hill park over the summer is just it can't be described in any other way, but to say that it's a complete zoo and I'm concerned about it, because I'm five foot two, nothing and I don't want to go out there and confront a group of you know: young men blasting their music. I just don't think that's a good idea, but you know we've been kept up here until six o'clock in the morning, all right so cynthia I have we have to move on. We really appreciate and value your comments. It's something once again that we've heard all summer from a variety of people and sources and there's been a lot of conversations about it. We did have a public hearing and there's a lot of work happening outside the board, with kind of moving this forward and making some actionable items that can be followed through on as well as working inside the board. You know, I is a very it's an issue that is ongoing and it's it, unfortunately, is not going to be solved overnight. So I do welcome you to reach out to me with any additional questions we can send and I'm going to follow through with follow up with nancy, about moving forward with 301 data and getting to the bottom of why the response has appearing to be slowing down from our from some of our people. Who's spoken on this issue tonight and we hopefully will have more clarity at our next meeting. So I want to move forward thanks. So thank you very much cynthia. So we're going to move forward to the 33rd precinct. 3-3 three: are you in the house? Okay, so chang captain chung from the three I believe mentioned, they were having some technical difficulties, while we're sorting that out is officer bat still on the line. Yep, I'm here. Okay, we can go to you, okay, my video's, not working right now, so I'm trying to work on that. But as of right now, transit works a little bit different than the top side precincts. We cover the three four all the way down to the two six and we cover a little bit into the Bronx. So our comp stats a little bit differently. We don't have a lot of major crimes are pretty much any besides for a couple of assault. Twos on mta workers that have happened up in the three four precinct to report on our main issues have been more quality of life issues that are happening in the three four, especially the 168 street. At the our 168 station. At the 169 side, the 175 street on the atom station we're getting a lot of swiper calls for that station and then actually our narcotics issue, we haven't received that many phone calls at the 181 or the on the one and one eight one on the a stations as well. So those calls seem to be subsiding as well, but we still receive the typical, our and the homeless calls and the swiper calls that we have at our regular stations. I'm sorry that was an echo hi curtis, I'm sorry, okay, we'll come back to you just hold tight. Please continue officer brent, okay, I forgot where it was okay, yeah so, like I said, all more of our concerns. Right now are all quality of life issues that we have been dealing with in the past. We do have our ncos out trying to tackle issues, doing directors at different stations at different times to try to answer the complaints that we get through the mta portal. We are also, oh sorry. I was reading the chat. We're also have our regular patrol cops doing director patrols at different times and intervals throughout all tours, to try to combat the the homelessness and also any of the swipe proposals that we get okay, so danielle. There were a few questions that you had that you over advanced. You want to go first danielle. I can't hear you daniel sorry, I would say I was. I was turning it over to you. Oh so much officer bats for your presentation. I really appreciate it. I'm just wondering you mentioned the home the calls regarding the folks who are homeless. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on that, and also just what is being done in terms of linking any of those folks to care, especially considering the fact that the stations have been closed from, I believe it's 11 to five a.m, one to five yep, so the stations at this point at the at this point in time the stations are so close from one am to five a.m and in the morning to the end stations, we have police officers at every end station when the stations do close or people that are getting off the trains that don't have any where to go. So we can offer them services as far as we normally work with brc in regards to trying to help people homeless, people with services or anybody that just doesn't have a place to stay with services. They are in somewhat of a pickle as well because of the cobin 19 restrictions. So normally we also do separate joint operations with them as well, to try to hit particular stations that we keep getting complaints about for homelessness or people that we just see an uptick in homelessness. We're actually just started to reach back out to them. They are going to start doing separate joint operations for individual stations, so we are currently trying to get some stations set up for next week and next week, because they just reached back out to us and we will continue to move forward as the weather gets colder and a little bit nastier about trying to find everybody as much placement as we can. Okay, could you share with us some of the issues that you mentioned 168th street? What are some of the issues that are coming from that particular station right now? We still have an issue at the 169 street entrance and exit the 33. I think sector david is the nco sector. We work closely with them because they own the area right above that entrance, as well as far as their sector, with a lot of narcotics usage, a lot of people panhandling in that area. Our specific problems are the people that are either sleeping or doing narcotics on the stairwell, whether it be k2 or shooting up and also sleeping there, because it's a kind of away from the booth away from where normally the mta goes. So we've gotten complaints about around four or five a.m: people kind of sleeping in the station at that entrance and exit I've, let our midnight platoon know they, of course, are a little bit hindered because the trains aren't moving. So we use as many cars as we can to get around the whole area. Like I said, we encompass 96th street all the way up to 242 in the Bronx, so they have a lot of a lot of area to cover, but we're working on trying to hit the stations where the station managers, the general manager station managers pretty much where we're getting feedback from were the worst worst hit areas to try to try to help people offer them services and to get them at least out of the subway station out of the cold and then eventually out of the cold weather for the winter. Okay. We, a few months ago, we had someone from the community come to our meeting and propose having a booth at 169 that could possibly help with this sort of issue. Do you think that would be about that? That's a solution, or that would help it all. If there was a larger presence there, perhaps would either rerouting individuals to services or helping with some of the narcotic issues as well. It's to my understanding that the mta is trying to do away with booths in general, with a new system that they're trying to encompass with the the tap and go pay system. So I don't I mean that'd, be a question more for mta than for me, but I don't think that they would actually set up a booth there. They could possibly maybe have people mta personnel, be at the that end station or that section just to kind of monitor the situation and call police as needed. But as far as setting up a booth, I think they're trying to get away from that aspect because they want everything to kind of go, pay to go and they're actually going to bring the booth agents outside the booth. From the plan that I heard and that the individual was actually advocating for a police booth there, oh a police booth. Oh, I don't think that they're going to give us a booth, but as far as increased presence there we can, like. I said I'll talk to the midnight platoon commander as I have, and then when the ncos are working, we always make sure we hit that station and specifically stand in that area for multiple times of the day to make sure that people are moving. People really nobody's bothering anybody, but I know our hardest hit times, for our complaints are more the when the trains open up and people going to their morning. Commutes around you know the five a.m to eight a.m. Time: that's! When we're trying to have our midnight platoon try to stay in the station as much as possible, but with the few people that we have the calls that they have, sometimes they do have to leave and people come back in the station. Okay. Thank you very much all right. We have a few questions from our committee board members, mariella hi. I have a question, I'm just thinking about schools, reopening and having you know, thousands and thousands of children back on the subways on a regular basis, and I was wondering if there's any plan or if there's any change in strategy around just transit safety, once there are students and teachers and staff members on subways and also what does that like? Is there anything related to social distancing that falls within the purview of transit? So, as far as social distinction is concerned, within transit, it's going to be tricky. We are. We have a school team that is dedicated to the transit that has always gone out. I know their sergeant is currently trying to contact the schools to see exactly how they're going to be. I know I know schools were pushed back a week. I know that was pretty new, so we're trying to right now get in contact with the schools to see how their models are going to be. If it's more online learning or I know the schools around, the area are going on more like an av schedule or only half the kids go to school for a time, but we will. We always have our school teams out in the stations in the past, where schools are the exit stations and the entrance stations to make sure that students are safe, that there's a police presence there. They will be trying doing their best to monitor to monitor social distancing as well, but until we get a more concrete plan, that's been on our schools, team and they're still trying to work on the issue about how many kids are going to be moving on the train at that time and then getting them on the train in social distance as best as possible. Okay, thank you for your response. Just for the public watching. If there are any questions, please feel free to use the raise hand feature, and I will acknowledge you. I don't see any hands raised now, so we're going to move forward with captain chung, who I believe is now ready to present information on the 3-3 hi everyone curtis. Can you hear me? I can yes, hi curtis hi everyone. I hope everyone's safe and staying healthy. Sorry, I'm getting technical with difficulty, so I'm actually on the phone lamb, I'm listening to you guys and speaking through the computer. So I'll give you a quick overview of the crime that we had in the 3-3 full 28 days. Robbery were up slightly. The problem is a couple of them began with shoplifting, which is a lot of farms. A big chain. Pharmacy perpetrator goes in steals. A product gets confronted by this security displays a weapon at the in this case it's a knife and then it becomes a robbery, there's no injuries or anything to complain it, but we take a robbie for that. It just initially starts off as a larceny burglaries were up. I'm sorry, oh burglaries were up a lot, we're up. 180 138, sorry, the echoing on my phone, is confusing me. I were up 19 compared to eight last year, the reasoning behind that the last 28 days. We had one perpetrator who committed seven burglaries. It was six of package step which was always a problem with us during this covert. Like I said the last time, people are ordering more products at home, leaving it in the lobby, and people are just coming in and stealing it, so it makes it so much more accessible for these criminals to steal from the lobby. So in this case we had one perpetrator who stole six packages from different buildings and committed a commercial bird. We went into a restaurant broke in and stole some money, so good work with the camera superintendent working with the ncos and the squad. They actually identified the perpetrator and he's apprehended at this point so from that 19 birds. This month, seven of them was committed by this perpetrator. Who's apprehended at this point, glee were up again nine versus two. Last year. That's 350 percent increase. A lot of the problems is 33 of them. Are people are leaving car keys in the car as they're, going to the delhi stores to pick up something they come out and the car is gone. So we need people to help us kind of bring drive to crime down it's hard enough, keeping our property safe. Let's not give opportunities and easy easy access to these people, stealing our property and that's about it with our crime. You know what I'm gonna address the 3-1-1. I didn't have the data for the 3-1-1 for this month, but captain chung before you move to 3-0 likes. I know that may raise some additional questions for the 3-3. Could you give us an update on the shooting that occurred at 174? I believe. Yes, it was 174. We have two perpetrators identified at this time. Squad is working on that case right now, they're identified, they are identified both yes again, it's from the video from the deli and the store in the street, the ncos and our fio was able to identify those two perpetrators. Okay, thank you all right, so you were gonna move forward to the three one concerns yeah. I don't have the data for this 28 day period, but I did have it for july, the last for the last meeting that we had that I've never presented. So I would just say on a specific date july 5th we answered 513 hormone, calls on that one day. Again, I don't have the data for this last 28 days. I know for the 3-3, at least on the 4-12. We have a 3-1-1 portal that is solely dedicated to 3-1-1 jobs. Again, sometimes the response time will be a little longer because we do they do jump in if there is a higher priority job and unfortunately, crime is an uptick in the 3-3 right now, so it's pretty much all hands on deck, but we do have a 3-1-1 auto solely for those jobs, and I do want to address someone who's concerned on the board, who messaged the board and said that they reached out to the nco, I'm not going to say the name, but it's the locations 165 in broadway. So I want to know that I want to let this person know that the condition is being addressed. This particular person is telling everyone on the board that they reach out to the nco and they got no response. So I can definitely tell you that that's inaccurate data, this person, emailed the co captain bellow, which and then so myself and captain bello- had the nco sergeant personally email, this particular person concerning her issue, and so, if she was reached out and it was followed up- but we had the serial sergeant specifically to help this particular person. I also had a 3-1-1 and 9-1-1 jobs rant for the 28-day period. In this specific location, there was two 3-1-1 jobs. One was marked 91, which means the condition was corrected and one was 90x, which means they. When the officer responded, there was nothing happening there. So the particular issue was car, blasting, music, dirt, bikes and so again, 91 and 90 x for the two three one jobs that we received. We have one 9-1-1 job on that date for for that 28-day period for motorcycles racing. So when the the job came over at 11 hours and the job was marked, nine easy. So again, as I expressed the last time by the time, they call 9-1-1 if it's a dirt bike, unless they're doing donuts and wheelies on the corner by the time the sector or the 311 auto response, they're, actually they'll be gone, so these jobs are being answered, they are accounted for because we do generate a report that requires that each job have a disposition. Thank you. Thank you very much for the update. I wanted to just answer a question cheryl miller posed about, so the answer is no that the person has been identified. We're not kept not arrested just yet. That seems to be the case. So thank you very much. I no one mentioned the nco build a block meetings. They are a great resource. I have attended several of them for this variety of sectors throughout our community board district throughout the summer. The past few months weeks rather- and I found them to be really helpful- to attend to get to know the ncos part of the problem. That I see is that it's really important for us to build very close relationship with our ncos to have their phone numbers to be able to call them to be able to text them, and I think that's really important as to in addressing some of our issues in addition to using things like 311, of course, but it's really important for us to rely on our nco builder block efforts that are out there and attending those quarterly meetings. I know the precinct council, they have not been meeting, so it's been really difficult to build those individual relationships, but I do encourage you all to go to them to meet people, because it's always it's also about relationship building right. We can't just you know, have a one-sided relationship. We have to make sure that we're also trying to work with our officers as they hear our concerns. So I would encourage you all to go to raise your complaints and your concerns also to the nco meetings that are now scheduled. I don't know: when is there a master calendar somewhere we can, we can see when they are happening for the three four and the three I know I saw a few posters on facebook, but there's cause. There are lists that you all can share with us, so we can share with the public. You know, I believe it's on the NYPD site. If not have them, everyone can email my ncos officers because they were they're, the ones who's conducting it, and I know we just had one last week. Okay, all right! Thank you very much so we're gonna go to. I see there are a few hands that are raised. We are going to go with bernard first, followed by jennifer. Yes, captain chung, can you hear me? Yes? Can captain chung hear me? Yes, hi, okay, hi, how you doing okay. So my question is, I mean I've had a very bad situation over here on the corner all basically all summer, a constant party just basically a regular party that starts on friday evening and ends you know whenever saturday evening and ends like three four o'clock in the morning and then even sometimes sunday, but that one at least ends at 11 o'clock and it's a very loud car speaker, the same car all the time all the time and I'm talking about for the last two months. So at what point do you guys finally take the guy's speaker away and we're talking about probably a thousand watt high compression driver speaker in the back of the car? That's completely 100 illegal without a permit on the street. So at what point do you guys actually go in there and just take the car? Take either give the guy enough tickets to have the car towed or get the speaker away? Hello, yeah! I'm here hi, mr grotman, I'm sorry you're having that issue. If you give me the location or if you email me or my ncos directly, we will have that taken care of or looked into so the problem with taking a car. Is it's not as easy, as everyone thinks like? We can't just show up on the scene and if the music is loud, it's all subjective. Obviously we can't just show up and take someone's car. So there's a lot of legal issues. We need sound meters, we need to see observations. We got to give them. You know what, in our fairness, we want to give them a warning. So tell us the location. Call us call my ncos directly when it's happening we'll go out there and we'll assess the situation. Well, I mean the question: is it's not it's not just one time, though, that I'm talking about I'm talking about it started. It started going up for two months. It's been going on since fourth of july fourth of july it was, it was loud I mean have you called it in, of course, yeah and I've been talking through the ncos about it as well and they've been so they've and they've been doing. What's going on. Please email me with all the information. I will personally look into it: okay, all right! Okay! Thank you very much. Okay, we're gonna, move on to jennifer, hey there. I just had a quick question for the 3-4 police officer. I think it was a month ago or a little more than a month ago there was a stabbing in fort tryon towards the broadway side. I wanted to know if there were any details that came out of that, and I heard yesterday when I was in the park that possibly someone was mugged or robbed. So I was just curious. Hey is that true, and is there an uptick in crime in the park this summer? It just seems like there's a lot. I mean I've. Never I mean we had a. I mean it was a stabbing. It was pretty scary and it was when the park was super crowded. So I just wanna know if you had any update on that just hold on one second, he just had to step up for one minute and but he's on his way. Okay, there's an uptick in the park at what was yesterday's event that you were asking about. Possibly it seemed like someone said there was a robbery I heard a scream and then someone said there was a robbery and I saw an ambulance leave the park which area which park fort tryon, broadway south of dangan, so somewhere between dangan and bennett, and then the stabbing was above near the dongan entrance, but elevated. It was above the lawn, and that was about five weeks ago, maybe a little longer somewhere along those lines. Yeah know what it's kind of it's a long time ago and the lieutenant wasn't here five weeks ago. So that's something we can get back to you all right like how did that happen, who's going to get back to who, because I'm just a I'm, not a board member or anything. Could you put an email address down in the chat box, the officer who's speaking? We can reach out to you directly with that right. If you, if you jot it down curtis- and let us know we can we can get that answer okay. So if you want to email me, your exact question, my email address is c cd, gmail.com, okay, cd23 gmail.com, all right, so we're going to move forward. Thank you all. Thank you to both precincts, obviously, are really appreciative, and you know. We hope that we can do it the best we can. We can continue to work towards improving these things and hopefully we'll have answers on some of the three one concerns meeting and, as I mentioned before, I'll look to work with nancy on getting you more examples. We can use to build to build some of those questions all right, so we have just a officer. Excuse me, miller, officer, miller from edgecomb superintendent miller. Are you on the line would like to give us an update on what's been happening at edgecone there we go you're immune. I can't hear you. I can't hear you no all right. So that's not working very well you're, not you're, not muted, but we can't okay all right, so we will come back to you. As you know, there is a correctional facility in the community as well, and mr miller represent that facility and provides us with community updates on what's happening there as well. So that's all always good to hear what's happening with that with that population of community members as well, so we're going to move forward with the agenda. We do have a presentation. There was community member paloma laura who reached out to me and had been working on some data and some research on policing in the community, his historical patterns and trends, and also came up with some recommendations on how to move forward with improving these relationships with that with the community. So I'm going to turn it over to paloma to begin her presentation. So, let's see how this works. Paloma are you there? I am here actually catherine's gonna lead on the presentation side and then dan and I will chime in when needed. If the community has any questions, do you have the presentation, or should I pull it up? I have it yes, okay, you want to pull that up. Thank you, curtis and are you there is catherine there yeah I'm ready to hear you hi craig, it's nice to meet you katherine. Do you want to go ahead and start? Yes, okay, one! Second, I want to just also just add that you know this is a presentation by a community group. It's not a community board presentation, we're here, to listen and to learn from a community member who came to us to share their research and their findings. So that's what that is the purpose of this presentation right now and we're hoping to hear what they have research and what their findings were. So please introduce yourself and explain the nature of your project. Thank you, okay, so my name is katherine and today I'm going to be talking about police accountability in uptown and why we should all care about it. So, in the wake of a current uproar, the NYPD continues to have a fraught relationship with communities of color across the city. In our own neighborhoods of washington heights and inwood, the 33rd and 34th precincts have a long history of treating our community as the enemy systematically antagonizing and over policing us, while repeatedly turning a deaf ear to our people's demands. Today, I'll be talking to you all about these two precincts histories and patterns of misconduct and about the deep bribes they have left in their wake, as well as a call to action in developing ways of caring for and protecting our community beyond the police. Can you turn to the next slide? Please? Okay, so taken together, the 33rd and 34th precincts have the second highest number of summons for Covid-19 related issues in all of Manhattan, especially when it comes to black and brown people. The roots of the rice between the uptown community and the police, however, run deep for much of the 20th century. Washington heights, and especially in wood, were overwhelmingly white working class irish neighborhoods for a long time the police reflected their community and were too mostly white and irish. Yet well, after the irish had fled to the suburbs and after dominicans and the black community have become the vast majority of the residents of this neighborhood, the police forces, racial composition remained the same, which is so white. The police made a name for itself, even in a scandal-ridden police force as a particularly violent and corrupt set of precincts, starting in 1990. As you see in the timeline, central harlem 30th precinct faced the largest corruption scandal in NYPD history, which included a massive internal drug ring, and does that on dozens of counts of lying perjury, as well as pervasive police violence, though the whole police precinct was implicated. Many of the officers got off free and were transferred further uptown to the 33rd and 34th precincts. Instead, during this time, corruption was endemic to policing uptown, to name just one of many substantiated and well-documented documented corruption. Investigations in the 90, a 2, a 2010 investigation uncovered the 33rd precinct systematic downgrading of crimes over multiple years. This led, among many other things, to a serial rapist in the year 2000 to be able to get away with rape and murder, because the complaints being received about this were categorized as trespassing, which was a very minor and vague offense of what actually was happening. Moving on. Is that slide three? This is slide. Three, I'm sorry all right! Thank you. In 1990s, the 34th precinct had the highest number of homicides and violent crime rates, and its mostly white policemen saw themselves as fighting an open war with black and brown drug dealers across our neighborhood. This war led to the creation of the notoriously violent, secretive and corrupt local motion, though the extent of their actions remains unknown. This group of officers have been documented to have engaged in organized protection schemes, with various gangs planted evidence and repeatedly committed outright perjury to get their arrestees indicted. Unsurprisingly, in 1990, an off-duty 34th on precinct police officer was arrested and later indicted for selling drugs and then in 1992 a massive federal investigation found corruption, racketeering and drug selling to be endemic to the precinct, though this investigation led to only two indictments of officers for perjury. Can you move on to the next slide? Please. Thank you. In recent years, this legacy of treating the community with deep sense of skepticism and opposition has remained in the past five years. These precincts have had among the most complaints and allegations against them of any other precincts in Manhattan between 2015 and 2018. The ccrb received 85 complaints and 226 allegations against the 33rd, and in the past decade the 33rd precinct has caused significant controversy in 2011, for example, officer john canali, dressed as a plainclothes officer, murdered and unprovoked dominican. Man then lied under oath that the man had tried to strangle him when that, indeed did not happen. Despite significant protests across the city and in the neighborhood, and despite the city in 2019, paying the family of the murdered man, 5 million dollars in a settlement canali was never charged but was instead promoted to sergeant in the same precinct and then in 2018 officer, michael j reynolds drunkenly broke down the door of a black family in nashville at a bachelor party and terrorized them called them. The n-word, among other things, and was saying and was even arrested in nashville reynolds, was forced to quit after significant public upheaval, but not before the precinct could take multiple steps to try to protect him from the backlash from his violent racism. Can you turn to the next slide? Please yep! I just want to also just keep track of time, because we do have a time constraint, so just be cognizant of that you're on slide number five. I believe yes, so the 34th precinct of anything has been worse in recent years, notably they're within the three highest complaint courts against them in Manhattan and employ the largest number of officers with complaints against them in the city. They currently have 62 officers with complaints with 105 total complaints, 270 total allegations and 53 total lawsuits against officers, because police misconduct isn't held accountable in this prisoning. Most of the officers with very high numbers of complaints and allegations against them are still working here today. For example, 34th precinct police officer with the most outstanding complaints is fabio nunez, with 10 complaints and 18 allegations where most of these are categorized as forceful encounters. These include three recent substantiated incidents of nuna's employing now illegal chokeholds, as well as him beating someone with a radio club and pulling a gun out on civilians in the case involving a falsely infused and now exonerated teenager nunez even seems to have been involved in planting evidence here with the local motion still active. While I was still active, 34th precinct police officers openly planted evidence and violently intimidated our community, though this neighborhood has become one of the safest in the city. The precinct still employs many of the same illegal, dubious and, above all, violent tactics against our neighbors. Moving on to the next libraries. Okay, so not only have the precincts antagonize, our local community, the 33rd and 34th preference have long histories of ignoring and disregarding the demands and needs of our community in the cases involving off-workers canalian reynolds. It took national news stories and weeks of surveying sustained protests for the precincts to act and remember, acting in cannoli's case involved, promoting him not holding him accountable. So most recently on june 9 2020 dominique alexander, a black man from the Bronx, was found, hung in fort trying park in the middle of national protest over racism, as well as racist counter-protests. Despite significant community uproar, weekly protests and the national black lives matter movement, not to mention the recent history of white nationalists and neo-nazis marching in for trying the detective assigned to the case, ruled it a suicide within 66 minutes into viewing the crime scene and instead of investigating it further carolyn kenji losi who's. The detective on the case took a week-long vacation a few days after. Instead, it is apparent from these scenarios why there is a deep, pervasive trust and fear of the police, especially among the uptown black and latinx community. Our community has lived through the police, extorting stopping first and brutalizing them. We have lived through plainclothes police officers, shooting our neighbors and family in broad daylight and then being promoted. We have lived through the police, raiding our homes for drugs and then turning around and selling those same drugs, even amidst a pandemic in which the washington high south, was the hardest hit in the city in which its low income residents suffer tremendously. They have received thousands of fine which are still likely compounding where these complaints get ignored by the 33rd precinct, and many feel the fear that whenever the police are present, they could be arrested, have evidence planted on them and be charged and indicted without any way to fight back. Our police precincts have systematically failed to protect and build trust with our community, and we demand not just for them to be held accountable, but for you to join us in building alternative models of justice that can actually support and heal our community instead of brutalizing and incarcerating them. So how do we do so? While the 34th precinct has? Is that the seventh slide so catherine? You have? We have just about one minute, but I just want to just jump in really quickly. Well I'll, wait till you finish, but there's this one piece of information. I just want to provide some additional clarity, because I have something about it as well, but please continue. Okay, so I'll make this quick. So sorry about that. So how do we do this? So, while the 34th precinct was the first to implement what seemed to be a revolutionary new way of policing community policing? However, the data and community feedback shows that, despite this initiative, there is still a lack of trust. Transparency has not improved and, most importantly, we still need a way to transition out of our dependency on a system that treats civilians as enemies. So in 2010 the city implemented a program called the crisis management system. It's a local nonprofit to train and hire team of experienced and credible community members to mediate. Conflicts provide counseling and direct community members to social services that they need. The effectiveness of cms lies in the fact that cms workers are our neighbors who have established trust and they are trained to de-escalate rather than incarcerate our youth going further. The mayor has stated that he plans on even increasing the cms budget. These are the kinds of programs that our community could be advocating for instead. So please also remember this as you vote for the next city, council representative, local officials and district attorney. That being said, if you have any questions, thoughts, ideas or would like to join us in any way to help hold the police accountable in our neighborhood. You can please email me at this email address which is kmvargos29 at gmail and I'll, just open it up to any questions or comments that anyone may have. Okay. Thank you very much for sharing your research with us. Obviously, you know it's important for our community to work with the precincts to in, to hold them accountable and also help them do a better job. Also, it's important for us to listen to the community members who have concerns such as yours as well, and just kind of serve as a voice for both sides. I most certainly you know, think we have. We have moved our community in a good direction of advocating for greater accountability over the last year since I've become chairperson. I just want to you know, thank you all for coming today and helping and pushing us even for happiest time. These very difficult conversations you know, they're not easy to have at all. I also want to just share that. You mentioned a few things at about the fort tryon hanging event. You know, there's a lot, there's a lot of misinformation. I think out there about this particular case, because you know there were efforts to do there was there were a lot of different version of the story that came out, and I think that you know from what I know from speaking with the precinct. You know there was. There was first, this kind of uncertain this information, great area of whether the family wanted. Maybe the family had some information, they didn't if they did not share or the precinct had information that they were not sharing but they're from what I know that you know in addition to what you just said, there was a lot more that did happen to and to do investigations for the case, and it was it's still from my understanding is ongoing. So I don't know, although it did seem like, I think there was a statement about it being whatever what you mentioned earlier. It is still an ongoing open investigation for what I understand yeah it's ongoing, but they haven't been attentive to the case. So while it is still open, there hasn't been much progress and when the family does call there's no response or answer for them on the case. So while it is open, they haven't been too attentive to the actual case. Okay, all right! Well, I don't I haven't been, I'm not involved with communicating. I just know that that it seemed to be ongoing, but that is something that is most early of concern. Yeah. I believe I believe some of the local elected officials were also working on it with the precinct at a higher level. So sometimes you know with the community work. There are a lot of people working on different issues and sometimes the family feels more comfortable sharing information with you know the congress, member senator or the assembly person- and I know many of them have been involved with this particular case, helping at a level that is way above my pay grade. So, but I do, I do appreciate you braving it up, because it's obviously a concern to me as a man, a black man. I want to be able to run and park and also feel safe myself, but are there any questions any questions in general? Any additional questions for our present presenter this evening? Yes, danielle, have danielle and then we'll go to yamarus and then jennifer. I just wanted to thank you, catherine for your presentation. It was really appreciated and I think I just want already said. We definitely want to create a platform for create the space for any community members or groups to be able to vent during this time. We feel it's important to have all voices to have a space where we're all voices. We want to continue to have the police officers report on the statistics, but we also want community members to be able to discuss and to voice these concerns and with the ultimate goal of being able to work with the police and try to find solutions to a lot of our issues, and then I guess one more thing. I'm just going to say anybody that might be new is that we have passed a number of resolution board that advocate for the reallocation of funds toward services, homeless, services, community programs. You know we are ideas that can help be safer, be able to take those ideas or those suggestions and potentially turn it into a resolution for any to be able to use with their advocacy legislation. I don't know that was a mouthful, I'm sorry if it was. I hope it all made sense. Thank you danielle. Thank you very much. So there are some I just to clarify. I just want to let everyone know that community, the continuity board is not an investigative body. We do not investigate these sorts of issues so when I say that it is under investigation by the precinct and yes, we can, we can advocate for deep for additional investigation, but, like I said before, that is happening. It has happened. I believe that our election officials have been working on in encouraging a deeper investigation. That is something outside of our ability, as community board members just as advisory. So I'm not I'm not. You know saying that you know not I'm not saying that we don't. We shouldn't investigate. I'm saying that we are not an investigative body and we don't have that in authority. We can. We can encourage it through a resolution. We can help advocate by organizing helping people to organize or connecting them with local elected officials. But as far as I know, it has been done, and there are a team of, I believe our assembly woman de la rosa hosted a a call from the congress member who also worked on this issue. So I know that happened. I saw that over the summer, so orlando is on the line. If you have any additional information you want to share as a representative from the assemblywoman office. If you are able to speak on that new trip, though hi curtis, can you just repeat that one thing once again, I'm sorry I was right. I was just saying that I know you all did some work on the fort. Try the incident that occurred, calling for additional investigations. Is there any update with the public? Yes, we actually co-signed a letter alongside a congress member espana and we send it to the da's office and we have been corresponding with them. They're they they're, saying that they're still investigating the monitoring the situation and the assembly member spoke to the family of the black men that was found there. So she has been having a direct communication with us with one of the family members. I don't recall if it's the mom or the sister, but I could just verify one of my colleagues, but you know we've been really monitoring and I know that the senator's office as well senator jackson's office has been also paying attention to that and they're like we're working, not together on the issue, but I know they're doing their part on the side and then we've we sent a letter to the da's office about it to further investigate and we've been monitoring. That's pretty much it so far, so good! Okay, thank you for the update all right. So we have additional questions. We have michael, followed by paloma. Michael all, right, michael you're, mute paloma will go to you next, hello, okay, mike I'm sorry, michael. Can you hear me? Yes, I can okay thanks curtis. Thank you for the presentation, catherine. I agree. There's a lot of problems with the police and relationship with the community now and historically also. I didn't feel that in total, that presentation was very well balanced, though it was just anti-police and some of the statements that were made just you know like at the end. One of your summary things was that it's the police that are the cause of all the crime here, that's ridiculous. We had so much drug dealing and so much guns and murders here in the 80s and 90s. I worked a law enforcement job around here, sometimes in the late 80s. I have personal knowledge of this. I was born and raised here. You got to recognize what was going on here. You got to be fair and balanced if you're going to address these issues. If you just come and talk about the police officers who were the most corrupt and these isolated incidents, it doesn't do anything for us. Yes, the response to the department often was not as it should have been to those types of things, but, and maybe that should be the focus more than just certain individuals, but I don't have much confidence that our current mayor is going to be able to address. What's going on where this is a crisis right now, the department is not only not doing what they're supposed to do, but they're making sure everybody knows that they're not going to do what they're supposed to do, including the criminals. Maybe it's going to take some kind of shooting where a whole bunch of people get killed in a spray of bullets. Maybe then something will change. Otherwise, it's going to get worse from what I see and I'm not looking forward to it. Okay, thank you, michael paloma, you're. Next yeah, I say something first tell my clarify gosh, please respond to michael and then we'll go to diploma after that all right. So michael, thank you for vocalizing, your concern and your opinion, but one thing that I would like to clarify is that our focus of this is not to say that the police are the ones that are making the crime and all that, that's not what we're focusing on. We just want to hold the police accountable and, as I said before, hold them accountable on their misconduct, because there seems to be a lot of complaints from people about them doing stuff they're not supposed to do and they're not held accountable, as I've mentioned before. So like that being said, we just want to hold the police accountable on the misconduct that, like a lot of people, a lot of them have shown and haven't been held accountable. Thank you very much for your for that we're going to go. I totally agree and I personally have made a civilian complaint. Even in the mid 80s, which was substantiated and I was very young, then I've been a victim of that nonsense. I've got friends and family who are cops when they're doing the right thing. I support them so much. I appreciate them when they're doing the wrong thing. You know they should be dealt with very harshly, and that needs to happen absolutely right. Now we don't have a mayor who's going to implement the kind of things that need to be done. It needs to be really strong fundamental action. I mean really strong. Thank you, michael hello, yeah. It's really tough to go after that comment on michael, but I just want to say that a lot of this call was focused earlier on the noise complaints and calling 3-1-1 and what the solutions are to that, and I think that it's important for us to understand that when we're in this moment right now what it means, when you call 3-1-1- and you call the cops on black and brown people you are essentially leading to- could potentially lead to the incarceration of more black community and to the death of black and brown people. And I want you to think about that hard because you are putting people's lives in danger. What we have been seeing is a masculine by the police, and I know that there was a comment made earlier about an increase in crime and less policing. That is completely false because there's been a decrease in crimes across cities in the u.s, not just in new york city, and we know that there's a massive budget that goes that there's a massive budget that goes into policing in the united states and especially in local areas. So let's just get our facts straight, and then there catherine mentioned in that last slide about what we can do. Instead of calling the police there's been research led by city lab that talks about how in enclaves where you have between racial enclaves in different neighborhoods, which definitely exists here in inwood and washington heights, because we all understand that there's a big difference between east of broadway and west of broadway. We're not blinded by that right that we understand that. There's a big racial difference there that what you see is that there's less door, knocking neighbors talking to one another, having conversations and being friendly. So instead take the time to get to know your neighbors have conversations with them and stop talking about being scared of going to young men to going to young men instead of owning up to your own insecurities and fears about who we are in this community and what we represent. And secondly, when we're talking about young men. This is not only happening in washington heights and inwood. It's happening throughout new york city, because people it's summertime. Okay, people want to go out there outdoors because there's we can't be indoors at the moment, and so you have to give people an opportunity to also enjoy themselves, and this people aren't just coming to inwood because there's an influx that there's no absolutely no policing here, because that's a complete and total lie and social media does not say that at all, because if you are actually watching anything on social media, you'll see that it's happening throughout all the different neighborhoods and not just ours, and not only those that are black and latino majority. So I'm just going to leave it at continuing to call the cops on black and brown communities. It's going to get in summonses, because people were talking about two thousand and three thousand dollar fines on communities where the majority of people are making under 35k a year on working class families that can barely pay rent and you want to give them summonses so that we can create further displacement and increase gentrification in our neighborhood. I just want us to like continue to reflect on these kinds of things and what we like, what our actions lead to. Thank you paloma. You know this is we're going to move the competition forward. I do think it's really important, as we begin to think about how to reimagine public safety. These are the conversations we have to have we have to take. We have to look at ourselves. We have to look at and those around us and not just talk about police accountability, but just some to some of this point, our own personal accountability as well, the people who are playing lock, music or the people who are complaining about it. It's all about the community, we're all a part of the community, and I think one of the things that I really would like to happen from this committee or from the community in general is to find a way to have those conversations. Although it's never easy, it's never easy to have these conversations and we're all going to be uncomfortable, but we grow from our own comfort and we have to be. We have to be okay with being uncomfortable and moving this conversation forward so without further ado, we're going to move the agenda forward. I know there are a few elected officials on the line we heard from orlando, so we have orlando. I believe we have from carmen de la rosa's office, and we also have senator robert jackson on the line or someone from his office. So I would love for you all to say anything if you would like to make an update before we move on to our last agenda item, which is the capital and budget rankings for fy2020 hi there curtis. Thank you so much. This is chris from senator jackson's office. Hi everybody! Now you can use they them pronouns with me. I caught the tail end of the discussion on them. I'm really grateful to the chair for opening up the space for that kind of discussion. I think it's really rich and really important and for people who are interested in that discussion. I wanted to let you know that on september 9th the senator is going to be hosting a panel discussion on public safety and that's going to involve panelists who have expertise in alternatives to militarized policing in the areas of school culture, gun, violence, prevention and mental health. So we're going to be hearing from the president and ceo of fountainhouse, which is an amazing organization based on in midtown west, that does work with mental illness worldwide. We're going to be hearing from congressmen elect jamal bowman, who has experience as a middle school, founder and principal, with restorative justice in schools, students from teens take charge who are experiencing firsthand the effects of militarized police in our schools, also kari lazar white, who founded brotherhood, sister soul in west harlem about 25 years ago, a comprehensive wraparound youth programming and aisha seku, who founded street corner resources, which is one of the main violence, interrupters uptown. So I'm happy to send along to curtis and to anybody else, who's interested the details. You can also find the event on the senator's facebook page and on our eventbrite page as well, so I'll place those in a link here in the chat and anybody who has questions I'm happy to happy to take them. Thank you hearing none. Thank you very much chris. For that update. I will most certainly be of attending in attendance. That seems like a much needed conversation and a great next step to this meeting and as we enter the fall, I'm really diving a bit deeper in this into this topic as a community. Thank you, orlando. Okay. We heard from orlando earlier so I don't think we can move. We can move forward all right. So thank you all for the updates, the precincts, as well as our present presenters for this evening. It's always great to hear to hear from their community members. As I said, we are open platform for anyone to come and present on any topic. We may not disagree on these topics, but it's really important for us to hear each other and learn from each other. So please for free. If you ever have idea or a topic you want to present on, you can always reach out to me directly and I can see about getting you on the agenda moving forward as we discuss the agenda items for the next few months and moving into the internet as well curtis. Can you hear me now? I can hear you? Yes, oh okay, it's a matter of the platform. Okay, safari didn't work. I had to switch just very quickly from edgecombe correctional facility located on edgecomb 163rd we've recently because of covet issues switched to a general pop, as well as a women's work release facility before we were a residential treatment for parolees in the community, but for the time being we'll be dealing with a general population inmates returning to the community with 90 days or less, we have visits. We have all the coveted protocols. We have no positive. We've never had any inmates with colted positive results. During this whole pandemic, we did lose a couple of staff members due to Covid-19, but we haven't had any new Covid-19, my activity since may, and a lot of that had to do with the mandatory mask wearing presently there's a security fence project going on the area. So I know people had concerns about the sidewalk space, but we're getting a new, secure, offense that was budgeted over two years ago and they're finally doing the project. We anticipate that being completed by the end of the year. We, of course, make sure to try to keep the area clean, try to make sure that the population is not doing anything to bother any of the residents and we, as always, continue to be a good neighbor. So that's my brief report. Thank you, okay. Thank you very much all right, so we're gonna move to our last agenda. Any questions. I have a question. Okay, thank you! So much for just wondering are there? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you oh hi yeah. So thank you very much for your presentation. I was just wondering what services or, if you've, been if folks who were released were linked to care to case man, for example, fortune society or osborne or, if they're, sort of being relieved. Presently we still are doing discharge planning services with the population, but presently we're not allowed to have any volunteers come in, so normally we would have monthly resource groups where organizations like osborne fortune, ceo, a host of volunteer organizations would come in and present to the population and we're not able to do that at this time, but we still have relationships with those organizations. So the orcs, the offender, real rehabilitation coordinators, as well as odyssey house who's, the state contracted agency, giving services in the facility are making referrals for individuals as part of their discharge. We're going to dive into our last agenda item, which is reviewing our budget rankings and the district needs for last year and in advance of our meeting in october. I don't think we have to have too much of a conversation today. I just want to share our numbers from last year with the public, and then we can be prepared to make our rankings for the october meeting. So I'm going to share my screen again, just so we're all on the same page, all right. So what I did was I read through our district needs report requests from last year, just to kind of see where we were and what we were thinking. I think that the world is different from what it was last year, so this the narrative for public safety most certainly needs to be revised and rewritten. It looks like it's been the same language for the past few years, just perhaps not updated very much so I'll. Just show you all, as well as the public who's watching live. This is the process we go through each year to make our recommendations on capital funding for our for the community. So this is what we have for public safety. There was a lot of there was there were a few comments on increasing the number of police officers. So there's a comment here. You know requesting additional funding for police officers. This section talks about crime prevention programs and the really only example they give is to increase officers, which I don't think that's the only way to prevent crime, so that definitely deserves to be rewritten and we and we reimagine, as we move into the next few months and there's more context here on that same issue, and there was a comment here about a command post near diamond street. I don't think that needs to be there this year, an increase in technology, and we did have decibel readers in our budget last year, so we're gonna have to take a deeper dive and really think through what the greatest needs are. I do think we have to think creatively on some of the ways to have more programs for crime prevention and I'll show pull up the exact rankings from last year. So last year we ranked this is our capital ranking. We had additional upgrade for emergency response system. Yes, who danielle can you zoom in at all decibel readers? We requested additional decibel readers. That was a concern. Last year there was a new item we added light tower within the 33rd precinct. There was a particular area with a lot of crime. It was really dark, so the precinct requested where they gave us information that led to us adding this as an item bariatric stretcher was for in fdny, mainly for the parks and being able to. I guess this is something they didn't have, and this was the two cameras. I don't think we got that last year the two argus cameras for the 33rd precinct that would have been placed at edgecomb and riverside drive, well, edgecombe drive and the other one on 155 and riverside drive. I don't think that's needed any anymore. The situation has most of these changed over there and there was also the request for atv vehicle, which that is probably not needed, so that is, that was last year for the capital priorities and I'll go to the next. This was the wait. These are the same documents. Okay, I don't have the other document here. It's gonna be the same one all right, so we have to. We have to work on this. I would advise the committee to go through these documents in greater detail. We are going to have to rank them next month. In order for the exercise we have to share with the board in november. So our next step is to look at all this information read through the narratives from from last year as well, and I'm going to start to hopefully work with the district manager to make recommendations on revising this explanation. I'm not sure who wrote this. It was not me last year. I believe it was the chair bro before me, which was richard lewis, so maybe revising this as well to coincide with some of the more needs that we see in our community. Currently. Are there any questions about this process next steps and what we should be doing so our homework is basically just to read the document and then come to our meeting next month, prepare to discuss and make our rankings that's our homework assignment. Are you gonna send it around curtis? I will send it around I'll, send it around cool. So are there any questions? Comments final concerns from the community or from the board. I do have you know or new agenda items. We need to add for the remainder of our time together, new business. Are there any new business items or final thoughts? Graham, you haven't said anything all meeting. Graham, do you have anything to add? Oh, it shakes my head. No, I don't have anything I so I actually was just wondering. Does anybody know the demographics? I I'm just curious of the current of the force. The precincts now is that public information we can find out. We can find that I'm just curious, like the offer, the demographic information of the officers yeah how it reflects the community. I will request that information yeah all right, thanks all right, so hearing none. I guess we need a motion to adjourn. Is there a motion to adjourn motion to adjourn? Is there a second? Can I say one thing: okay, yes, nancy! Please yeah! Oh it's paloma, o paloma, I'm sorry! Yes! No! We so catherine mentioned at the end of how we changed the narrative or around policing and there's nothing more important than our elected officials and one of the programs that she mentioned specifically receives discretionary funding from city council members. So we want to make sure that we're asking the right questions and looking for the right answers. There will be a candidate's town hall tomorrow on 190th and wadsworth in that little park area there. It starts at 6 00 pm, and we hope that folks come out for that. Thank you for sharing all right, so we had a motion and there was a second all in favor. Raise your hand perfect. Our meeting is officially adjourned. Thank you. All! We'll be meeting again next month, first wednesday at 7, 00 pm any questions or comments in between you can always email me. My email address is cdn23 gmail.com. Thank you all have a great night. Thank you good night.
