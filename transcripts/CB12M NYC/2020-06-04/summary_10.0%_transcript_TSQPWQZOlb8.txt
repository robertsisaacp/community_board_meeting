There are a handful that you know regularly provide their comments, but I'm really looking for all committee members to, let me know- or you know, make cases now- it's Chris who is preparing the minutes.
I might take an initial look at them, but get back to both of us to let us know if there are additional things that you would like to add, or if there a question so that we can take care of that and I would say.
The same thing is true: when I circulate to the committee reference information, there was some information that I circulated to the committee pertaining to both the BSA application that we'll be considering, but also the West 158 Street rowhouse district I think the resolution that the board passed years of I circulated that for reference, so that committee members, who are not committee members at the time, have some background on what we're talking about.
Thank you not a problem, and so with that, before we begin, let me once again introduce myself I'm Wayne, Benjamin and I chair land use for community board twelve and before we start the presentations.
I would like my fellow committee members who are online to introduce themselves I'm, starting with Vivian, to cut Vivian, do cut I'm to your right, depending on how you look at your building well I'm to the left, looking at the screen, and so the next one looking at the screen is mr.
Well, speak to the committee tooks to the community board chair and give me that update, because the attendance list that I have does not include you, okay, so that's why we speak and then I also see a number of literally brand new community board members on line and if you each would like to like unmute and say hello, that would be great hi everyone good evening, Jimenez here, Leo good to see you hi.
This is for a special permit to allow a school or school use to be placed in a building that has c8 zoning and the CH zoning is, you know, simply put something that it's really more automotive focused and I also mentioned in at that time, and at last month's meeting and then circulated for reference to the committee members.
The community board passed a resolution several years ago asking the Department of City Planning to rezone various c8 districts in Washington Heights in wood, because that zoning designation really does not allow for any residential development and a community facility cultural, the things that you know, we say that we need more of see.
It's a renovation of an existing building at that time, I think both the traffic studies and the environmental studies were not complete, so we recommended that the applicants coordinate with our Health and Environment Committee, our traffic and Transportation Committee and our youth and education committee, so that those committees- although this is really just asking for permission to put a school use in a CA district, those committees- would have interest.
All of those meetings took place in May, and so we then suggested that the applicants come back to us too, for us to more formally consider that so with that I turn the floor over to Richard LaBelle, who is counsel representing the applicant as well as any of the members of the wind charter school who are present.
So you know I think we're here to talk about the specifics behind the results of those meetings, the special permit with focus on traffic and environmental issues.
I think I would turn it over to Amanda who attended all the meetings and kind of guide some of the various team members and professionals that we have regarding the consideration of the factors than the special permit sure rule, so we're joined by Tom Glock project, architect.
Tom. If you want to share your screen, you can show the presentation that we've shown various other committees if it's helpful to walk through the plans of the building again I know.
A lot of questions had a very good discussion and really you know all the all of the all of the committee and meetings were generally positive.
It was more about coordinating unloading and loading on the street because they also have buses, and you know, vehicles for people with special needs or handicapped individuals coming and unloading to the building.
Some committee members have not seen it so I would do a quick presentation of you know what the floor plans and elevations look like.
What's unique about when is that it uses El Sistema system of using music as a way of providing primary education to kids, in this case K through 5, and so all the kids go to have music twice a day and then also the performance they learn instrument starting in kindergarten I mean in first grade, and then it culminates in a series of performances over the course of a year, and so as many charter schools is, we've done.
We've never done one at this size that has a little theater, so the organization of the building is based on is sort of based around that on 80, underneath 1st Street you come in past the offices and reception and welcome area, and then on the street level is a 400 person house theater that can house all that can stage a performance with all the kids downstairs are the rest of the music classrooms and then because the rear yard is lower than the street level, you can see Street here, there's two kindergarten classes which give them kind of direct access to the outdoor, which is helpful because they don't have as far to go, to get to the recess space and moving up to the building.
Now it's a tight gym, but for K through five school it provides a good space, for you know the active play and the curriculum that goes along with physical education, and that is in the back of the building and then moving down.
The youth education committee asked- and you know, I mean I, know the answer, but they wanted to make sure the building was accessible to you know: students who have disabilities so as a newly renovated building.
We've tried to create these kind of core areas and both stairs and the elevator access that so, whether it's someone who needs to use a little bit or on a teacher or staff or admin or students, obviously and Steve, Simon who's, the chair of our Health and Environment Committee, but also a member of land use, he's going to be late.
You know existing ambient noise levels, including noise associated with the FDNY vehicles across the street, and then what we did was we looked at occupancy of each of these terraces and so that noise of the children playing is added on to that ambient noise to determine the level of basically the thickness of the windows and walls and the level of attenuation.
So we I did that analysis and we specified that attenuation level, and we also looked at the potential impact of students playing in these areas on adjacent buildings, and we looked at a number of different receptors and actually did a very detailed line-of-sight study to see how high each of these enclosures around the terraces need to be.
They would have had an active system where you had a fan and things of that nature, but they decided just you know, and we do and I work with schools a lot.
The interesting thing is since this building is currently used as a garage converting it from a garage to a school actually reduces, not increases the number of vehicular trips, but I know there was still some discussion about.
So we had actually, you know, collected data on the existing wind location and looked at where the students are reside and how the modes of travel in order to basically prepare a preliminary model of the number of vehicle trips.
Assuming that you will coordinate directly with TNT on that right, we would be coordinating directly with them, and it's important to note that for an application like this as a threshold level, finding the school needs, we need to the environmental studies which support of the legal findings of this special permit.
You know what is being asked of land use is something very specific and the I'm sure Health and Environment would want to be updated on.
You know how the studies and mitigation measures are developed and those are things that you don't need to go land use for.
Actually it would be great if you could also send us this information because it looks like it was presented to youth and education, but this would be good reference.
Yeah 27% from the Bronx I think with the and it says, 70% reside in Manhattan, but looking at your map, I mean it seems to be heavily concentrated in Upper Manhattan, right yeah, which was you know, that's kind of the point that I'm raising about the fact that we really do feel that this survey that was completed of you know existing with students, is going to be representative of what we wouldn't, but it might be Charlie.
So, like they'll come into the school, you know when we were in the building and then, though, they'll get like an inside look at everything and then also because all of our historic families are clustered in this area.
You know waited way to share about the work, and so our current families tell other families who also live on the same block, and you know it just kind of grows.
And that's you know kind of a touchy issue with a number of folks but you're actually with this project moving out of the public school building into your own space.
So you you'll be able to continue to provide the school program to local residents, but you will not be occupying space in a public school building correct and you know just as an update, I think it was two weeks ago, although all the days are blurring together anymore, I think was about two weeks ago.
Comments from the committee and I can't see everyone, so you'll just have to unmute yourself and you know be careful not to speak over one another yeah I have a question: Wayne go ahead if I remember correctly, when we spoke about it last month or maybe two months ago or three or maybe three I, don't remember, but in any event there the building the current structure has like two and a half or three and a half story, and only one like a half of the parking on the roof will be enclosed or there will be an envelope around that or something is that correct, yeah I can I.
Maybe while now you're planning and thinking about you know renovating the entire building me I thought you may want to be sort of in compliance for 2040.
But you know later we could I would say that's an interesting thought and also see b12 is supposed to have, although it has never been active sort of a infrastructure task force, because one of the big questions is what is the capacity of the electrical service in this entire community to support any major?
Okay and you know I guess we should actually move to have the committee consider you know its position or this application, but something that we have not discussed.
I just want to point out to the commit, because that we might have touched upon it briefly in February and I think it came up at the exec committee meeting in April in preparation, and that is, if you look at the materials that I forward in the last couple days, which were I, guess the applicants response to be essays.
You know there were 13 14 sites other than this that were considered before they ended up here and, as it turns out, I understand that you did look at space in the building that it's being constructed next door, but the problem is, they could not give you the floor to ceiling heights that you need to accommodate the music program because they would have to have either if they were.
That's a total of eight one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight okay are there so for our new committee members who are present that would like to vote.
Those participants are considered like public people, so they're, not speaking in your panel, but if they want to vote, you can ask them where they can post a question to your answer through the Q&A.
If you want her to speak, let me know I'm sure I mean.
The next item on the agenda is an update on the West 158 Street grow house district, something that has been presented to the committee and the community board a couple times over the years and the parties involved.
When the Audubon Park historic district, which is the base the residential buildings just north and west of the Audubon Terrace historic district, when that was being proposed by LPC back in I, think 2008 2009, the Land Use Committee and the community board fully supported that.
If you look at the history of the development of what used to be the Audubon estate, those row houses are actually older development than the apartment buildings that were, in fact included in the historic district and while the apartment buildings are wonderful and they're.
Indicative of you know the kind of pre-war apartment buildings that were developed and a representative of the urbanization of Upper Manhattan, driven by the both the extension of the number one train, moving north and Riverside Drive being extended.
What's the status of the you know, action to designate the area so we've reached out to Vivian and to Matthew to give us an update and with that I will turn the floor, or maybe the screen over to them and Matthew need to unmute yourself.
The buildings on either side in the Audubon Park historic district we've come back with sort of answers for all of those things.
Wayne I'm sure you know and say it right off the top of your head, but the folks in Albany, who are the coordinators for National Register status when they reviewed the Audubon, Terrace, Ark designation reports and then looked at this row, the immediately symbol.
Of course, the group, the grouping that should be included in a historic district, would have Audubon Terrace, Audubon Park and these row houses, but they subtracted a couple of apartment buildings, 158th Street that are actually outside of the original historic over here and say: oh you're, a compass of Suman, Terra I, just let Paulo know the whole conversation was being blasted so Vivian.
That shows that Bailey spoke at who, whose family owned six thirty West one to the eighth Street starting in 1967, and this is a picture from when we had a meeting at River Terrace to describe what we were doing and then we also had I guess in November we discovered of that year, 2016 the last of actually not the last, the last frogs to be living in that building passed away and somehow mysteriously it.
Is the cultural history of that particular block in relation to the Audubon, Park, historic district and also in contrast to it, one of the things that we didn't include, and actually we didn't know, and if it's okay for me to plug my book I will I have look on the Audubon Park coming out in September.
Let them know that all right, well, okay, well, I, don't think that comment earlier was necessary.
I wonder if any of the committee members particularly committee members who are seeing this for the first time, have any questions or comments, and if you so, you would have to unmute yourself and I would say, hearing none and seeing none Viviane, Matthew I think this was wonderful, as you can tell you know, there is continued.
/ comment: yes, I'll see: okay, can you go back to the slide that show all the buildings from it's kind of when you go down that no keep going the older picture, the older picture?
If, though, somebody or maybe want some of the owners thought about bringing back the railing I know it's a small detail but I in my view, I feel that it's it looks really uniformed here and it's actually highlight the building's the way it is now.
Everyone has their own style of railing and fences or whatever, and it's somewhat like I feel that it kind of take things away from the buildings that that's the comment that totally up to them, though, and - I know it, but I am putting it out because I look at that, and it looks so nice and then I, look at the last photo.
