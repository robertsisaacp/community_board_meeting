Just bridging community engagement, okay, I, see Orlando from Carmody LaRosa's office is here and I know which like to say, introduce yourself.
I'm hoping tonight that we can dive into some of those issues, hear concerns from community members about things that have conspired in our community as well as around the city, and hopefully the goal is to have some action steps and some next steps we can take as a community with their leaders and as a committee, to take to our full board and also to share our concerns with larger audiences meeting, is being recording and so I'm hoping that we have Peter.
That did not need to happen and I think that the situation you know is from what I saw in the video footage was authorized by the brother by the NYPD.
In my sleep, which has been doing a lot of positive work in the uptown community and the whole was to just provide additional reporter businesses and to try to protect the neighborhood, and but here we were saying but I do think that the that the that the it was sort of a positive there was a the goal of just traditional support to businesses.
People were being kept up all night, so they're there a lot of complaints and there's a lot of complaints about the drag racing and then in particular, I wanted to know, given that there was big heads up because there's stuff all over social media yesterday exacerbating the situation at Dyckman I, wonder how you prepare for something like that.
Do a resolution from the committee that calls on our electives to you know fully repeal 58, because if so, we would need to sort of have just a quick agreement on what the provisions would be and vote on it.
One on funding, so I would like to just open the floor up to conversate your comments on of my people in my PD funding issue, and if we felt as a committee that it was appropriate to somehow do a resolution to link all those issues- Mertes, yes, no, yes, it's great I think Graham wanted to jump in Graham was that you yeah go for it.
How do you consider- maybe you know, keeping things like their Street graffiti genes that we definitely need now?
Okay, come I'm, sorry I'm, a little concerned about suggesting coding or moving forms from one area to another, when we don't have people who are sitting on the table to do that type of negotiation and making sure that the money goes to the right areas that we are that are needed.
I believe that we do in this particular conversation is the reason why I do think that both of these resolutions repeal at fifty a and ways to reallocate the NYPD budget require a very specific view on them, especially in the case of the budget.
Now, when it comes to the budget, and just give me about a minute to say this piece of it, I can definitely understand from folks how you know the phrase defund NYPD or anything like that.
It's exactly what Curtis said: there's better uses for the money than the hyper militarization of our police, for instance, and that's why it when it comes to you having a specific resolution for reallocation of the budget and really on all of this and think you saw me proposing that link.
My name is Sean Thank You Curtis for you're, inviting me to tonight's Public Safety Committee meeting I like to just say that to pretty much follow what Nobles were saying, which was remarkable in my opinion that we spend more money on policing, then our mental health services, affordable housing and youth programming combined right, so I think that when we're talking about defunding I can see how that can be, and you know every word for many, but keep in mind that, if we're just saying reduce the NYPD's budget by a million influences, that is not eliminating the NYPD, in fact we're simply restoring them to where they operated to 2013 and 2014, and it would also provide a lot of benefits for our youth, which I think is very important, and so it's really not as radical as people say.
What support I'm going to make sure that we're cognizant and maybe we can, the resolution can speak to equity and how those cuts would happen, because the reality is that there has been an increase over the last four or five years in the NYPD budget, and we want to ensure that when there is a cut that they're not cutting the black people that actually work at the lower end in regards to salary in the department and we're talking about, for example, the traffic these safety officers, those to help the crossing guards, the majority of them are women of color, and if the NYPD, like any other agency, is asked to take a cut, they're gonna.
All of the important points that we should include in this I think including that term, specifically, though, would be great and really important, and perhaps not using language like defund NYPD, but sort of you know, reallocating funds and making sure that and showing our support or even occasion of funds, and so I guess I would be in support of having two separate resolutions.
Don't know people have strong feelings about 50 a spending alone, but you think we could perhaps have one reso that addresses a number of those legislation item together and then separately this Arezzo on the reallocation of funds.
There's a package of let goes from black and Latino caucus and the city level, as well as a statement, so it may make sense, look at some of the existing resolutions and what's happening, I'm there and maybe lumping CCR hate getting with that and keeping the budget equity separate.
So I agree with you on that package of ten items which are all addressed: police reform and so I think it'd be really great to sort of have all of those things together because it ultimately fifty a is getting at.
You know more transparency, it ultimately be police reform, more accountability and so I think they so I think we are one quick comment: ok, yes, Sally redirecting to community-based programs, but specifically with regard to people with mental illness and responding to calls for mostly disturbed persons.
Ok, second, so there's a motion on the floor: well not on the floor in support of community board public safety committee supporting a full repeal of 50 I.
Is there motion on the floor to create a separate resolution of tackling the issue of budget equity?
So when you're saying a resolution on budget equity and voting on that, I mean I'd like to see.
It is a we would focus the language on a budget equity and the things that we throughout the meeting, particularly the issue of maybe even looking at what Mark Levine is already advocated for advocating for reallocating funding to healthcare education, housing, youth programs such as SYEP Mark Levine, also mentioned a funding.
There's a comment in the chat about restorative justice, training, which I think I would prefer seeing something like restorative justice initiatives, because I don't know that the police are the right people for that.
So you know these things are all of a piece and I think if we try and get super specific on exact numbers of dollars from here or to there, we get way in the weeds.
You know, process exactly and I think it's also then easier for people who may have disagreements about this or that particular thing to unite behind the concept that when we say defund the NYPD, we're not talking about disbanding it all together and saying you know fuck it we don't need cops.
You know with a number of where Rex is talking about our budgetary priorities in general and some of the efforts of our local elected officials, including feedback from constituents that we support NYPD, a reduction in the NYPD budget that allows for an increase in the budgets of some of the other programming and social investments in New, York City that achieve our collective goals of equity, justice and fairness.
So we have the opportunity in this resolution, to talk about what that means and to kind of recapture that language and to say something like, whereas when people talk about defund, NYPD they're, not saying disband it, they're saying spread the budgetary love so that we can pay for some of the other things that very necessary that go hand in hand with you know: justice.
There I think that, as long as we say something general like when we say defund, we don't mean disband all together, we mean shape a budget that funds some of these other things out.
That's going on to acknowledge how people are protesting against funding the NYPD, so I think we have to use our, whereas to describe or to acknowledge that there have been excellent number of calls made to define in my PD during this time period, and we focus on just acknowledging it and did making it more, maybe defining what the fun means we'd have to go into we're advocating for defunding.
I want to jump in I feel strongly about, including first of all, Thank You Liz, for what you for your comments, because there was an item last year in the public that came from the Public Safety Committee about adding additional police officers and we modified it shoe include or to say, police training and specifically for a mental health homelessness.
Since youth and so I think my feelings would be to include some of those sort of general buckets and not maybe get so into the weeds, but include things like Sally mentioned.
It should be, but I do think we need to have a place where community can come and share their concerns, as well as perhaps learn about another issue that we've tackled tonight.
You know there are a lot of things that we have to continue just and hopefully resolve in our community, but I do want to acknowledge.
