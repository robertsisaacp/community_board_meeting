She was so happy, but in this cases that I'm really similar, it's just heartbreaking, just heartbreaking, I know so I don't know, and then this community, what is also driving me crazy, yeah I, think that we are missing something the arguments that usually have is limited and I.
Don't think we are doing a good service to the community, because people from community that comes to committee meetings or to the general meeting I'm not going to have full information of the leader period time that we have with this type of system, no matter how nasty some people guessing our meetings but I think that is a you know.
In-Person meetings in person are more productive and this ain't you know, that's my that's my take it's comfortable, because if I am, if I want to drink water, go to the kitchen, I can come back right away and do the same, but I don't know somehow I don't feel that I'm functioning the way it should.
Let's see what let's see what happening after the primary you know, Aisha is running against me for the state committee I know, I saw them doing a campaign like your food, like she's, going to have a salary of two hundred thousand dollars a year.
Yeah I'm, okay, I'm part of the things you've been here a little bit of part of the things you've been hearing about a couple people speaking previously along at home and what Maria had to say about zoom meetings and Technology yeah.
I wanted to get like a more global perspective on what's happening in our community and there were more than 50 people on the zoomkour.
So this is what bothers me because then you know the people who are listening probably feel or think that we feel similar to them, and that is very dangerous, very happy, my name's, you know, but that was exactly the problem.
My sense is: it gets just as much done as a meeting and then the other problem is what Maria is said about people's perception of meetings and perceptions of the community board.
You know it's been overall just overwhelming since the beginning of all of this, just the shift in everyone routines right and now to throw in all these virtual room meetings and the technology and having to learn a whole new thing.
I have birthday parties I've been to a baby shower I've, been to you know all kinds of celebrations, because this is little life we're living now, but I'm hopeful that my September there'll be some kind of change right when we're back that things will shift in a positive and we can have some kind of no normal.
No, because they just mentioned summer camps are opening at the end of this month and we have summer times yeah and we have summer programming all summer long so I don't know we're gonna have to cross the bridge when we get to it as of right now they only said summer camps, but they didn't say that a facility like ours could open so I think we have to determine and see, and you know, ask people for guidance on it.
We know the seniors are the most highly vulnerable population of all and so I feel pretty strongly that we've got to do our best to be protective, but also be able to offer the services that they needed.
So that's sort of where we are right now with more info to follow as the city rolls it out like you, I expect that the actual congregate, Senior Center meal program will probably be the last face.
I have about seven phone calls from people said: I need an air condition, so I just don't know it today break then I will text you Maria I, have a contact or actually Richard you have it right of where the seniors should call I can find it.
You know relative essentially that if the air city start requesting a whole lot of information about it's like the people of, if you have leaves in your apartment, they can provide you restarting you know manifested, but if they don't who qualify and who doesn't qualify, the person who is in charge of the apartment I have about seven calls so far.
Are the new business para Mary, okay, married one other thing on air conditioners, the first question we ask people is: do you have a working air conditioner now so that this program can be used for is for pink?
From the last meeting, there was a lot of discussion around what we could do for the first bell for the Isabella residence and I've actually been talking to Betty, and she has turned spoken to the Recreation Department and what they've come up with is that they would really benefit from having some magazines, some spiritual reading books- and you know, they're.
So if there are people on the committee and who have neighbors and friends and relatives that would like to donate those kinds of reading materials, I'm willing to transport them up to -, Isabella English in Spanish, English and Spanish ships, mostly Spanish, but yeah I- have a lot of National Geographic, but they had in English and they brand-new.
Okay, that'd be great I, don't know if they want 20 years worth, but no it's worth everything is that mean you'd.
You know we talked about to the future of the meetings, because, if zoom continues, our seniors from the community are not gonna be able to get in on these meetings because they don't have the equipment, they don't have the technology.
She can't get him Miriam James who's on the committee has not been able to get him so I, don't know it's difficult, but at best the other thing I have on the agenda is we talked about a lot last time is the long lines at banks and post offices and stores of all kinds and making it very difficult for the seniors and the disabled.
If anybody has any suggestions, I don't know if we want to try to formalize a resolution and put the my sister said that I talk too much.
So this is why Julio Batista for some of the community businesses around here, those little markers where you know like if six feet from you know each other and the Apple Bank is very good because they said of chairs individual chairs every six feet.
Yeah, no senior sang everybody, so I think that some of the businesses may accommodate some people.
Amazon fresh all these services, like my point, is because I know a lot of elderly people.
I, don't think everyone thinking that you know the world is gonna end I need to hoard crazy amounts of food and I think when that was happening, they were saying: let's give the seniors an opportunity to get in the supermarket early.
I know they're doing it at the food town and Broadway as well and 231st, so I'm not sure what else is going on, but that's where I think the thought was where it started their early access.
He says I used to say you know you can't do you can't do them, how to go shopping for milk I mean you buy a large kite song and since I said, oh no I go and I see my friends and also it's fresh, so I said I think the same melt that you put aside yesterday is you're buying today, but there are people who do that, especially seniors in my community in this area, where I live, it's like really a low-income type order.
You know that are doing delivery, including Gordon Gorman, that you can even call them and tell them you a list and they'll deliver Richard, you were gonna, say something yeah and I was mostly its agreeing with what's been said.
They have someone, you know sort of monitoring the doorway, especially if there's a long line and they let a certain number of people in at a time.
What might be you know more along the lines of what I need or want all right, I completely understand that, but I think that in terms of people not going out at this time in terms of being protected in terms of not standing on line, there are limited options right.
They prefer the Hat food I supposed to call vegetables and things like that or they have to you, know, take home, and you know and cook and since like that, so it's we need to talk about economics.
How do we, you know who is putting these things together and there's a lot of sin being thrown away and it's criminal, because people needs food.
I have few buildings here that they have committed himself to deliver the food for the apartment, that I know the people that need and I'm they are.
Okay, you know what we had decided some time ago that we wanted to talk about the budget in May and we didn't talk about it and maybe cuz everything else that was going on.
I want people to start thinking because you know come September and you know nobody has looked at it.
You know, as things go, there's a lot of things to think about and consider what we want to ask for.
I mean a list of sins items that we really needed for the aging communal community and for the senior some of the Dyatlov senior centers sit on that you know and that Camellia, so everybody is pushing for you know whatever they want, but now that, with this pandemic, we may be thinking about how we go into there or the seniors are going to be drilling.
With these senior centers provide services for them, because now that everything is going online for lying and for your mother-in-law, we need, to, you know, see how we can, especially for the early seniors many people between 55 and on, as opposed to the very elderly that are not going to get.
So we want just the two capital budget items today, but I leave them if we can just move right but I'm, saying the housing, let that go with housing, but make sure that they include seniors.
You know to do this thing so I admire because of that is just I think you know just trying very hard I'm talking about you for a lingua, oh yeah, I'm saying do we want to have the mental health issue number one?
I think we need to know what the committee thinks I mean I'm, not involved in senior centers, so much I.
Hmm I mean I, don't know what do you think for what's linked with mental services, because if we isolate that people may know way too much of them, maybe they won't rank thing.
What we want to do include I'll leave that I leave that to foreign further I'm gonna say: let's make the geriatric mental health it's its own item, okay, yeah and I would say number one but like I said I'd like to hear as well I agree well, you'd be number one Oh see any thoughts.
I just want to push this up to the top, because it's so big right now, okay, I, think we're good on that any announcements, everybody house, no the only thing, I hope they improve the quality of the food that they deliver.
Someone like it is printed that has that type order that it's not going to be they narrowing the pass for people to you know to use the sidewalks and I was looking at this.
In the day, yeah like this morning meetings, we actually tried having this committee meet in the evening, because we wanted to get more board members involved and it didn't work and, of course, and of course we had no seniors attending the meeting because they're not going out in the evening I, don't I, don't know who the new members are I mean somehow I miss the you know any presentation of a new members, because it's very difficult to do it this way, but they have they appointed anybody over 50.
You know involving no mustering, or some of them will be interesting in you know, seniors issues seems like that was from the beginning, I'm, the one that said of this committee.
If people individually bring magazines to Isabella, let them know it's from the community board: Asian Committee!
