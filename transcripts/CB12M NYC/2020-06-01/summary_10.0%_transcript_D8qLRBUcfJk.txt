In our community board district, I'm gonna, let we I see, we have a lot of names, jennifer, hi, mabel, jess, jesse, lyle, I'm sure I'm missing, jackie, lazaro, and- and so, if you guys just you know, introduce yourself to so omar, you can grab the names and all of that- and I will hand it off to you.
It's really nice to see many of your faces, and you know hear your voices it's nice to feel connected in this way and first I just wanted to take some time to extend my regards to everybody joining the call.
I wanted to thank community board 12 for hosting us tonight to share our plans to expand city bike into northern manhattan.
Thank you to all of our elected officials, the bro president's office, councilmember rodriguez's office, senator jackson and all of your elected staff for your continued support and partnership and feedback on all of the dot projects that we've worked with you on so far, and thank you to all of our neighborhood partners and community stakeholders we're looking forward to hearing your feedback after we present our plans to you tonight.
Our partner lyft has been busy installing new stations across community boards, 9, 10 and 11 in manhattan, as well as in bronx cb1 since last month, making citibike a four borough bike share system.
So, as I mentioned, and as debbie mentioned, we're here, to get your feedback on our proposed station locations around the district and we're focusing our presentation tonight on the southern portion of the board from 155th street to 184th street we're going to take the feedback that you share with us tonight, make adjustments to our plans over the next few weeks and start to install these stations over the summer and we'll return to the board to present our plans for the northern portion of the district later in the year, with those stations being installed next spring.
Yep great all right, so thank you again for joining us to talk about bike share in washington heights and, first I'll, just start off by going over the basics of bike share and the city bike program in new york city.
So, as the city grapples, you know, with the spread of covert 19, d.o.t is working closely with city bike to ensure that new yorkers have a safe way to get around town and lyft, and the dot are working together to ensure that there is an increase in cleaning efforts at depots and operation vehicles, as well as near high use, medical facilities and understanding that access to transportation.
So you know, as with our other expansions, we wanted to know where residents of washington heights wanted city bike stations, so we held a community board workshop to gather feedback on location preferences into and then, if presidents weren't able to make that we also held three pop-up outreach workshops throughout the neighborhood at various community facilities, and there was also an online feedback map where people could drop pins, also stating their preference for locations.
Participants were asked to place, yellow and red stickers to indicate where they wanted city bike stations to go, and so taking all of those comments through the outreach we synthesized them and you can see in the dark blue circles is where there was higher community preference for city bike stations and we also in creating the draft plan, tried to eliminate sites that were unpopular or might be an issue for lyft operationally and those are shown in the in red on this map.
But first I just wanted to reiterate some of the things that jennifer mentioned at the beginning, that we will be installing in this community board in two phases, and so this summer we will be installing from 155th street to 184th street 30 stations and that's really to create a contiguous service area across upper manhattan and the bronx.
So now we will move on to the last portion of the presentation and we will review the draft plan sites and, as mentioned previously, this first phase of installation will be from 155th street sorry to 184th street, and I also wanted to note that the draft plan presentation is available online at our website at new york city, dot, gov, slash bike share under the maps and plans tab for easier viewing, so now I'll review the draft plan sites more closely.
Have a station plan for the east side of amsterdam, avenue south of west 156th street also on the sidewalk, but along the building line there moving west, we have a station on the south side of west 157th street west of edward morgan place and that is a road bed station and then, as I'm sure, you're familiar there's a street improvement project along much of this area along riverside, and so we will be coordinating two stations in this area following further coordination with community board and residents and other stakeholders for that project, and so moving north to broadway.
On this slide, a sidewalk stationed along the fence line planned for the north side of west 163rd east of riverside drive all right now.
We have a station planned for the road bed on the east side of amsterdam, avenue south of west one second 172nd street and then final station on this map is a sidewalk station planned for the curb line on the east side of fort washington, avenue south of west 173rd street and then now we're at the northern portion of the area.
And then the final station for this draft plan is the road bed on the west side of fort washington, north of west 183rd, and then I think I actually the last one is on the east side of cabrini boulevard north of west 181st street, and so that's what those are the draft plan sites and so now we're available to take any questions on the city bike program or any sites in particular that you may want a little bit more elaboration, but thank you for joining us and for listening to the presentation all right.
We are gonna, try to be pretty strict about two minutes per comment and if I could, let me just see, I think we have and I'm sorry that I'm not, I don't know the order, but omar, do you want to kick off in terms of questions?
Now, there's about a couple hundred e-bikes out in the system, let's plan to add by their count thousands of more e-bikes into the system by the end of the summer, the e-bikes naturally just ebb and flow from you know one part of the system to another part of the system, but we can make sure to tell this that the board requested that there might be some additional rebalancing of those e-bikes, especially in somewhere, that's as hilly as washington heights and inward.
That'd be one of the high priorities that they continue to replenish e-bikes at a higher rate up here, because of the disparity in the in the neighborhood in terms of height difference in elevation gain okay and then the question about the parking who's going to take that yeah.
The two stations for the area under you know with the street riverside street improvement project there right and mobile.
It's a priority and very important to the community board, and so we just wanted to make sure that we balanced your needs as well as the needs to create you know a meaningful network of bike share stations.
There are three bike stations that will be, you know in the street or whatever you want to call them, and I presume they will remove parking spaces, and there will be much anger about that.
If I were, you know in tr- and I didn't time myself shameless, but I'm going to stop as soon as I'm done our criterion up here is we don't want any parking spaces removed period because anywhere you remove them?
Do you know what I'm saying like that station is presuming that that's then a one-way street with all the changes that were approved so that station is planned to be along the bike lane on saint nicholas avenue on the west side there.
So I'm happy to jump in here, and I know I think debbie your office might be right across the street from that location on one on st nick and 166th street.
What we're thinking here is exactly what mobile had mentioned is that the station would be installed in the road bed in the parking lane adjacent to the bike lane closer to 166th street, but our field staff did find, and we all know that, there's the ongoing construction- that's happening closer to 168th street and we can continue to coordinate with dbc to see if there's any way, once construction wraps to see.
If we could utilize that space and decrease the potential parking tick in the area, no, I no my point's a different one, which is that dot proposed all these changes to that air yeah and on that block, there's.
Actually it's creating a lot more room to do things, because it would be going one direction, so it's adding like 20 parking spot whatever.
Yes, we do coordinate with our other units as well, right, okay and then the other thing that I think might be helpful and then we'll open it up to the other board.
So, as you know mentioned in the presentation, any construction projects that come up that might impact the footprint of the station, whether it be on the sidewalk or the road bed.
I do also want to say that jim and debbie and omar, we hear you that parking take is definitely a very serious issue across the district and we tried very hard to balance parking take and you know utilize the available and feasible sidewalk spaces that we did identify but parking removal here for city bike expansion into cb12.
We can't have shorter stations than that and sorry, okay, I don't know if I had some and then as the system grows some stations but the patterns for ridership changes and so some things that might be at the northern portion of the service area.
I guess what I'm saying is a station is successful, given, like a you know, maybe a short amount of time frame but yeah.
I think that's a very doable thing and actually you know, should certainly be part of your submission for consideration, and, secondly, would it be possible for us to have reporting on a monthly basis with the technology I would.
I would guess, presume that you'll be able to track just how much bikes are being used up here, so that if we, if the use and as kind of debut is alluding in the cases where, if it doesn't, you know really require a lot of bikes that a reconsideration could take place because, as jim was saying, we are in a very parking stressed.
If I can trust going back into a train system anytime, soon, like literally anytime soon and as soon as we get called back into the office city, bike is probably going to be the primary way that I actually come from home to work and back.
Sorry repeatedly on the road bed from the corner of 157 in morgan, south to whatever the length of the road of the dock, is correct, so it's actually going on 157th street from the corner with morgan place west.
Thank you and debbie, I'm not sure if you're hoping to consolidate all of the comments and questions for us to answer as a group, but that might be you know just a good way to get that get all of the feedback to d.o.t right.
Maybe then, if you want to you, know wrap up before we go to some more board member questions.
Thank you very great, so I definitely would appreciate if those two questions, I had one about the parking space loss assessment if that could be included in a future submission just again for transparency, give people some idea of the total loss of parking spaces and also, if it's possible, to do issue a monthly report use report.
Every time the bikes are at a depot or when their operations photos are at stations, they're also making efforts to sanitize stations more frequently at near medical facilities, but it is yeah an ongoing process to you know to continuously keep that clean the areas.
Okay, so because we're our back and forth are starting to add up to a lot of time- and I do want to say it's not actually.
Research and you know folks, have really taken to creating and doing creative projects with the data that's available on the citibike website and in terms of the exact parking take across the board when we do come to transportation committees to present on our draft plans.
So while we don't have those specifics just yet, you know it is something that we take into account when we come with average station sizes just to share and give you kind of a general idea of what you'll be seeing across the board, and I think it was jim who did a little bit of calculation about the average.
If we're actually looking at the screen, I know there's only three road bed sites that are shown on this particular map, but you know, as you can see, there's a network plan where the station is approximately three to five minutes away or three to five blocks away from its next station.
So those folks going east need to you know, have the sight line of southbound traffic yeah, so I think it cut out a little bit towards the end.
You know that may take more than 30 minutes, so someone wants to travel all the way, downtown I'd say to chamber street or something that's going to take a while.
You know: dock a bike if you're nearing your the end of your time limit and then undock again or in some cases able to go to stations and to extend the time limits so that you, if you wanted to take a longer ride, that you would be able to do so, ebenezer chanel, I needed keana diaz, I'm putting the panelist and I somehow maria luna fell back to attendee status in terms of raised hands.
You know mature people who might not have credit cards, and they might be left out so little bit concerned about how you might be addressing that issue for stability purposes, where some of the members of our residents might not have access to a credit card.
I think I'm just concerned that if you have this issue all times that we're going to be adding up to be one of those, we don't want to be one of those.
I want to make sure that my people have full access to this price, because you know what we're going to suffer.
So jesse yeah, if you can just keep up, keep close to us on this on that question all right, so I've got the list on the public attendees of jerry, culligan, dimitri cotembes, jack, vogel and phil bethel, I think, wanna.
The first thing is: there are only four stations around the hospital, which means that there's a hundred bikes for the hospital- all you have to do is to walk to the corner of 165th street and fort washington, where the people who work at the hospital leave their bikes and they leave almost 60 bikes there right now, you need more stations there.
I think you really need to reassess the parking going to the center of the street, so they can do the city bikes along the sidewalk, as I suggested, and the final one is the 166th street and st nicholas station.
I guess my question is the selection of the plant city bike station locations gonna be complemented with a decisional bicycle infrastructure upgrades such as protected bike lanes, because I feel, like infrastructure, also comes in hand with the expansion of the system, because you're basically going to make it safer for so many other people to use bicycles as a form of transportation and actually achieve better utilization of your system as well.
I just would like to urge for like okay jimmy I'm sorry, we've gotta, we've gotta just stop it there and then thank you, but and then, of course, as you know any time that kind of thing gets proposed, you know to come back here to traffic and transportation.
Approximately 75 of the households in cp 12, don't own a car and as one of those households, I would really like to see city bike stations located on the road bed actually, as opposed to on our already crowded sidewalks, where possible, but thank you to dot and thank you to the community board for this forum.
I think we got a lot of notes and we will share that with dot, but if people could email ebenezer our district manager and with something in the subject line, you know citibank expansion, input and then he will get those to me and I'll consolidate feedback for dot and dot you just.
I know maybe bruce, can you know we can take a look at that because they, the bikes, will go against the little park between, but it's called in catania payan, where the boss number six comes through from broadway, make a left.
We have to consider elderly people in our community that cannot afford not, for they cannot use bikes to you know as a means transportation.
So you know you have to think about that all right people.
So much all right, thank you, maria and then so I know dots heard that, but clearly a lot of you know 157th and edward morgan concern as well as the other observation and then just let us know when, and you know, as things do develop when you'll have more specifics about the pending information at riverside oval.
We've had so much going on with with the mta and the coven moment, and you know on a few different dimensions, and so we asked howie to spend a little time with us and just sort of update us give us a view to sort of what comes next as we, you know, as we start to some people getting ready to go back to work, and all of that- and you know also we've had big changes like the cleaning, regimen and the closing of the stations you know between one and five so howie, I know that's a little amorphous, but if you could just give us a general overview of sort of what's been happening, how it has been going, you know with the changes that you've had to make and sort of what comes next we'd.
I just want to say that up front, but just to start off with some of the broader changes that I think most people are aware of, but you know have been big changes for the mta and european transit since I've last met with the board, we're still running essential service at this time, which is intended for essential workers and essential errands.
Our elevator replacement projects at 181st street on the a train and 191st street on the one train remain on schedule at this time and I think, as most people are aware, the bus shuttles that we were running to help with service ball as elevators are out or temporarily suspended, and that's been true for about a month now we plan to resume those shuttles when the pandemic concludes and ridership returns, particularly at 191st street on the one you know we're monitoring ridership.
I trust you and I want to you know, make sure it's taken care of personally so right, but it's simpler yeah, if I say to somebody 511 rather than call community board, ebenezer give them an email so forth, and so on yeah we're certainly not going to post.
We want to be able to take care of it and make sure those bus drivers are following this policy, and you know letting all of our customers, you know, use the bus in the way that they need to.
Thank you all for the time and an update really appreciated very concerned about some of the bosses in the washington heights area, particularly the 181st street san nicolas and rowan, where on the bus stops, it's actually not accessible for any riders because of the back door as you use.
So I I put out you know: I've asked ebenezer and eli just sort of how that needs to go, but I don't have any feedback yet, and but I thank you for being here and then yeah so we'll circle back sounds great all right thanks again, yes and it's good to see all of you and hear all of you and again, I hope everyone stays safe and well you as well howie regards to team mta.
Thank you howie same to you, man, all right, just a few, a few items- newish business, oldish business first on sort of new things that are bubbling, but is that we've had two groups express or people both actually coming in from community board.
You know the riverside drive, work and so the short answer and, as everybody knows, the issues of the part of the proposal that related to the middle drive and making that one way southbound are sort of left unresolved and we have- and we obviously asked for sort of like more clarity on sort of what the options were, and we weren't ready to consider that I've asked dot to be back at our september meeting and so that we have an opportunity to get a more full presentation of that aspect and have them.
That's going to go through our response back to dot on that presentation, and then third, I should actually, I should say, and bruce you're, probably getting at the fact like weren't, you gonna, say something we are right.
So there's a few different ways we're getting at this, but I think if somebody's got additional feedback on the city bike thing, they need to put it through us and I will consolidate it if they have comments related to the middle drive issue.
Will you come back to us for like a little sub moment of considering the city bike stations that we didn't get to see that are in the riverside area?
You know for that last project that we had, but we can take a closer look if need be at that western portion by edward morgan, broadway 157, depending on how things go between now and september yeah.
I know that we've been going through our different projects to see what can be done, what resources we have and the time frames, but definitely I can see where we stand on that and see if we can, if it's a possibility for it to be done during the summer, but yeah I I'll see, I can find out for you.
