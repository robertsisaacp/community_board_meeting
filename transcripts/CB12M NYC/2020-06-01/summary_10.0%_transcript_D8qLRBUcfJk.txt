I wanted to thank community board 12 for hosting us tonight to share our plans to expand city bike into northern manhattan.
Our partner lyft has been busy installing new stations across community boards, 9, 10 and 11 in manhattan, as well as in bronx cb1 since last month, making citibike a four borough bike share system.
So, as the city grapples, you know, with the spread of covert 19, d.o.t is working closely with city bike to ensure that new yorkers have a safe way to get around town and lyft, and the dot are working together to ensure that there is an increase in cleaning efforts at depots and operation vehicles, as well as near high use, medical facilities and understanding that access to transportation.
So you know, as with our other expansions, we wanted to know where residents of washington heights wanted city bike stations, so we held a community board workshop to gather feedback on location preferences into and then, if presidents weren't able to make that we also held three pop-up outreach workshops throughout the neighborhood at various community facilities, and there was also an online feedback map where people could drop pins, also stating their preference for locations.
It's a priority and very important to the community board, and so we just wanted to make sure that we balanced your needs as well as the needs to create you know a meaningful network of bike share stations.
I've been actually a city bike member since 2013, since this thing first launched and You know outside and not have to do public transportation in a different way.
and then so I know dots heard that, but clearly a lot of you know 157th and edward morgan concern as well as the other observation and I think, as most people are aware, the bus shuttles that we were running to help with service ball as elevators are out or temporarily suspended, and that's been true for about a month now we plan to resume those shuttles when the pandemic concludes and ridership returns, particularly at 191st street on the one of okay, so anybody first from traffic and transportation A first question: I saw a recent report that the disinfectants that mta has been using on the trains didn't meet certain standards and I wonder if you would speak to the metrics, how that's measured I will say that just the safety of riders which I've received so to be safely, can you can you not hear me very choppy So I was just going to say that the in terms of the safety to customers of cleaning solutions and disinfecting solutions that they're all epa approved- Some concerns had bubbled up and I haven't heard it again, but I just want to make sure you haven't heard it when there was a switch to the rear boarding on buses that was sometimes leading to people who were trying to get on with a wheelchair or needed some assistance, additional assistance in boarding not having access to the front where they needed to be or not being seen and not being able to board, and so if anybody on the committee has heard more about that we haven't so, first off mary, I'm really sorry to hear that.
