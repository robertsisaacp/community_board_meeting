That's clear why people aren't appearing in the Q&A, so I'm going to dismiss those questions that relate to that and then I will begin with a little bit of welcome.
So it's 6:35 which, by my measure, only running five minutes late, not so terrible I'm calling this meeting to order I want to welcome everybody again, I think we've got the administrative and announcement piece out of the way.
Shall we that's a classic all right, I'd like to begin with a moment of silence, not only you know, just to honor the upheaval and oppressed that has been happening in our community in our city, all over our country and, frankly, all over the world and for many reasons, they're sad, although I personally am optimistic.
We are just continuing to be mindful of it and I believe we will be circulating petitions over the summer and having an update on that in the fall and moving that to a resolution and a recommendation to the City Council in time for their December Street Co naming bill I'm going to put a footnote to here to just ask Jennifer when she gives her report to give any updates on parks, usages prohibition, suggestions, dog, runs, playgrounds, anticipated openings, any additional closings that kind of stuff I think it's probably easier.
Don't have to talk about that, because that curfew is over I, think that so far in terms of protests, demonstrations and rallies I want to thank Chris and all of his colleagues at the 34th precinct who have done in the in the protests in which I've been a part in this community have done an extremely good job of working with the community and I other people may have had other experiences, but from what I have seen and heard the three four has done.
A good job working with the people of the three four and I think that's the difference between being policed by a precinct where you know the officers and they know you versus having a force of officers from other precincts who do not know the community just sort of come in and not really know who they're dealing with hold on a second sorry about that.
So if y'all can just kind of think about that and at the end of the meeting we can check in and make sure that works for everybody and then I by Bastille Day. It is couturier hello, so that's all of that actually show of hands up body language smiles thumbs up, does July 14th work for you, committee members.
Yes, okay, let's see, okay, so we'll assume it'll be scheduled again, we don't need a quorum because we can't conduct business but I think it's a good opportunity to check in with each other about all things, parks and arts.
Someone said I would love to hear Park speak, but please note that the amplified music without permit is so loud in Inwood, Hill Park at the moment that it is actually hard to hear you so not going to talk about this at this moment in the agenda, but if you can also Jennifer just roll in some information about what to do about that.
Sally I see your hand I'm actually going to call on you last because, as a panelist, you have lots of opportunities to speak and I want to make sure that everybody else gets a turn.
I know that many of you have joined this meeting because of an interest in the last item on the agenda, which is barbecuing rules and facilities in northern Manhattan parks.
I know that some person posted extensively in and around Inwood Hill Park a flyer about this committees plan to expand barbecuing in into one of two areas in Inwood, Hill Park, either the Indian Road lawn or one of the soccer fields which soccer field was not stipulated in the anonymous flyer.
We've got 74 participants, which is fantastic, but I do want to let people know that there is a zero point: zero percent likelihood of expanding barbecuing onto the Indian Road lawn for any number of reasons, most importantly of which is there, is a complete violation of FDNY regulations and it's a terrible idea.
So if you could just very quickly I wanted to know, we want to know if there's going to be any park monitoring or forcement at Fort Tryon, the last few days, besides myself, seeing it, many people have seen mopeds, including the what is it called the rebel?
So maybe you can put that into motion may be handing out mass later on in the day, I'm sorry and then wanted to know about the dog rent opening, because people were curious and then lastly, in case you haven't realized all the downpours.
That's more a part of Jennifer's report, so I saw her writing notes and I look forward to hearing her answers when she gives her report later in the meeting next, we've got Julia Attaway the newly appointed executive director of the Cabrini shrine welcome I just wanted to pop in and introduce myself.
We've been also doing some workshop for kids and we are actually very proud to be participating at Uptown arts and culture group collaboration among with 14 other organizations uptown to create a summer camp, and it's gonna feature music, dance, literary I'm sure somebody from NOAA might be speaking on this in detail.
You know the issues that had so era, there's like 15 organizations and we're all taking like an hour to during the week to do something that people could sign up for espera, sign up their kids, and so the registration I, hopefully, will be made available to your to the community board to help us express that Noma has been taking the lead on that.
Next, we have Shiloh Holly from the morris-jumel mansion, but before we get to Shiloh I just want to respond to something in the chat someone asked: what is the motivation for enlarging the BBQ area in Inwood Hill Park?
Once again, I would like to welcome you all to the meeting of the parks and cultural affairs committee of community board.
Since it's the last item on the agenda, I would hate for people to be like fuming about a misimpression, so I want to just be really clear, and then we will have the discussion in its time in the agenda, but thank you so with that Shilo Europe hi Schuyler from the morris-jumel mansion here.
Thank you so much quick question for Dirk East, Ramos, I'm, gonna unmute, you and just ask you: are you speaking on behalf of arts, of a cultural institution in the neighborhood, or are you asking a general question, perhaps related to barbecuing, no I'm deputy director for up clown stories, so I wasn't sure if my name was showing up properly since I use someone else's Lane got it, but well, in that case, uptown stories tell us what you got.
We will be kicking off myself, isn't seeing Broadway beautify Broadway initiative to help take care of street free beds, you'll be hearing more about that and then obviously, we've been working with the super street Stuart's in forestry on invasive species removal, hopefully getting them back the parks as soon as we can do that, but just stay tuned.
If you're still here can you need me to share screen with Jennifer know if you can promote, if you can promote Tyreke and also can earth soy, two panelists, okay, and if you can make me a host, so you already host I already am and then that way, I think I can I missed the other name.
You gave me to the other, so it's can earth soy and the other name is Tyreke thank fantastic, okay, MS hapa, so on behalf of the New York City Parks Department and Lotus music and dance I wanted to let everybody know that this year's drums along the Hudson, our annual Native American and drumming and dancing from around the world festival that usually happens in Inwood Hill Park, is going to be virtual.
It's not happening in the Sacred Lands of Inwood Hill Park, but we're delighted to have connected with joy and so everybody tune in June 20th and we'll ask the community board to send out that link to everyone outstanding yeah.
If you can send the flyer and paola, if you can just be ready for that and to send it up, it's a wonderful event and I'm delighted that it's happening virtually and last but not least, I'm gonna turn it over to Martin Collins to give the noma report and just while he's speaking in addition to listening to his every word, if there's anybody from a parks or cultural organization that I missed and who would like to give a one or two minute presentation.
We will see a cavalcade of paintings from art stroll past courtesy of the chair of parks and Cultural Affairs, the Elizabeth loris Twitter, yes, Liz we'll be in the house for our June 25th open studio, and you won't want to miss that a couple of programming notes about events coming up in the next couple of weeks, and you can see our website Noma NYC org, that's n, om, a NYC org first is the uptown arts and culture summer.
But if you happen to bump into him virtually or in real life, wish him a happy birthday and thank him for all that he brings to the Arts in Inwood and northern Manhattan threw in with artworks he's, been doing a lot of really interesting programming, virtually including a virtual Film Festival and singing storytelling, and it's really quite fantastic.
Are you reporting for an arts or Parks group, or do you have a general question about another agenda item Allegra LeGrande going once going twice, I have unmuted you.
So, if you guys can unmute yourselves great, at least I'm just going to quickly introduce the other panelists and then I'm gonna sit back and be a panelist for the parks committee, great okay, Katarina Rivera, who many of you know is our founder and the fundraising coordinator.
Oh, my goodness and Anastasia actually emailed me separately to let me know that she was going to be giving a presentation.
First Street I just want to give you guys a few quick updates our summer on the Hudson programming series which operates throughout the park is working on bringing virtual programming to our audience right now.
Unfortunately, because of a the parks, department is not as far as I know, submitting permits for four fields and athletic courts, and things of that sort so cancelled.
You know a strange year for that, but we have gotten an outpouring of people who have been writing to us looking to help us take care of the park like actually hundreds of people.
So it's been challenging for the volunteer program staff like myself to kind of figure out how to get people started in the park safely and all of that, so that's in the works.
I can share my email if anyone themselves would like to get involved, helping, take care of the park or know someone or, if you're affiliated with an organization that would like to arrange for a group project in the park.
Oh sorry, okay, one last thing on a citywide scale on the Conservancy, we're really involved with the Playfair coalition, which is a multi-year campaign looking to get the city to allocate adequate and equitable funding to its parks and that's a citywide thing.
Right now, you know we're working really hard to make sure that the city doesn't cut funding for the parks, as it's slated to do.
I believe it's looking at 60 million, plus of cuts right now, which would directly impact like more than 300 parks employees around the city who could lose their jobs.
We want to increase the amount of affordable and healthy food available in Washington - in wood, and also increase residents, awareness, knowledge and self-efficacy related to topics like urban gardening, nutrition, healthy eating and food justice issues affecting our community, our organizational history.
But we have a garden bed and every year we've been able to increase our presence with them in a number of different events: expanding our programming over the years we started with inviting youth into the garden and hosting family garden days, then, into that we received a double of our funding from citizens committee and we added another garden bed with New York restoration project, and we started our annual fermentation workshop, which has been really wonderful: a nutrition workshop series and weekly Guardian hours.
So in the first year of gardening, we just hosted events about once a month or but now, with the weekly garden hours, we invited community members to come in and harvest with us on a regular basis and be able to take free, fresh produce home with them.
They were submitting an applications that we've signed on as a partner with them, and we have obtained formal fiscal sponsorship through a social good fun which, if you're in the nonprofit world, you know that's a very big step for an organization that year we were featured in the Manhattan Times and also in a video that's up on YouTube that was produced by tastemade for REI and it features when they're cove and why our piece work in US as well.
Damn right, I would think you Katerina I would like to talk a little bit about what we do in a regular year, at least in the last three years, and this is going forward what we plan to do for the coming years, as well, of course, expanding with new activities.
So, instead of following the months, we followed the seasons and during the harvesting season, of course, our primary focus is on gardening and on the garden space, and this is the space where we can meet with people from the neighborhood from the community through having these weekly open garden hours, where community members can join us and when they do, we would help them show them: basics, gardening skills and also, if there is anything to be harvested, they can obviously harvest with us and take home some of the fresh produce to their homes.
We do organize potlucks, usually around holidays and Thanksgiving, so to bring our members and, of course, anyone who would like to join from the community together and last year we have had our first holiday gift, making workshop - a workshop where members or participants would be able to make gifts that from sustainable materials related to some of them related to food, some of them not to be able to give to their loved ones, and that was a big success and participants expressed great interest to have us do this in the coming years and we anticipate to turn this into a tradition.
Now the idea behind this at the beginning of this year was to create some sort of a coalition of groups from the both neighborhoods who are seeking the same goal of trying to establish more community gardening spaces across the neighborhood, whether tied to organizations or open to the public.
That, of course, makes our fundraising campaign even more vital and more important for us in order to weather this crisis and I think we have one more slide if we can move on to that, and what do we ask from community Ward 12, and we would appreciate any support to help us find space that could be suited for egg garden could be associated with an institution or free unused public areas.
We are also seeking partnership with interested organizations who work with families in the Washington, Heights and Inwood area, and, of course, if Community Board 12 can put us in touch with them or to help us to get in touch with people.
We know we are aware that this is not going to happen in the height built Highbridge Park, but we would like the community boards help for advocating for us or for organizations across the neighborhood to use these funds allocated for community gardening for in Highbridge Park to be used elsewhere for a similar purpose to create community gardening spaces, and that would be, of course, greatly appreciated in any sort of help that might come in that way.
I will say that if we did not have an important but short presentation about art in Fort, Tryon Park a robust report from the parks department about the many questions that you heard burbling up and then a fairly extensive discussion about barbecuing or not, and the rules and regs around that throughout the board.
We've had as a Capitol item for a while wanting to identify places in the board for additional community gardening I understand there are some issues with regard to lead in the soil and protection by fencing and I.
Think Jennifer had some points about that, but I saw first up Danielle's hand and Omar's hand, so I'm going to take questions from them first and then from Jen, then yeah.
Well right now everything has moved online, unfortunately, because all of our events require people to be in close proximity, because the garden beds are not that large and, as you have seen from the pictures that was not going to be an option given the circumstances, so everything until further notice until we'll see what happens is online right now.
So, even if we wanted to implement social distancing guidelines and implement some sort of activity there we're not permitted to access the garden right, okay, yeah, it's there are many things that we can do online, including this online gardening kind of hard.
Moving on sorry, so sure I think parks through our green thumb program is very supportive and scaffolds organizations that are looking to do this on existing green thumb garden sites.
It has 10 feet, high steel, picket, fencing and it does those early so that the level of control you know modulates and it's staffed all the time so also started out as sort of a children's garden that particular use so going into another area, fencing it off, taking away what it's been used for and then restricting access creates sort of legal issues.
So when we were looking at sites, you know first, we had to look at what was it mapped park lands because of the restricted hours aspect of a community garden and people having to be members to participate, except when there's a public program, so we have one site in the entire sector: that's unmatched!
It's also part of the forest sort of buffer area of the map forever wild forest and again you'd be displacing people use it for picnicking and gathering you'd be displacing that and having restricted hours in an area that have always been, you know, open and available, but it's not Park Lane.
That's maybe like currently not used for anything other than say you know it's a vacant lot because then you're not just placing an existing use- and you can, you know, put in fencing start with clean soil raised beds, okay, I'm, sorry, who's, that Sally yeah very quickly, and then I really need to move the agenda.
As you know, you know there is a community group that has gotten access from the do-e for that gated area and they have been doing a lot of the stewardship and the cleaning there so that, if something were to happen in a green thumb way, we'd want to make sure that both groups collaborated, turn I, think the challenge is we'll.
Yes, okay, no I, think and I'm getting a little ahead of myself, but when we get back to Danielle's reso, we can include that in there I really want to get to Ayesha get to this dispatch.
Yes, okay, I just wanted to know if any thought had been given to the possibility of using vertical farms that could be either outdoor or indoor I've seen some really good work being done with that, like, for instance, in the Microsoft facility on 42nd Street.
Anybody who's ever been to a meeting that I chair has heard me say that I think that group writing exercises are boring and tedious and I don't like them and I don't, engage in them, but I'd like to try and get just by peoples show of hands and of course, half the board.
Members have picture smiling pictures of them on the screen, so you look like you're smiling, but I need to see your faces, so it sounds like there's broad consensus for supporting urban gardening for putting forward a motion calling on you know the board and the parks department and the relevant community based organizations, specifically washing eighths in wood, food Council on possibly NY RP other, you know maybe Anastacio and her and the Riverside parks Conservancy, all the various parks based organizations working together to identify possible areas for urban gardening looping in Board of Education the possible school site.
Yes, those about saying and I would say, especially considering the fact that the two areas that the food transfer identified are not usable right, daddy need soil mitigation, there's a whole bunch that goes into this, but I think the next step and again I.
So with that, we've got presentation on proposed temporary art installation in Fort, Tryon Park, I Elizabeth, here I can share my actually says: I need screen, sharing ability.
We're happy to let you know when it will actually be going into the park, so it may look like it's made out of stone, but it's actually made out of plywood plaster, resin and exterior paint.
It will go on just because we haven't had a site visit yet due to social distancing, but we will meet there to find a location that won't impede regular news of that area of the park and in a place that you know gives both the park and the artwork justice and I don't know if zach wants to just share some information about the artwork and the inspiration or about his work as an artist yeah I can do that.
People will sit on it and I think the wear and tear might actually help it, because yeah it'll make it look more authentic I think that's super cool I love that I just love that okay, we've got Darrell, who is back I, think I did I successfully promoted.
The plan is to feature it as part, the Battle of Fort Washington, and you know we hire a woman channel or to be Margaret Corbin at that reenacting festival each year, and this will happily be incorporated to work and we want the four train trust we'll invite Zach, along with the parks creme, to give a artists, talk and try to have some sort of reception, so people more people can hear sort of the backstory.
We move to Jennifer's Parks report and I know that a lot of people had questions that they were throwing up into the chat and just know that all of the panelists are able to monitor that including Jennifer.
It updates I just want to make sure that everyone on this call knows that the Parks Department has partnered.
More importantly, though, it can test up 2,000 people a day, it's ours or 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 8:00 p.m. and there's no out-of-pocket cost no appointments needed and that's a to 301 Amsterdam Avenue I also wanted to give a shout out to the park staff.
I'm, not sure everybody on this ball knows, but the parks department has been a part of eleven ongoing food distribution sites and we've given out twenty-seven million meals during this pandemic.
If you're approached by a coyote make yourself look bigger than you are waving your arms and making loud noises, and then you know you can continue on your way once the coyote retreats so I'll send around this coyote smart in English, Phoenix I got Donnie in, but we wanted to make sure.
The out falls, you may know we get, unfortunately, runoff from the Henry Hudson Parkway bridge, we okay, we have a budget cuts, allowing we've already programmed some state of good repair capital funding for pathways and Inlet $800,000, so that will advance that will help some of our more problematic pathway areas where we need to do more plantings, where we have drainage issues and surface issues, because the water scours the paths and as Jennifer Bristol mentioned earlier.
So here's the thing I, don't think that a resolution calling on the parks department to reopen the dog runs and to figure out how to do that safely is actually the best way to go, because that's a little too slow a resolution would be.
Guess there's not a lot of time to explain all of the nuances of this but I'm just trying to understand, given the fact that there has been an increased presence of NYPD and Parks Police in the parks and just everything that's happening in the world right now, I'm, just really trying to understand like how it decided when parks and forces something versus when NYPD enforces something and if there's been like a decision made to increase it to a by a certain percentage right now, because I'm just I'm noticing a lot of police in the park, namely Inwood Hill Park and the Dyckman fields, but we maybe have inspector Harris speak to that and Amy. Can you hear me I'm sorry little louder inspector yeah?
Can you hear me yes, okay, first I'd like just for you guys not on being able to see me I was having problems with my video earlier, so I just wanted to apologize to you all and hopefully on the next call.
So that's a reason for the increase in the police officers in the park, but we've also had an increase in who want fog and, as you all know, she's seen in the news.
It was regarding potential because my concern is if somebody who works with about five hundred kids in the summer right, what it like the parks department has to and then I thank God Steve is here, like you have to take ownership of what are these kids gonna do check outside in a block you know like there has to be something that work together with the nonprofit's figure something out, but these parts have to be open to be able to provide services to these kids, like you can't just automatically assume that they're just gonna stay home.
Inspector Harris I just want to point out there's a lot of chat going on about a current condition, as we speak with respect to a lot of amplified sound up in Inwood Hill Park.
So, even though people did a good job of cleaning up, you wouldn't know that, because animals have come and had a field day, there are a number of environmental concerns.
There have been some specific questions in the chat and through email about why there is barbecuing on the peninsula and what hill Park, as opposed to the Dyckman fields, which is also part of Inwood Hill Park, and then, when you can clarify what the permissible areas are I'm going to open it up for Q&A and I'll, be taking stacks writing down the raised hands in the order that I see it also helped protect forests.
I guess yeah Steve, if Steve, if you could take over well I, just want to add that there is an area in Fort, Washington Park, which is not under Jennifer's jurisdiction, where we allow barbecuing north of 150 history going up towards the soccer and baseball fields going up towards the Discovery playground.
Oh I'm, not sure that there is okay, I'd like to start going through some of the raised hands.
Unfortunately, right now with the barbecuing and she said, the budget cutbacks I wasn't quite clear on what that meant for the spring summer and fall I walk my dog three times a day in that Park, because I live a block away and on Mondays it's basically a it's a it's a trash pit and there's they're congregated around the limited small trash cans.
But it's a trash pit, every Monday, and so if what I was hearing Jennifer's say is true, is she saying that there won't be people to clean that up in a timely fashion through the summer of 2020, and what that will what the park will look like I have seen a huge increase in the number of people using the park, people who bring full backpacks thinking the woods is literally a full was and I'm like it's not that deep people I did not understand her comments to be that my understood or comments that the seasonal staff, which is like the playground associates, but those are the ones that have been cut.
The decision called on Steve I just want it for people who do not know this.
I mean that's where we stand at the moment, so, okay, so I was so I'm connecting the increase in the use of the parks, the increase in people barbecuing I know it says you're not supposed to barbecue, but people are and the fact that there won't be people I'm used to saying hello to all the people on Monday mornings who come and pick up the trash that sort of gets scattered.
It's really important that we find some answers regarding reopening the parks, a lot of people cook, things that are actually deadly to dogs, not just dangerous or annoying, but deadly.
So right now all we have are the general areas where everyone else is and the woods and if we're not, if we don't have the Run, which is a sacred space for the dogs, I'm really scared, especially if there's going to be a decrease in the amount of people.
We wanted open, but there needs to be something because people will just I mean the park is just there are no rules in the park anymore and no one's gonna.
My name is Joe I live by Inwood, Hill Park and it's the first community board meeting I've been to in years and I came to me because I saw that flyer and my heart really sank.
When I saw the flyer, because I thought it was pretty unwelcoming I know, III see the peninsula from my window and there's lots to you know: there's an impact on quality of life when there's a lot of people barbecuing in the park, but I just think there are things we should keep in mind.
As someone who lives near the park on the park with a view of the park and say that, from my perspective, the part belongs to all of us a lot of people, love barbecuing in the park with their friends and family, and we have to support one another and if it were on the table, I would support an expansion, BBQ area and that's all I wanted to say.
It's really important that I mean people have brought up about barbecuing about having things to do and I think that part of the culture of our lives is changing, and so much of it is an opportunity for us to make changes in a positive way.
You know for early Monday morning or things like that, even though we're not supposed to gather what have you because I think as a community in word is very special and we want to be our nature.
As I said, people want to clean the park.
The first thing I want to say is because we didn't really address why this discussion or how it was born, why we decided to add it to the agenda, and so I had proposed it at the last meeting, because I observed over several years that the barbecue area is tend to become very crowded and that there's a need right.
So I think that if there's a community need, especially given that we're in a time of Kovac when we should be social, distancing and granted, the barbecuing areas aren't yet open, but we're gonna be moving in that direction, and so I guess my thought process was okay.
I do think it would be nice to expand to the along the Hudson, where or sorry along the Harlem River Drive like where that sort of enters there's like a portion I, don't know what that is called, but I think I've observed people barbecuing there and I think that going back to what people have said about resources in trash I.
Think that my like another thought that I had in raising this is that if we do officially expand these areas, then it would allow us to argue for additional resources, part staff and trash receptacles and things of that nature.
If it's efficiently designated so I understand that people are very concerned about trash, and perhaps we can talk about ways to address that, like you know the receptacles, maybe we would want to shut it down for a portion of the day and you know volunteers, can you know, help collect trash like the park staff?
You know certain time frame, I, don't know I guess my hope was to bring this up to add it to the agenda and then have us all as a community kind of come together and discuss what our feelings are, so that people can enjoy the barbecuing areas because it tends to be very crowded and yeah.
We work from home and we love this community, but we have our parks system and we need New York City to invest in the people who actually stayed in New York City, and it's not just about the trash pickups.
So what I would like to ask Jennifer is understanding that there's a need for resources in certain particular areas to be able to accommodate and thank God, the chief of staff for Manhattan this year.
In the part we had an overwhelming amount of people come to our basketball games, so we bought extra receptacles during the summer to be able to create a system where we thought the park isn't trash stuff that we're done right.
How can ordinary people come together to if we purchase the garbage, can is parks going to be able to pick up the garbage?
The question around resources is, if you are so, if it's a calling for you to bring more resources, uptown then I encourage everybody here who goes that way to join the defund NYPD movement and, let's use some of those resources, be reallocated to fuck to the park, and we could use that because it seems like there's a need and no for the neighborhood Karen's right.
I wasn't expecting that right now, but thanks just actually a couple questions and I'm not Steve still on the call, but you know obviously there's a problem crash after grilling.
But again it's a staffing issue and until we see how this new a budget shapes out, shakes out, I, don't know you know, I, don't know that we're gonna really have a good sense of where we stand and, as Jennifer pointed out, you know we did in the FY 2008, with the help of New Yorkers for parks and the City Council.
Big dumpsters with the noise I would like to see some signage in the lawn like little lawn signs temporarily to let people know that might be more visible to where the noise is coming from and then I would love to see something organized like community service hours to students that might be able to volunteer in the parks to pick up trash on and volunteer that way, something for their resume.
Jennifer can you address I know that earlier it was stated that volunteer days are curtailed because of kovat I can say that the parks department has a very robust volunteer program.
Our organization is called partnerships for parks, so you're all welcome to go online and look it up, but you're welcome to email me like Jennifer, said anybody who would like to volunteer once it all goes back to normal a little bit.
I mean like barbecues that people held in the park.
A few years ago, we actually did have a group that was distributing bags and helping with the cleanup I just wanted to ask parks once the barbecue areas are reopened, especially on the peninsula.
Let me sorry literally give me just one second: it would be good to n y4p spelled like with the number four dot org slash, what we do, it's kind of long, I kind of want to send it to you, I'm, sorry, okay, it's a lot to spell out right now, I'm taking a man's time I'm in the Q&A section, Q&A or college, oh yeah, if you could just put it in the comments or email it to me and I'll forward it to Nobles awesome.
Liz are we gonna put forth a reso in support of things related to budget and also potentially barbecue areas or whatever you think you know, because the budgeting I think the so the reason why I really wanted to have this conversation, and thank you for reminding that so I don't think it's helpful to have a reso on this I think what's helpful, is to have these really robust conversations that feel in some way.
Once we get to the budgeting piece thanks, Anna, Liz I, don't think some people know who Rod Serling I.
Think I can also say that I think I can also say that once our new budget is in place and once we know what the guidelines are going to be for social distancing and allowing gatherings and Parks, the Parks Department will review the barbecue situation and maybe we'll be able to report back to you in the at a future meeting.
