We're gonna, pretty much go straight to our agenda item with the MTA I do want to provide an update before we get started, though, on 181st Street bus way.
So we have a short presentation and then per usual we'll take any questions so 190th Street, you know the station opened and the elevators were first installed in 1932 the old station elevator travels 137 feet from the station house down to the mezzanine.
So, if anything does happen, we'll be able to know exactly what it is, what kind of crew and parts we need, and so we can respond a lot quicker additionally, we're adding a backup battery system that will allow passengers to exit the elevators if there is a loss of power, while people are in them and, lastly, communication systems upgrade most notably including two security cameras in each elevator cab.
We bet that we have that and have had that scheduled to begin in September for quite some time, we're looking at potentially accelerating it into late August if conditions permit right now, we're still on schedule at 181st, Street, on the a to wrap up in August and additionally for those for winter, brawls are still on schedule at 194 eat on the one, although that's a little farther into the future, but we're very happy that you know we've kind of been able to keep ourselves on schedule and catch up when we follow a little bit behind over the last few months, and so we're pretty happy with that.
You know either going to there or back from there, local and for buses operate and also m 90's m-98 buses operate specifically during rush hours in the peak direction and provide a bus connection for those that need it between the two stations and just to kind of hammer it home.
This will just be on Fort, Washington Avenue, there's not going to be any storage needed on Bennett and, of course, during the work you know we'll have personnel going up and down these stairs, but the Serkis will remain open to the public to access the park.
181St Street on the a is ongoing right now and hoping to wrap up in August just next month, which we followed by under 90th we're discussing today, which were also overlapped with the last elevated replacement we have uptown will come back in the future to present on 181st Street on the 1 and following all of these elevator replacement projects, we currently have planned the escalator replacement at 181st Street on the a as well so that those are our slides for tonight.
So, if I go silent in any way Omar, if you could just step in I, just two very quick questions before the committee, just when you say that this project could be accelerated into very late August rather than September, can we infer then that would mean that the hundred 84th Street elevators might be up earlier in August rather than later in August, or is the MTA willing to communicate a date yet and then also when we hear about and funding theirs, I presume that's about very forward capital projects and won't affect the escalator project, but just clarify that I'm correct about that.
This will be the first time I think during in the middle of a pandemic, we're bringing a new elevator back, and some of that is, you know, done a little differently, given the circumstances.
We can bring it back as soon as possible, but we're a little we're so little cautious about everything in terms of wrapping up the work there making sure it's you know perfect and ready for customer using it all right.
Yeah I did want to follow up with Debbie's question, because I think it was our understanding that no two station elevators on the same line would be out at the same time.
There would never be any overlap between two stations on the same line, all right, so we're just gonna infer what we're gonna infer, Howie, I'm, just gonna say that all right, so just looking through it's anybody from CB, 12 I know we have Maria here, hi Sally's joined us Oh eat it.
Sorry, no problem I'm, just I just want to do a quick scan of whether we have any board members, but it looks like we are clear so Kathleen.
My question really is: have you thought about that, because I think there would be a lot of people who would like to have a handicap accessible station there?
We we've commissioned a study of the entire system in every station to look at how they can be made accessible, and you know that's something that we're always looking at in terms of the a-line were generally for the next for our 2020 to 2024 capital plan.
Both directions, uptown and downtown 190th Street is not included in that for the moment and of course, our capital plan is in a little bit of financial trouble right now right terms of what, in terms of what we had laid out as our priorities for the stations we made a DA accessible in the next few years, 180 first read on it on the a was made declared one of those stations.
If you want to unmute yourself by handing me to myself there, you are and I'm, given that I know nothing about the work and what the capital plan is, but my I do live near 207 Street and that elevator seems to be going out all the time and it seems like I.
So to answer your question in terms of elevators overall in Washington Heights, you know this replacement project is I, think, probably by far the largest piece of that and expanding those deep station elevators, which I think are probably you know most problematic when they go out and when you know anything you know negative happens to them.
It's less problematic, but in terms of 207 is, you know, was scheduled to be replaced also as part of kind of a regular cycle of a DI elevators throughout the system, but I think that's also.
Currently, you know on hold because of the capital plan and when you say on hold how long should I expect it to be unrolled I, unfortunately, I don't know that Debbie you're, muted, sorry about that I mean like I'm stirring every level in every community board is talking about this, but this certainly at CB, twelve.
Obviously, for the capital plan in peril is I just feel like we were so close to getting something and I really I, really hope things change, Maria Luna had her hand up and then and then Edith sorry I'm, just seeing you now so Maria and then to eat it.
Unfortunately, we can't do that, and especially right now, given the state of the capital plan, that's not really something that's on the table at the moment, but if there's specific cobblestones I'm, not sure where the cobblestones are you referring to that, I could, because I could for watching time that you have to you know you have to go like a little to the to the right, and then you turn left to get into the station Wow. What's our like break, you know like red break or something like that.
Yeah anyway, we once took the TRC through, and people were saying, I don't know, there are no gaps there, no gaps, I'm like we're at City, Hall and I, said just watch it come in and, as you come in, the level of the train goes up.
If you want to communicate, you know specific stations that have this issue to the board and they can get that to me and I can follow up and see what we can do about them and we've addressed it to Alex right well, let's just if you guys can just connect and make that happen so that the vertical gap issue one 71-68 should not be connecting external to the committee.
Always like you know, one behind the other saying not in service, not in service the m4 or the or the in for the shuttle bus shuttle bus hasn't been running for a little while during the pandemic, but well, the m4 is always there for I was seated in the restaurant over there and 193rd McKee Mishima and three Baz is the same time pass by and this and northern service, not inserts people waiting for the boss, yeah I, you know I can't say exactly what was happening at that moment, but you know generally.
You know there's a lot of flexibility with buses in this regard, but in terms of seeing three in a row when there's people waiting- and there wasn't necessarily one that you saw that came soon after that- you know is not what we'd like to hear and you know I can you can get me in the future more specific details, but like time, you know day a possible any bus numbers.
Sorry, not you Debbie, senator I was just thanking know what the picture at the photograph isn't behind him who's that Oh, like you, get to see everybody's art yeah, yes to go!
First in terms of importance of chance, especially it's definitely something we're aware of and I believe, and certainly something we would hope to address in the Manhattan bus network redesign when that you know comes about those are also on hold right now, just because the difficulty of holding you know in-person feedback sessions and moving forward with those that we have active currently in the Bronx, the Queen's in Brooklyn, as well so I think when we get around to doing Manhattan.
We don't have to resolve that here tonight, just if Sally or Edith had an additional question just unmute yourself and let me know or otherwise just take down your raised hand I, so I can barely yeah.
Sorry I did have a couple questions to come up in various committees that are MTA related but I'm, not sure I, don't know the gentleman who spoke with her.
They were going to be available from the agents, but I'm not sure that's posted anymore people are getting on the subway without masks, so Mary, Anderson and Edith have both we've covered in this committee in prior meetings.
If you forgot one, you need one in terms of you know, someone being asked to put one on the station agents, as you mentioned, do have masks in the booths that are available.
I, don't know what the status that is going forward if there will be more machines installed, but in general the best way is to just go to the booth and ask for a mask and that's at all stations, uptown or anywhere in the system.
Whole thing was documented, etc, and you know we come back to the fact that there are station I mean there are stops.
There are also problems with social distancing, because you end up at the situation where you are fewer seats and less space available in the front of the bus, and a lot of us are being left behind on the sidewalk, because the buses do not have you know: you'll have two seniors on the fold up seat and the driver says I'm full and drives away.
Now the steps is a wide, very wide area that people can just go right into the stage you know the station and into the subway.
We sound, really major, you know, work I mean thing had to be done properly, of course, but I'm looking at there, because it's not just elevators I, think that particular station could be made accessible and it's a you know the commute there is like thousands and thousands of the people.
All of that is in peril, so anything sort of for additional accessibility after that first round of the 22 24 stations that is also contemplated, but we know is after 2024 is like what's the what's, the best way, how he to get feedback on sort of, because the fast forward you said, looked at every station.
So if we wanted to understand to Maria's point like a better understanding of like for those of ours that didn't make it into that plan, because you're saying only the 181st a made it into that one like where do the rest of our stations land and are there any other programs that do like she said like okay?
Every station was looked at so that you know there's not so to your first point: Debbie, that's correct that basically, everything that is going to be accessible, that requires a capital improvement, whether it you know, elevators, that your bigger investment compared to ramps.
100 168th on the one is also in the 2020 capital plan, as is Dyckman Street on the one which is I believe going to be ramps, not elevators as well, yes, great yep, and so when that was all previously announced, and so in terms of why we pick certain stations over others.
Think to Maria's point, though, like accessibility, we always come back to it on this committee and I.
Think all of us again picking up on something Maria said earlier as well that maybe in the fall we could sort of get a better understanding of like let's say it's, not a full accessibility, but there are improvements to address some factors within the station that are making it difficult for people with.
So maybe we can sort of have a little bit more time on this subject, because it's really important up here, as you know so, Thank You Maria for raising that Natalie.
But my internet garbled when Sally was asking about masks so I don't didn't catch if she asked about the mask vending machines that you guys rolled out and whether or not they're gonna roll out for uptown and so I wanted to know if that was in the plan, sure so the so the vending machines are primarily at Midtown and downtown stations.
The next thing I wanted to bring up and I really did want to keep this meeting sort of focused on just the MTA, given its a special meeting, but one thing and I'm sure everybody on the committee has been seeing and it's something Oh, Maura and I have talked about is over the past I mean certainly all through June we're seeing a lot of stuff about rebel scooters gone wrong, meaning not obeying traffic laws being ditched in inappropriate places and the only appropriate place is in a real parking spot in a drop-off zone.
They don't there's also a traffic enforcement aspect of this that I think Curtis will be picking up on, but I just want to say, like you know, we need to get smarter about who does have jurisdiction besides a traffic cop being able to say you're, speeding, you're going the wrong way on a one-way street you're on the sidewalk etc.
So I want to say September agenda roughly like that we target having it on there, but it's a single biggest thing that at least I see I'm, sure I, don't know about the rest of you, but and so if anybody else has I make one brief comment on that yeah.
Second, your sentiments here because again, as you mentioned one day, they weren't here and then one day we turned around and they were everywhere and not in a great way, because I don't want to say it's every day then I go outside, but more often than not I do see someone on a rebel bike and they're, clearly disregarding a red light going right through a red light like God forbid some but someday somebody gets hit by a car which actually has a green one.
Yes, okay, great Howie, you said you would take back to the MTA the possibility of having signage talking about the free masks that are available from the station agent.
But if a mask dispenser is like right by you know, it's installed on the front of the station thing.
It's not I, don't know if the concern would be about taking as many masks as they need for the next week as much as people, maybe vandalizing or taking the mask from the reason and throwing them away and all surgery I think unfortunate.
You know having a Geo zone where it just turns off if they go into parks- and you know having it where, if bad behavior, if illegal behavior is observed, that they could be turned off and just turning it down so having them come and starting a conversation with them and also with the legal entities of New York City to have a little Everage on this would be great and just letting people know because I'm here, it's a really hot topic of discussion and we're lucky that nothing serious has happened.
Is it possible to get a few strategic speed bumps check as traffic calming that's a excellent point and Omar, if you can just make sure we're capturing that from Barbara woods and then to wrap in d-o-t when the time comes about sort of do these having this additional vehicle racing around and does that make us look at certain streets for traffic calming that we may not have?
You know, we'd ask for community input and if there was enough support- and then you put the request but I think that d-o-t changed its policy two years ago, such that they're, just putting in speed bumps like we kind of just need to ask, but I I'd have to find out the process, but it's not the same they're not involving us in the same way that they used to well there's a secondary issue since you asked- and that is that we are in this reduced speed zone for school safety.
And you know you can't put in a speed bump every two feet that would drive people crazy so well, we can certainly ask but yeah I.
So let me let me do a little digging on what I don't think that would have changed since that sort of a safety thing, but in terms of putting in more of them you know yeah.
It was basically a breeding ground for the spread of Kovac and I'm, trying to figure out what's the best way to both allow the restaurants to make money but make sure that we're not killing people all right, Julie noted I, mean I, think that's sort of a the big, the bigger question and also how we're dealing with hot spots like of a hot spot emerges.
So it's sort of like I think it's a little bigger than the TNT trouble and you know maybe we should just wrap them out to the governor because they, you know if they people don't follow rules.
So I think we need to keep the ideas coming and feed those to do tea and people can do that directly or they can come through us and we'll get it to do tea because everybody's you know, they're continuing to expand open streets and the open, dining etc, but I just I think it's tough right now in the neighborhood, because we have a lot going on and some of it has been on hold and is gonna be restarting and it's been very hard to get around for a year.
The community has been in touch with G ot, but they- but you know this program- is to help the businesses and there's really sort of stepping back I, think Natalie said influx right and fluidity.
You know what's going what they're doing to support businesses during this time, but the first protocol, of course, that Sally brought up is the safety of our community as well, so I just want to bring those three points off.
