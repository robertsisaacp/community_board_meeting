You will hear their names when they put the time come to Kovan, and we also have our blanca, our bank, a Latino latina, who is a retired, principal or district, and you will hear also- and you know more from her as well- her expertise and different area of Education and of course, we have also a former Senate, who is the executive director of community league of the Heights, also known as cloth, and we also have a sports Sharon G Kim, who is the program manager of Uptown hub I, wanted welcome to welcome oh I.
She can't see me I'm the secretary and I'll be taking notes tonight, Oh, her hello, my name is Curtis young member of your neighborhood advisory board, I'm, the assistant secretary, also a liberal Community, Board, 12 and former member of the youth education committee, so I'm here what a capacity, though NAB capacity 990 anybody else.
The purpose of this evening discussion is to get feedback from community leaders, educators, parents, students about the challenges and experiences they have encountered during this difficult time of Kobe 19.
Yes, let's proceed now with our agenda and thank you, for you know, join me in this important moment of silent.
Cruz has very much and I'm the assistant chair of the youth of Education Committee I, also am a social worker by day, I currently worked at New, York Presbyterian Hospital as a social worker, but more specifically as a program manager.
As a whole and to say that black lives do matter, and we will continue to be a support and advocate for that, thank you thanks for providing that moment of silence earlier I will so just to give a couple of I guess, rules or just a breakdown of like what will happen throughout this panel.
Fed from the invitation and I am extremely grateful for the work that you guys do for the community America for the Hmong years ago, when she was a proceeding of the CEC for this receipts, and we had the opportunity to engage in with initial is a problem for digital school I am the district six school superintendent, and just a little bit about myself.
In a nutshell, my main role responsibilities is to support and supervise every school in the district, and that goes for providing platform for organizations instruction, social-emotional learning and community engagement, academic development develop for the schools.
I rather want you to handle this clock on your side and whenever anybody finished talking, so you can say time so the people in sub talking right because yeah indeed this way we're covering the whole thing.
My name is Penelope no I've been an educator for 48 years, 40 of which are in district 6, not only as a director bilingual programs as assistant director, as ap as a teacher, and also as a principal for 17 years and an RTI specialist as well as now that I work for ethical schools, Network, providing social, emotional learning to train staff that work in shelters.
I've been I, always said that I live in New Jersey, but I, don't know anyone I just know everybody who lives in the heights I follow my students and I work actively with teachers within district six.
My knowledge has run from bilingual education to administration, as well as lending my needs for social-emotional learning and basically I hold a great heart for the community and I, provide whatever service.
However, I've been with the organization since July, 16 1997 and the majority of the work that we do is in affordable housing, but we also provide a plethora of other services, including the creation of Community Health Academy of the heights in 2006, which is a middle through high school.
Everybody hi I'm, so very honored to be part of this conversation with everyone, and thank you so much for the invitation, and my name is Sharon Kim and I currently direct the uptown hub, which is a youth development program and drop-in center for 12 to 24 year olds, we're how was that New York, Presbyterian Hospital, and basically we you know we launched back in 2017 with the support from the Manhattan district attorney's office.
All of oh that any young person could desire- and you know a large part of our model- as our name hub would suggest- is to provide these opportunities through a network of community organizations.
Thank you welcome so before we begin, I just want to note following the panelists discussion, we're also going to be hearing from a couple of our parents and it's one of our students, so I just want to note them, but I want to so sorry.
Dees Williams, you go first, so we wanted to know and ask what are some specific dy programs that will continue to address the needs of the community third, this pandemic and what programs will not be available.
A lot of people don't know that we fund all those programs, but we've also been sharing that information with a lot of our families.
The community has expressed many times that they see that there is a big difference when teachers provide life instruction over non-life instruction, and this remote learning is something that had never been done on this scale ever so we needed to create climate roles and support for innovation on pacing young-sun, our missteps, but that has been one challenge: finding that balance between life instruction and not life instruction the devices on the connectivity right now right now, these receipts have four hundred twelve devices listed as outstanding sixteen or been happy no reading ship, but we hope we have 255 devices now in process.
I think, based on what I know that has been happening over States, because I know, people who teach in Washington DC, I Massachusetts, for example, I think what has happened in your city has been remarkable to switch three more learning that happened in a matter of a week and to the scale of this of this initiative, actually created a huge challenge for and given those challenges, I believe that we have minimized the loss, that's gonna occur.
We know that you have been in communication with teachers, principals and parents in our district to learn first head what they have been experiencing.
Ramirez had mentioned some of the critical issues, but in talking to teachers and looking at how it was affecting children, one of the things that the teachers expressed over and over again was the need of improvement of their own technical skills, especially when you consider that many of the staff are over 40 years old and are not as tech savvy as some of our younger teachers.
They also asked for other support, because what happens in district 6, as you know, eighty-four percent of our community is second language learners and the there's also twenty point.
Nine percent of them are new immigrants or people who have been in our communities for a short period of time, and the language issue became critical in terms of the activities and the lessons that the teachers were providing.
You know you have these things at home, but parents then were saying yes, I do have paper towels to do the science experiment, but they're not that easily replaced anymore and I'm afraid to go out and purchase anything because if I go out, I might get cold at 19.
In terms of the school and the, let me add one other thing: we've been working with merchants as well, because, as you know, our merchants have been devastated.
It was once very exciting for them initially, but now it's wearing off, so we've had to think about ways to continue the engagement in a social way coming up with activities that make them feel that they should still participate in ways to learn and ways to stay engaged.
I'm, definitely going to focus in specifically on the hub and how we've been providing services to our youth and through our hub partners, and so like my fellow colleagues here tonight, you know due to this pandemic, we have had to quickly adjust and make a lot of decisions about how to continue providing our services.
Basically, every young person who officially enrolls in the hub as a member they are immediately assigned to what we call a hub advocate, and so that is their one-on-one mentor, their champion that person that's connect to resources, provide emotional support, and so, as soon as we had to close our physical space, our main priority was making sure that every one of our members was reached out to you and to determine if they had any immediate needs.
You know the summer and the summer that's coming up and how do we continue to support our young people?
Over and over again, we are launching youth town halls, which will be starting in August for led by young people is both an opportunity for them to express how they're feeling about what's happening, but also, we hope, develop a Youth agenda that they want to present not just to this man but to the candidates who will be running for mayor.
So it would be some young people, partnering grad students and CUNY- to conduct research on how Colvin has affected their communities, particularly people in their communities, and have them develop a set of policy recommendations that put in it to the children's cabinet, which you know as part of its made up of commissioners of all agencies who in some way touched a lot of young people through Wayne, homeless youth initiative.
So that's one, but if the young people, young person, has symptoms, we don't want them having to stay in a group setting and so yeah isolation, hotel rooms where they get supported, organization, food and care, but they can be away from the shelter like settings so that they can recover from if they have cold like symptoms.
You know that in the past couple years we've served 75,000 young people, I, don't know that we'll get size and scale again, but July is almost here, and so we do need a decision fairly soon if to be able to mobilize providers the thing that I will say that we were really focused on safety and a lot of job sites that we would usually go to whether it was corporate or others were either teleworking.
So, of course we want it to be the right thing and we're excited about the opportunity, but in fairness to the providers you know we have to make a decision to give them the time to offer experience this summer.
Thank you appreciate that just wanted to make sure, because I know that that's why he's been on a lot of our vines.
We are in constant communication with school leadership teams school principal to ensure that not only the academic part of Education is at rest, also social-emotional need of our students on some families.
Our schools are all promoting at least two workshops on parents to talk about how to handle crisis, and the type of conversation need to engage students, so they can understand what's going on around them, so they can face a and teaching parents, also certain skills, or they can learn how to teach the children as well.
This is something that the city new year has embarked on, and I am very lucky to work with a group of teachers who actually are having a pleasure to what we do at this time because of their positive attitude, also community.
You said that I just want to know that numbers you said -, that about 2100 students last year were summer school in the district wide correct me if I'm wrong, we're 2014, 580 and then this year.
Ramirez I said it's a time to begin to look at activities when we begin to work with children that actually decrease stress, because, as you know, executive functioning brain does not work.
As people have mentioned parents, our kids are disengaged, as Yvonne had mentioned, they're, disinterested unmotivated and now, on top of it all, they have this issue with what is happening in terms of justice, especially for our high school students, where parents continually say I, don't know what to do with them.
We have an opportunity to deal with the answer: the questions of justice and race discrimination through videos, activities available in the internet, promoting discussions providing factual information and in order to build a student's, self-awareness, build relationships, because if we do not do that- and we know that neuroscience says that research has indicated that this will lead to motivation, predictive in achievement and I'm.
We need to have it every day as part of the educational system in our schools to make change to help our children feel the hope of being able to make those changes.
Think I want to I want to address it through the work that we've been doing in our school I cannot magnify how much the social and emotional piece is affecting our young people.
Not only did we have to create kind of a wellness advocacy group that actually checked in with these families daily checked in with the students, but also had to check in with the parents to find out where they were on that mental stress ladder and try to figure out how to engage them, not just about how their children were doing, but how they were doing their homes are not prepared to do distance learning everyone.
So the multiple pressures that are happening to our young people right now to think that they can comprehend academics on the level that we want them to is just it's not possible right now, without putting in a lot of antidotes without putting in a lot of mechanisms.
Another thing that you're realizing and has sort of been mentioned is just that the living space not being so conducive, not only because it might be cramped- and there might be you know so many family members, but we're also finding that for some of our young people they're in some, you know possibly dangerous or unresolved situations at home.
You know physical space and it has been something I see for myself and for my staff it's been a difficult thing to swallow, but when we continue to do the best that we can and sort of as von WA see, you know it's a lot of texting and a lot of colleague on the daily just trying to trick me hopefully were able to provide some amount of hope and let them know that someone cares about them so that they can get through one more day and that honestly has been a huge thing, I think having our virtual programs.
You know every week we get like one or two or three or five more young people that are tuning in and so I think that has been tremendous I.
Checking in on the same young person, I think that actually has been really tremendous and there are weekly and sometimes multiple times in a week, conversations that our staff across our organizations are having, with each other, to make sure that no one is falling through the cracks and so I think that has been just so huge and you know, but with all that said, I do want to just mention that we're also very blown away by our young people's resilience.
I'm not sure I have solutions, but some of my worries are the disappearance of some of the entry-level offset our young people used to carry or families individuals with a lot of language proficiency or degrees like I'm, worried about a whole range of jobs, disappearing, I'm, worried about the tax base, paying attention but they're talking about a lot of people relocate from the book city, that's Hamza's and other states that are relocating and, as you know, do ICD it mostly tax levy.
This is not gonna be about the NYPD and DYC be like this is going to be about hundreds of people being laid off that will further decimate communities from first responders to teachers, to you know other folks in city agencies and a lot of government jobs that provided a ladder to you know the middle class with folks.
If this crisis hold, there is no federal stimulus or stayed better we're looking at losing a lot of teachers which will add to the already delicate emotional stage of our children, seeing their beloved teachers call, but we will have to think about cutting our started programs summer problems after school problems.
Pitino was mentioning that one of the issues that we face right now with this new structure for teaching or learning is actually teachers saying that they need to increase their technologies savviness and now with less money to find organizations or consultant and can help you do that.
So our formation of what school is like has to change as well and to get our resources has to change, and the teaching that takes place in the classroom must deal with the issues of justice equality even at first grade level in a minimal since, but we have to also empower our children to become active in our communities to go out and help with the census or with the pandemic.
All these questions, how our custodians, who have contracts of that state that they only can service x y&z, are not going to change to be able to deal with Klan cleaning a school that the community that there's kovat 19.
There has to be ongoing and I have to thank there for having this the first side of thinking of how important it is for a Unity's to get together and to talk and to unite as a group in helping the education and our youth I said, because if we can't do it, who's gonna do it for them, I mean our parents are in need.
One of the benefits that I've seen is how teachers and parents are now for the first time, actually sensitizing themselves to each other bonding in ways which they didn't know.
I think a lot more accountability and a lot more streamlining of how food comes to communities needs to happen.
You know I as I, listen to everyone I'm concerned about economic development, around businesses that are better gone under or don't see a way of coming back, I'm worried about education, not just for young people, but adults.
Excuse it sure yeah so I mean we are obviously talking a lot about the resources that are needed in our community and first I would like to mention- and this has been I think talked about throughout the night.
In light of our current events and seeing how people, and especially our young people, have been rallying together to promote racial justice to promote systemic change, I'd like to just share just how important it really is that all of this work be rooted in an anti racism framework and as we're talking about resources to really think of it through that lens.
And you know it's been interesting to have been starting a hub which is funded by the DA's office, and there is this perception that these are young people who are not as smart or not as capable, and that has really prevented many of our youth from getting that extra push to pursue an interest or be exposed to different opportunities that are out there instead they're being categorized as delinquents or that they're up to no good, and you know that really, you know gets to me and I definitely think it's really up to the adults and the institutions to do that.
There should be some financial, stipend or something that quite honestly is a stimulus to the economy and so giving our young people that purchasing power I think will go a long way and then, finally, you know the people part.
I think one thing that's sticking out for me, as I've heard, all of you speak is really just the fact that, like all these inequities that we've experienced in the community are just highlighted by the pandemic right, it's nothing that we didn't know before and yes, some of them have been exacerbated, but these are things that, as you all said, are rooted in systemic issues.
There is some reason for hope: Yvonne alluded to the nonprofit community-based organization infrastructure, it's where I spent most of my career prior to this, and you know even the fact that the mayor and Office of Management and Budget allowed nonprofits, who couldn't work, had determined that the 40,000 folks who worked with nonprofits were essential right and good.
So there's things happening, you know like what the young people and all this activism has shown us.
1964 C means why, whenever the community come together, change happen and that's why I'm hopeful, because what I see now industry is a coalition of people who actually are realizing that things cannot continue to be.
Yeah our community was that maybe not your final, but I just want to thank everyone that was on the panel and I feel very honored to be with such distinguished people, who are doing great things in our community.
I still, I know that there are many ways to do that, but I feel that there is hope, because I've seen our community before our parents make it, regardless of some of the issues that they have, they survived they're survivors.
I, unfortunately, I have two grandsons who have no immune system, so I cannot actually even go out at this point, but I am constantly in contact with many members of the community and Evon I always know what you do and other people within, and it was a pleasure to meet Denise and everyone else who is here representing the communities and all the work that you're doing you know because of people like you, our community is better, so there will always be good people in that community always and that's my hope that we continue to join together and to advocate and to push our representatives but more to also rethink creatively, new ways of finding materials and resources.
You know in talking to our young people, I keep telling them and I really mean it.
My dad eventually joined the US Army, so I grew up moving every couple of years and quite honestly, never really felt like I belonged anywhere and I first moved to Washington Heights in 2009 and lived on 173rd and Audubon, and it was since then I just for whatever reason God has been bringing me back to Washington Heights, and you know I've just been more and more disenthrall with the community and how much I have been embraced and something I learned recently is that Washington Heights in Inwood holds the second highest number of youths in Manhattan.
We have a long way to go, but I have been really encouraged these days by something that many of you probably have heard from Martin Luther King jr., who once said that the moral arc of the universe, bends toward justice- that's right and I have been just so honored and privileged to be able to work with fellow CBO's, who are just as passionate as I am and I really believe that we have been bending and quite honestly, pulling that are closer toward justice, doing everything in our power and strength to reach as a young person that we can who doesn't feel like they belong anywhere, so that they have a safe place, that they have people that care about them.
I really believe that there's something to that and that this is sort of the moment in history, where we truly care to come together in a way that we never had before, and so you know with all of that said, you know if anyone I don't think the laughter we lost her the question.
Welcome so I'm just gonna be asking her what her experience every speaker, that's 2 minutes and we just want to hear from their perspective as parents or involve active working in the system.
Think the other thing with the with that undocumented piece, as she mentioned was it was more of a fear from minor saints, a fear of not her, but the people that she knows in her community as undocumented folks, having the fear of signing a paper and having the fear of being outed as undocumented, well I'm.
Let me go okay, so while that happens, I just want to I just want to know some more people that we wanted to acknowledge.
She can call in to the number in the link go to the numbers, call the number thank you, I think I didn't and that she speak clearly, since this information is recording and guess for the record, you know I want to make sure that it's how the same in that now what I translate will be for the rest of us.
One of the education reporters like at the Daily News to ask this question is a good way to get him on record about certain things and set up my first strategy and as I said you know, there are some funders like Robin, Hood and I have stepped in I'm, always a little too.
We have right, building more school buildings, so I think we're going to be partly in buildings and partly online, and so families are going to need that support.
So, if you I would just answer that we have letter writing in this day, almost like Twitter accounts, I, agree, social media no way they would not do that and if it started trending and think so weather it's the chair of the Education Committee I to the council and that negotiating with the mayor about the one I would definitely be all absolutely even I'm talking to mr.
With all of this advocacy work- and you know our young people are in it, but I think that what we can do, as providers is better, prepare them safety plan with them.
Let them know hey, okay, if you're going to a protest like here are some things to think about.
This is an issue, especially we're gonna, be online for another year and bringing the power of the city and the community to bear on whatever the spectrum Verizon, whatever so I think it's both it's worried about being able to mobilize corporations in time for something that's happening at the end of this month, and so, but we have to get money or bring this thing to bear on this negotiation and in longer term, it's you know: Community Reinvestment, Act kind of thing.
We said we don't know if schools are gonna be remote next year we do have utilities back online and I would love to give her the platform so that she could share her experience as a student as we're talking about that as a student.
So I wanted to thank you so much for sharing that, because I think that is very important for us to hear and I I'm sorry I said no problem, so thank you for coming and I know.
We do have some questions on the chat for my understanding, but while these are saving those so that maybe we can actually we can send those off to the folks who can better answer them, because I know that I want to keep track of time and we are really over time.
I, I'm, just gonna, say snaps to everyone, because you, a lot of you, said that I've been thinking and I feel like the rest is up to another day of conversation.
Work may see the transitions that we're facing changes, and you know we just have to be very patient with ourselves, but with others, and also just a kind of like think about what.
I love hearing that you know the conversations of what of what was of what is and what and how you know what the future will look like, because I think that that's ultimately, what we're tasked with as advocates for the community and as a system of support for times, would identify what needs are and try to make an argument for you know for access to resources to prove these needs right, and so with that being said, I know that, if a mention yesterday in our kinda ad-hoc beautiful about this panel of a button- and it was brought up with this panel discussion today about the internet, Wi-Fi being a issue- I had a very big concern for a family.
I just want to say everybody protect themselves that it be mindful of your space II get at each other and know that you know we're here as a committee we're here for the youth of education, but as a Florida as a whole were here for the community, and we were to just continue to relay that support.
You probably want to hear about this from all these conversation and other conversations that I had with some of my college interviewing people and getting to know exactly about their experiences.
I also wanted to share with you that it is important for you and please share your thoughts about this meeting, because in conversation like this nature is where we have the opportunity to impact on the needs that we are facing in one way or another, directly or indirectly.
Thank you so much for you know, helping us and of course, I wanted to thank the parents and the students for joining us tonight.
I wanted, also to mention that this perhaps is going to be the last meeting of the youth and education committee until September.
You know on duties and very last I just wanted to remind you that remember that all these collect the effort with members of the neighborhood Advisory Committee, the White City, in collaboration with the youth and education committee, is also part of another strategy, another initiative and building bridges and building relationship, and let me tell you especially our panelists if there is any way in which you can courage, all their colleagues from different office to join us.
So we can unify our voices together and you- and we can- you know- applies our concerns and highlight the needs of our community, not only in district 6, where we are actually residing, but all over the city, all over New York City.
Let's keep up the good work and my team Thank You Emily I, want to conclude this meeting with this.
You know you in my heart as well and I want to thank you deeply for all the things that you do, because you don't so many wonderful thing for our community and I think this is something that can not go unnoticed in this meeting.
The only thing that I have to say is that I'm very grateful that this happened and that this was organized and everyone that was brought together with brought together, because I actually learned a lot from our panel from our panelists and there's a lot of food for thought and also a lot of food for action, and so I'm just going to be reviewing my notes also watching this video again of this meeting to see you know what sparks and what comes up and I'm.
I know that you wanted to focus in a different way and get participation by everybody into the zone, which is some time we cannot do.
Your point is well taking, but I don't know if my college said, but in case that any question that people may have they can send.
