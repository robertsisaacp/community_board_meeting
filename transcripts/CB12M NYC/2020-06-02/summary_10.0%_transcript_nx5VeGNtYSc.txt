It's to really know that, so we can respond, and so one of the things the resolution asks is for the various federal state and local kovat 19 related small business funding programs to provide our community with community specific data by race, gender and ethnicity on who received the funding both now, yes, I must start walking home.
I'll just stop this for right now and just open up the meeting yeah we could go I, CCD, no more on top from eight or nine isn't here, so we could start by getting his testimony and seeing as a small owner.
I would like us to just acknowledge, what's happening right now in our community and New York and just sort of you know open it up.
The country is in turmoil, we are have witnessed some really horrendous things in terms of police, violence and other types of violence, the rash at black people, black men, and we want to just acknowledge that it's happening a lot of people- businesses, as we were discussing before we started, are in our community of dealing with this, because we have, you know, sort of fringe things going on like lutein and other that's impacting small business.
Cuz I spoke a lot of my piece of the very beginning of this meeting, so I'm good okay, so we're gonna start with Cirillo moranto from 8:09, and we are you know we as part of our business development committee for those who might be joining us from the community.
Everybody how you guys doing all right all right guys, thank you for inviting me well I, think you guys know that I'm be part of this community for 45 years, just some diamonds alone, I've been 35 years since I opened up my first business, which is which was the grocery store and the corner grocery store diamond and a Nagar Avenue when I move in here was 1986, then I move into a restaurant business and 95, which I opened a diamond restaurant, which is right next to the grocery store and then I moved to eight or nine across the street and 2005.
We would mean me personally, I, don't know if I want to be able to go to do what I used to do to you know to stay at stable to stay in business, because we to be honest with you, I, don't think we're gonna check and rate that money I mean the revenue that you used to do it in order to to keep up with the with the sensor.
You know the state, the city, yeah I, don't know what they're gonna be doing with we're out of space I, don't know how long we gonna be able to manage the way they want us to do it.
You know, be with my name, my neighborhood, my people, but things are getting like a little concerning its concerned me a lot I, don't know if you're gonna be able to go back the way we used to I used to so we have to see.
So, in order for me to go to sleep, you know like right is concerned me Allah, okay, so city, no question, though yes, yeah raised a great point and brought a great resolution for where we're looking to figure out ways of directly tackling a lot of the issues and concerns that you raised Tanya, and we could speak on ways of being able to incorporate even his test testimony to be able to give more validity to the claims that we're making in the resolution and give it more life.
Okay, sorry, yeah I meant to use your space for some official duties of the state like testing.
You know right now like if 809 is open, they should be having antibody testing up here for the community, so maybe something we should think about when it comes to using underutilized spaces right now, especially like eight or nine eleazar.
Think Domingo, you right on that, because you know we are we all brothers and sister, and now we as a small business, you know we were coming from most of these pieces.
We don't make we're not making the money to in order to to not even to think up in our eight or nine it's a large space like you know, and I was and I wasn't gonna be able to keep up with it.
You could comment on this if you have any suggestions, but I think one of the areas that seems that collectively we cut we've come to an agreement, it's with the whole being able to identify temporary uses for these spaces in order to generate revenue so that we could be able to alleviate the burden once the business has to reopen and I think like Nobles stated, potentially using these as testing sites for both antibodies and for the virus seems to be, it would potentially generate the revenue to be able not necessarily a profit or better, but to be able to maintain a certain cash flow coming into the business.
What type of initiatives are being done to be able to bridge the resources offered by the city and the state in order for businesses not to drown, you know so I think and Tanya you have do you have any remarks on that yeah you're, muted, yeah.
If you people are retail, to do curbside and things like that, and who knows, we might be in that phase for a few weeks, and then we will get to the phase of restaurants phases that sorry I believe it's phase, two from what I saw the last thing I saw on the governor's press conference I, believe restaurants were phase two but I believe there were restrictions, they're gonna be restrictions like it could be capacity and then outdoor they're, looking at allowing people to use outdoor space, but yeah I think I.
You know when it's time to reopen and there will need to be steps taken to help these businesses to get to that point, and so I think that's a very key point and I appreciate.
I from my understanding- and luckily we have angela here- who's- been immigration lawyer or has a very broad understanding of immigration with I felt like what's interesting to know and what people have to understand is you might be undocumented in this country, but you can't incorporate a business and once you get that a Ibn number, you can actually make money.
You could become a millionaire and vien documents, and just so folks are aware and Angela correct me if I'm wrong, you know that that's right, Domingo I mean there's a interesting irony in that a business owner.
I mean the one thing that I also just wanted to share is that in the immigrants rights movement for years, we would tell people who are undocumented.
Well, you know what, for the ten years, I was living here when I worked, I pay taxes now we're in a situation where we don't see, reform coming and these people may never get the benefit ever of the of the money.
Thank you so much Angela, but that's what I'm trying to say like there's ways around it, and it's just about understanding the laws and being able to make sure that our community benefits and we find those gray areas, because if corporations could avoid paying taxes, we should be able to help our people get the proper recognition CD low.
Don't thank you guys, thank you, don't mean go for an I guess, yeah and the great thing is just know that we're working Tonya Bonner has a great resolution that we will make sure is reflective and that our voices are heard.
Thank you, for you know for the invitation to participate in the committee meeting before I go into an update for the recurring legislation for small business communication at the council.
I just want to mention a couple of things regarding: what's Lila was referencing to in regards to the loans is I, don't know if he's still out there or if he left already, but I know that he mentioned the just the Paycheck protection program, but there are other loans that are available to small businesses that are not related to the paid to paychecks and he left because they're actually putting up the plywood in his business as we speak.
As you know, a lot of businesses in our community are not being approved for these loans, but you know I like to hear more about what the situation is, whether they you know he applied and didn't get it or you know he's aware of you know of them.
Gonna have to start canvassing and figuring out what the current state of some small businesses are: I known, for instance, a lot of the feedback that I've gotten from the bank has been a light in this darkness is about Copa pool on the highest percentage of PPP loan approvals that I've seen in the community is actually coming from them, and what I would suggest is that as a committee, we start looking into what are the role that some of these banks are having within our community.
Are they just here for show, or they just here to have an ATM, but a bank is supposed to provide more services to our community than just a storefront or just a quick access to their corporate banks, and that's something that I feel like we do have to question, because it seems like there's a difference: the differentiation in relationship when it comes to businesses, downtown and businesses in Washington Heights and the uptown areas of Harlem, Washington Heights in word, and the Bronx so I think something to really start thinking about.
You know for the rent so question, though the same way that there's subsidies for big corporations and people that employ over a certain amount of individual there's, certain city and state subsidies.
Is there anything being currently drafted or in the talks around like potentially having some sort of local city as BA, SBS, bail out or reopening packages for small businesses?
That's able to be allotted for the reopening back of the city and identifying particularly communities that have a and like Tonya's resolution is addressing a certain amount of vacancy storefronts right.
So there have to be some effort or I monies identified, not necessarily as loans, not necessarily it just be able to incentivize the reopening of the city, you know and being able to add lots more businesses, particularly those who are disproportionately impacted by everything.
You know the ability to be able to reopen without having like, because what sonido saying is pretty scary, which is like hey I, don't think I'ma have to reduce this imma have to reduce that, but yet we're talking about potentially having to add another individual to unemployment having another individual who's, not gonna, be able to work.
You know, putting a lot of pressure with press conferences and a lot of events in order to highlight the need, especially now in the time of you know, of this crisis, I mean small businesses are hurting a lot and now, with everything that is happening in the last couple of days, I mean I, don't know how much they can take so I think it's time to bring it back up.
You know: negotiating environment for landlords and lease holders, and another thing that I was forgetting about the bill that is also being added to the to the bill is to create a pilot program for restaurants, and you know some other small businesses like pharmacies to participate with city programs that offer you know, discounts or some types of services to seniors in the community.
So, let's say a business has been operating over five years in the neighborhood and is you know, participating in this program with seniors and in the city will add, you know a certain amount of years to at least two extra years or something like that on top of the minimum ten years that you know, we have been asking as a minimum for businesses in good standing, I had a quick question.
You know they understand that the city needs to get back to you know to where it was and if you make it harder for the businesses to do this, you are hurting the entire, the entire city, you know so I mean, if you guys have any ideas you know well, you know I'll bring it to the councilmember and you know provide support from the councilmembers office yeah.
So thank you so much Evelyn I know there was a lot of information being that there's so much going on right now, I think huh.
She was out there as well making sure that she heard the voices of our community and just the people sentiment so Carmen you're up here for any updates in regards to legislative or anything pertaining to small businesses, Carmen she's muted, unless he's tier, she sent a question.
Yes, we were out there not only listening to the sentiments of the community, but also as somebody who grew up on Post Avenue, where we were today my somebody whose father came to this country to open up a bodega I'm in the Bronx when the Bronx was burning and was one of the first Dominicans to do that at that time you know, I really do understand what the value of a dollar is when it comes to opening up a small business, and it just broke my heart to see the images that we saw last night in the Bronx I.
No. The rent package that we just passed last week in the legislature will only help 50 to 60,000 New Yorkers, and while it is some money and in this time of really hard economic times, you know helping 50 or 60,000 New Yorkers is better than helping no New Yorkers, but I honestly feel that I'm personally, tired of settling for the crumbs that are put on our tables and not being able to deliver for our communities robust packages of legislation that is actually going to prevent evictions.
It was a very hard vote for me because I do believe that in this time of economic hardship, we gotta help people we have to help them and if one constituent in my district receives $600 a month for three months, it's better than zero dollars for three months, but I just feel that as a whole, if we're not in this together and when I'm holding the line together, we're gonna continue to settle for crumbs and so obviously bringing it back around to small businesses.
I've had several conversations with cee-lo more on time, as you know who owns 8:09 and Syria was in a hole before the pandemic hit, because the lowest thing that he does not as a month for the renovate all nine and how could he possibly without making any money, continue to keep his doors open right and this and we're not putting packages of legislation together?
These funds, so I'm gonna, leave it there I'm gonna, open it up for questions, okay, cool, so Thank, You, Carmen, and going back to it.
We had a conversation around banks right and I think what people we were working on an event wave with somebody woman that Arosa around doing like what folks need to know about banks and not it just being face value for what is the purpose and what are the expectations that the community should have on these banks?
I, don't know if that's gonna be delayed because of the pandemic, but in your circle, in your area of expertise and the bills and things that you hear what are they're talking about when it comes to cannabis and how can those potential earnings or monies can come into our community and help us similar to what those taxes can do as well?
We deserve a conversation around cannabis and the stigmas that are in a generation, and unfortunately, it's not the new social norm at this point, so I think having a conversation intergenerational conversation around that Francisco is something that we could work on to be able to discuss it, because the possibilities are real and, like Carmen said, is that about tokenizing.
It will be part of our conversation whenever it legalized and I think we should start preparing for that conversation and get ahead of any programs, and we could take advantage of or speak to the Carmen's of the world and make sure they come in and talk to us and keep us abreast of what is happening in the political realm, because a lot of us are completely lost.
We don't know, what's going on there and I just get the feeling that communities like the Heights and Harlem and the Bronx are gonna, be last yeah typically and then I'll say this before I see Angela has a question.
Imagine still being able to maintain certain stigmas that have not necessarily proven to the times, but yes, Angela, no I just wanted to know Thank You Carmen.
Well, yeah come up in other states and that you know because I mean it's a it's a disgusting irony that someone who actually has the expertise in this and probably has even greater expertise because they had to do it in the way that they had to get it done through the informal sector, but that then they can't get hired by the supporting quote.
How do we reopen and what does that look like, and some of the supports and I think Tanya if you're integrates with that another key element to it is: are we holding banks accountable for the face value that they just keep giving our community, which is you could come cash?
One thing that we could incorporate is: what does it look like to work with a community beyond face value and that's something within itself: yeah, that's one of the things I guess I was given, but you definitely right.
Like a public bank, you know how do we make sure that the realigning that existed doesn't continue to kind of rear its ugly head when it comes to our communities and I know that not all banks are created equal?
So you know I, think that it's important for us to have that conversation as well and I look forward to engaging with the committee in, however way you guys see fit and I'm a resource.
That is something that is known and documented, but we haven't really done that work as a committee just yet, but I think it's a good area for us to start looking at one of these days, I won't have a long conversation with you about, what's going to happen to the mental health system.
Agreements are where the developer agrees to pay for a study to understand the recreational needs of a community and also fund, whatever the study produces, which could be certain equipment in parks, creation of parts creation of a community center that people can use one of the things that I wanted to go a little bit do a little bit deeper dive on is: what's considered, the largest community benefits agreement in the country, and this was agreed to in December of 2004 in Los Angeles and so I'm gonna just read off a couple of the details, because I mean ultimately in the end, when it comes to community benefits agreement, we can decide what that is.
So that's the procurement stream that the airport, this new airport would actually produce so I thought it was important and I mentioned it to Domingo, not only to share this information on as something that we should be demanding this from developers that come in, but also I, think it's important that we understand what has already been negotiated in our name and understand that, put it up publicly and let's look and see if whoever signed these agreements, if they are actually holding up their into the bargain.
Let's call you got a question, no I just wanna say thank you, for that was enlightening yeah and the reason behind this brief conversation was that I think it's extremely important as we do our due diligence to understand somewhat magnitude.
So if somebody's gonna come to our community and part of business, development is also being able to make sure that we leverage these developments to be able to meet the needs of our community, but also the means of local businesses right like, for instance, right.
We have to stop thinking about the crumbs and start realizing that when folks want to make money off of our community, there should be a standard that the helps and works with everybody, including our small businesses and certain guarantees.
But the great thing about the community board is that it actually does have a lot of diverse voices, and you know I mean I, just I just you know it's again.
Is there anybody else that it wants to ask a question on once twice: go ahead: Sally, okay, here, ideally starting 2021, we won't have those kinds of problems with community benefit agreements.
I know Jackie's here as there's anybody from the Washington Heights Chamber women's Chamber and the bid for them to speak up, and we finish this meeting where we're at an hour and yeah we're like a never in 30 and already so, let's do okay, alright!
Is there anybody in the committee who needs who needs to be informed about what time the resolutions on his presidency today she sent it on Sunday, I, believe, okay, so tiny, if you want, you can share it on the screen.
You think it would be prudent on this one, because I feel, like the banking needs to be a statement that we do alone, like a resolution just for banking and the type of business that you know what you think well I think we need to yeah.
They didn't have a relationship with the big banks and things like that, so it just it needs to be in there, but you're right.
I know you a muted yourself earlier in the yeah sure hi everyone a lot of great points today and thank you for bringing that up about banks and how we hold banks accountable.
That's one of the things that you know when we return to whatever our new normal is that I'll continue to work on is getting the leadership of whatever these branches that we have available, either on the full, seven or Dyckman, or in wood, Washington Heights to come out and actually support, because we don't see a lot of a lot of banks in small community events.
So that's one of my targeted when it comes to engaging them more is how do we, you know, use this not only to empower ourselves or empower more people that are like us to be in positions where we can actually make decisions now this particular resolution I would say: is it's really looking at the broad picture in terms of we're about to start the reopening phase and a lot of our businesses have been struggling, even pretty no pre-pandemic, as the resolution kind of outline outlines.
Yes, but they're also, you know they're also other private funding that could pop up or maybe they're now, and we may not be aware, we want to make sure that we, our businesses, can access that and that we are demanding that we are making clear.
They provided a chart on how it's gonna be breaking broken up because, like I know, downstate is receiving, X amount of state is received, they broke it up into the different regions and how the percentage of that each region is going to be able to get of that New York.
I know: I'm gonna, just read back some of the things that you all said and see in what ways that we can incorporate this.
Thank you, and my second thing this is maybe for you, Domingo I know that the community board goes on like hiatus or break or whatever you know after this meeting for business development.
Is this a is this a resolution you would bring to the executive committee to get approved and then go into the general I just want to make sure that there's clear, we could actually vote on me with the understanding of the edits that Tonya's gonna make okay I'm with it, but in the case that folks don't feel comfortable on voting for today is something that I would definitely put up for the executive or remember we go in hiatus, July and August, but that doesn't necessarily mean that as a committee, we can't just all coordinate and say all right.
So thank you so much for taking time and actually putting in this work and yeah I'm like I, you wanna, pay, closer or undocumented issue about the issue.
Specific data I know like on a federal level, there's a database that you can look up and see who got federal funding and there should be the same available in a state and city level have any of the business associations like the Washington Heights bit or the Chamber of Commerce reached out to our businesses to see who's actually received these funds, I'm, not sure I.
I know the priority is helping the current businesses, but for those who want to take this time and start a business, are there any specific loan options?
He leads the efforts at Apple bank on 181st Street and he's also a resource being able to provide information as to like, because I consider Apple Bank Apple back as a community bank right, correct, senex, yes, correct I mean we only have some branches food work, but we're not a big corporate we're not publicly owned, so we're not public, so or family owned, ok, perfect and just feel free to chime in anything else.
We want to make sure that if watch tonight's a.m. would all receive, it have an equitable access and targeted access for any funding related to Cole, vid 19, small business rebuilding, and we want to make sure that is targeted for communities like ours and that there is equitable and so basically we're asking your you know we were outlining.
You know and had to close down, and that we have a lot of restaurants in that community that were reduced to like takeout and delivery.
Don't know how everybody's feeling, but just it's just a lot going on right now at the same time, and it's like I feel like I'm working more now than ever.
You know so it's like yeah.
