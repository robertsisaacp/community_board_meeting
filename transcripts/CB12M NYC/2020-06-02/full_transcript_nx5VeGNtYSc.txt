It's to really know that, so we can respond, and so one of the things the resolution asks is for the various federal state and local kovat 19 related small business funding programs to provide our community with community specific data by race, gender and ethnicity on who received the funding both now, yes, I must start walking home. Can you please chair the meeting? Sure? Okay, we are recording? Okay, so do you want me to just start from the beginning? I'll just stop this for right now and just open up the meeting yeah we could go I, CCD, no more on top from eight or nine isn't here, so we could start by getting his testimony and seeing as a small owner. What are some of the hurdles so like this should help inform the resolution. You know what I'm saying cause we're getting direct, that's immoral. They just directly impacted by it right, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna get back to that other to the revolution. Okay. So it is the time at 6:54. We are opening up the Business Development Committee meeting on this date, June 2nd 2020. We have present from our committee. We have Domingo Estevez, who is going to be joining us shortly to chair Ashlee, Fernandez, Nobles, Crawford, Cindy, Matos and Francisco Lopez and I'm Tanya, o Bonner, and so we are going to begin I'm. Sorry I took the agenda down we're gonna begin with the AIA, the owner of well I, guess, first I think we should just open before we get into anything. I would like us to just acknowledge, what's happening right now in our community and New York and just sort of you know open it up. You know just the general statements from people. In terms of you know, we want to acknowledge that you know the city is in turmoil. The country is in turmoil, we are have witnessed some really horrendous things in terms of police, violence and other types of violence, the rash at black people, black men, and we want to just acknowledge that it's happening a lot of people- businesses, as we were discussing before we started, are in our community of dealing with this, because we have, you know, sort of fringe things going on like lutein and other that's impacting small business. So we want to acknowledge that I don't know if anyone else has any comments or anything they want to say about that. But you know I, it's just you know. For me, it hurts my heart. You know that this is still continuing, but this is still going on in our country and it's when we put it into context. So really you know I just want to open it up and see. If anyone else has any comments, if not, we can, just you know, go right on into talking with our business owner from 8:09. Anybody have any comments about anything. That's going on any feelings, God wasn't really say anything. Cuz I spoke a lot of my piece of the very beginning of this meeting, so I'm good okay, so we're gonna start with Cirillo moranto from 8:09, and we are you know we as part of our business development committee for those who might be joining us from the community. We invite businesses, small businesses to come to our community committee to just check in with us and tell us what are some of the challenges and other things that they're facing in the community and maybe even accept and celebrate some of their successes in the community. So this is our moment so really hear directly from our small businesses, and so 809 is joining us. You are, if you can hear me. Yes great, would you like to begin 8:09? Have you been? Have you been surviving this good evening? Everybody how you guys doing all right all right guys, thank you for inviting me well I, think you guys know that I'm be part of this community for 45 years, just some diamonds alone, I've been 35 years since I opened up my first business, which is which was the grocery store and the corner grocery store diamond and a Nagar Avenue when I move in here was 1986, then I move into a restaurant business and 95, which I opened a diamond restaurant, which is right next to the grocery store and then I moved to eight or nine across the street and 2005. So you know guys that I've been in the neighborhood. This is my this is my home. I haven't been moving out here for 45 years, I'm planning to stay to stay in my neighborhood, but things are getting rid of rough I'll say they spend their mean. Then let me put it this way. We would mean me personally, I, don't know if I want to be able to go to do what I used to do to you know to stay at stable to stay in business, because we to be honest with you, I, don't think we're gonna check and rate that money I mean the revenue that you used to do it in order to to keep up with the with the sensor. You know the rent, we spent a very high rent. You know the state, the city, yeah I, don't know what they're gonna be doing with we're out of space I, don't know how long we gonna be able to manage the way they want us to do it. You know we they're gonna reduce our space. We have like 10 tables or 20 table. They go when I bring it down to ten or eight, so my business, the eight or nine it's been closing since March X, 14 I, haven't opened that door. So not able to do it so I do want us to stay like I said I do understand, my neighborhood do understand eight or nine doing what I love to which is. You know, be with my name, my neighborhood, my people, but things are getting like a little concerning its concerned me a lot I, don't know if you're gonna be able to go back the way we used to I used to so we have to see. What's gonna be next, you know I'm waiting, I'm waiting to see what sky you know what they open about the first stage, which is a I believe it's Jones, a then from there a tone. I is it's gonna be on the last stage, because you know, since you guys know, is I have a very large screw and I'd do a lot of you know private event. You know you call him a burg, the wearing political, you name it and I get. You know what I get to do it over here and I. Don't know, but I'm not gonna be able to be doing that for now so I don't know when I'm gonna be able to do that again. So, in order for me to go to sleep, you know like right is concerned me Allah, okay, so city, no question, though yes, yeah raised a great point and brought a great resolution for where we're looking to figure out ways of directly tackling a lot of the issues and concerns that you raised Tanya, and we could speak on ways of being able to incorporate even his test testimony to be able to give more validity to the claims that we're making in the resolution and give it more life. My thing is: City know if you were to have every if you were to receive any state or city subsidies or any program that you feel could leave the burden of the pandemic. What would be some of the suggestions that you would be able? What would you provide? What suggestions would you provide to the city in order to you for you to be able to open up a full capacity? Then that's a real question: no Mingo, you know the city of the states we get it. I mean I actually got that people own payroll, so that's money that has to use it for my payroll money. I come only touches 25% out of that money and to use it for whatever I want to mean now, whatever I want. When it comes to rent who know the 75 has to be useful for payroll I'm, not again that much I think I didn't get enough money and I don't get that big long. For me to say: okay, you know what I could stay open for five six months. We are no problem. So that's that happened to me, because you know the amount of money that I guys that it was so much and the thing is that I see you know we as a small business. We know we get and I don't know. We need to get even true for some long. We have to go to allah and we're not getting it done. So it's like to be honest with you. Guys is something to the whinny or do you would know? We all need to be worried about this. Okay, I'm opening up the floor to anybody in the committee that has any questions, concerns yeah I have a question: do they go hey since? Thank you so much for joining us. So quick question for you around. You know you do have an event space and that's extremely valuable, especially to some new services for the state, testing, anybody testing or even Cova testing and there's some other like services. I know of I. Just don't know if Tom my head, that are looking for event space. Has anyone reached out to you about that? No one is thinking about having it right now and that does put it take time. Oh and then I don't know right. Okay, sorry, yeah I meant to use your space for some official duties of the state like testing. I know that they're looking for a lot of places, especially in the heights, has anyone reached out to you to maybe use your or rent your space for testing, not no more habit, we job so now. That's something that would be interesting for your resolution, Tonya that you know in events where it's like you know, contact tracing, checking, places or further expansion of testing, or what have you perhaps like for the areas in our community like, for instance, the antibody testing I had to go to the Bronx for mine? There was only one antibody testing in Midtown. You know right now like if 809 is open, they should be having antibody testing up here for the community, so maybe something we should think about when it comes to using underutilized spaces right now, especially like eight or nine eleazar. Bueno has actually has Anna ELISA yeah. Thank you for always good points. Our businesses employ undocumented families more than anyone else, but when it comes to the paperwork for the PPP approval, we can't count that as payroll because they're on that commitment, but they are employees so the fight, please make me a co-host. I'm. Sorry, listen! Please make me a co-host, Lola, okay, so a lot of our pieces in the opening and of the opening phase situation of, thank you and it seems like there's a lot of concerns that you must address when we create and I thought. Anya's resolution is headed to that source. That step where, when we think of reopening we have to question what does that mean and who are the people that are actually reopening who have the resources to do so Cedeno. Another question so I noticed that there's a lot of commotion going on in Dyckman. There was a rally today around a small business and looting. Can you speak about the impact that that's having and the extra expense now to be able to protect your business from individuals, work or your community and unnecessarily and just to be clear? There's a movement right now on police brutality and police abuse right and some individuals have used this to be able to, and I personally feel like. These are perfect professional provocateurs to divert from the message at hand that there is a systemic issues happening that are impacting our black brothers and sisters and alongside other people of color and they're, using this whole looting situation. To divert from that. You know so. I just wanted to state that before we see any hope you could provide your response. Please yeah I! Think Domingo, you right on that, because you know we are we all brothers and sister, and now we as a small business, you know we were coming from most of these pieces. I have my own path so I, you know it's like today. Like you said we are, we were we got together with. We call up the CEO from the 3/4 and group of guy from the community and sorry about that. Guy I was getting a phone call so yeah, so we yeah that's something that me myself. We was already I, wasn't ready for I had to say my guys too I had to say my guys to our hot Depot I had to give my hundred dollars wire to make sure I cover all my windows tonight, because you know since I don't want. You know, I wouldn't want someone to come and break all my windows on unloaded. You know and that's something that we're not ready for that. We right now in the middle of for Demi, then a crisis then top of that we get in this too. So I, don't think you know we're not ready for this we'd already. You know, like I said this, is we are sending that the wrong the wrong message, I bite by doing it this way, because, like I say this most of this business, this is this is a. This is a this is a family. Families are business, a small business, and we have you know employees that we have yeah so most of employ that we have this from the neighborhood. They have family and you know now we had to face this situation. It's really sad. You know it's like I said you know it is we now we know we're not ready for this. Definitely not I'm gonna do is. Does anybody have a question on the committee? Anybody going once so, I have a question: I have a question how's everyone doing seriously, no seriously! No thank you for coming and giving us your time. I noticed that eight or nine, unlike some of the other bars, didn't open halfway, meaning delivering drinks or delivering food. Why did you guys decide not to go that route? Well because, since you know, I have another business across the street, so I'm doing everything for one across the street plus my me keeping up the doors open on eight or nine. That's cuz, that's gonna cause me a lot. It's gonna cost me Allah and you know we got a. We don't make we're not making the money to in order to to not even to think up in our eight or nine it's a large space like you know, and I was and I wasn't gonna be able to keep up with it. So that's why I had I didn't even bother, OpenOffice or, like you said, for us a bar or drink, so I am doing it across the street. Got it no booze. Would you mention when you said earlier about using it or not as a space, I think, honestly, every single club or bar that has some sort of open space like 10th Avenue? What's the one, seven is it's seven or one one, eighty something I can't remember one, seventy something and then all the place places in on Dyckman that if we can convert those spaces into testing grounds for either Kovac or antibodies and probably get some government funding that can help these faces stay open. If that's an avenue that we can tackle, I think that we should give all our efforts into that. If possible, I honestly think that we should put into the resolution that Tonya's got work in Francisco I think that's the best forum for it. Okay, completely right, it's a good point, Francisco, so I think moving forward and Tommy. You could comment on this if you have any suggestions, but I think one of the areas that seems that collectively we cut we've come to an agreement, it's with the whole being able to identify temporary uses for these spaces in order to generate revenue so that we could be able to alleviate the burden once the business has to reopen and I think like Nobles stated, potentially using these as testing sites for both antibodies and for the virus seems to be, it would potentially generate the revenue to be able not necessarily a profit or better, but to be able to maintain a certain cash flow coming into the business. So I think we have to do our due diligence with that and identify, and even speak to some of the elected officials that are here. What type of initiatives are being done to be able to bridge the resources offered by the city and the state in order for businesses not to drown, you know so I think and Tanya you have do you have any remarks on that yeah you're, muted, yeah. Thank you. Yeah I, totally agree with that. I think that yeah in the interim we are, we are rapidly approaching reopening like phase one is Monday and that will allow retail. If you people are retail, to do curbside and things like that, and who knows, we might be in that phase for a few weeks, and then we will get to the phase of restaurants phases that sorry I believe it's phase, two from what I saw the last thing I saw on the governor's press conference I, believe restaurants were phase two but I believe there were restrictions, they're gonna be restrictions like it could be capacity and then outdoor they're, looking at allowing people to use outdoor space, but yeah I think I. Believe don't quote me quote me on that, but I believe when he put up the slide in its press conference that I believe restaurants for Phase two, so we're rapidly approaching so, but I do agree that there needs to be some businesses won't be able to just full fledge, go full speed ahead. You know when it's time to reopen and there will need to be steps taken to help these businesses to get to that point, and so I think that's a very key point and I appreciate. You know that insight yeah. Thank you so much city low. Do you have any closing remarks on a ways that we could potentially effectively advocate or any project anything you would like us to amplify in regards to resources for your business or yeah? Anything you need from us to be able to put in the forefront of the conversation when it comes to. Thank you. Don't we go I, think you what you're doing right now, I think is. You know like I, guess a I begin, the right track and I and I do believe that we go. We gotta get some resolution that will help us out for now. Let's just list this wait, let's just wait and pray that everything comes out: okay, boss, okay, Tomiko! I just want to piggyback with what mr. moranto said about the lot of some of his employees being undocumented. I do have a legal question and I, hopefully, maybe I, know see that representatives are here from the councilmembers office. That could probably answer that is in what way could they be legally integrated into making sure that, even though those businesses do employ have a number people who are undocumented? And what way can we can? They still be able to get funding to so that they can reopen because he mentioned it was a very good point that he had employees be couldn't use the PPP funds for because they were undocumented, so I would like to sort of. Maybe when we get there see, if there's some insight that we could get in terms of what we could ask for in a resolution. What's realistic for us to ask for as far as that situation. Oh, it's! Okay! I just want her to say something quick, we TI ins, which is that would cover okay, so you feel being able to cuz. I from my understanding- and luckily we have angela here- who's- been immigration lawyer or has a very broad understanding of immigration with I felt like what's interesting to know and what people have to understand is you might be undocumented in this country, but you can't incorporate a business and once you get that a Ibn number, you can actually make money. You could become a millionaire and vien documents, and just so folks are aware and Angela correct me if I'm wrong, you know that that's right, Domingo I mean there's a interesting irony in that a business owner. No one asks for the status of a business owner. So you find these interesting situations with like landscaping. Companies, for example out in the suburbs where the owner of the landscaping company is undocumented. Yet all of the employees are documented and so and so that's a you, know, a unique aspect around the law, the ITIN number, a piece I said: I'm, really happy. You brought that up, because there is a bill as one of the stimulus package bills that passed in Congress I, don't think it passed in the Senate. That said that, if someone can prove you can show they have an ITIN number, they can receive a stimulus benefit, but then would also benefit on the small business owners. I mean the one thing that I also just wanted to share is that in the immigrants rights movement for years, we would tell people who are undocumented. Get an ITIN number pay your taxes through the ITIN number, so that when there is regression reform you can say. Well, you know what, for the ten years, I was living here when I worked, I pay taxes now we're in a situation where we don't see, reform coming and these people may never get the benefit ever of the of the money. They've been paying. Thank you so much Angela, but that's what I'm trying to say like there's ways around it, and it's just about understanding the laws and being able to make sure that our community benefits and we find those gray areas, because if corporations could avoid paying taxes, we should be able to help our people get the proper recognition CD low. Thank you. Thank you. So much for being, unfortunately, fortunately enough, you were the only test, the small business testimony today, because everybody is busy putting up the la medida and crying play will apply no windows, oh yeah, everybody's, covering their windows. We had Oscar from locksmith he's like Domingo I'm doing right now. Don't thank you guys, thank you, don't mean go for an I guess, yeah and the great thing is just know that we're working Tonya Bonner has a great resolution that we will make sure is reflective and that our voices are heard. Thank you so much. Thank you there. Next up on the agenda, we have elected official updates, so I see here we have Evelyn Colorado from councilmember Adonis Rodriguez office, Evelyn C, to kill a. If you want to say anything. Any updates, I believe I. Send you a few points on what resources are available to small businesses and yeah Evelyn, hi, hello and hello to everyone. Thank you, for you know for the invitation to participate in the committee meeting before I go into an update for the recurring legislation for small business communication at the council. I just want to mention a couple of things regarding: what's Lila was referencing to in regards to the loans is I, don't know if he's still out there or if he left already, but I know that he mentioned the just the Paycheck protection program, but there are other loans that are available to small businesses that are not related to the paid to paychecks and he left because they're actually putting up the plywood in his business as we speak. He just took some time out and jumped into the committee. Alright, so I like to know if you know if he has applied for the loans and have not received any loans or if it's something that you know he has not tried to access yet because they are, you know there are some. There are some loans that he can that he will be eligible for that. You know. I would like to hear more about that. You know their reports. As you know, a lot of businesses in our community are not being approved for these loans, but you know I like to hear more about what the situation is, whether they you know he applied and didn't get it or you know he's aware of you know of them. Give me one second I mean give me just one second, okay and yeah. So basically, it seems like we're. Gonna have to start canvassing and figuring out what the current state of some small businesses are: I known, for instance, a lot of the feedback that I've gotten from the bank has been a light in this darkness is about Copa pool on the highest percentage of PPP loan approvals that I've seen in the community is actually coming from them, and what I would suggest is that as a committee, we start looking into what are the role that some of these banks are having within our community. Are they just here for show, or they just here to have an ATM, but a bank is supposed to provide more services to our community than just a storefront or just a quick access to their corporate banks, and that's something that I feel like we do have to question, because it seems like there's a difference: the differentiation in relationship when it comes to businesses, downtown and businesses in Washington Heights and the uptown areas of Harlem, Washington Heights in word, and the Bronx so I think something to really start thinking about. As a committee is what role do banks have in our community and it is it just face value? What you see is what you get you know. So that's a good call yeah. So I think that that's something that we have to start contemplating, because the recurring message that I keep hearing is well I didn't get it I didn't get it, but then you got a steakhouse downtown. They got twenty five million dollars that they had to return. So there's, obviously something not going on that. There's something wrong in that situation. Evelyn are you back because, if not so I want to highlight for him and for and for the committee is that there are a couple of legislations that were recently in not enacted at the council from Rivera and Adams and they are in relations to businesses, and you know personal liability for provision of provisions of leases, and you know against the harassment of commercial tenants. So these are two bills that have already become law and that prohibit you know, landlords to harass, tenants, commercial, tenants that are have been affected by you know the restrictions imposed by copy 19, and also that you know forbid them to hold tenants. You know personally liable for commercial leases. So is you know it's not a lot, but it's a very important step to protect. You know commercial tenants as they face. You know a lot of the issues of not being able to operate within this time. So I know that you know. Loss of revenue is a huge issue and this is not a complete answer, but this is something that gives them a little bit of you know. Space to you know, get back on the saddle as things open up. There is another bill that is, there are several other bills related to small business and Kobe 19 I, don't know if you guys are aware, but there is, it was another law that was recently enacted that prohibits certain third party food delivery services to charge more than certain percentages. You know in fees for the you know in their business relationship to businesses in the city I believe is for restaurants is that it can be more than 50% of you know the total right, 15:15 1/5, okay and 5%, for you know all other businesses. So these are you know these are you know important wings to protect local and small businesses and they were quickly signed into law. Also Joan I consumer John I also had a bill. You know signed into law that prohibits third party food delivery services to charge local businesses for orders that did not result in a purchase. So a lot of these businesses will charge the restaurants even when the person did not end up placing an order. So that's also that also has become the law. We have a resolution, consumer Rodriguez and Constanta need. Is they both have a resolution supporting state bill that will you know that is calling for cancelling three months worth of rent. You know across the board of residential and commercial, but you know that's resolution and, as you know, you know it's not something that the city can legislate, but we support. You know the state level. You know bill that is has been submitted in Albany and we continue to call for you know for this date. -, you know, cancel rent for three months or you know allowed, or at least for commercial tenants to allow them to exonerate them the value of those three months worth of rent- and you know in property taxes, or you know this- allowed the businesses some way to make up for the yeah. You know for the rent so question, though the same way that there's subsidies for big corporations and people that employ over a certain amount of individual there's, certain city and state subsidies. Is there anything being currently drafted or in the talks around like potentially having some sort of local city as BA, SBS, bail out or reopening packages for small businesses? I mean there are some. There are some bills that have been introduced there. Some ideas making you know the wrongs, but as it is it bailout you know not an item. Bad language, I haven't seen anything calling for you know a bailout, but sorry bailout I, don't want to focus it on that one I'm, basically focusing more on a substantive, just an amount of money. That's able to be allotted for the reopening back of the city and identifying particularly communities that have a and like Tonya's resolution is addressing a certain amount of vacancy storefronts right. In order to be able to maintain the small business and develop that small business infrastructure, there has to be a certain level of commitment from the city, alongside with the state and the federal government, in order to be able to reopen and not just have a go from 18 percent to 28. You know what I'm trying to say. So there have to be some effort or I monies identified, not necessarily as loans, not necessarily it just be able to incentivize the reopening of the city, you know and being able to add lots more businesses, particularly those who are disproportionately impacted by everything. You know the ability to be able to reopen without having like, because what sonido saying is pretty scary, which is like hey I, don't think I'ma have to reduce this imma have to reduce that, but yet we're talking about potentially having to add another individual to unemployment having another individual who's, not gonna, be able to work. You know what I'm saying so, I think examples. The city have full capacity and not just partially yeah, so we are introducing a bill. Next data meeting we just draft a bill to create an economic recovery task force. Coffee, 19 recovery task force, which is exactly that will be the main goal of this working group, will be to identify the ways that the city should move. You know forward in you know, post reopening, and that includes you know the business community you know and the citizenry at large. You know all the other issues that people are facing: lots of jobs. You know accumulated debt, you know, rent name is everything, so we are gonna, be introducing that on the next date state of meeting, and so we also have an update regarding the SP JSA bill. As many of you know, this is a bill that you know has been around for a very long time and it's currently being primarily sponsored by councilmember Rodriguez, and it's very controversial has a lot of you know pushback, because of you know the industry that is trying to you know to sort of regulate. As many people see it, there are some changes to the language that were recently introduced that will concentrate on business above you know, 96th Street and the outer boroughs and below 96 just storefront business. So we're trying to compromise on you know on the language to you know, help this bill move forward, so basically trying to highlight that the larger need for you know comprehensive. You know revamping of how leases are negotiated between landlords and commercial. Tenants mostly affect small businesses owned by you, know, immigrants and you know middle-class and working-class New Yorkers. So that's what we are trying to do open up to questions from the committee Evelyn me Tania and myself co-hosted a meeting once about that particular subject as be SBJ and how many boats are, and after this question it's open up to the committee. So anybody who has the question feel free to, but how many boats await is the legislation from passing cuz I remember. It was like a 29 30 31 at one point and all I needed was six seven more votes yeah. So we have a lot of support on this bill, but we need this work of the speaker to move this bill forward. So you know we were the speaker's not supporting the bill. Well, you know I'm, not at liberty to say he's not supporting this bill, but it's obviously you know it's not moving. It hasn't moved forward. You know any support that we could get from the community boards or any organization the local. You know small businesses to put pressure on the council to you know. You know schedule vote for this, for this bill will be greatly appreciated, but we have been you know we have been. You know, putting a lot of pressure with press conferences and a lot of events in order to highlight the need, especially now in the time of you know, of this crisis, I mean small businesses are hurting a lot and now, with everything that is happening in the last couple of days, I mean I, don't know how much they can take so I think it's time to bring it back up. I think this is the perfect and that's basically it I mean we are. This is just about. You know, creating a more fair like a more just. You know: negotiating environment for landlords and lease holders, and another thing that I was forgetting about the bill that is also being added to the to the bill is to create a pilot program for restaurants, and you know some other small businesses like pharmacies to participate with city programs that offer you know, discounts or some types of services to seniors in the community. That would allow them to sort of gain extra years to at least like you know. So, let's say a business has been operating over five years in the neighborhood and is you know, participating in this program with seniors and in the city will add, you know a certain amount of years to at least two extra years or something like that on top of the minimum ten years that you know, we have been asking as a minimum for businesses in good standing, I had a quick question. My vision is about penalties and fines. Is there something right now where there's a? Is there a temporary halt on these penalties and fines, or is that something you know because I'm not you know, as people start to open back up and other activities may begin in terms of inspections and things like that? Is there something that has been discussed in terms of that? Or is that something that you know we should be considering or thinking about temporary suspension of 504? You mean for yeah I know that there was something recently that the mayor signed into law, about penalties for businesses I'm, not I. Don't remember exactly the new rule in its entirety, but I also know that we have a bill to change the way that penalties are issue and the moratorium the time that businesses have to correct violations before they get before they get the penalty, so sort of like adding, like a warning time, a warning period of time for small for the businesses to get into compliance before they are even issue a ticket so but I would have to go back because I know that there are some recent changes and in the way that the city is handling that, but you know I believe that this administration is open to create. You know a sort of structure to help businesses get back into you know into business in a way that is, that is not punitive. You know they understand that the city needs to get back to you know to where it was and if you make it harder for the businesses to do this, you are hurting the entire, the entire city, you know so I mean, if you guys have any ideas you know well, you know I'll bring it to the councilmember and you know provide support from the councilmembers office yeah. Thank you so much. So what we'll do? Is there any questions from the committee? So thank you so much Evelyn I know there was a lot of information being that there's so much going on right now, I think huh. Thank you for taking the time to actually come in and do a very thorough presentation. If there is anything that I think one of the things that we could, we should contemplate sanyas incorporating language about the SBJ a into the resolution. I, don't know if in any way that were to take away from the message but I think everything, intersects, there's intersectionality holiday and it's multi-layered so I think that the stronger the resolution, the more that we could encompass and actually give some ideas. So, thank you Evelyn. Absolutely thank you for the invitation and, if you guys have any follow-up questions about the stuff that I mentioned I'll be happy to. You know, send you something in writing or something like that. Okay, thank you! So much! Okay, thank you! Guys! Carmen Donna Rosa, our Assemblywoman is here. Carmen was out there in the field. So the reason why we started a little bit late. She was out there as well making sure that she heard the voices of our community and just the people sentiment so Carmen you're up here for any updates in regards to legislative or anything pertaining to small businesses, Carmen she's muted, unless he's tier, she sent a question. No seventh heard her thing is: muted: okay, Carmen P. Here s K money on new her we care she has some new herself. She has the bill as apparently she come here herself in response there she goes Carvalho, no cheese on buy cheese. Now, let me see hold on this is Orlando by the way. How are you condo but she's on as well? She said that she was on yeah, see her here, but I. Don't see her in the attendees she's, apparently she's there Oh Carmen her just now hello. Can you hear me? Oh yeah, there you go. Alright, sorry, I, don't know. What's going on with this, I can't zoom in is the new standard we gotta get you citizen, yeah, alright hold on okay. Alright, you see me yeah, okay, I got a little bit thrown off because they're Lando's down there with my face and I'm like wait a minute. Thank you for the invitation and I Mia. Thank you. This is my daughter. She's, like I, just got home and she's, probably like more work. So thank you for having me. Yes, we were out there not only listening to the sentiments of the community, but also as somebody who grew up on Post Avenue, where we were today my somebody whose father came to this country to open up a bodega I'm in the Bronx when the Bronx was burning and was one of the first Dominicans to do that at that time you know, I really do understand what the value of a dollar is when it comes to opening up a small business, and it just broke my heart to see the images that we saw last night in the Bronx I. Think that is important for us to recognize and acknowledge what is happening in America is not okay and that we are not okay because of it, and unfortunately you know we have this curfew imposed. I have my feelings about the curfew, but one of the things that I was so happy to join the community on tonight. It's calling for us to not destroy our own businesses. We have to support our own small businesses. We have to uplift them and I think that that's the goal collectively and so I'm happy to be here tonight. Let me start by telling you the things that I'm not happy about I'll tell you some other things that I think are helpful. What I'm not happy about the rent package that we just passed, I voted, no and I feel like I need to explain why I voted. No. The rent package that we just passed last week in the legislature will only help 50 to 60,000 New Yorkers, and while it is some money and in this time of really hard economic times, you know helping 50 or 60,000 New Yorkers is better than helping no New Yorkers, but I honestly feel that I'm personally, tired of settling for the crumbs that are put on our tables and not being able to deliver for our communities robust packages of legislation that is actually going to prevent evictions. The package of legislation that was passed is basically based on rent burden and ami, and so basically, what it means is that before COBIT, your household was part of had a red burden. So, let's say your households had a rent burden of 50 percent, which is what we see in Upper. Manhattan is the rent burden for tenants this package, this legislative package, based on what your ami is, will restore you back to the 50% red burden, so we're passing legislation that restores rent burden and for me that does not equal relief. That is like basically so that you're, not in the negatives right, but that isn't for me mean that going forward you will have the ability to pay rent. In addition, it did not cover undocumented immigrants, and we understand that there's restrictions from the money that we're using because there is that is coming from the federal government, but I believe that there are work use in order to include undocumented immigrants, and there also it did also did not cover people who are not traditionally employed and the burden of proof was on the tenant. So you had to proof that you lost your income and the money is not coming to you, the money's going directly to your landlord, who can then turn around and evict you anyway. If you owe more than 30%, remember we're not making people whole we're just saying we're restoring you back to your rent burden, and so that means that you're responsible for that other half for the rent we're in this law. Does it say that once your landlord receives the rent that you're off the hook and that eviction notice is not gonna come through nowhere and so I couldn't have a conscious vote for this legislation. It was a very hard vote for me because I do believe that in this time of economic hardship, we gotta help people we have to help them and if one constituent in my district receives $600 a month for three months, it's better than zero dollars for three months, but I just feel that as a whole, if we're not in this together and when I'm holding the line together, we're gonna continue to settle for crumbs and so obviously bringing it back around to small businesses. This had nothing in there for small businesses. Small businesses would not qualify for this relief, and so for me, that was a big no-no. I think that we still have who I don't think I know that we still have not addressed the issue of commercial rents during this pandemic. We know that is that's the number one issue right now. I've had several conversations with cee-lo more on time, as you know who owns 8:09 and Syria was in a hole before the pandemic hit, because the lowest thing that he does not as a month for the renovate all nine and how could he possibly without making any money, continue to keep his doors open right and this and we're not putting packages of legislation together? That is actually bringing a relief that will help him to come up from the hole he's in and then stabilize right and so I'm disappointed in that I'm gonna keep working on that. We also haven't anything around the interruption insurance, which I thought was a big issue and I really thought we had some momentum to get it passed. So, basically, for those of you that don't know, interruption insurance is an assurance that businesses take out in case of interruption and pandemics are specifically prohibited from interruption insurance, so businesses cannot go and recover from the insurance they pay monthly. If it's based on a pandemic, so we were trying a Bobby Carol. My colleague from Brooklyn has a bill that includes pandemics as a reason for paying interruption insurance and so that members could get some relief from their insurance companies. That bill has not moved. We engaged with the bed around GrubHub and all these delivery apps, which have cost wreaked havoc on our restaurant industries. Up here we're talking to a group of small businesses about the issues there I know the city did something it kept them at. 15% I think that still wasn't sufficient I think more needs to be done because really those apps it's kind of like the ubers of the world, to the taxi industry, up town, they're, really sort of taking out most of the equity that is coming into the delivery systems. And so you know, those are three areas where I think we still need to continue to work. I'm gonna continue to bring my voice forward, I'm, not on the economic development committee, but I am on the banks committee and so we're looking at that as well. Banks are a huge equation. A huge part of this equation, sometimes a huge part of the problem. We know that our small banks were screwed in the first round of PPE we're hearing. That is a little bit better with the second round, but I'm sure that there's still a lot of businesses that haven't been made whole, and so you know as far as what has been done and what could be done and I don't know if you guys already know about this, but I'll just tell you whenever I'm repeating myself just tell me to stop, but there is a new alone that was put up by the Empire State Development is a lot. They just launched it. It's called a New York forward loan program and it's for nonprofit small businesses and small landlords, they're accepting pre-pre applications now for the regions that who have not yet reopened. So this is something that New York Region can apply right now. We know that New York is set to reopen next week. That's based on that's a moving target, I think because there's still parts of our state, a parts of our city that are not that are still obviously undergoing the pandemic and so I'm very concerned about the reopening process. But this small business loan is available. It's for small businesses and nonprofits that employ 20 or fewer landlords. I mean fewer full-time, equivalent employees. I, don't know, I have landlords. On my mind, small businesses that have a gross revenue of less than 3 million dollars per year or nonprofits that provide direct services and have an annual operating budget of less than 3 million and have now received either. That's the a PPP program or the SBA economic injury disaster funding for covert. So this is basically law, that is, for those businesses that have been excluded from those funds and in addition to that state pot of money, there's also a pot of money that was put together by the State Comptroller, and he announced 50 million towards a small business relief, job retention and it's available for New York businesses with no low minimum, but a maximum sets at 350 thousand 25% of the loan is targeting women and minority-owned businesses, and basically it's for businesses that, let's see businesses, what type of PPP can apply for this loan as well and UK, and it's part of the 484 billion relief package that was included from the federal government and so guys sort of where we are as far as these two funds of money pots of money that exists. Something else that I've been working on that looks to help workers I'm and I think that workers are a big part of the work force and our small businesses is the excluded worker fund. So senator state senator Jessica, Ramos and I introduced legislation, call the mark-to-market Act it basically tax capital gains for billionaires in our state that haven't been taxed before it would be an annual tax that would create five point: five billion dollars in state revenue and would create a worker bailouts fund, and the worker bailout would basically function to excluded workers in our state, like undocumented people, who may not have maybe the process of legalizing, but don't have all of their status together. People who don't have traditional means of employee meant like sex workers and others, and so what this one basically does is that it creates its own unemployment fund so that they can receive a monthly income, we're projecting that monthly income. If we get to the level of five point five to the tax to be a three thousand dollar a month income for these families, so it would be something substantial, not a crumb. Obviously you know there's a significant political conversation that has to happen in the state of New York about revenue raisers in general. We haven't engaged in those conversations, unfortunately, to the extent that I think we should be. We need to tack the millionaire's. We need to make sure that we are looking at appear to tear tax, we're looking at the stock transfer, tax and other ways to make revenue for the state in order to get us out of this hole, and so this is my bill with Jessica that we've put forward and is now up for discussion with the with the state legislature and we're pushing it. We have the support of over 50 coalition, orgs and unions and we're like moving the conversation forward to make sure that some of our workers and our communities can benefit from some of this. These funds, so I'm gonna, leave it there I'm gonna, open it up for questions, okay, cool, so Thank, You, Carmen, and going back to it. Thank you for your articulate presentation going back to it. We had a conversation around banks right and I think what people we were working on an event wave with somebody woman that Arosa around doing like what folks need to know about banks and not it just being face value for what is the purpose and what are the expectations that the community should have on these banks? Unfortunately, we had to postpone it because we were gonna do this meeting, but we could pick it up as a committee Carmen and work on that collaboration again. I know Cindy's in here and say these I believe the branch manager for TD, Bank and Toro 7 and as we engaged in these conversations, I think I. Think it's extremely important to be able to know are the importance of what are the roles of banks within our community and what does it mean to have a branch within the community because a branch is supposed to serve as a connection to the to the entity, not just we're, seeing it there at face value. But what benefits are you bringing to the community in which that branch is located and I? Think we could? We could tap into more into that towards the end, but imma let up Francisco, go ahead. Brother Carmen there's a pleasure to meet you I've, seen all your fliers everywhere, I'm glad that you are representing us by the way you are. You was talking about all these different ways that we can tax and raise money and funds for future issues with pandemic and small businesses. This is a similar. This is in the same realm of what we're talking about, but it's a little different because there's a huge business but industry that's booming and is creating surpluses for states and cities all around this country, and it's not a touchy subject cause depending on where your moral being is. It might be something you're in favor or not in favor, but cannabis. That's something that we at some point we're gonna have to tackle. I always hear heard the governor say we're definitely gonna make this something by the end of this year. I, don't know if that's gonna be delayed because of the pandemic, but in your circle, in your area of expertise and the bills and things that you hear what are they're talking about when it comes to cannabis and how can those potential earnings or monies can come into our community and help us similar to what those taxes can do as well? Thank you for the question and it is a touchy subject not for me personally, but for many I think that when I think about cannabis, we gotta split the conversation in three ways. The first bucket is education. We gotta educate our community because I will tell you this when I walk into a Senior Center to talk to seniors about whatever it is, that is bothering them. The first thing they say to me is no plethora of illegally selling marijuana inside. Don't you dare legalize that marijuana? That's the first thing they say to me right and I think that that's because there's a generational disconnect between what marijuana is for many and what it is for our seniors right and so I think that the first thing that we need to do is really sustain a conversation in our community, about substance abuse and about marijuana policy and the French differentiate these two things right. So that's very critical for us to do, and I've actually been engaging the drug policy Alliance on this heavily. We were actually planning on an event with Senator Robert Jackson last year around this. But then the situation with the needle exchange in the community got out of hand, and we needed to shift from the we in the marijuana conversation to talking about and focusing on that, but that's definitely something that still on my radar, a conversation that I think we need to engage in very wholeheartedly. So now, when it comes to the politics of things right, that's where I say that we need to break this conversation down in two realms. There is the revenue side of the of the equation. How do we tack something right that has caused harm on the criminal justice side to many of our communities? So, as we engage in this conversation, I'm a member of the black Latino Asian caucus, one of the things that has been on the forefront priority for us members of color has been the decriminalization of marijuana as we look to legalize right. We need to expunge criminal records of people that have been picked up on these streets because they were selling something that you now want to make legal, because the state needs the money right. We also need to talk about equity right, generational and wealth building in our communities. How do we allow these black men of black men and men of color to and women to be part and not just the face of it? So they can qualify for some MWBE thing that the state comes up with right. But how do we make it so that they can actually build wealth, understanding that some of them have criminal records based on the racist system that has existed in this state of criminalizing men from marijuana possession, and so one of the things that has not allowed this to go forward is that there is kind of a deadlock in where we won't go. If the wrongs that have been inflicted in our community or not put made right made whole because it's unfair, like for example, gave you an example of something that happened to me. I had a white man come and see me, and he was the owner of all of a corporation that operates in another state where marijuana has been legalized and he came up to me and he had a lobbyist of every high-powered lobbyist and they were talking to me and they were talking to me. Mom buy marijuana and my views on it and I said to him. I said who is going to be the president of your board, and he said we have this great african-american man he's going to be the president of the board and he's great, and he started telling me his credentials and then I looked at him and I said so. He's the president of your board, I'm sure he's gonna have a hefty salary, but why not make him part or no owner? Why not give him equity in your company, and they both looked at me like I- was crazy and looked at each other and just said we never thought of that right, and so this is the conversation that we need to push. The conversation needs to be that we don't want to be the faces of any companies that are gonna get subsidies from our state. We need to be the ones that are making the decisions for these companies to come forward and so that wealth can be kept in our community and grow, because when you eat the people around you eat and most likely, those people are people that are in your community that you have grown up with that you're moving forward with you right. So we have to be very careful about how we unpack this cannabis package, because we want to make sure that we are equitable and how we do that and I in a way. That is all token you know here you go because we want to make sure that people are actually have a stake in it, so that the conversations that have happened and when I have seen deadlocks on this conversation. It's about that. It's about how do we write that wrong and I think something that process will take for raising it. Something Carmen is very responsive, so I think we should. We deserve a conversation around cannabis and the stigmas that are in a generation, and unfortunately, it's not the new social norm at this point, so I think having a conversation intergenerational conversation around that Francisco is something that we could work on to be able to discuss it, because the possibilities are real and, like Carmen said, is that about tokenizing. But how could we identify people of color being part of the structure that benefits from it? Not necessarily just the face, but part of the investment part of the folks who are gonna, be able to profit from something that was used as a tool to be able to criminalize individuals? Any anybody else have any other questions for Carmen. I would also like to add real quick that we as a committee, as well as the licensing committee, should really start to have these conversations, because if we will, it will affect us. It will be part of our conversation whenever it legalized and I think we should start preparing for that conversation and get ahead of any programs, and we could take advantage of or speak to the Carmen's of the world and make sure they come in and talk to us and keep us abreast of what is happening in the political realm, because a lot of us are completely lost. We don't know, what's going on there and I just get the feeling that communities like the Heights and Harlem and the Bronx are gonna, be last yeah typically and then I'll say this before I see Angela has a question. I have a question before we get to answer this question. I'll say this: at the end of the day, if we have individuals that could advocate the way the way car like Carmen broke it down, the question is: how do we back that up? You know what I'm saying: how do we make sure that she's not targeted and that there's a mere campaign meant to persuade a lot of the elderly? Cuz I understand like the elders, are a big voting block in the heights, but unfortunately, that it's changing like Washington Heights, is not what it was five years ago. Imagine still being able to maintain certain stigmas that have not necessarily proven to the times, but yes, Angela, no I just wanted to know Thank You Carmen. That was a excellent presentation and I wanted to know within the negotiations around the cannabis bills. Is there any discussion around ensuring that companies do not or not in a position where they can't hire people who have past criminal convictions? Well, yeah come up in other states and that you know because I mean it's a it's a disgusting irony that someone who actually has the expertise in this and probably has even greater expertise because they had to do it in the way that they had to get it done through the informal sector, but that then they can't get hired by the supporting quote. You know legitimate companies because of a past conviction, yeah, absolutely that that's tied into exactly what I explained. Those are the type of things that we need to make sure are not happening right. We need to make sure that you're not gonna, be in some back room somewhere strategizing. How do you move this product because you have that experience but you're not being compensated for it or you're, not being acknowledged and worst of all, then all those things you're, you don't even have the opportunity to have the equity, because you know it's like it's like a corporation right. It's like McDonald's, the people that are making the big money or not the ones flipping the burgers right, and so those are the inequities that we need to be responding to right now, so that we don't create a second-class citizen REE within this new industry that we're trying to legalize well is the old industry, but an industry that we're trying to legalize so yeah, absolutely yeah and I. Think and now finish off with this Carmen. So, basically a lot of the concern that was raised. One of our committee members, tiny time of my assistant, chair Tania, my co-chair. She did put together a great resolution around. How do we reopen and what does that look like, and some of the supports and I think Tanya if you're integrates with that another key element to it is: are we holding banks accountable for the face value that they just keep giving our community, which is you could come cash? Your check, you could come visit our ATM, but are you really supporting small businesses? Are you developing relationships? Were you bringing in it's okay, that the loans and I believe Christina you work in a bank as well, if I'm not mistaken, no, actually, I, don't work in a bank I work above the bank, similar names, I work for neighborhood trust, Financial, Partners, so, okay, the credit union is on the first floor, then we're on the fourth on the financial coach. Oh, but thank you. It's happened to move forward, but banks how we hold them accountable and Tonya. One thing that we could incorporate is: what does it look like to work with a community beyond face value and that's something within itself: yeah, that's one of the things I guess I was given, but you definitely right. I can be refined and running the resolves we asked about. We do mention that request that SBA lenders federally insured banks, credit unions and others in our community that they increase their outreach efforts to predominant to our communities to ensure equal access, yeah and I, don't and also focus on what equal access looks like. Are we currently engaging our local small businesses with low-interest loans during the pandemic? Are we informing them of what is available? What are what the banks are offering to be able to help them relaunch or restart their businesses or reopen their businesses? You know so I think it's extremely important and Carmen. Now that I have you here, the committee will work on that. We will work together, I'll reach out to Orlando I'll, send you an email as well. I'll see everybody in the committee so that we can move forward on the conversation around banking and being able to develop the standard of what thank you came within. Our community should look like and what's the expectation, the preparation happening on the state level. That I think is interesting. I still got to learn more about it, but is the conversation about the public banks and creating a public bank in New York. You know, I. Those ideas always seem interesting to me. They always seem like something I want to support, but we also have to remember that not all communities, unfortunately, are billed equally bring in a new product. Like a public bank, you know how do we make sure that the realigning that existed doesn't continue to kind of rear its ugly head when it comes to our communities and I know that not all banks are created equal? So you know I, think that it's important for us to have that conversation as well and I look forward to engaging with the committee in, however way you guys see fit and I'm a resource. I have a lot of information. In my mind, I also love to read on this stuff because on the committee, so if I can ever be of service, just call them. Thank you so much I think sadly, Fischer had a question. Oh good, you could have mute yourself and ask Carmen. That's gonna be the last question before we move on just an update on the agenda. Unfortunately, Frank from the bodega Rosso Association is not gonna, be able to be here because, as you know, everybody's just the Bronx was hit hard and everybody's just getting their business is ready, so to be able to avoid any few. The future instances of looting so sadly closes hi, Carmen I'm. Sorry I was late. I missed most of your presentation, because I was at the Columbia Cove aid community update I wanted to know, and your other life is working on mental health, who is studying the mental health and public health implications of the legalization. Marijuana yeah, that's a great that's a great question. I would say that at this point, as a committee on mental health, we have not gone there yet there's a separate committee that has started to look at marijuana, which is the committee of substance, abuse and alcoholism, simply because there is. This worry right about substance, abuse and marijuana legalization, and some of the members had continued to bring this up. Even though we know the correlations of addiction in marijuana are very diminished, so that committee has started to look at it. I think it's an important topic for us to look at. We know that there are people who have severe mental illness that use cannabis to treat some of their illnesses and I know. That is something that is known and documented, but we haven't really done that work as a committee just yet, but I think it's a good area for us to start looking at one of these days, I won't have a long conversation with you about, what's going to happen to the mental health system. Thank you, sadly, thank you and I would encourage you to connect via email and followup with Carmen directly now moving forward. Oh Carmen. Is there anything any closing statements any anything you won't want to put on our radar that we should be looking at this time? No I'm. Just thank you for the opportunity. You know this is a tough moment for all of us, see your elected officials as a resource. There's a lot going on from Kovan to racism, and our offices are working to make sure that a lot of the bills that have been held up that will bring some equity begin to pass I'm a very huge proponent of criminal justice reform and police accountability, so be on the lookout for on Thursday. The black Latino Asian caucus is going to do a huge rally at the state office building. We will be there in full force presenting our agenda as legislators of color, of what we want to see when it comes to police accountability, and you know enough to just say that I love you all and I hope you're safe in this time. That is so troubling. So thank you for the opportunity. I. Can you can you put your email on the question part? So we can have it please yeah! Thank you so much, okay, perfect! So moving on to the agenda, so we have a presentation around CBA's I heard that term a few months ago, for the first time, community benefits agreement and I was participating in a meeting that the congressman, the ironist bhaiyaa, held up with the tower that new development in eternity first Street and Amsterdam and I found it very interesting that there are agreements out there that are legally binding, that we don't have an understanding of, and we don't have an understanding if they're still being upheld. You know. So when you have these big corporations, these big developments coming to our community to benefit from them. They have to there's a certain negotiation that goes that takes place and a community benefit agreement is developed for that. I'm. Actually, I reached out to Angelo Fernandez who's, a lawyer to be able to presentation for the Committee on what is a CBA Angela. You can go ahead and begin your presentation, please sure, no, absolutely and thank you for the invitation, Domingo and Sally I'm glad to hear that you're on the call, because I think you remember that in a presentation at Isabella's there I think it was related to the Port Authority, where I think they were announcing. Its opening and I had asked where's the community benefits agreement and they think someone said there was one, but as far as what you know, folks in the audience they didn't know about it and I think that that's a critical piece there, and especially then Domingo. You mentioned that the towers that there is a community benefits agreement. But the key component to the community benefits agreement is the word community and when you look at models, excellent models of community benefits agreements. They are binding agreements legally enforceable and they are done between typically a developer and the community, and the community is many times represented by a coalition of groups or a coalition of leaders and I. Think that's something that we have to have a robust conversation about, and so what do you typically find in the community benefits agreement? We can find on the way there's actually before I go into that. But I want to also add is that when we think about our neighborhood and we think about a building that comes in and says that they're going to build an additional eighth floors on a building that already has two floors? Well, those additional eighth floors at their building. They're gonna make millions and millions and millions of dollars off of that over many years. So what benefit is the community getting for essentially giving them permission to do that and that's why the best community benefits agreements are negotiated with the community at the table and I'm sure you have heard this quote: it's a quote from from a bolita congresswoman, where she said if you're not at the table, you're on the menu and, unfortunately, I think we have been at risk of being on the menu on in our in our community. So one of the things that a good community benefits agreement would have is, for example, workers that their pay is a living, is a living wage that they are hired locally additional pieces that I have seen in in strong community benefits. Agreements are where the developer agrees to pay for a study to understand the recreational needs of a community and also fund, whatever the study produces, which could be certain equipment in parks, creation of parts creation of a community center that people can use one of the things that I wanted to go a little bit do a little bit deeper dive on is: what's considered, the largest community benefits agreement in the country, and this was agreed to in December of 2004 in Los Angeles and so I'm gonna just read off a couple of the details, because I mean ultimately in the end, when it comes to community benefits agreement, we can decide what that is. It doesn't have to be just one way, but for this one it was the building of the Los Angeles Airport and so a binding contract between the entity that was managing the Los Angeles Airport and a coalition of organizations and labor unions signed this agreement that had in it monitoring of the agreement and checking to see if the groom was being enforced during certain times, and so one of the things that they included is benefits for the school districts. That's what negotiate in a separate agreement. So it's something I think really important. You know our schools are under sourced under resourced and if a developer is going to come in here, then we need to. We need to put that on the table. Secondly, and this one had 15 million dollars in job training, funds for airport and aviation related jobs, another one is local, hiring giving priority to local residents and low income and special needs individuals to be hired. Funds for soundproofing, effective schools and residences I mean this is something that is extremely necessary when you have an airport, that's expanding to pay for the soundproofing in people's homes and in schools, retrofitting diesel, construction vehicles and diesel vehicles operating on the tarmac to curb air pollution, electrifying planes at the gates to eliminate pollution from jet engine idling funds to study the health impacts of airport operations in the surrounding communities and increased chances for local minority and women-owned businesses to be able to do business. So that's the procurement stream that the airport, this new airport would actually produce so I thought it was important and I mentioned it to Domingo, not only to share this information on as something that we should be demanding this from developers that come in, but also I, think it's important that we understand what has already been negotiated in our name and understand that, put it up publicly and let's look and see if whoever signed these agreements, if they are actually holding up their into the bargain. So with that I'm gonna want to take too much time. I'm happy to take questions. Thank you for that. Let's call you got a question, no I just wanna say thank you, for that was enlightening yeah and the reason behind this brief conversation was that I think it's extremely important as we do our due diligence to understand somewhat magnitude. Negotiations are currently happening in our community in our name right. So if somebody's gonna come to our community and part of business, development is also being able to make sure that we leverage these developments to be able to meet the needs of our community, but also the means of local businesses right like, for instance, right. There should be CPAs that provide ownership to small businesses within our community within those particular projects, for instance, if we're building a hotel room right, a big hotel that has X amount of commercial space etc, and it's renting no space. How come a portion of that- and this is where I say the importance of a land, a land trust is so important. When these development comes into our communities, there has to be a portion of that investment that goes back to into a community. How great would it be to have one of our doctors have a space that they own within these projects and I? Think it's important to note that we have to start thinking, and Carmen spoke about that. We have to stop thinking about the crumbs and start realizing that when folks want to make money off of our community, there should be a standard that the helps and works with everybody, including our small businesses and certain guarantees. Steve I know you have your hand up, go ahead: Steve yeah Angela. What are the situations where a developer is legally required to enter into a CBA I? Don't believe it applies to every single situation, but there may be some where it's absolutely a requirement like a Columbia, had to negotiate and provide a CBA for its Manhattanville project and I. Think that may have been a requirement, but is there something in the law that stipulates when a CBA is required? So what I can tell you is that many times CBA's are entered into because the community demands it. My understanding is that there isn't a city law that stipulates that, but there are, but there are municipalities that have created laws that say that for X project of excise they must enter it in entrance of community benefits agreement. So I can't answer the question about New York City specifically, but it has happened in other cities. Why? My suggestion is that's what we should be. We can't research because we I mean if developers are required to you, know, there's certainly far less of an incentive for them to do it. With exact, with respect to the radio tower project on 180 year, first Street, when they came before the community board, we negotiated and got a half a dozen concessions from them. I, don't know that you would. That would constitute a CBA, but it was. There were some provisions there that were comparable to what we you would have in a CBA, kuranda and but yeah and I think the closest we have in our recent history is, with the 87 points of agreement that Adonis negotiated in the inward rezoning, not that that's a CBA right. No, that's that's true and I think that the other piece and by the way, I mean I, commend the community board for negotiating the community benefits agreement with 181st Street I do I'm a very big believer that it is really important that people or organizations that may not be in the formal structure also be at the table on negotiating because I think. Then you get a diversity of voices around what the needs of the community are. But the great thing about the community board is that it actually does have a lot of diverse voices, and you know I mean I, just I just you know it's again. It's just so important to reiterate that when you have diverse voices around the table, then you get. You have some really unique and interesting ideas, because it's the people that are living in this community and I. That I think it's really important to have people that are marginalized at the table as well, because they're, the ones who are going to be able to say well. This is actually what's needed here, and so what happens in certain municipalities who have community benefits agreements and just really quick? One final piece is that when cities see that a good CBA or a good constellation of strong CBA's, actually lifts people and lifts a thousands of people out of poverty? That's when they start, then putting legislation and saying, for you know, X amount of you know of the kind of development you want to do. Then you have to make sure that the CBA invests this amount of money or a value of this amount of money. Because that's what we're that's? What we're really talking about you know I actually have a question before anybody had a question. Yeah I have a question. Actually do we go first? The question I have for you is: how do we ensure that we can bring those marginal I know those people to the table? Because, in order for this, like you were saying to be effective, we have to make sure that the community actually represents the community, and so- and you know and I see that in problem problems with even Manhattanville where it's like people are saying. Oh no, we didn't get anything that we needed our community, you know if they didn't hold up there in a park, and you know you hear those sort of things. How do you ensure that? How are there some techniques or methods to make sure that the people that should be at the table or actually at the table, are not marginalized from being at the table? You know, I mean I, think that actually does take a lot of your friend people working together and I, think it takes a little bravery and when the ghost went you know, I mean if people are doing if their negotiation is happening in secret. That's a problem, that's a problem right, specially around a CBA. So if someone learns or finds out, then they have to let other people know and there has to be a process. There has to be a process around when a community benefits agreement is about to be negotiated and the process can be created by multiple stakeholders on the end of the process and I mean this is something that can be developed together with the community board, with uncertain, potentially certain nonprofits or certain, even certain individuals that have that are tapped in there are these folks that are informal leaders that are tapped into the community and so I think it just takes someone taking you know leadership and saying we got to make sure that these voices are at the table as well and just and didn't just create a process for that, sadly, is before we think before we move on to the next item. Is there anybody else that it wants to ask a question on once twice: go ahead: Sally, okay, here, ideally starting 2021, we won't have those kinds of problems with community benefit agreements. My comment is just to Steve. There was also a community benefit agreement for the let's go to Marsh development in would help park. It was battered back and forth for years. I think wasn't signed by both sides, but I don't think it was even clear what which were the two sides, but that was also a you know, a small fraction of what the Manhattanville project was, but that also necessitated community benefits agreement. Okay, thank you so Angela. Thank you so much for the presentation. Thank you any final remarks. We an anonymous question. I, don't know the mean goes up to you. If you want to you can see it. There is anonymous attendee. So Anjali, you have a question here. How do you we initiate a CBA in a community where economic development is set to happen where the conditions that need to be in place? Who are the key players institutions with developers, HPD EDC? Does it apply for only public spaces or subsidized spaces? So the last part of that question I'll answer quickly. No, it does not only apply to public spaces or subsidized paced spaces. Let me give you an example of something closer to home up in the Bronx the Kingsbridge Armory I wish. Many of you may be familiar with this huge space that had not been utilized and as soon as there was some interest in getting it utilized on the Northwest Bronx community clergy coalition, which is a housing rights, nonprofit pull different organizations together and demanded, that is, CBA, be negotiated and they did that it took many years, but they did it and there, and actually that CBA is considered one of the top CBA's in the country. So you know I think it takes. You know the will of an entity or certain individuals to come together and say we're gonna we're going to negotiate this and get and get this done. No, just that you know we have so many tools at our disposal, but without exposure to them we don't know to use them, and so I think that we are in exciting moments in the sense of a diversity of voices are at the table and, let's use yes, you utilize that diversity of perspectives to bring really positive things to our community and primarily to uplift our communities out of poverty. Thank you so much. Oh thank you next Tanya. So unfortunately, there's gonna be we're. Gonna have to table some things. We're gonna have to table the well the ghetto Association resolution proposal being that the person that was gonna present is actually not available at the moment and Tanya I feel like we should go into your resolution and then any of our partners a year. I know Jackie's here as there's anybody from the Washington Heights Chamber women's Chamber and the bid for them to speak up, and we finish this meeting where we're at an hour and yeah we're like a never in 30 and already so, let's do okay, alright! So how do you want you want me just to describe it or you want to put it on a screen? I, yeah I think you did a great job by sending. Is there anybody in the committee who needs who needs to be informed about what time the resolutions on his presidency today she sent it on Sunday, I, believe, okay, so tiny, if you want, you can share it on the screen. Okay, to see it and then again like we discuss just adding a few more where as azure be resolved, where it just includes its moenay's and a lot of the conversations we had today, which I felt like the banking Tonya like I felt like that would like I felt like it wouldn't necessarily be. You think it would be prudent on this one, because I feel, like the banking needs to be a statement that we do alone, like a resolution just for banking and the type of business that you know what you think well I think we need to yeah. We definitely need something separate about banking, specifically I. Just thought that in here, because a lot of the covent related funding is coming from banks, some of it is so that we need to at least mention it. We don't have to go into full detail. We can leave a lot of that out, but you know I feel like that it is you know you need to mention that you know, because the first round people didn't get as the PPP, they didn't get access by the banks, weren't really dealing with people. They didn't have a relationship with the big banks and things like that, so it just it needs to be in there, but you're right. We don't need to. We can reserve. A lot of you know any other further detail about that for a separate thing which I agrees. We have a very important we've got a few important voices here. I know: Raphael works for Apple bank and Cindy is at TD. Is there anything that we might be honest, share the screen and I'm sorry I apologize? Let me see it like Cindy. Would you like to chime in anything on in the conversation? I know you a muted yourself earlier in the yeah sure hi everyone a lot of great points today and thank you for bringing that up about banks and how we hold banks accountable. One of the things that I do see a lack of in our community specifically, is banks working together. Obviously we are in a competitive industry, but we do thrive off community based assets. So the way we succeed is if our community succeeds. So a lot of what I've tried to do is to gather the bank's in the community to try to come out and support in different ways. What my experience has been is not many banks either they don't have the ability to do so. The leadership in those specific branches or just dismissive about it. That's one of the things that you know when we return to whatever our new normal is that I'll continue to work on is getting the leadership of whatever these branches that we have available, either on the full, seven or Dyckman, or in wood, Washington Heights to come out and actually support, because we don't see a lot of a lot of banks in small community events. You know and they're the banks do have a lot of resources. It's not just PPP loans. We have. We have CB numbers, but those are called community based asset numbers that we need to reach and way that we do that is by giving back to our community. So we all have to do it in some way or another. So, in order for us to do that, the best way to do it is for us to work together and understand that we're not here to compete, we're here to make sure that this community progresses so I would love to see more banks out there and for the funny fact is that a lot of the branches in Inwood are minority and female run. So that's one of my targeted when it comes to engaging them more is how do we, you know, use this not only to empower ourselves or empower more people that are like us to be in positions where we can actually make decisions now this particular resolution I would say: is it's really looking at the broad picture in terms of we're about to start the reopening phase and a lot of our businesses have been struggling, even pretty no pre-pandemic, as the resolution kind of outline outlines. This is looking at all of the financial. The targeted funding set aside for Colvin we're rebuilding for small businesses. We want to make sure that this community, that it is a targeted thing that we, that whomever, is offering cofee related small business funding for rebuilding, that we want to make sure that is targeted towards communities like ours, where there's a large minority and immigrant population, and that would include not only just the bank relationship. Yes, but they're also, you know they're also other private funding that could pop up or maybe they're now, and we may not be aware, we want to make sure that we, our businesses, can access that and that we are demanding that we are making clear. We need this data, we need to know who is being able to access kovat related funding. Who is not? We need specific data for our community, because we don't have that. If you ask people well how many people will in this particular you know neighborhood or in this particular area receive funding is very difficult for people. No one has that information, and so and as Carmen mentioned earlier, there is a that other loan I mentioned in here. The New York one yeah, the New York loan that we mentioned in here. That also needs to be. We want to make sure that once that opens up, that we are able to that. Our community is able to access that, and that is the New York forward loan. Now that is for business, and she mentioned with fewer. It could be businesses or nonprofits with fewer than 20 full-time employees, and it is targeted for minority and women-owned businesses in regions that have reopened. So we are not quite there because our city has not reopened yet officially, but as of Monday, it will be in that reopening phase. So we want to make sure that we, our community, is gonna, have access to those funds and that we're gonna have data to show us that our community is being able to access those funds. They provided a chart on how it's gonna be breaking broken up because, like I know, downstate is receiving, X amount of state is received, they broke it up into the different regions and how the percentage of that each region is going to be able to get of that New York. Moving forward now, I want to make sure we I include all of y'all's amazing suggestions, because I did make notes and I just want to see what things need to be added into the resolution to complete it. I know: I'm gonna, just read back some of the things that you all said and see in what ways that we can incorporate this. There was a mention about the targeted testing so that businesses, you know targeted, covert, testing, temporary uses of spaces or businesses of temporary use of spaces to help them to you, know kind of bridge that transition between not opening and reopening. We mentioned it's more towards I, think nobles was trying and Nobles you could speak, go ahead. Nobles I think he was gonna address it thanks a lot. My dude I know just that, but I also have you know two other quick questions. It was basically what I was talking about before in the beginning of this meeting was basically about when opportunity, when we get more testing available, antibody and also covet the first places they should look in. The neighborhoods of for testing should be businesses with the requisite amount of space. Of course, and also you know the you know: safety accommodations, if you will, they should look at local businesses to rent that space first versus empty storefronts from landlords. First and foremost, that is certainly something I think that we should put in this as a part of that bounce-back and I. Think you got that down my two questions with this, though, and first of all, thank you so much Tonya for putting this together. I read it on Sunday I, absolutely love it! It's about transparency, but one thing I don't feel is in here is actually talking about transparency of where this money goes. So it's not just this money needs to come to our local community. It's we need to make sure that where the money does go wherever it goes, we know where it goes, and so, if there's a way that you know the first resolve yeah, that was the first resolve. Sorry, let me see that we are we asking for community specific data by race, gender ethnicity, who receives Kobe related funding both now and into the future. Oh sorry, I misread that Thank You Tanya because that's like you, said, yeah [Applause] accountable. We have no idea yeah, we got to hold them accountable. Like you all are saying we have to hold them accountable. So anyway, you want me clearer, more clarify that is there any way anything you think would make it. You know anything you'd like to add in there can we say data and information, because I work in marketing and data for me can be extremely amorphous. I can tell you. There are a thousand women between the ages of 25 and 54 that received this, but I'm not telling you that 809 received this. You know I'm, saying and so like so data and information, correct, like and maybe business information might be even more precise, because they'll be like well I gave you the data for the owner, not you know what the I think that would get to it. Thank you, and my second thing this is maybe for you, Domingo I know that the community board goes on like hiatus or break or whatever you know after this meeting for business development. Is this a is this a resolution you would bring to the executive committee to get approved and then go into the general I just want to make sure that there's clear, we could actually vote on me with the understanding of the edits that Tonya's gonna make okay I'm with it, but in the case that folks don't feel comfortable on voting for today is something that I would definitely put up for the executive or remember we go in hiatus, July and August, but that doesn't necessarily mean that as a committee, we can't just all coordinate and say all right. Let's me it at least once in July, that's er, oh I would rather this not come out of the executive committee. Meeting I want to do it. I don't find that very edible, but I would prefer that this comes out of the business development committee. You know just from us yeah the equation. I, don't want to go through that right. Second Tanya, what's important to note is that all options have to be available and if no Bryant dating, like a being that this is happening, are we gonna wait till September like no there's different avenues that we could explore, and that's why your chair all right so taught me that the resolution for me personally it looks great like even on before all the edits I felt like it addressed. It was broad enough to provide a lot of different avenues of information, but it was actually concise enough to provide a direction and I want to commend you for that, because, even though it tackled a lot of different issues, it was very concise and intentional, and that was demonstrated through the resolution. So thank you so much for taking time and actually putting in this work and yeah I'm like I, you wanna, pay, closer or undocumented issue about the issue. Is there something about the issue of? Are we asking for something for there, so they could be funding even with yeah, I, think I. Think addressing what Carmen dela Rosa said with that bill. Remember taxing the rich and creating that fun new revenues. We could also add it to your. We could also add it to your resolve in terms of in terms of like citizen, demographic or I. Don't really know how we want to word it, but you could add it as a piece of the resolve to call it out specifically on you know the businesses with you know, percentage of documented or undocumented I'm, not really sure to word it, but I'm, not yeah I. Think Steve. Simon also has his hand up. Were you trying to say something: Steve Sally, -, Sally -, yes, I raised a right now. Well, I just wanted an something: -, a noble suggestion about requesting business information that you should use the word, a specific business information not just leave it general and if the aim here is to make sure that our businesses receive this funding, I think we need to we'll get the word out to them. Less funding is available and I believe you said in the past that you've been in contact with. Maybe a hundred 50 or more local businesses. Yeah I will send an email blast to everybody that for the emails that we have from our last event, yeah. Thank you so much for the significance. Can you send them the information about this now? There's a New York forward program, okay, yeah and I. Believe we like slowly. We have but I agree on what I'm doing is I'm giving power all the emails, so she could incorporate them also to our mailing as well all right. But let's do let's do a targeted email blast to the businesses that you're already in touch with okay, perfect, Sally, okay, my question about the business specific it should be listed by business. I did I'm. Sorry Sally. You were you so very dick. What were you saying? I'm sorry Steve got my first comment, which way so they should say business. Specific data I know like on a federal level, there's a database that you can look up and see who got federal funding and there should be the same available in a state and city level have any of the business associations like the Washington Heights bit or the Chamber of Commerce reached out to our businesses to see who's actually received these funds, I'm, not sure I. What I could do is I could create a thread with all of us in it with the entire committee and reach out, see they're all Sandra, Harris and Kenya Verdejo to be able to see if they have done any type of newer or survey great. Thank you. Alright, we have a question here from an anonymous attendee. There are Rhys there. Is there any resources for people starting their first business. I know the priority is helping the current businesses, but for those who want to take this time and start a business, are there any specific loan options? At the moment, I'm not innocent, speak asked what options are I know that SBS and the Chamber of Commerce's usually provide a lot of assistance and a lot of guidance to individuals who are talked to trying to start their first business, even developing your developing your business plans, etc. So I would encourage what I could try to do is if you well you're, not a missile. If you try to you could look up the Chamber of Commerce's I know that you have the women's Chamber of Commerce and director. There is Kenya Vireo they're, very active around helping businesses, develop their business plans, etc. I just wanna, hello, I'm, Rafael Fernandez. The branch manager of the Apple Bank branch on 181st just wanted a touch base on that question there in regards to starting up the new business or getting information SBA and has government funding for those types of loans and regards to the new law that Tonya was speaking about, which is the New York, FL, f, Apple Bank is actually an investor and it's providing capital to New York businesses and for to receive those loans being that Apple Bank is not an SBA lender. These are the channels that we're using through other larger institutions, we're not the TV. Banks were not the chase of the worlds. These are. They have the SBA approval. Unfortunately, Apple Bank does, and so we are helping our community through the other back channel. Oh perfect. Thank you. So much Ruffy I was scrolling down and I see a name like I thought you had guy no, but thank you so much because Raphael is our public member. Oh man. He leads the efforts at Apple bank on 181st Street and he's also a resource being able to provide information as to like, because I consider Apple Bank Apple back as a community bank right, correct, senex, yes, correct I mean we only have some branches food work, but we're not a big corporate we're not publicly owned, so we're not public, so or family owned, ok, perfect and just feel free to chime in anything else. Is there anything else with the resolution Tania? Well, what I added I added the resolve about we were talking about. I said resolve that community boards well Matt had worked with stakeholders to ensure community business are informed with kohli related funding opportunities, because that was another thing that someone said was and that's what we wanted. Steve and I believe other people. So fewer people wanted to make sure we added in there and I'm adding in the issue the need we're asking for support for the excluded workers fun. Is that what we're doing right and so I'm, adding that in there and I'm gonna have that language in a minute? Is there anything else that people think we? You know should be in here before we see if we're gonna vote on it. Ok, let me just oh I would like to make a motion to bring this to the floor for vote, to see if we are yeah to bring this or vote. Second, like I, don't know what this window is so weird right now. Is there any questions around the resolution, so Tanya could stop a screen sharing? No all right! Tanika, you, okay, sorry, one question Domingo regardless Tanya. Can you just give a brief? Sorry yeah, you want me, give overview. Cuz, I, know yeah, okay, briefing over be right, okay, yeah! So very briefly, we want to make sure we're about to reopen right, we're about to start phase one on Monday. We want to make sure that if watch tonight's a.m. would all receive, it have an equitable access and targeted access for any funding related to Cole, vid 19, small business rebuilding, and we want to make sure that is targeted for communities like ours and that there is equitable and so basically we're asking your you know we were outlining. You know how we were uniquely impacted by this pandemic: being communities of color and communities with a large number of immigrants and how we had a large vacancy rate in Washington Heights, even pre-pandemic, that was as high as the whole entire city of New York. So businesses already vulnerable and we want to make sure that our business cancer can come out of this pandemic and survive. And basically what we're asking for a couple things. We had a several resolves, one of which was to request specific community specific data and business information by race, gender and ethnicity, on who received kovat, 19 related funding both now and into the future. We want to make sure that we acknowledge that state and local officials and other stakeholders acknowledged the need, acknowledge the impact of businesses who employ a large number of undocumented employees in the need to support a bill that would enable, though businesses, to provide for those workers, which is the excluded workers, fund and karma Delarosa was here, and she spoke about that. We also are asking community board asking SBA lenders: banks, credit unions and other regulated lenders participated in coe, viet 19 related loan programs, as well as any private corporation or nonprofit financial relief to increase their out rita efforts to predominantly minority and immigrant communities like ours to make sure that we have equal access to funding opportunities and we're also asking for making sure that they partner with us that federal state and local these same entities partner with community boards well to address any obstacles to come to access of our community in our community in accessing those financial resources and also ensuring that we inform our that community is informed of any really funding opportunities. So Tonya, howdy, Bo, well, Steven Han is raising and raised I, don't know if you want my sure, wasn't lowered. It was caught the question already: okay, Steve! Excuse me unless I'm wrong late, there's no questions very now, being that it was if I could I would just well. I haven't had a chance to see the resolution. I just want to make sure that it emphasizes that our community is made up overwhelmingly of small businesses, not national chain stores or major stores, and it's the small businesses such as in communities like ours, that need to help the most oh yeah. Definitely yeah, I know that's not good, I hope you're not coming down with roan on that. It's not here. Rhona is not cool. No, please tell me no Steve, please don't let that happen. You know asthma, condition, I, hope it doesn't lead to anything else. So I was just very briefly before we vote. Cuz I do want to get I did mention yeah we talked about the community district needs assessment from both in wood and Washington Heights, where we've noted the store for, and vacancy rates that was very high in Washington Heights and that most of the type of business we have were those that were clothes that were deemed non-essential. You know and had to close down, and that we have a lot of restaurants in that community that were reduced to like takeout and delivery. Only so in it did, you know emphasize how communities like ours are uniquely impacted by this pandemic. I, don't know, I'd have to see the language, but I mean. The point would be that again that our business, our business environment, is made up almost entirely of the small business type stores and not the larger stores. That seemed to be climbing the money up to now and I would like to have that point specifically made like you and Tanya could communicate just send resolution over once it passes and the additional language could be added. Then we have it. We have a history of communicating like we should just we have to do roll call right, since this is virtual and we have the Deauville Tanya. Yes, that's a yes right, yes, Jonathan, yes, Nobles, yes, I know Christina, yes, definitely and welcome to the committee. Christina, hey, I'm! Sorry, it's so long! It's just that this has been like our first virtual meeting in probably like two months at this point, so we had to compress a lot. No worries I, look forward to meeting all of you guys individually and getting to know you a little bit better. Okay, thank you! Cindy! Yes, Francisco, yes, Ashley! Yes, what's the very executive, like yes, I got a long day. All right am I and then we have our public member Rafael. Yes, is there anybody there? It's on our committee that I didn't call okay, so the main go? Yes. So our tiny resolution passed unanimously I know he has her hand up Sally, yeah I just wondered well one thing: I think there's one and I haven't read the resolution either this one paragraph. Will you refer to local and state elected? The resolution already passed. I would recommend that you speak to Tonya as she makes the final revisions and we could move forward all right. Thank you so much Tonya, so I'm gonna make those changes and therefore that to you- and he you know so- please sadly communicate with Tonya's. You will be making the final edits and we could just finalize the resolution before we send it up to. We send it to Docs. Okay, I know before we adjourn our meeting. We're almost there community partner updates, Jackie I, know you're, there cloth sorry, so it was just dark going here. Yeah ooh, I hope everybody's doing well, okay, a couple of things before it gets our update. I'm, not sure. If you're aware of this or not I was listen to the conversation. I didn't want to interrupt, but there are other monies available through PPP. Besides the controller and besides the new besides in New York, State I'm, sorry, it has an ear for loan fund, there's also something from Magic Johnson he's partnering with MDE capital apartments for minority-owned businesses. So that's one thing. The second thing is Sally just so you know: I tried to put out a survey for PPP to see which businesses actually got it and I got six responses, I'm, not sure how effective that is going to be, but just you know, FYI, and it's still out there by the way- and the third thing is the cdna that cloth completed, that I completed is published. Now they are translating it into Spanish. I am working remotely still our office from Peru. Besides the pantry, that's obviously busy 24/7 right now area. All other programs are working remotely, so I haven't really had a chance to get into Washington Heights. Very much I am going to go there either tomorrow or Thursday, but just know that once I am back there and I will drop off a bunch of the public. Cdna is at the board for everybody to have and the Spanish ones will come. I, don't know when they're working on translating them. Now. As far as our update is concerned, you know, as you know, we were working on pop-up markets. For the month two in the month of June Street permits were cancelled. We had to cancel our pop-up markets and that we're pivoting to virtual book clubs. So we have a collaboration with sisters, uptown bookstore and with work up, and we are going to bring virtual book clubs featuring local authors, local artisans and artists and local businesses once a week on a Saturday, beginning, June, 13th running until August 28th, whatever that last Saturday is before Labor Day. The first one is on June 13th as good as its with sisters, and what we're doing is we are it's free to the public. We're trying to what I'm trying to do is accommodate those vendors that I know either applied for the pop-up market or intended to apply for the pop-up market and give them the opportunity to we're going to with the grant money we're going to give money to artists. So each excuse me, each book club that we're having it's gonna feature an author. It's going to feature a work of art by tart, it's valued at $150, we're going to pay the artist for the work and then we're going to get a Gift Card for a business, a local business worth $50, we're gonna, raffle off and then the first five who register will get a free book.
