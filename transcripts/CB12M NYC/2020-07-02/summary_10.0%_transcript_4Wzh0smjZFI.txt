She will do more odd number to follow up on discussions from the last meeting: hey Isabella's request for books and magazines, the future of meetings, seniors and community unable to join meetings because of lack of equipment, technology skills, etc, long lines of businesses, including banks, post office, etc, making it extremely difficult for the seniors and disabled, and then it's you know the usual new business announcements.
Okay, I expect other people to be joining us, but let's begin so again welcome everybody to the meeting we had.
I know how's everything going with you, thank god, I'm, actually not in the city now we're in Maryland and my mother-in-law's home, so a little more space here for myself and for the kids, but watching and listening to what's going on in the city closely I can't say it makes me want to return home soon, guys we're good thank God, so Tara your mother.
I think, with the help of fern Hertzberg I have finally gotten the city to stop delivering uncalled for food deliveries, good cheap right, the only way she and it was to send a letter on her behalf and then my bag.
Great, so does that mean you have two public members now three uh-huh three, oh good, okay, cool I mean you know yeah the more than workers it works for yep.
Now it's perfect more voices Sally anything you want to share I, know you're keeping busy Sally so yeah and also because wanted one of the reasons I wanted to be in this meeting and I'm.
Also on another meeting with fountain house right now is that you had mentioned when you did your summary, that mental health needs for moving to your top priority and I just wanted to sort of weigh in on that and get some input.
We act on the key initiative on I mean I'm on their climate, democracy, working group and we're looking at heat issues and cooling centers and all that kind of stuff, and so I wanted to get and I'm, not sure if it's for you or through fern what the issues are that are communities facing with respect to getting the air conditioners that were supposed to be provided by the city, how they eligibility might have changed and also you know, utilization and what they might do during the pandemic.
Think, as you know, with all with our community in general, I think you know what, if this pandemic ever ends, the next crisis we're going to face is mental health care services because of the crises that people have been through, in fact that we are not providing many of the impatient.
Oh great, and otherwise the other issue has come up in what I guess is the noise issue and I'm I don't know they're facing it, especially if Isabella yeah I'm helping Betty Lehman said she would be joining us.
So I have a question for Sally this issues that you would like to add to the new business part of the meeting, or just these are just random questions that you have so I would like to say something about the a/c, the air condition you know for information, so I'll wait until the end.
There was an issue because Daryl Cochrane had brought some magazines up to Isabel and security seemed to not know anything about that was brought up at the I think at the general meeting.
You know lengthy period of time, so maybe people that had children or grandchildren that they have those really nice, their books, uh-huh and maybe they come printing over I mean they are very amusing.
Sorry, the next item in the future of the meetings and seniors involved in joining the meetings I mean there was some suggestion raised by the actually I think by Byrne and some of the we talked about it at the y-column eating the possibility of using tablets having tablets for the seniors, and they seem to be a easier way to navigate the system and get into youtube or something like that for the activities that are actually being given by B by the Centers.
I spoke to Domingo Estevez who's, the chair of the Business Development Committee I, spoke to him yesterday and one of the thoughts that he had was trying to reach out to you know, rather than change the hours, because some of them have hours for seniors like 8 o'clock in the morning.
You know I love it when they do that, but I think that if you know somebody, students aren't lying I think that we should be able to say okay, but you just you like to go ahead of me only they have a car full of like fifty five items, but anyway, that would be something that we need to promote to be kind to one another: no one's ours, Ella's ours.
I want to pick up on a whole bunch of things that people said: okay, I, don't I, don't think, there's a legislative solution here.
Don't but I can only speak for a certain fact of the community that I've observed a few things, so there might be a little more tool both of the bank seem to be able to do then I kind of walk people ahead and have their own mechanisms.
I know that if you have certain things that you don't need they're able to skip people around, and they don't have an issue with that.
So I think it would be good for I decide one anomaly yeah when you're talking about like urgent care centers and that kind of stuff I.
You know like when you call make the appointment, they always say like, be there an hour beforehand and then, when I actually got to the office areas going to, they said arrive no more than 15 minutes before your appointment and then you can come up because they don't want a lot of people.
Maybe you know hi I wanted to say something in regards to the lines and the business that I mean somehow I understand that it's not a regulation or a lot to do that.
You know it's making it more difficult to educate people to stay on lines for so long right.
So if we do, if we do send requests on the committee or the board since the request I'm sure they will they will, they will set up a line where we're on the other we will be, will have I mean priority, but Ned. You know in a in a organized way, it's saying to elderly and then one regular person, depending on how many is the people that can be inside I understand some businesses say no more than six the more than five.
Carol did you want to say something: okay, I think you know, I agree with all of you.
Okay, I just want to say a couple of things about under new business and then I can open it up.
You know in this agilent it's actually the OT do T's in charge and so I'm gonna be putting in a call two three one great plane about three different places that I see is a problem, so make sure that they understand the guidelines because I feel like some people, just don't so that would be I.
You know riding up and down I mean it's terrifying, uh-huh I, don't you know, I have been pretty much staying inside, but I'll tell you something you know after it's, it was dark enough for fireworks to go off, there's no way I'm going outside, because not only people idiots for setting them off, but they're idiots and don't have particularly good aim and I really don't want a roman candle landing in my stomach so and I'm sure that those same concerns are affecting people at Isabella and the elderly throttle community people can't sleep and they don't feel safe when they go outside say.
I had mentioned previously because they had done work for some folks in Dyckman that people are concerns about, and they were able to kind of not only make sure that people had an understanding of the rules, but had a copy of the rules that things have changed, but I think now they're a lot clearer, but after they have that conversation, they were like alright cool, we'll make certain changes that were supposed to make because again, as Maria said, that could be seeming threatening where people probably never spoken to them before, especially there are newer business and I would use the example of the Havana hyah Oh was trying to open when the pandemic began.
They need to get around safely, and it is not fair for you Mary to have to wait for people to walk by because there's so many things going on outside.
Even though people have the complete right to be able to get places on time without having to wait or Carol did you want to say something yeah, I really kind of it's a ticklish situation.
They don't ask the many question: they ask the person, you know the and they fully five for whatever services, and since like that we're saying three days if people have receipt, the air condition and install and everything now the second part of the issue which is dispenser paying the electric noise, the Canaries don't have a program.
You can contact, especially for seniors and people that have low exposure, so I think we have to take advantage and in another way to you know these new condition.
When there were successive 90-degree days now we're talking about the cooling centers not being opened in ninety five, three consecutive 95Â° days, I mean right yeah, you know, I mean I'll, be like very fiery, now, they're very fussy as to who would be it because you have to be over 10,000 feet.
Sarah, okay, great I, know what they're thinking is.
We sanitize them anytime, you're used with their own phones, where you could say: okay, let's get a zoom thing together, and then you get three or four people or five of one of ten populations frail and doesn't have a lot of resources right, no I would what I was thinking.
I would come up with some activities where I could just write out the instructions very simply, oh, and that people would do because most of the stuff, you know, I'm, not crazy, about zoom I, just think I'm too old.
Community Board twelve Manhattan urges Attorney General Letitia James to investigate the causes of the crisis at Isabella and responsibilities of mjh in this continuing crisis, be it further resolved that the state Senate and the state assembly health committees, open investigations into the causes of the deaths and the spread of infection said Isabella Carole.
My doorbell rang I didn't hear the end of it Jay. What did you say be resolved what I'm sorry I said: community boards twelve Manhattan urges attorney Letitia James to investigate the causes of the crisis, ed Isabella and responsibilities of MJ age.
If you don't mind, first of all, okay, whatever you want to say about MJ, yes or Isabella, all those numbers reported on a daily basis to New York State Department of Health since the beginning- and those are a matter of public domain and I happen to look at the website yesterday and we had a total since March total of 68.
Nor did we ever report any such number, so I need to tell you that fact is not accurate and if you want I can send you the link I believe it was already sent out in a prior email with the Health and Environment Committee right.
It's able to check it and we are you know where, if you look at the whole, actually that particular website contains all of the deaths in all nursing homes in New, York State, so I need to address that right up front and for whatever you want to say.
What's being happened, what's going on, what's not going on etcetera, so I know that this has been a difficult situation in the state but Isabella and for all nursing homes, we're not alone and whatever is going to come out of any kind of a commission or attorney general inspection.
We didn't have a right to have a discussion on it number three, which is that probably the most important thing is that this meeting is in July, even if we come up with resolution or with both and since like that is not going to be an effective resolution, because this has to be brought in September to our committee and then to the full board at the end of September.
So I will very much with respectful jay-j that we bring on the community world for years and years and hundreds of years I would like him to stage remove these resolutions from our meeting today, because of what I, just you know, is playing if I have nothing to do with right.
That is because of many of the reasons Betty outlined as to the governor's responsibility in this matter, which lead me to believe it's extremely doubtful that his health committee, his health department, will conduct a fair and complete investigation, because it would inevitably involve his wrists by disability and I want to point out that 6% of the nursing home residents, the New York State died of Kovac 19, while 14 percent of the residents died at Isabella as to what Reddy said about the excellent work in the past of Isabella before it had been acquired by mjh Edison, now known, I, fully agree and I.
Furthermore, think she's been a big asset to the community board, but those are besides the point as to the discussion of the question at the May Health Committee, which of course was two months ago.
A lot information there that I don't know I would no be able to vote yes or no on this particular resolution.
Just a person to you know to come up to some agreements because I, don't you know the way I feel I, don't know how the other field but I, don't think that will be able to vote on this particular resolution right now.
Think that you know I know I can be scared in writing, so Jay I need for you to send it send that resolution so that we can have something to look at.
Think maybe, if it's on the committee I have to you know, make a decision on that.
There I was going to make sort of a comment yeah hold on you, don't want to hear it hold on hold on I, think, and those of you that have more experience than I do I.
Think at this point we need to take a vote on what I'm, not sure Maria helped me with us take a vote on whether we want to okay.
Then we need someone to second the resolution and then proceed to a vote, but I say that even if we take a vote in a way, this has to be ratified in September, and that is like two or three months period between now and there, you know to continue working on that in the meantime, I suggest that he can send us Adam right into married, so cam married, so we can really take line by line to take a look at this resolution.
What I know is there a second to the resolution Richard all night, such thinking and we can't hear Richard?
There is some issues about you know the food coming being sent to differing areas, and things like that.
You know and I think that this is a great community that we need to help.
Another I, don't think I'm, sorry, okay, committee.
What do you think should we had open in Logos the community boy yeah we had, we had said we were gonna meet in August.
