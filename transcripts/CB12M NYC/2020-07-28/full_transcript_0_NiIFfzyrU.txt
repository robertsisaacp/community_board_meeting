We have daryl, I'm guessing sally, just said her point and he see that yeah. I just wanted to mention that at our last health and environment committee meeting we had a very robust meeting about fireworks and the noise that creates, as well as subsequently people just hang out, while they're shooting the fireworks and after and create the noise, and I just want to point out two things. One is to thank tanya for spearheading that conversation. That was a really great conversation and one of the best community engagement committee meetings. I've been to, and also just to point out, that many of the elected officials most of the elected officials, either just don't care or weren't there for that and have not expressed the will to do anything about that point. Okay, thanks, daryl we're going to move on since a lot of you have a point of information, because no, I need to speak because you allowed all the board members to speak and I cannot be of a shadow because now you have to go to a public session. No we're not! Let's be fair question. We're not publishing the public session said that the points that are related to noise we're going to take those q and a's and comments during after the sorry after the noise pollution presentation, because it's all related to noise right and my comment is related to noise. Okay, so I just want to say that the noise has been a problem. I've been attending and going to different places in the heights and inwood, and there are many people that come from outside the community to make noise in front of restaurants oftentimes. They raise the music, the volume really loud, just to about people that are having either dinner or, if not just eating outside, and you can even hear yourself at all. So it's a big problem for the community, but I just hope that we do not blame the local restaurants. Most of them are complying. Then compliance and a lot of people come from outside to make this noise, and it's really annoying- and I agree with most of the comments have been said- thank you so much catherine, my okay, kathryn, okay, so in respecting also our speakers time. I know liz you're waving. Is this a point of information, or does it have to do with noise? It's it's! I it's a procedural thing, so I have a short video which should be played during the public session, since it relates to noise, correct yeah we just yeah we'd like to yeah. Thank you. Let's just have a presentation just to be fair to our presenter, yeah and they're patiently waiting for her turn great okay. So, as folks who have seen the agenda tonight, we have a presentation from dr wendy chung from columbia, university, medical center related to the covid recovery corps and they'll be talking about a new research initiative related to covid, and so we're really excited to have you present and update us on what's happening hospital good. Thank you so much for having me. I want to check and see if you can see my screen. Is that sharing? Yes? Okay, very good, so I am a professor at columbia university and I think everyone appreciates just how much our community's been impacted by covet 19.. This was a recent publication that came out of the patients at columbia, university and I'll, be using this to explain what the next thing is, we're looking at, which is how individuals are recovering, hopefully getting better after they've been affected. However, as we've seen this, our community that we served at columbia is representative of our northern manhattan community. As we looked at individuals to understand who was sick in the hospital and who died of covid19. These are things that I think you probably appreciate, but we have individuals who are more at risk. Individuals who are older, we're at six times higher risk of having severe outcomes. Individuals with heart disease, diabetes, lung dis, excuse me, lung disease as well as smokers. We don't understand all of the factors that are related to this, but we do understand. These are individuals that are at higher risk relevant to our community in northern manhattan. This is not an equal opportunity condition. This virus affects certain members of the community, more so than others in ways that we don't entirely understand, there's a higher burden in terms of both hospitalization and disease severity and, ultimately, fatality or death in our black community, as well as our latina community, and that's something that concerns all of us very greatly. As we've been getting over the other side, I hope after march and april, and what was truly very trying. We are continuing to follow individuals, who've been sick at columbia, as well as other places around the city and around the country, and we realize it's not resolving for everyone as quickly as we would like. So as I've been seeing patients I've seen. Patients that continue to have issues in terms of shortness of breath continue to be very tired. Very fatigued and I've also been hearing many complaints about everything, from fuzzy thinking or difficulty, concentrating to difficulty, sleeping and just not feeling like themselves and as we're doing this we're trying to learn from each other. What are things that seem to be helping recovery? What seems to be hindering recovery and trying to learn from each other so that we can all do this faster and be able to get better faster? I've been working with a group, that's called themselves survivor core and they've called themselves long-haulers those individuals who have symptoms that don't seem to be resolving and it's been incredible to be able to hear from them one-on-one their stories. Their issues and they've been helping us to design a study to look at individuals who have previously been infected and understand, as I said, differences both how long it takes for people to recover and then the symptoms that seem to recover faster and those that aren't recovering so quickly and long term. We hope that we can use this, as I said, to either think about medications or strategies that might help people get better faster. So we started a large study. That's called the covid recovery core to be able to get at these issues, as I said to understand the issues around recovery and understand. If we can, what some of the contributors might be, and some of them might be pre-existing health conditions. So people who had diabetes heart disease, lung disease, before maybe their body, wasn't quite as strong and the virus did. You know, push them over the edge and cause some permanent damage. But in addition to that, it may be issues in terms of access to care being able to get to doctors being able to get to medicines continuing to need to work not having access to healthy food, all sorts of stressors that we might have and understanding these contributors is important to us. One of the challenges that we had back in march and april is that we didn't know many people who were actually sick with covet 19.. If you can remember back in it seems like years ago, but really just a couple months ago, we had so little testing available that we've had many people who thought they were sick, but we don't really know for sure if it was covid19 or not so we're launching this study as two-fold. The main goal is, as I said, to understand how people are recovering and whether or not this is any different. I will say. I think we as new yorkers are proud that, unfortunately, since we're seeing some of this come up in other parts of the country, we may be able to lead the country we may be able to come up with understanding, because we were first that we may be able to help family members. Friends, others around the country. Part of this, though, is to understand back in march and april, who really had coveted 19 and so as I'll be explaining one thing we're doing. Is we've developed an antibody test which allows us to look back because of the body having mounted an immune response and fighting the virus to be able to see evidence of previous infection and we're guessing that in the community of northern manhattan? It may be something like 20 to 25 percent of individuals who have been previously infected to do that. We need to check in the blood for antibodies and see who was tested and then once we know who was tested that allows us to then go forward to know who's getting better and to be able to make sure that we know that it was covet. 19 related realizing that this is something that we wanted to offer free to the community, so free testing for everything and wanting to be able to make it as convenient as possible. We've wanted to allow people to do testing from home, and so what I mean by that is you don't have to miss work. You don't have to even come to the hospital, the doctor's office. We wanted this to be something that people free from home convenient easy and getting their individual results back. Hopefully, within a matter of a day or two, once we received their samples and again, we would pay for the shipping we would pay for the testing. We would pay for all of this and share information back with each individual participant, as well as what we're learning as a community, sharing that back through forums like this, but also through newsletters and other email alerts, and updates to do this, we're thinking about doing it on a scale, and we have the support already to do this for 11 000 members of our community. If this is something that looks like it's useful, we have permission to be able to go on from there as well, but we're starting with this group in to do this, though one thing we have to do is to develop a test that we can do testing from home. So phase one- and this, which is a critically important test, is to think take what we think will be about a thousand people where we can take samples, blood samples, but also a sample that would be easy to collect from home, something like a saliva bowl or something where you would prick your finger and put a spot of blood on a blood filter card. But something again you could do from home without having to go, get blood drawn. So in phase one we're going to be having individuals where we compare what happens when we measure from a blood drawn in the regular way from a finger stick or from a saliva sample. So we get the same results in all three ways, and once we know that we do whether that takes a hundred or two hundred or a thousand. I don't know, but once we know that test with home testing works, then we can get kits out to on the community and, like I said, be able to do this on a much larger scale. So to do this, I'm here tonight and thank you for the opportunity to tell you about this website covid recovery core, which is up on the upper left here. This is the website, that's live and you can log in here or and join us to be able to join the study again. Everything about this is free and for the first individuals who need to get the blood drawn for the phase one. We also have a 50 gift card. So in terms of being able to do this, appreciating that it takes people's time and energy to participate, we want to be respectful of that, and so we do have a show of our gratitude for that. As we're doing this, as I said, the eligibility criteria are pretty straightforward, it's adults, so it's individuals, 18 or older, who can sign, who can be able to give permission for themselves and that think they've had coveted 19 because again we're looking for people who are positive, who actually were infected in the past, and then we can check and see how they're recovering, as I said, because many people may have even mild symptoms. We appreciate that everyone doesn't know they had covet 19 and that's why the testing will be helpful, but you do not have to have testing to be part of the study. So as an example, if you had testing in the past, you had that nasal swab or you had another plant sample, and you know for sure you are already positive. You don't need to get tested again and we're not going to make you do that. But you can simply sign up to answer some questions about how your symptoms are resolving and some ideas about what might have been helpful in terms of helping resolve those symptoms. So this can be done online from a computer from your phone we've made it mobile friendly. We've done really robust user testing to make sure it's really easy. The flow is simple. The questions are understandable and this takes about 30 minutes to be able to participate as we're doing this. As I said, all of this is through a new york state approved test, so you might have heard in the news about some fly-by-night testing companies where their results are not reliable. These are very reliable tests done at columbia, university with worlds experts who have developed this test, as well as being able to get results back quickly to the community. So this won't be something you've heard about in the news where it takes a week or two to get results back. We will be getting these back very quickly as soon as we get the samples into the laboratory. All of this is made easy. So for those of people who do give a blood sample, we have a process. You can be able to select your time and location online, so we make it really, I hope, quite convenient for you to do then, as we do this, like, I said we're going to be able to use hopefully specimen types that are really easy either, like I said, a blood spot, or else one of these saliva samples. So as we do this, the whole point, though, is to learn along the way, and as we do this we're going to be having videos that are on the website community board meetings, newsletters that are going to go out, but as soon as we know, you'll know as well. So with this, these are the just examples of the test report. That's coming out. It's the same test report that I myself have gotten. So I've tried out the system to make sure it works and the results are robust, they're, the right results and, as I said, we're getting these results out quickly to people so I'll wrap up here, but just to say and give credit to survivor corps which has been one of the community groups. That's been very instrumental in this if they're all extend an open offer, if there are any members of the community who think they might have useful feedback, we'd love to have your feedback and even potentially, to help us on our advisory board. So I'll stop there and I'll be glad to take questions. Thank you so much wendy. There are two questions in the q. A that you can see. I can read them out for you. One is a linum linda's asked if you could repeat the contributing factors, support outcomes of covid sure, so the contributing factors are older age. I didn't mention it, but male. So men have a tougher time of this. Also heart disease, lung disease and diabetes. Those are those are the main factors that we're seeing that are contributing and then we're also seeing in terms of communities. The latina community and the black community specifically have had a born disproportionately a lot of the burden for this disease and mj. T roycey also asked in addition, if you're still accepting survival survivors and how someone can get in touch yep, so the maybe we can put this in the minutes, but it's covid c, o v id recovery, core c, o r, p s dot org that website you can go right there, the upper right hand button join us is how you get into the study awesome. Can you please send the powerpoint to the community board office sure I can pull the notes off of that, because there was a lot of information. I want to make sure the notes are accurate, sure, absolutely and feel free to share these slides. There's nothing just getting ready to say that do we have anyone else, that's raising their hand. Besides angel last quest, we have curtis stephen sally, just whoever hasn't said anything put those first and then those who have already spoken then puts us on the second tier, well, steve all right. Well, first of all, I think it's important that, if we're having a discussion about covert 19, that we recognize the fact that 914 people in our community have died. As of today from this disease, we should not, we should not ignore the impact that this disease has already had on the community. I missed the doctor chung, I missed the beginning of the presentation. Is it? Is it your intent that the thousand volunteers in phase one and the ten thousand phase two would all come from washington heights and inwood, because the health department statistics show at the moment that we have had 5146 positive cases in washington heights and inwards? So I guess there's a presumption on your part that a lot of people have yet to be tested who in fact have had the covert 19 symptoms right. So we are doing the study within a 25 mile radius of columbia, so that actually includes more than washington heights and inwood. However, the community that obviously is right next to us at columbia, I wanted to make sure had first dibs, so to speak, that they knew about it and were aware of the opportunity remembering also, though, that people don't have to take the blood test or the test in general to be part of this. If you know you know, there's lots of opportunities for testing. If you know you are positive from any of those mechanisms, we want to put that information together on as many as people as quickly as possible, because we obviously want people to recover and, as I said before, I think colombia unfortunately having had the first wave first is going to have a lot that we can teach the rest of the world about. Okay, I'm the I should mention, I'm the chair of the health and environment committee and I'm sure that my committee and personally, I would like to be able to work with you on this project. That'd be great. I will also send with the powerpoint my email. So if anyone needs to get in touch with me, you can. I think angela was next all right. Well, first of all, thank you, dr trump, for that thorough presentation. That's really helpful and I'm glad that colombia is pursuing this. My question is: how are you all doing, you're conducting your outreach in the non-speaking parts of the community, I'm assuming the website's, also in another language other than english? But what partnerships are you utilizing or leveraging to ensure that you are getting that diversity of people that you're looking for and understanding that the black american and the hispanic american community have been disproportionately impacted by kobe yeah? Definitely so the english version has launched now the spanish version is in the process of being approved by the irb, so they are looking at the translation to make sure that everything is exactly as it should be. I'm hoping we'll be able to launch that within the next two weeks in spanish, but everything has been translated and I said with the irb: we've had many community partners, alianza, dominicana, rafael antigua, has been one of our partners in terms of thinking of, I would say, sort of the north of columbia and then south of columbia, harlem hospital, as well as many of our faith-based organizations, our community health care worker, core we've tried to reach out to many individuals, but I'm sure we're not finished, and I'm sure this is going to still for kovit is going to be with us for a while. So if you have suggestions individual contacts organizations, we would love to be able to reach out even more than we have already. Thank you, fe and wayne. How about that? Thank you, yeah. We can hear you okay. Thank you so good evening, everyone, yes, my question is actually and thank you know for this wonderful presentation. I think this is a very interesting update for us. I wanted to ask you mentioned that- and I have heard this before as well- that minority like african-americans spanish. These are the community that has been more affected, and this is something that I constantly it's not the first time that I hear it only for you, but for other folks as well- and I'm wondering is at this point, you may have any idea what are the contributing factors for which this is the community. That seems to be more affected, great question, so I think there are two factors. One was just in terms of getting infected in the first place, and then I think the second is once you're infected. How does your body do in terms of fighting the infection in terms of getting infected in the first place? I think new york city as a whole. It was when you think about it was how many contacts you had before we knew to wear masks before we had idea about how quickly it was transmitted, so people who had jobs, for instance, where they were out and about and in the public and interacting with many people who were taking public transportation, people who were living in buildings, with many people or in households with many people tended to transmit and to get the virus very quickly. So I think that was the first part of things. The second part of things, though, was that who got infected those individuals who already had issues like diabetes or who had heart disease, even people who didn't know they had those conditions or even people who may not have been overtly diabetic but may have had some pre-diabetes. Even I think those people are the ones that we're seeing that are bearing disproportionately the burden in terms of getting either very sick or, in some cases, even dying, I think in terms of access to care and who had access to medical care to know about their conditions to get treatment for their conditions. I think that's where I'm seeing a lot of the unfortunate disparities in care disparities that I don't think have to do with the color of your skin per se. In other words, I don't think it's a sort of innate thing, but it's something in terms of what we've had in terms of access to medical care and being able to get the same types of care. So I think that's part of what we want to tease apart and understand and be able to start remedying and addressing as we go forward. I just would like to just say finally that my question- and I hope, doesn't probably resemble that you know my question has to do with color or anything. But yes, I'm looking forward to is there is any particular you know kind of behavior that this community are achieving things that they are not doing, and this is exactly what I wanted just to find out, because I heard that, but I've been wondering until now that you kindly you know, have responded. I thank you for that. We have wayne benjamin next yeah. There is also I thank you from the q. A right after wayne speaks yeah. Thank you and good evening, dr chung. I wanted to follow up on the question on community outreach, the population that is most adversely impacted by kovid. If you look at upper manhattan- and I mean community boards, 9, 10, 11 and 12.- I mean a large percentage of the population. Is you know there? So I'm is it safe to assume that you have or will also make presentations through community boards 9 11., so I I'm hoping I'll be able to get the word out to 9, 10 and 11.. I don't have them lined up. I will admit that this is so something we're still working on and ross looks like. Maybe he wants to say something thanks. Dr sure wayne will certainly work with our the your counterparts at the other boards, as well as our counterparts at the morningside who may have some closer relationship, especially with nine, but a study like this. We certainly want to get the word out and help get folks involved and, frankly, in any way we can because we, this is an opportunity and we need folks to get involved in it. Right, I mean if your catchment area is within 25 miles of the medical center, certainly that captures all of community boards 9 10, 11 and 12, and I would think you want to take you know proactive measures to make sure those boards know about it and get the word out to their residents. That's a great suggestion! Thank you absolutely and even beyond that as well. So, if any, if there's a there's a list server, if there's a citywide community board list server or anything like that, that could be helpful to us. I don't want to commit wendy to 51 sep or whatever number it is separate. Presentations we'll certainly concentrate on northern manhattan, but anything you could help us get the word out beyond what we might normally think of as our normal hat and how we're going to concentrate on northern manhattan. But we want to get the word out. As wendy said this 25 mile radius, well, certainly gail brewer's office can be of you know: assistance to you and pulling together the manhattan community boards. I just got a text just for the sake of information from sandra harris who's. On the I said, not a panel, but it's an attendee on her phone that they have already reached out and that they're still continuing the efforts to outreach to the entire community as much as they can very good. Thank you so just so, for so we have sally and danielle to wrap up our committee board members speak and then wendy. There's two questions on the chat that we can address regarding recruitment as well, so you can go ahead. Sam thanks for your presentation, I'm glad focusing on the specific situation of our residents two factors. I know that dr alexander melamed at the medical center and the medical school has done research looking at why black and brown communities are disproportionately affected and has tied that directly to their living situation. How many generations might be living in a household and also the controller, has done a report on the number of essential workers by community board district and I think across the city, we're number four in terms of having the num the highest number of essential workers. I wonder to what extent you are collecting information on living situation, occupation and those other things that might contribute to a population being at risk valley. Those are great observations and so, in fact we have questions that are related to pre-existing medical conditions, exactly, as you said, type of occupation, housing situation. We ask about how many people that are living under the same roof and those are exactly the risk factors that we were worried about. So incredibly insightful, perfect answer too, and just very quickly someone asked about blood type, a being associated, and that does appear to be correct. I don't know why yet, but blood type a does seem to be associated with higher risk. Danielle hi. Can you hear me? Yes, thank you so much for your presentation so related to risk factors and social determinants of health. You I don't know if you mentioned this, but you mentioned in the presentation that one of the factors that might contribute to folks being more predisposed to getting the to getting covet is not having an insurance or access to medical care. So I was wondering if you came up if you come across any of those folks during your study, if you're planning to link them to care at all. Yes, that's a great point, so one of the things that I think is good about this is that at least for the first thousand people we'll actually get the chance to meet them so we'll be personally. I myself will personally be part of this and as we're doing this we'll be able to understand what the issues are in terms of, if they're continuing to have symptoms groups that we have providers, that we have comprehensive programs that we have that are offering support for individuals recovering from kovid, so that absolutely is part of being able to connect individuals in the community to individuals in our health care center. So that's a great question and if you have even more specific suggestions, we'd love to hear them. Well, thank you for that. I think yeah. I was just really curious about the extent to which you'll you're planning on trying to assist those folks with accessing care and ensuring that they have you know a pcp. For example, somebody that's going to follow them long term and not just you know during the study yeah, so I'm very sensitive to that fact, and as we do this, like, I said we do have many programs. I think one of the things that colombia has been working on very diligently in the hospital is about healthcare, equity access and justice, and so I think we've got lots of new resources available that are going to be very useful to the community in that way, and then I guess just one more quick thing. I know you mentioned the the increased prevalence among black and brown folks, and you mentioned the odds ratios, but I was wondering if you stratified it all by zip code. I mean I know that data like on a city level, but I think it'd be really helpful for us as a community board, to see where we have these hot points and to be able to potentially do education around that yep. So this is something and if there's a representative or two from the community board, who would like to help us with the data analysis. That would be great. We are planning on actually breaking down. You can break down even more than zip code, but by census, track and by census tract. There are all sorts of databases that link to different factors with social determinants of health that you can start to tease apart some of these various factors, and so we're looking forward to being able to do that and get into like, I said, even more granular data and if members of the board can help us in terms of analyzing the data learning from that data and then disseminating that information back to the community. That's what this is all about, so I'd love to have volunteers. That would like to be able to be part of that analysis. Team. I'm seeing sally's already here so sally. I've got your name down kelly's, going to be all over that great and also the school of public health might also be able to assist you because absolutely we have their internships and great suggestions. So we've already got a whole core of people that have been part of that in terms of helping us think about how to design this. But great suggestion. Thank you so much. I appreciate it all right. Catherine, do you have anyone else? No, we don't before we go to pull up their hands up right now. I just there was something in the chat where somebody had mentioned reaching out to a tenant groups and that's going to be, I think, an extra a good resource. So you can contact the community board office to get contact information for, and there are a number of tenant advocacy organizations. That's great! I got those names down. Thank you for the suggestion. Well, don't! Thank me anything. I think it came from lena yeah. Thank you. So we're going to open up to the public captain one second. Ah, where did my zoom go? Sorry, I lost the screen for a second, oh, we actually don't in terms of the q, a chat you mean regarding the presentation yeah, so we have just one more from d'angelo around behavior in terms of you know like if you're outside, do you consistently wear a mask? Do you wear fabric or medical grade mask and if it's relevant to the study at all, so another great question, we got to the level of specificity of wearing a mask social distancing hand washing. We didn't get down to the specificity of what type of mask. So that is a good suggestion and that about wraps up the questions. One more oh, go ahead: hello, steve yeah! I just want to mention, following up on the point that wayne raised earlier about reaching out to our adjacent community boards we're going to be co-sponsoring an event with columbia. Next wednesday august, the 5th with the borough president's office and the other upper manhattan boards to talk about the columbia university's plans to reopen and will include a discussion about covert, 19 and quote helping communities follow. The latest public health guidelines seems to me ross sandra. This would be an opportunity, maybe to also have dr chung, make our presentation yeah. We were steve. Thank you. You know this is all coming together and then, frankly, in the last couple of hours and we've been talking with our morning dad about exactly what the program will be, we have just following up on steve said we have three speakers lined up dr donald lynn, who is now the covid director for the entire university. You may know where she's the chief operating officer of the medical center, dr melody burnitz, who is head of student health for the entire university and dr rafa alsada, who is a professor at the school of public health and has been on the university's covet task force. You know I don't want to put wendy on the spot, because I don't know if you're just hearing about this, but we'll take that suggestion back up and see. If we can, we can work it in steve. I'm glad to hear, because I didn't know that was finalized with community board 12., I'm glad that it is, and that's great to know. Thank you. Well, you can thank ellie, okay. Well, thank you! Ellie catherine, no, okay, we're gonna, give mark levine a few words since he's here with us. Mark thank you so much, mr chair, and thanks to cb12, who, my goodness, I think, you've been probably the most out front of any community board and focusing on the pandemic for months on end and, unfortunately, that work is going to have to continue we're not out of this. Yet dr chung great presentation great to see you again. This is a really important study and we need washington heights inwood, marble hill involved in a major way and really appreciate you reaching out or spending time with the board. I guess I'll just say to everybody. I just want to emphasize the extent to which this crisis is not yet entirely in the rearview mirror for new york and while, thankfully, we're not experiencing the kind of surge that other parts of the country are we're, still we're still getting a good 300 cases or more every single day, confirmed in the five boroughs. More and more that's trending to a younger population, particularly new yorkers, in their 20s and to some extent in their 30s. That's a pattern we saw in other parts of the south that later unfortunately led to greater rates of infection. Among older adults, and just about every model, we're looking at does show an increase in cases starting in the fall for new york. We've got to be ready for that. We've got to use this time to build. For that. We've got to build our contact racing. We got to fix our testing, which is taking far too long in most cases and is again leaving communities of color behind. So let's take this time not to rest on our laurels, but to do the hard work to get ready for the fall to address inequity and to build our public health infrastructure. I know cv12 has been focused on that. I know steve as healthcare is very focused on that, but I just wanted to thank everyone for holding this meeting and for your work on this topic and I'm obviously here as a partner for you throughout as long as this pandemic lasts. Thank you so much, mr chair. Thank you mark, catherine, okay. If that's it on that part, we will be able to move forward actually and that's a question for steve steve. You mentioned you had somebody who had a quick five-minute presentation. Are they on the call it's jen donahoe? Is she on the call? Yes, I saw her earlier. Oh I'm not a co-host! So if jonathan or ebenezer, if you're on here still, if you can upgrade jen don, oh there we go yeah. D-O-N-O-H-O-O okay got her. So even though we're hosting the idea and again thank you so much dr wendy chung for the presentation. You're gonna have a lot of feedback from us and we're more than once, there's any additional literature for the community, we'll be happy to put that out, along with the website, as I shared in the q a so next up on. It's not necessarily on the agenda but related to obviously public session tonight and a lot of what started our meeting. Are noise complaints so steve I'll? Let you introduce jen, who will be speaking for about five minutes before we usher in the brief public session. Where is jen from jen is from the facebook group why he for respectful or decimal levels- and she has done some interesting work on her own to analyze, 311 complaints generated from our community during a specific period in july. I believe, but if we could let her go on now, she can. She can explain exactly what the work is, that she didn't what she found from analyzing. The complaints, thank you and mark is mark still on the call, because it feels relevant for him to be here. Yes, I am hi lis, fantastic thanks. So much hi bear. Thank you so much steve and thank you to the community board for allowing me to speak with you today. So, as steve mentioned, I am a part of the facebook group that was started by claudia back in may to to try to figure out some solutions. You know for the noise issues that we've been having our neighborhood and, as you guys have all stated- and we all know it's like a broken record like this- is nothing new. It's not just the quarantine, but it definitely has had an uptick. So we've been having some weekly meetings just to kind of discuss like what can we be doing to help? You know help out the community and just you know, help provide solutions. So what I did this past week is. I asked members of the facebook group to participate in a short data study, so I had I created a google form. I had people track from july 17th through the 25th. They sent me their 311 numbers. They sent me their address intersection. The timing like just copying and pasting. Basically, what's on the 311 that they've got on their app or through email, and what I did then, is I cross-checked that data with 3-1-1, so I literally inputted everyone's 3-1-1 number into the 3-1-1 just to double check and make sure that everything matched with timings and locations. What not and then I cross-checked it with boardstat, which is what I believe you guys use to help you know, allocate funds and know where the issues are, and what I found was that 38 of this sample that I did for one week we're not tracking into board stat, which I think is quite significant, because if you guys are using that you know as part of your resource, then that's a huge amount, that's not showing up in there and then what I did from there is also. I tracked you know what type of responses. What was the response from the from the police department from 3-1-1, and what I found is that 60 of all of the of the data that I collected are all coming back unfounded by the police department, meaning you know they didn't see any they weren't experiencing anything when they stopped by, but at the same time you know, as you guys know, like people are sending me videos at the same time. Look it was closed. I have a video of the same time that it was closed. It's still happening, and I know that you know there's pressure to close 311 cases out. A lot of us have found that the cases have been closing in less than 10 minutes. I did share all of this research with steve. I do have pdfs that I can share with you guys you can see which ones were closed within 10 minutes within 20 minutes. Clearly, nothing was changed, but that's for another day, sorry a little loud over here and then. What I also thought would be interesting is just to go back and track and see what did it look like this same week for the last 10 years, I've lived at dikeman and semen for the past seven years. The first night that I moved in. I was like, oh my gosh. What have I done and it wasn't necessarily from the restaurants but as someone else mentioned on the board, it's the people that are coming in and making like a huge ruckus like on the street. So I was like. Let me just track and see you know what's been happening, the last 10 years, so I use boardstat again and what I found was that even just checking tracking back for this one week from july 17th to the 25th from 2017 to 2018 the case, the amount of complaints increased by 15.41 from 2018 to 2019. There was a 63.35 percent increase again just tracking this one week of complaints this year and I'm sure no one's surprised. It was a hundred and eighty point, six percent increase. That is massive. We are under assault over here. As you guys know, it feels like a war zone, as many of us are saying and we're trying to figure out like what can we do to help? I love the idea of a public hearing. I think that's a great first step for us to really get all of this out there. I know you guys were tracking like different hot spots. I mean I did use. I did use board stat to start to check some of the hot spots, at least for this past week, but obviously, since 38 percent of them aren't being tracked in there, it's not going to really completely cover all the areas that we're having issues. I was honestly surprised that dikeman and siemen wasn't higher on the list. It was actually lower on the list with complaints which seems insane to me because it's a mad house over here but anyway. So I that's the data I collected, and I know that we've been we've been coming up with some other solutions we actually accomplished from the community sat in with senator jackson. Last week he had a center at your corner and he seemed very open to the idea of having a town hall having these discussions creating a coalition to try to deal with some of these issues. He emphasized that it can't just be. You know us coming to you guys to the senators with complaints, but coming with ideas of solutions, we're doing that we're having weekly meetings where like we're here, we're ready to like pitch in and help out. So, thank you again for letting me speak today and I'm excited about diving in more with the public hearing. What would you like to say list before you jump in? I just want to get a couple of clarifications on some of those numbers or if you get are you reading from a sheet? Can you just send it to me so that I don't have to bore people yeah? I can send it to you I'll, shut up. Now you get cat all right, so we're gonna head on in steve. I just gotta raise your hand, you have a question for jenner: can we dive into the we'll just? I just want to make sure that I just want to clarify something to make sure people understand that what jen did was look at the complaints, not just from seaman indictment, but from all of the washington heights in inwood that her analysis covered all of our district. I had people from the community, it was you know, people I had they had the google form I posted every day, like all right we're day. One of the study we're day two and I had complaints coming in you know all times of the day from people all over. It wasn't just at my intersection. It was literally all over. Did you have a video that you compiled that you wanted me to share? Yes, we did put together a video. These were videos that again the community sent me we have probably about a hundred. We obviously did not include them all on this short clip, but that would be great liz if you wouldn't mind playing it. These are some videos from the people in our community. I would like to I like to dive into the public session. First. We can share that as we can only one minute, it's literally a one minute, video right. It's a good introduction. I would have loved to hear about it at first. That's why I asked about it earlier in the meeting. Are you seeing that yes make your screen full screen? I mean make it full screen. It is full screen, so, my god, okay, thanks liz, okay, so we're gonna go into. Thank you liz for that visual. I want to remind folks, too, that we are having a full public hearing to actually dig in deeper and have, I think, more robust conversation, ideas. Okay, I think it is extremely uncalled for that happened in the community yeah, but we're gonna have we're. Gonna have a hearing next week in which, given that everything is on the agenda and given that is already presented to the board prior to is shown again so moving forward. So on the list. First, we have tiffany ernst. You can unmute yourself tiffany! Thank you. I also had some concerns about the noise and I was talking to dr arlene bronzeft today, for those of you who don't know she's an environmental psychologist who is on the board of grow, nyc she's been she's been appointed to that position under five different mares and her work in anti-noise advocacy actually started in inwood at p.s 98 in the 70s. One of the questions that she asked me was about crime in the neighborhood and, if that's been on the rise lately- and I didn't have the stats in front of me- but it does seem to be- and for my personal experience for the locations that are recurring noise issues on my block, I have called 9-1-1 three times in the past two months. One was for a fight that devolved into a stabbing. Another was a fight where somebody got knocked to the ground and wasn't getting up and another was a man and a woman fighting over a gun, and she confirmed that there is a link between noise and crime, and she said that when you give license to violate the noise ordinances, you give license to break all laws and she was concerned about what is going on in the neighborhood, and she has agreed to work with us and with respect the group for respectful decibel levels to get these noise issues resolved up here. What is the name of that expert? Please, her name is dr arlene bronzeft. Sure it's br. Thank you sure. Thank you. Tiffany. Next up we have lee I'd like I'd like to say something. Is it a question for tiffany? Well, it's a statement. First of all, liz arlene is spelled a-r-l-I-n-e. I also spoke to dr bransf and I just want people to know that she has agreed to speak at our hearing next week. Can I have a question? Are we going to have a consistency of who gets called that? Oh he's a board member people are jumping in that, don't even raise hands. Do we have a process here, distracted, we're in the public right, but people are jumping in people are jumping in it's unfair and it's uncool. Thank you. I know others feel this way. Are you following the rules and we're silenced yeah we're not. Is there anything that he'd like to say because I'll wait, my turn I just I just we should have a process. Okay and we should all be treated yeah. Maybe she didn't see your head, so it's happened throughout the meeting. It has happened. Okay, so I haven't seen you myself. So is there anything that you would like to say now? Gerard, I don't want to jump ahead. Is it okay? Unless there was someone before you, we have we're in the public session, so customarily board members don't speak during public session. Unless then I've been out, I will be part of the problem clarify why board members aren't being called on. So we have four other people on the list and then we can go and then we can follow the agenda and, of course, in old business new business. That's where we customarily okay. Thank you very much all this that no other point to keep jumping in okay, george, I think the public session customarily what happens is if the board member has a question or is speaking to something that the speaker is stating that the board members can speak during that time. If anyone else wants to chime in who's a veteran and has an understanding of that, I would appreciate that the question is so leanne is next hi. Can you guys hear me? Yes, okay, perfect! Thank you. So my main concern was about the noise, but I don't want to sound like a broken record, so I guess my main question. Then will be how you guys, as the board members like what are your actions in helping us, because there's only so much that we can do 3-1-1 complaints are not working. 9-1-1 calls are not working when I call the precinct, nobody ever picks up and I've even spoken to the nco about this and she's like I don't know why they're not picking up, which is concerning to say the least like how is a precinct, not picking up calls so we're just all at our wits end right now, like I literally had to escape the city in order to be have sleep, that's how bad it is because it's every single night starting at 7 p.m. The latest has been going on until 8 00 a.m, and I work, and so this is like so there's a lot of people. So what are you guys, as community board members doing to help us out, because there's only so much that we can do and we're all extremely frustrated, and I just want to know what actions are being taken specifically also for spanish speakers. That may not even be you know, they may not even know that these board meetings exist, so they may not be able to have an outlet for their frustration. So what are we doing to help the community out? What are the actions taken and how are you guys following up? That's my question: can you state your name please? My name is thank you. Thank you. Hi leanna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take a mat and answer for giving try and give you the best possible answer on three optics, one as a business owner. I have spent a significant amount of money, just boarding up the glas, the entrance classes of my businesses so that they wouldn't get vandalized two. My car has been vandalized twice in the past two months, so I feel you I feel for you. I feel as defenseless as you do. What we're trying to do as board members is to try and pass that information along to the authorities that we think are the ones that are the ones responsible for taking proper action. Has that happened? Obviously, no we are in the midst of some sort of. It seems like, and I'm just guesstimated of a power struggle between different agencies who have not taken actions what they need to take action on and that's what we are in the midst of we're. Just like you we're not you know special super with human beings with super powers that can just with the flick of a finger just make change. As I said, you know, I'm just suffering, probably as much as anyone else in this panel, so we're just looking for answers and trying to call for action and on the part that we're doing the spanish speaking outreach myself. I've appeared in different spanish outlets. New york, one some dominican based tv channels trying to spread the message and get people to understand the importance of being active and participate and participate in these discussions and the process of these discussions. So we are taking baby steps towards that effort, but we are trying our best we're all trying. Catherine, I'm sorry, I'm just seeing an extra comment. There's a few hands. I didn't wanna. If I could, because I haven't spoken as a member to add to lyanna's point- is community boards? Don't play an enforcement role right, so we can't force nypd city hall, any city agency in general. What to do? We can only make recommendations as an institution. What I do value about this space, though, is that it's a great bridge in being able to understand like who is in decision making powers within different city agencies, but also hearing who else and who else you're. Seeing on the screen that you may not know that are actual neighbors of yours and I do want to kind of acknowledge as well. The biggest limitation of not being in person right now is that hearing is going to be in english right, and so we are leaving out a fundamental major part of our community, which is spanish-speaking elders, who are deeply impacted by all of the quality of life issues that we spoken about tonight, and so I think it does push us to go into the drawing board and thinking about how we can make it accessible, not just for spanish-speaking folks, but just in general, accessible for those and gen who have different issues and challenges in terms of the virtual english space. So I want to acknowledge that and say that that's a real thing that hasn't necessarily come up. Sorry. I would also extend that question to the elected officials and their staff that are also on the call. Can you repeat that I couldn't quite hear you? Oh I was just saying I would extend that question that she had to the elected officials and their staff, who are on the call if they have any, which question is the one from lyanna or which question isn't specific yeah the one from the one from the public section that just spoke was their name rivera before that tanya. Since I haven't seen any official raise your hand yet, do you have a question or comment for lyanna me yeah? Oh, no, I'm with daryl. I want to hear from the public officials, because I agree. I think that that's a role that has been left out in terms of holding them accountable. They have access to the mayor. They have access to the people who make these policies and they have the ability to advocate for change. If there are some rules, we have a noise ordinance in this city that is not being followed. We have other rules that are not being followed prior to rebel, being shut down. We as a group and were complaining and saying that this needs to be addressed. We were even working on a press petition, we have been trying our best, but it's only so much. We can do, and I agree with daryl that we need to start to ask the public, the elected officials why there have been. There has been silence, I personally emailed elected officials and their representatives, their representatives about this noise issue when we were in the middle of fireworks terrorism- and I only got one response and that was from senator jackson office- that's it. So what I'm saying is that I think that's a relevant question and I think part of the issue is that I don't think they've been held accountable. I don't think we've asked the pertinent questions to them. I don't think we've asked why we they have much more proximity to the people who make these decisions than we do as community board members. So I would like to know why this is being allowed to go on and, like I said this has been going on for years. I personally have reached out to elected officials over the years I've been here 14 years and I've reached out to elected officials over that 14 years. To address this issue, I have tried to address it on both of my committees from health and environment to the business development. So what I'm saying is that we you know I would like to know: where are they? What are they going to do to work with this community board to make sure that we address these issues and get a resolution? Finally, instead of just talk, okay, thank you funny. There are remembered, ladies sally hang on. A second gerard has not spoken and he's been waiting. Thank you, mr chair. Thank you, mr chair, so I just want to offer my own personal experience as a lifelong resident of inward. I'm going to give witness to some things that people are aware of and think, maybe only in the last 10 years. Some of the things I can empirically offer is that fireworks. This year were as bad as in as in the early 90s, and this is through my conversation with people that have been here for a short period of time, their experience, but also with others that have lived here. As long as I have. There is a generous belief in sense that the fireworks this year, whereas and it's been starting even these previous years, but this year was worse than any year any resident. Anybody that was has lived here for 30 40 years can never remember the noise and public dis disturbance are as bad as the early 90s when people were starting to become concerned about living in this wonderful community, which still remains to be a wonderful community. We, when I speak to many people that have been here for a long period of time, and some that have not been here feel generally are increasingly feeling less unsafe. We feel that there is more to be concerned about when we travel to trains in the morning or through our buses or from our trains and buses. Then there's a general sense that we are being abandoned by our leadership that nobody, that our leadership is not stepping up and being out there in voicing and standing up for our concerns and I'm going to ask our leadership as a lifelong resident and for people that have can't speak right now to please don't abandon us and step up here and take care of business and that's the leadership, and I thank all you. Okay. Thank you. We're gonna keep going. This is one of the few opportunities the public session has to speak. My comment is related to the speaker, who just spoke: the lyanna okay, your answer to her kathy was, unfortunately, we can't reach the spanish-speaking audience. We have done that at hearings in the past and also columbia university has managed to hold spanish and english zoom meetings. I wonder why we can't, I think, that's a huge oversight on the community board's part, and I think that we need to do our damnedest to make sure that all our communities heard. It's unacceptable to say we're doing this only in english, and I'm saying it just because it hasn't been publicly said, and it hasn't been fully it's still in discussion and being planned. That's why it needs to because it's a refusal on our part. Okay, it needs to be. We need to address it. It's not enough to say that we can't okay, bernard grohmann has had his hand up for a while. There are a few questions in the q. A can you hear me. Okay, you can definitely hear me. Is that bernard? Yes, okay, so I guess. First of all, I called up mark levine's office to complain about the noise I've been having. I moved here last year, so I'm a relative newcomer, but last year every once in a while. There was some noise, but it was okay. This year it's unimaginable I had on july 4th. I had two parties one on each side. I had it in stereo over here one louder than the other. I mean literally the volume of like yankee stadium with the rolling stones shaking my shaking stuff in my apartment, fireworks within a foot of the building, okay and until about three o'clock in the morning and and since then every saturday night till three o'clock in the morning every saturday night- and there is not a restaurant over here or anything it's in front of a of a beauty. Parlor, that's! What's going on, I've called 3-1-1. I've done everything. It's same results as everybody else. I have been speaking to the nco in the area. He actually has come around and done something a little bit, but not much and it's the same car. I have the license plate number of that car. It's the same speaker in that car all the time. It's real, simple, enforce the law, give the guy a ticket and confiscate the speaker. That's all you got to do it's not rocket science. It's not rocket science and do it. You don't have to do it to everybody. Just do it and people will stop doing this. It's as simple as that the ticket the ticket goes up to a thousand dollars and plus they lose their speaker. Okay, I mean you know it's really easy. Yet somehow not easy. Okay, I mean, and I got I was so frustrated. I started a twitter account and started posting. My videos of the party and I got on. I got this story on 10 wins yesterday and there's going to be as a result of that they're going to be asking de blasio a question about the noise up here and one of the press, all right eliezer. I can speak to that. Do you have anyone else so what they don't feel like they're being jumped over people still waiting to speak so andrea rojo is unless they spoken, then let barbara be the first one because she hasn't spoken. Yet no. These are community members. Okay, so yeah! Please go ahead! Sorry, barbara! I don't want to jump in one of them hi. Can you hear me? Yes, hi? Thank you, hello, everyone! So I live on 159 on broadway and really the noise violence is just unbearable. I mean I want to say this is not only about noise, it's basically about justice. The one thing that you know many people tell me is that noise. The noise issue is a kind of a cultural divide, and I want to say that that's just definitely not true. I am part of the latino community and we do not condone the extreme noise. In fact, we are the victims of it, and the latino community is, of course, a hard working community. We deserve to live in a healthy environment like anyone else like everyone else, blasting music at extreme decibels is not. Culture is noise violence and it fosters really a lot of anxiety and a lot of fear. I you know when people tell me about culture, I my answer is you know? Music is culture, yes of course, but it is culture where it contributes to the cultural life of the city and it when it's used to foster community building. So I think ending noise pollution is basically about justice because we all deserve to live in an environment that is healthy and just speaking of impact on a personal level, the loud music I mean my window shake my wall, shake I'm on the fifth floor and I still can't hear it the explosions, the music, the imagine just that constant assault of noise on a baby trying to sleep on a teenager trying to you know, do homework on a nurse. You know, after a double shift, trying to get some rest on someone would, with ptsd on an elder with anxiety on anyone really with health issues. On anyone in mourning I mean we're uncovered pandemic, we lost so many people in new york. People are mourning. I know on all of us that we're just really basically trying to survive in what is already an extremely stressful time. So what I think is that a small number of individuals and groups are victimizing most of us and are making this beautifully diverse community divided, and I really want to foster a sense of community so that we all fight for what is right and for condition living conditions that are healthy for all of us, and you know the last thing is that we need to address this noise issue as a public health issue and as environmental and environmental justice issues. So thank you. Thank you, andrea and next up we have claudia shire. Sorry, yes, hi good evening. Thank you so much for taking me to speak. I wanted to introduce myself. The group washington heights and inwood for respectful decibel levels is the one that I founded I'll, try to speak a little louder, eyes, audible! Thank you, so I founded it in on. I think about, may 20th, because I was working from home. I am a musician and of course all my concerts were canceled. All the teaching was cancelled, so I was trying to teach violin lessons on zoom at home and I couldn't hear my students because there was a car outside playing about 50 feet, away playing the music so loudly and so eventually I went outside I called 3-1-1. Nothing happened, complaint, close called 3-1-1 again, nothing happened, complaint closed and I want to say this is before george floyd's murder. This was just as the weather was starting to get hot, and so I it went on for eight hours and I didn't understand why, and so I thought I will reach out to other community members and see if we have similar experiences and try to find out what's going on, and I thought okay, this is probably just a small thing. I've lived in inwood since 2003. I love this community very much. I have been here in the summers I have been here on july, 4th I've. It's been fine, it's been loud sometimes, but it's been basically livable, but this year was something else, and so I reached out and without knowing what I was getting myself into. People joined and more people joined and more people join and today we're reaching 600 people all together who have joined the group. So that's a huge amount of people and you should see the videos that we have we have so I've tried to be very diligent about keeping the group somewhat organized. So we have probably 100 videos of all the different noises that we have here. We have, of course, fireworks. We have the motorcycles that don't have mufflers. We have the racing cars that don't have mufflers. We have the slingshot cars that zoom around all night last night for four hours. I could hear the tires screeching and hear all of us and we've. You know, we've also had discussion. Should we go down and talk to our neighbors that that can be helpful when you know your neighbors, it's very hard to talk to somebody who's racing, a car I'll just say that. So we have all these different types of noise and some of the noise is linked with each other. Sometimes you see the motorcycles and then you see the fireworks happen after I was stopped when I was trying to cross the street by somebody who wanted to sell me drugs. Probably thinking I was, I was a customer and I said no thanks, I'm just crossing the street, so all of these things come together and we have. We have a general sense of lawlessness here, a sense of public in safety, a sense of fear about all the lack of social distancing, a lack of being able to sleep at night, a lack of being able to work. I should mention that we have a spanish language section of our group now as well and lyanna who spoke earlier is actually leading that section. So we have many spanish speakers and somebody reached out to me today and she actually wanted to speak today, but she was worried that she might not have somebody to translate for her mother passed away her 83 year old mother, passed away after having an anxiety attack from the fireworks on july 4th, and so I just think that is, I can't imagine if my parents passed away survive covet but pass away from the fireworks, and she said you know if I go into the community and I walk through the street, and I see you know, I see I pass people and I think we're the ones who set off the fireworks. You know I just it's just so sad, and so I want to I'm I want to. I realize I'm talking a long time, but I want to thank you very much for holding the public hearing. I think this has really affected our entire community. I hope that we can do something to reach out more to the spanish-speaking community as well, and I really just want to thank you for putting us on the agenda for next week. Can you repeat the name of the facebook group just so that liz has it for the chat and also somebody in the q, a yes, we have two so there's the english one is washington heights and inwood for respectful decibel levels, and the spanish one is the translation of that washington heights and inwood. I think the shortening is wahai and inwood in both cases for and please pardon my pronunciation but respect. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry. We have two more folks, so we have joel, then barbara and then phillip, sorry, I'm just looking for joe wow promoted him was he promoted yeah? Yes, he needs to unmute joe. If you unmute your mic, we should be able to hear you. It comes up muted. There you go joelle, he mentioned earlier. He was having issues so I'm going to move on to the next person and if you can get that fixed, just raise your hand. So next up we have phillip who's actually from germany's office where you at right, hey good afternoon, everybody, I don't. I don't want to really speak out of turn here. I can wait later on to make any updates or share what's going on, but I just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that you're, representing republican advocate jamani williams, notes welcome finish so you can talk, but I I'm actually taking notes and I'm going to bring it down and I'm sure that lazar could tell you we've seen us we've you can. Some people are you've, seen a slow down and in what you're, seeing here, 9-1-1 3-1-1 and the police precincts is happening all over manhattan, but there's a particular violence. Uptown that's taking place, and so I just want to let you know that I'm gonna go back and I'm sure and make sure the public have again our office knows and be in touch with lsr and other board members. I know like curtis and domingo and anybody else to touch base on this really. Just really. I heard the woman saying that this is a form of violence, so make sure this is really understood. Thank you, hi yeah. Can you guys hear me now yeah, we're gonna, hear it joel all right. Sorry about that guys I was having. I was on the call, and I was also in the zoom I apologize, so my name is joel abreu. I have I've been living in this community, all my life literally I'm 29 since I was born- and I think I'm listening to a lot of the the public speak and a lot of what you guys have to say and what it is it's a microcosm of. What's going on a national level, the police, a lot of my family members are police, the police have their hands tied and the reason why the police have their hands tied is because of our politics. It's politically motivated, there's a movement going on. I don't know what you guys, call it defund, the police or whatever it is. That causes the police to have an action. So because- and when the lady spoke about this, it was it's about justice. So when somebody lets off a firecracker or is on a motorcycle or is racing, the people's, the people who are supposed to enforce the laws are not there because their hands are tied, so it becomes a problem where none of us can solve it right because it comes from a part of this system that is almost unreachable for us, because the media, our political leaders, are all backing this movement to defund the police. This black lives matter movement these this these movements. What happens is that they aren't, they aren't able to enforce the laws that keep our neighborhood safe. So de blasio democrats, all these progressive, I don't know what to call them right. Affiliations, fund this movement, which then in turn make the police not enforce these laws, which makes our neighborhoods unsafe. It's simple, you stop these movements, you put different political leaders in power with give which then gives power to the police to enforce these laws against firecrackers against motorcycles against all of this against all the noise complaints. If you stop giving people the police, this power, they aren't able to enforce the laws anyways! That's what I wanted to say. My second thing that I wanted to say is I've been living here for 30 years and it hasn't been as bad, but it's always been. That's part of our culture. Dominicans are loud in general right, so mu, you're, gonna, hear music, you're gonna hear a lot of motorcycles and unfortunately that's not gonna. Stop that's not something. That's gonna stop. Obviously you can control it a little bit right and some of the solutions that people are looking for are not going to happen. Aren't we as they aren't really realistic. So a lot of solution is to move out to go to a different neighborhood. Unfortunately, it's not going to be something that's going to be quiet because that's not within our culture. A lady mentioned that it's a cultural divide and it is most dominicans like to be downstairs and listen to their music and it's okay as long as it's respectful, but it's not going to stop and unless we put different political leaders in and stop political movements that have that tie the hands of police that aren't able to enforce these laws. So that that's what I got to say you, we have several hands from board members, so barbara will be the first one, because you know I think, if you've already spoken, we have a lot to speak about next week and we have so much more. Thank you, liz for second, taking that we have so much more that we can disclose because hey can. I can I please I can't literally, I know as soon as barbara is being late from a lot longer ago, and it was lowered, okay, you're. Next, I don't know who lowered it. I certainly didn't. No. This is the public section for the public to speak, not the board exactly fine, so let the public finish right, so we're right. So what elias said is saying: the public session has ended based on the hands that we took at the appropriate time again. I know that there are a lot more comments and we have gathered them in the q, a we were adding ebenezer's email. So if you have specific crosstreats of incidents or videos, please send them, because we are compiling a log and not just for the hearing, but also as we coordinate with other city agencies. So there'll be more information on that. So and they said, if you're moving into new business old business, are we doing the calendar first before we take hands from members? No, I think that we want to it's eight o'clock. It's 8 10. I think that we want we want. We have so much to discuss. We would like to end it here. Barbara just feel the fairness of it since you've been waiting. I'm gonna, allow you to say, say something on a few minutes and then we're gonna call it a day and then move on and unless release you have anything else that you wanna add. No, I don't have the agenda. We don't have new, so barbara, please! Yes, I believe. A man who spoke a few ago about the party outside of his house and how winds radio is picking up on it and that they're going to bring de blasio to task is really the essence of the problem, because the police, who are generally the enforcer who engage in enforcement, work at the behest of the civil authorities and take their marching orders from the civil authorities, for example, of that is the ending of stop and frisk at the direction of the mayor. It's. Similarly in this situation with the noise violence, the mayor has said very clearly that the police are to focus on more violent crime and are not to direct their energies to these issues, which he sees as less important. We do not. We are really under siege with this. I start, and this comes from de blasio, so the police have been ordered not to write summons, not to confiscate radios, not to which I fully agree with. They should be not to confiscate boom boxes that are in the boombox speakers that are in the backs of cars, which they have done in previous years. Now. I believe that for our forum on august 4th, you should have the mayor come and also the speaker that was here from germany william's office. Our public advocate said strongly. When this noise violence really was kicking up. He said enforcement should focus on the distributors from out of state that are coming in and not on the low-level people on the streets and that instead, community groups should engage those people and talk to them as community groups. And, of course we know, a woman was shot dead on the streets of brooklyn, not a really a great idea. So that was the message that was sent out and it comes from the mayor's office so and then and the nypd has had their hands tied behind their backs. So it was one perspective. What we need to do is have de blasio and his de and his deputy mayors and our public advocate jemoni williams, come and say we want and reverse their positions and say we will call on the police and authorize them to write summons confiscate boombox radios confiscate illegal speakers. Many of these speakers that are installed in the backs of cars are illegally installed and so forth, and that will take care of the problem. Thank you, barbara for yours from the mayor's office we're going to move along to the review of september's agenda. You guys understand it's labor day weekend. Most of you guys who would like? Yes do. We have items of new business or I don't think new business come after the calendar. I'm sorry! I don't have the agenda in front of me. It's all right! Yeah! The calendar comes first, my bad okay, no problem the yes, the our calendar for next meeting in september, those of you who like to move their first week over to the second week, if you don't have it in front of you, please reach out to ebenezer goodness or make the necessary arrangements and distribute them accordingly, new business does anyone. I don't think we have anything else, one second, before we move from the calendar, I want to call to the attention to all the committee chairs here in the meeting is that we must to start our calendar september calendar before the labor day, because all we have like four days of meeting before monday, the label day. Usually we start after label day, but this year we have to start before labor day and also we need to find a date for the executive committee meetings that because the third monday is the day the monday before when the executive committee should be is the day before the general meeting for september. That's what that was the reason I want to have the discussion of the september calendar. We can have it offline if you want to this just meditation, the date of the of the executive committee and also to make to ensure that everybody is aware that we're going to start out with meetings before the labor day weekend. That's so here, I'm looking at the count. That's september 1st to the 4th are the first days before labor day so you're saying we should start our meetings, the either the first second or third, though yes, because we're not going to have enough time after labor day to accommodate all the meetings to have one or two meetings per day amiibo. You know so I usually meet on the second tuesday, which is going to be the day after labor day and I'm fine with keeping my meeting on september 8th and I would suggest, even though we usually have our executive committee meetings on monday, I would suggest that we have our exactly. No, I'm deliberately not oh good gail's there hello. I would respectfully request that we have our executive committee meeting on tuesday, the 15th or wednesday, the 16th, so that it's in enough time for the general meeting on the 22nd, so I just wouldn't do it on the monday, because if we have it on the 14th, that's going to be the second monday it's going to conflict with whatever usually meets on the second monday. My second day for that emotion or just a change. No, I would suggest that tomorrow, ebenezer. Can you send out, like a google poll for all of the members of the executive committee, to see which date is best the 15th or the 16th, and then, whichever date is best for the majority of the executive committee? That's the one that we should that we should go with. I think, okay, so that that'll have been israel. Is there anything else that you'd like to you know? I will do that. The conflict is with the executive committee. We need to find a date for that one, because that's the one that is open. The air because of the general meeting is the day before according to the calendar, and make sure that all the committee chairs understand that we have to start our meetings before the labor day weekend. Okay, thank you. So are you going to send out that google some kind of yes? I will send that tomorrow, I would say the calendar and a poll. Thank you so much all right! Thank you before I, you know call the meeting to order. I like to. I have two items of new business sally. You should give me a quick second. I like to you know, point out first letter that congressman adriana's but yeah it was able to send to dmv which led to rebel, pretty much ending their operation in new york city, at least for the time being. So I'd like to acknowledge the fact that congressman espana was on top of a situation that is affecting us all, more so more than others, but it has been a troublesome situation for the community as a whole. I know that gail was just here listening, but I would like to have her at least say hi to everyone gail just listening. I want to say the main issues that we're focused on schools and schools and schools- and I want to thank you, mr chair, for participating in the discussion with the foods are about everybody getting 420 on their card and they already get food stamps and if they don't, please don't throw out your junk mail with 400 per student in the public schools in the very near future, and then just we got to figure this school. I don't think the school should open and I don't know if that's something that the board is going to take up, but we have to figure out opening or not. How do we make sure that if it's virtual, we need a better system than what we had last semester? So I'm just going to leave it at that because I know there's a lot to discuss. I know that the department of sanitation has cut the litter baskets on sunday, 100 and they've cut pick up 65 during the weekdays. That's also an issue and, and those two in particular not to mention many of I want to say thank you, keep talking because you're having thank you so new business before we called the meeting to order sally, I think you had it. Yes, I have two items the first. I appreciate the board setting up a public hearing about the noise violence and the health risks associated with that. What we have not yet addressed is the public health risks that we have by the lack of social distancing face covering in our neighborhoods. I think it's an economic matter. I think it's a matter of education. There are both at a city and a state level issues, for example, with the restaurants, can be addressed by the mayor's office of special enforcement at the state level. Cuomo now has a task force. I think that we need to address that in a separate public hearing. That's item one item: two, as you may or may not know, the hold on the inward rezoning is now not a hold it's back on in full force. We have been requesting that the promised inwood task force be assembled. It needs to be assembled and it has to be approved by a vote of the full board, we're already behind the eight ball on that. So my request, right now is that we address it immediately. We should have been working on it for the last year we haven't been, but we can't wait to discuss this in september. We need to start now or yesterday. So that's my other item of new old business. Thank you. Thank you. So much task force to address the rezoning issues. I think that valley, I think it should include representatives from every committee. I agree: a diversity of membership representing different neighborhoods expertise, etc. It affects every single community and we need to get on it yesterday. I second the motion. I already seconded that I got multiplied. That being said, my hand has been raised for quite some time. It's in relation to the public hearing that we're expecting to happen on august. Second, there's a motion on the floor. It needs to be voted on or discussed if there's and then we motioned to end the meeting. I wanted to register that there is a motion to happen. We have we have a motion on the floor that sat in, but we almost just ended. The meeting and my hand has been up for a while, so I want to make sure that I'll be able to speak before that happens again. Thank you. Can we take a vote? Call the okay hold on a second. I didn't realize that we were going to be calling the roll. So if it's not a total breach of protocol, is it okay? If oh wait a minute, I don't have a roster, so I can't help you please. I got it liz. You need. What's today's date, it's the 28th! Okay, could you repeat the motion that sally just made and was approved as we were all clear on what the items were that was to be included. There was just one motion in reference to start or restart. It start we never had one because it was never approved. The motion is to impanel the inward health task force. I mean the inward rezoning task force that include representation from every single committee. In a diverse classic, I mean that's representative of our community, also representative of each committee, because they will be. This is a matter that affects every single committee of the community board, and so that will be the way that we liaison between this task force and the individual committees. Thank you, including businessmen, who are probably the most affected ones by the way. It's development committee, of course, that'll, come from as there's a sign, not just from the business committee. We need outside people as well too, on that tax course. Yes, is there a discussion? There was actually an original discussion that outlined exactly how this should be created, including what elias al just stated, as well as other members that have been involved in the inward rezoning process. Great point, okay, and I would like it unencumbered by the intrusion of any elected official and to who gets appointed to this to this task force. It needs to be diverse. It needs to represent this community, it needs to represent people from actually from inwood and it needs to it needs to be. It needs to be par or separate from influence, because that happens way too much. I second that okay call on the roll marielle mariella ali okay. So I'm gonna ask, can you I? If you don't, if you're not taking attendance in the community of the hall, then I have taken attendance, but you don't need is a useful way of making sure that I didn't miss anybody. So mariella lee appears to not be on the call richard allman. How do you vote is richard on the call he's been nina, he's had internet. I just unmuted myself. The answer is yes, okay, francisco alvarez, is he on the call? No mary anderson? Yes, I vote. Yes, thank you glennis. I don't see glennis on the call wayne. Benjamin wayne he's no longer here.

I don't think he's here, okay! Well, I see that he's. There's still a box that says jimbo. I didn't hear enough of the discussion. So I'm going to abstain. There was no discussion. Oh. What am I voting on you're voting, whether or not so the motion by sally was that the inward rezoning task force be impaneled and that it include membership from every committee and representation of diverse constituencies of the community unencumbered by politics.

Is there anybody that I did not get going once going twice. If you are a member of community board 12- and I did not call your name please, let me know all right. The vote passes. I would like to change my vote to yes, if that's possible, it's jim, absolutely possible, and I had a funny feeling you would do that, which is why I was vamping for time. The voting thank you are welcome. I know you a long time. My man, the vote, is unanimous. Thank you guys all righty. There was a good order of your item of new business. Thank you. Yeah asia had a few words before we called the maid into order so quickly. Before I go into my true point, I wanted to reiterate that previously I don't have the resolution in front of me. The housing and human services, under my leadership, put forth a resolution that was voted on by the board and passed, which spoke to the fact that agencies should be restricted from acting during the summer months when we are normally supposed to be on hiatus. I do not know that any of the chairs that have been in position since that resolution has passed has actually worked on that. I understand that we are in different times, and that is the reason why we have continued our work during the summer, but that does not change that resolution needs advocacy. So I wanted to bring that up. If there are any questions about which resolution that is, I have no problem providing that. That being said, I believe that, in the context of the august 4th hearing of noise complaints that we should have this be a part of the discussion and possibly representation to people who can speak to this. I did a training with the defund police movement two weeks ago, a four day, training, and I feel strongly that there are voices in that space that are doing incredible work specifically in regards to transformative justice, and that should be bought into this discussion so that we can develop some solutions that can rightfully address some of these problems that we're having without criminalization, it's criminalization and policing. Being the primary part of that discussion, also I'd like to add to that that columbia university, which is near where I live, also contributes to noise issues. So this is not only about fireworks. This is not only about speeding cars and motorcycles, but it's about noise in general, and it seems to be that only certain types of concerns raised to being a high priority, while others are swept under the rug, especially when we're talking about specific institutions in our community. I'd like to see that be also on the agenda and when I say that I speak of the gate rattling at all hours of the night having deliveries being delivered from large trucks idling at three in the morning, etcetera and so forth and honking of four hours at times, because they're blocked in specifically because haven plaza was put in their way. So that being said, the last thing that I want to add to that is that I believe that someone should be available to unpack the numbers. The reason why I said that is: there's a study that was done on noise complaints that were issued in the 138th and broadway street area. A friend of mine's grandmother lives on that block, she's, actually, the wife of one of the mirabal family and on that block historically, there's been like domino playing because I grew up there. I've known it. I've seen it as the neighborhood began to change specifically gentrification, that specific domino table began to get us like thousand percent increase in complaints. So we, while I'm extremely sensitive to my neighbors, I'm sensitive myself with noise that I experience. I do feel like there's been an uptick as far as the firework noise this year, my son has hyper accuses, which means he hears extremely loud in one ear, so we would be a family that would be extremely sensitive to that being said, we cannot assume that the statistics of the complaints is equal to the activity, because it simply can be a campaign at times right and I'm not saying that it is all I'm saying is that if we are doing things fairly, we will have someone that can unpack the genesis of those numbers appropriately in the in that space and that discussion as well, and I think that can benefit all so. Thank you all righty. Unless someone has anything specific that they want to say before we call the meeting to order all right. Thank you. I do quickly my hand was raised. Oh I'm, sorry, I didn't see it hon. No, I was I was I was going to make, so I just wanted to clarify that. As we heard tonight, several people may address this noise. The quality of life issue complaint and there was a young man who spoke, and I just wanted to clarify a few of his statements. First of all, there is no correlation with the black lives matter movement and it seems to be a little bit. How can I say this, but politely I won't even try. It doesn't seem to be true to kind of connect. These two issues of the police of black of the of the movement that's happening around the country. What's happening with. You know: noise complaints. Yes, there is, you know, there's a lot of there's a lot of correlation, but these are deliberate decisions that are being made by the nypd to not respond to the concerns of the community. Last month of my public safety committee, it was stated on record that there was a that there was a cons. There was a concerted effort by some particular officers to not respond to the issues in the community because of their. You know concerns about how to interact with people if they were to go into cop and confiscate a stereo. What that would lead to that? Could that could that could lead to a altercation that could escalate to beca that could that could potentially become something of a larger concern. So that is the issue it's. How do we figure out a way, as I used to mention to transform? We don't want. We don't want policing to around. You know arresting people for these infractions, but to fix what happened, but to figure out a way to think of this holistically and come up with a solution that is transformative and restorative at the same time, but also holding the nypd accountable for their lack of interest in engaging in this conversation and their lack of response to this particular issue, not just the mayor, but the mayor, the nypd, our local elected officials and even our community board. Who is not an issue of just the businesses either. I've heard that tonight I know several people have said it's people coming from other locations coming into the community and I don't think that's completely true either. I think there's a yes. There are some people coming in, but if there are definitely people in the community, I've walked around the community to observe some of the complaints that I've received through my through my committee, and these are people I see doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over again we have to. We have to remove the false narrative. We have to hold people accountable and we have to accept their accept the reality of the situation for what it is. Thank you hang on a second phoenix. Were you trying to say something because I really want to call it yeah really. Can you hear me? I have a suggestion for wait. Give me a second because phoenix was already speaking. Oh I'm sorry phoenix! Thank you! It's okay, can you hear me paradise yeah. I wanted to agree with curtis and hearing people say that they were calling 9-1-1 on, can't hear you. Can you get closer? Maybe I'm sorry. Can you hear me now? That's a little bit a little a little low, yeah I'll turn off my, but when I like hearing people say that they were calling I'm sorry. I can't barely hear you you're gonna have to either get one of these or really get really close to the mic. Phoenix. Not yes. Now much better. I wanted to say that I agree with curtis and hearing that people were calling the police on people who are making noise makes me a little concerned given what's happening right now, and I'm not saying I don't think anyone should be called. I think we should work on finding an alternative to that and I wanted to respond to the man who said that I don't know if he's still listening. I hope he is, but he said that the reason why there's a rise in noise complaints is because of black lives matter movement and, though calls to defund the police. I think the whole point of defunding the police is to find alternatives to calling the police on non-violent offenders. So we don't end up so people of color and black people, especially don't end up losing their lives when it's not needed. So I just wanted to respond to and say that when you make assumptions that are not based on facts like saying the police are scared of black lives are afraid to take action because of black lives matter. I think language like that is really violent and we should denounce it because it's honestly offensive to me, because I support black lives matter, and I think we should defund the police, but what that man was saying is not at all what we support so yeah. That's what I want to say. Thank you phoenix I just like to before. We finish our meeting to say: yes, we do have an extremely amount of noise. I've heard comments of people say. That is a cultural thing, even if we, if we share the same nationality, that doesn't necessarily mean that we are all alike or we behave the same. I think that some of us are just as big of victims as the people who have had the opportunity to express their opinions. I think that we are making an effort to try and gather as many voices so that those people who should be held accountable, regardless of who they are, and what agencies they work for, and whether we should abstain ourselves from voting on resolutions that affect the agencies that we work, for. I think that we are on the right track. I am very proud to say that a lot of the violence that has been happening throughout the city, regardless of the amount of noise that you guys have heard, is not happening in our backyard, not a single homicide, not a single stabbing. None of that nature. Yes, there is a lot of noise on firecrackers, but no homicides or no violence. At least something is positive, is come out of this. So I like to call the meeting to order I like to get it I'm sorry. I wanted to suggest somebody to come to the meeting and I've been trying to say that for the august 4th hearing, I wanted to suggest that we invite beta nyc, because they are the ones that gather this 3-1-1 data. They manage that 311 data for boards that and I wanted to suggest that they are invited as long along with the office of special enforcement they're, all known a part of the august 4th discussion. I just wanted to make sure you all heard that so people can get on. I have the contact information. Yes happy to share. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Maria's hand has been up for a long time. I know I just have an announcement that, after listening about the noise and everything you should have been in the bronze on saturday afternoon, coming out of city island, there was a million people honking, you know the these, the cars and it was a mess. We have problems here, but we should look at the other bottles how people are misbehaving, but also, let me just say my announcement. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, I have a few hundred masked blue masks available for donation, but I want to make sure that I know who I want to give them to not everybody's gonna line off in front of my house. You know asking for the mess, so give me a call. You all have my telephone number. I also have bandanas a very nice bandana to give to people that are you know that needs it. So let me know and I'll be able to provide those to everybody. Okay, just two very quick things. One is dovetailing on tonya's suggestion. I would like to just make sure that we have someone from dep the department of environmental protection. They are the people who are responsible for them, they're, the ones that carry noise permits I mean so I want to make sure they're there and not related to that next week's meeting. I just want to let everybody know that, with the last couple hundred bucks that the community board had in fiscal in the last fiscal year, we were able to procure several trash, grabbers and a bunch of bags. So if anybody wants to join me, I go out a couple nights a week garbage in parks. You know where to reach me: it's a rocking good time who doesn't like garbage so yeah. I got your text on db, so for my third time, I'd like to call this made into order. Can I get a second german, it's already in order all right. Thank you have a great night y'all, so you.
