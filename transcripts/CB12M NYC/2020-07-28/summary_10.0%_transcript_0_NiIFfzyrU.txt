Okay, thanks, daryl we're going to move on since a lot of you have a point of information, because no, I need to speak because you allowed all the board members to speak and I cannot be of a shadow because now you have to go to a public session.
We're not publishing the public session said that the points that are related to noise we're going to take those q and a's and comments during after the sorry after the noise pollution presentation, because it's all related to noise right and my comment is related to noise.
I've been attending and going to different places in the heights and inwood, and there are many people that come from outside the community to make noise in front of restaurants oftentimes.
Then compliance and a lot of people come from outside to make this noise, and it's really annoying- and I agree with most of the comments have been said- thank you so much catherine, my okay, kathryn, okay, so in respecting also our speakers time.
I it's a procedural thing, so I have a short video which should be played during the public session, since it relates to noise, correct yeah we just yeah we'd like to yeah.
So, as folks who have seen the agenda tonight, we have a presentation from dr wendy chung from columbia, university, medical center related to the covid recovery corps and they'll be talking about a new research initiative related to covid, and so we're really excited to have you present and update us on what's happening hospital good.
Okay, very good, so I am a professor at columbia university and I think everyone appreciates just how much our community's been impacted by covet 19..
Very fatigued and I've also been hearing many complaints about everything, from fuzzy thinking or difficulty, concentrating to difficulty, sleeping and just not feeling like themselves and as we're doing this we're trying to learn from each other.
Their issues and they've been helping us to design a study to look at individuals who have previously been infected and understand, as I said, differences both how long it takes for people to recover and then the symptoms that seem to recover faster and those that aren't recovering so quickly and long term.
If you can remember back in it seems like years ago, but really just a couple months ago, we had so little testing available that we've had many people who thought they were sick, but we don't really know for sure if it was covid19 or not so we're launching this study as two-fold.
Is we've developed an antibody test which allows us to look back because of the body having mounted an immune response and fighting the virus to be able to see evidence of previous infection and we're guessing that in the community of northern manhattan?
If this is something that looks like it's useful, we have permission to be able to go on from there as well, but we're starting with this group in to do this, though one thing we have to do is to develop a test that we can do testing from home.
I don't know, but once we know that test with home testing works, then we can get kits out to on the community and, like I said, be able to do this on a much larger scale.
So in terms of being able to do this, appreciating that it takes people's time and energy to participate, we want to be respectful of that, and so we do have a show of our gratitude for that.
As we're doing this, as I said, the eligibility criteria are pretty straightforward, it's adults, so it's individuals, 18 or older, who can sign, who can be able to give permission for themselves and that think they've had coveted 19 because again we're looking for people who are positive, who actually were infected in the past, and then we can check and see how they're recovering, as I said, because many people may have even mild symptoms.
So as we do this, the whole point, though, is to learn along the way, and as we do this we're going to be having videos that are on the website community board meetings, newsletters that are going to go out, but as soon as we know, you'll know as well.
So I've tried out the system to make sure it works and the results are robust, they're, the right results and, as I said, we're getting these results out quickly to people so I'll wrap up here, but just to say and give credit to survivor corps which has been one of the community groups.
That's been very instrumental in this if they're all extend an open offer, if there are any members of the community who think they might have useful feedback, we'd love to have your feedback and even potentially, to help us on our advisory board.
Well, first of all, I think it's important that, if we're having a discussion about covert 19, that we recognize the fact that 914 people in our community have died.
However, the community that obviously is right next to us at columbia, I wanted to make sure had first dibs, so to speak, that they knew about it and were aware of the opportunity remembering also, though, that people don't have to take the blood test or the test in general to be part of this.
If you know you are positive from any of those mechanisms, we want to put that information together on as many as people as quickly as possible, because we obviously want people to recover and, as I said before, I think colombia unfortunately having had the first wave first is going to have a lot that we can teach the rest of the world about.
Okay, I'm the I should mention, I'm the chair of the health and environment committee and I'm sure that my committee and personally, I would like to be able to work with you on this project.
But what partnerships are you utilizing or leveraging to ensure that you are getting that diversity of people that you're looking for and understanding that the black american and the hispanic american community have been disproportionately impacted by kobe yeah?
I'm hoping we'll be able to launch that within the next two weeks in spanish, but everything has been translated and I said with the irb: we've had many community partners, alianza, dominicana, rafael antigua, has been one of our partners in terms of thinking of, I would say, sort of the north of columbia and then south of columbia, harlem hospital, as well as many of our faith-based organizations, our community health care worker, core we've tried to reach out to many individuals, but I'm sure we're not finished, and I'm sure this is going to still for kovit is going to be with us for a while.
Thank you so good evening, everyone, yes, my question is actually and thank you know for this wonderful presentation.
The second part of things, though, was that who got infected those individuals who already had issues like diabetes or who had heart disease, even people who didn't know they had those conditions or even people who may not have been overtly diabetic but may have had some pre-diabetes.
Even I think those people are the ones that we're seeing that are bearing disproportionately the burden in terms of getting either very sick or, in some cases, even dying, I think in terms of access to care and who had access to medical care to know about their conditions to get treatment for their conditions.
So I think that's part of what we want to tease apart and understand and be able to start remedying and addressing as we go forward.
But yes, I'm looking forward to is there is any particular you know kind of behavior that this community are achieving things that they are not doing, and this is exactly what I wanted just to find out, because I heard that, but I've been wondering until now that you kindly you know, have responded.
Dr sure wayne will certainly work with our the your counterparts at the other boards, as well as our counterparts at the morningside who may have some closer relationship, especially with nine, but a study like this.
Right, I mean if your catchment area is within 25 miles of the medical center, certainly that captures all of community boards 9 10, 11 and 12, and I would think you want to take you know proactive measures to make sure those boards know about it and get the word out to their residents.
As wendy said this 25 mile radius, well, certainly gail brewer's office can be of you know: assistance to you and pulling together the manhattan community boards.
Thank you so just so, for so we have sally and danielle to wrap up our committee board members speak and then wendy.
How many generations might be living in a household and also the controller, has done a report on the number of essential workers by community board district and I think across the city, we're number four in terms of having the num the highest number of essential workers.
Yes, that's a great point, so one of the things that I think is good about this is that at least for the first thousand people we'll actually get the chance to meet them so we'll be personally.
For example, somebody that's going to follow them long term and not just you know during the study yeah, so I'm very sensitive to that fact, and as we do this, like, I said we do have many programs.
I think one of the things that colombia has been working on very diligently in the hospital is about healthcare, equity access and justice, and so I think we've got lots of new resources available that are going to be very useful to the community in that way, and then I guess just one more quick thing.
I mean I know that data like on a city level, but I think it'd be really helpful for us as a community board, to see where we have these hot points and to be able to potentially do education around that yep.
There are all sorts of databases that link to different factors with social determinants of health that you can start to tease apart some of these various factors, and so we're looking forward to being able to do that and get into like, I said, even more granular data and if members of the board can help us in terms of analyzing the data learning from that data and then disseminating that information back to the community.
Sorry, I lost the screen for a second, oh, we actually don't in terms of the q, a chat you mean regarding the presentation yeah, so we have just one more from d'angelo around behavior in terms of you know like if you're outside, do you consistently wear a mask?
I just want to mention, following up on the point that wayne raised earlier about reaching out to our adjacent community boards we're going to be co-sponsoring an event with columbia.
Next wednesday august, the 5th with the borough president's office and the other upper manhattan boards to talk about the columbia university's plans to reopen and will include a discussion about covert, 19 and quote helping communities follow.
You know this is all coming together and then, frankly, in the last couple of hours and we've been talking with our morning dad about exactly what the program will be, we have just following up on steve said we have three speakers lined up dr donald lynn, who is now the covid director for the entire university.
Mark thank you so much, mr chair, and thanks to cb12, who, my goodness, I think, you've been probably the most out front of any community board and focusing on the pandemic for months on end and, unfortunately, that work is going to have to continue we're not out of this.
I know steve as healthcare is very focused on that, but I just wanted to thank everyone for holding this meeting and for your work on this topic and I'm obviously here as a partner for you throughout as long as this pandemic lasts.
What was the response from the from the police department from 3-1-1, and what I found is that 60 of all of the of the data that I collected are all coming back unfounded by the police department, meaning you know they didn't see any they weren't experiencing anything when they stopped by, but at the same time you know, as you guys know, like people are sending me videos at the same time.
I did use board stat to start to check some of the hot spots, at least for this past week, but obviously, since 38 percent of them aren't being tracked in there, it's not going to really completely cover all the areas that we're having issues.
You know us coming to you guys to the senators with complaints, but coming with ideas of solutions, we're doing that we're having weekly meetings where like we're here, we're ready to like pitch in and help out.
I had people from the community, it was you know, people I had they had the google form I posted every day, like all right we're day.
One of the study we're day two and I had complaints coming in you know all times of the day from people all over.
I want to remind folks, too, that we are having a full public hearing to actually dig in deeper and have, I think, more robust conversation, ideas.
Okay, I think it is extremely uncalled for that happened in the community yeah, but we're gonna have we're.
I also had some concerns about the noise and I was talking to dr arlene bronzeft today, for those of you who don't know she's an environmental psychologist who is on the board of grow, nyc she's been she's been appointed to that position under five different mares and her work in anti-noise advocacy actually started in inwood at p.s 98 in the 70s.
One of the questions that she asked me was about crime in the neighborhood and, if that's been on the rise lately- and I didn't have the stats in front of me- but it does seem to be- and for my personal experience for the locations that are recurring noise issues on my block, I have called 9-1-1 three times in the past two months.
Another was a fight where somebody got knocked to the ground and wasn't getting up and another was a man and a woman fighting over a gun, and she confirmed that there is a link between noise and crime, and she said that when you give license to violate the noise ordinances, you give license to break all laws and she was concerned about what is going on in the neighborhood, and she has agreed to work with us and with respect the group for respectful decibel levels to get these noise issues resolved up here.
I also spoke to dr bransf and I just want people to know that she has agreed to speak at our hearing next week.
Thank you very much all this that no other point to keep jumping in okay, george, I think the public session customarily what happens is if the board member has a question or is speaking to something that the speaker is stating that the board members can speak during that time.
Then will be how you guys, as the board members like what are your actions in helping us, because there's only so much that we can do 3-1-1 complaints are not working.
9-1-1 calls are not working when I call the precinct, nobody ever picks up and I've even spoken to the nco about this and she's like I don't know why they're not picking up, which is concerning to say the least like how is a precinct, not picking up calls so we're just all at our wits end right now, like I literally had to escape the city in order to be have sleep, that's how bad it is because it's every single night starting at 7 p.m. The latest has been going on until 8 00 a.m, and I work, and so this is like so there's a lot of people.
So what are you guys, as community board members doing to help us out, because there's only so much that we can do and we're all extremely frustrated, and I just want to know what actions are being taken specifically also for spanish speakers.
As I said, you know, I'm just suffering, probably as much as anyone else in this panel, so we're just looking for answers and trying to call for action and on the part that we're doing the spanish speaking outreach myself.
The biggest limitation of not being in person right now is that hearing is going to be in english right, and so we are leaving out a fundamental major part of our community, which is spanish-speaking elders, who are deeply impacted by all of the quality of life issues that we spoken about tonight, and so I think it does push us to go into the drawing board and thinking about how we can make it accessible, not just for spanish-speaking folks, but just in general, accessible for those and gen who have different issues and challenges in terms of the virtual english space.
I don't think we've asked why we they have much more proximity to the people who make these decisions than we do as community board members.
What are they going to do to work with this community board to make sure that we address these issues and get a resolution?
I'm going to give witness to some things that people are aware of and think, maybe only in the last 10 years.
Then there's a general sense that we are being abandoned by our leadership that nobody, that our leadership is not stepping up and being out there in voicing and standing up for our concerns and I'm going to ask our leadership as a lifelong resident and for people that have can't speak right now to please don't abandon us and step up here and take care of business and that's the leadership, and I thank all you.
The one thing that you know many people tell me is that noise.
So I think ending noise pollution is basically about justice because we all deserve to live in an environment that is healthy and just speaking of impact on a personal level, the loud music I mean my window shake my wall, shake I'm on the fifth floor and I still can't hear it the explosions, the music, the imagine just that constant assault of noise on a baby trying to sleep on a teenager trying to you know, do homework on a nurse.
So what I think is that a small number of individuals and groups are victimizing most of us and are making this beautifully diverse community divided, and I really want to foster a sense of community so that we all fight for what is right and for condition living conditions that are healthy for all of us, and you know the last thing is that we need to address this noise issue as a public health issue and as environmental and environmental justice issues.
This was just as the weather was starting to get hot, and so I it went on for eight hours and I didn't understand why, and so I thought I will reach out to other community members and see if we have similar experiences and try to find out what's going on, and I thought okay, this is probably just a small thing.
Probably thinking I was, I was a customer and I said no thanks, I'm just crossing the street, so all of these things come together and we have.
So we have many spanish speakers and somebody reached out to me today and she actually wanted to speak today, but she was worried that she might not have somebody to translate for her mother passed away her 83 year old mother, passed away after having an anxiety attack from the fireworks on july 4th, and so I just think that is, I can't imagine if my parents passed away survive covet but pass away from the fireworks, and she said you know if I go into the community and I walk through the street, and I see you know, I see I pass people and I think we're the ones who set off the fireworks.
I realize I'm talking a long time, but I want to thank you very much for holding the public hearing.
I hope that we can do something to reach out more to the spanish-speaking community as well, and I really just want to thank you for putting us on the agenda for next week.
Uptown that's taking place, and so I just want to let you know that I'm gonna go back and I'm sure and make sure the public have again our office knows and be in touch with lsr and other board members.
I have I've been living in this community, all my life literally I'm 29 since I was born- and I think I'm listening to a lot of the the public speak and a lot of what you guys have to say and what it is it's a microcosm of.
A lady mentioned that it's a cultural divide and it is most dominicans like to be downstairs and listen to their music and it's okay as long as it's respectful, but it's not going to stop and unless we put different political leaders in and stop political movements that have that tie the hands of police that aren't able to enforce these laws.
So that that's what I got to say you, we have several hands from board members, so barbara will be the first one, because you know I think, if you've already spoken, we have a lot to speak about next week and we have so much more.
The calendar comes first, my bad okay, no problem the yes, the our calendar for next meeting in september, those of you who like to move their first week over to the second week, if you don't have it in front of you, please reach out to ebenezer goodness or make the necessary arrangements and distribute them accordingly, new business does anyone.
I don't think we have anything else, one second, before we move from the calendar, I want to call to the attention to all the committee chairs here in the meeting is that we must to start our calendar september calendar before the labor day, because all we have like four days of meeting before monday, the label day.
I like to you know, point out first letter that congressman adriana's but yeah it was able to send to dmv which led to rebel, pretty much ending their operation in new york city, at least for the time being.
I don't think the school should open and I don't know if that's something that the board is going to take up, but we have to figure out opening or not.
That's also an issue and, and those two in particular not to mention many of I want to say thank you, keep talking because you're having thank you so new business before we called the meeting to order sally, I think you had it.
I think that we need to address that in a separate public hearing.
The meeting and my hand has been up for a while, so I want to make sure that I'll be able to speak before that happens again.
If you are a member of community board 12- and I did not call your name please, let me know all right.
That being said, I believe that, in the context of the august 4th hearing of noise complaints that we should have this be a part of the discussion and possibly representation to people who can speak to this.
I do feel like there's been an uptick as far as the firework noise this year, my son has hyper accuses, which means he hears extremely loud in one ear, so we would be a family that would be extremely sensitive to that being said, we cannot assume that the statistics of the complaints is equal to the activity, because it simply can be a campaign at times right and I'm not saying that it is all I'm saying is that if we are doing things fairly, we will have someone that can unpack the genesis of those numbers appropriately in the in that space and that discussion as well, and I think that can benefit all so.
You know arresting people for these infractions, but to fix what happened, but to figure out a way to think of this holistically and come up with a solution that is transformative and restorative at the same time, but also holding the nypd accountable for their lack of interest in engaging in this conversation and their lack of response to this particular issue, not just the mayor, but the mayor, the nypd, our local elected officials and even our community board.
I've heard that tonight I know several people have said it's people coming from other locations coming into the community and I don't think that's completely true either.
That's a little bit a little a little low, yeah I'll turn off my, but when I like hearing people say that they were calling I'm sorry.
I wanted to say that I agree with curtis and hearing that people were calling the police on people who are making noise makes me a little concerned given what's happening right now, and I'm not saying I don't think anyone should be called.
I think we should work on finding an alternative to that and I wanted to respond to the man who said that I don't know if he's still listening.
They are the people who are responsible for them, they're, the ones that carry noise permits I mean so I want to make sure they're there and not related to that next week's meeting.
I just want to let everybody know that, with the last couple hundred bucks that the community board had in fiscal in the last fiscal year, we were able to procure several trash, grabbers and a bunch of bags.
You know where to reach me: it's a rocking good time who doesn't like garbage so yeah.
