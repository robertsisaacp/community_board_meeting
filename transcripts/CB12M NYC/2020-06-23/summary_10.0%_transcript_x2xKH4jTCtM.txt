Why do you know it's not just members, it's open to the public, and I pointed out that it's overlapping with our general meeting and asked whether they could offer it again and I was told that they are going to offer it again.
They will also be currently listening to youtube manhattan training series, so it is always going to conflict with somebody's meeting somewhere right, [Applause] yeah.
I know, but I think this is the second time in particular that the land use one conflict.
We have about 40 panelists out of which I'm assuming that there are public members, some dlt presenters and some some other people that I can recognize because I just see a bunch of numbers, so I'm gonna call the meeting to order is seven actually no 6 39 welcome each and every one of you guys for making making the time and making the effort to be here tonight or this evening, beautiful weather out it's been kind of hot.
Okay, all right and I'll have the june the may minutes next month, next meeting any nays, any abstentions.
There's many things to do, but I'm gonna now take this opportunity to do something to what I think is priority, which is a presentation spare headed and quarterbacked by our chair of dnt david avian on a department of transportation, citibank, presentation on how they're moving forward with their their future and appliances.
Everyone and hello, I'm jennifer santenez, I'm the manhattan deputy borough, commissioner, at the new york city department of transportation, and I wanted to thank community board 12 for hosting us tonight.
Thank you right, and that has been those links have been sent to the board, but also dot t or I don't know if this is best by ebenezer and team.
You can put the links in the in the q a also maybe for people to pick up thanks, and one thing to note is the one that we're sharing today is an abbreviated sort of version, so the one that we'll share in the q a will have much more details in it.
Like I said, I'm gonna go through an abbreviated presentation hitting some hitting some important facts about the expansion of city bike up into washington heights and inwood.
That would accomplish about 30 stations and later we're going to come back and finish off the rest of the community board only up to 220th street.
So we created a draft plan for station locations within manhattan, community board, 12 and the two main sort of considerations are our own planning and technical, siding guidelines and community outreach, and, as jennifer mentioned, we presented this plan to the traffic and transportation committee on june 1st, so public outreach there's a couple of sort of facets of it.
There are no, and at the same time, we had a online feedback portal map open for about a month and a half actually is closer to two months and people were again able to drop in pins and say yes, you know, I want to see a city bike station here or no, and in addition to that, we have stakeholder meetings with places such as the new york port author, the new york, new jersey, port authority, different parks, nycha facilities to make sure that their input is taken into account as well, and this is the more planning side of what we're looking for when we, when we put stations down.
We generally like to add larger stations adjacent to large destination, a very popular destination such as transit hubs or supermarkets, or things like that, where there's going to be a lot more foot, traffic and generally smaller ones in residential areas and the actual sighting of the station there's other things we have to consider, such as utilities, manholes street furniture, trees, sidewalk width, to make sure that nothing really gets impeded when we place a station down so like I said, we combined all that outreach and our citing guidelines and made this draft plan, of which we presented to community board 12 the transportation committee.
One is contacting jennifer and her folks at the manhattan borough commissioner's office numbers right there or you can email us directly us being the bike share unit at this email address we're going to be accepting feedback for another week up until june 30th.
We can synthesize everything and make sure that we have a plan that best works for the community with installationing happening later this summer and, like I said that was a quick abbreviated version, we can provide a longer presentation that has stuff such as ridership stats and pricing and some more detailed information about our planning process, so yeah.
Anybody from the public obviously can go direct to d.o.t. I understand you know: eli really wants to move the agenda and I think- and I'm supportive of that.
I just want to capture that when you do have a chance to look at the map- and I hope people already did- that the hottest station and the only one that there were two that had issues in particular and number one on that list was a station that you'll see on the map at west 157th, there's a variety of reasons: why a number of board members, and thanks to maria luna, curtis wayne, etc, who were able to provide pictures and very specific feedback that will be sort of one area.
So I understand people are going to want to talk tonight but know that I have captured if you have provided that information.
That included two other stations to comment on as well, so with that, I certainly open it to questions, but people should rest assured that if you've already provided impact information that I have, that and and I'll have omar back me up on sort of reviewing everything to make sure that we haven't missed anything etc.
I just want to let people know that there that those issues will be addressed later in the agenda and the district managers report in the different committee reports.
Don't think that we're ignoring you, even though we're not answering those questions right now, we're just focused on this item, but we will get to those things, one other procedural question: how do people sign up for the public session because I or whoever's the host?
I need you to mute everyone across the board because there's someone who has their open microphone, I'm hearing something that is really kind of like bothering each and every one of us so catherine, you know the sadly poster questions.
Thank you, hi jesse, a great work on the presentation and even better job in minimizing the impact on the local parking spots.
That needs to have the attention of everyone, and I'm sure that you know you will come through that because I don't think it's difficult, but the most important thing is obviously the fact that we need to have equal access and provide some type of options where clients can buy some type of cards and have access to the bikes.
Can you hear me yes now we can thank you for your presentation, so I have a bunch of questions like the more one minute.
The first thing I want to say is: I was on the traffic and transportation committee for almost two years, and I was unaware that this was an upcoming project in the neighborhood, and I didn't hear about any of those meetings that were opportunities to provide feedback.
The other thing about safety in in washington heights and one thing that we did mention during the community meeting is we have this mayor de blasio announced in 2019 this green wave initiative and that is to increase bicycle infrastructure, not only in you know not only in bike share expansion areas, but throughout the five boroughs- and that includes you- know, physical infrastructure and education of the best rule the rules in the road, the rules of the road.
The the meeting that we had was in coordination with cb12 the outreach meeting, and on top of that, the pop-up meetings were in the libraries in community board 12 as well, so they would just pop up and we just showed up and whoever was inside at the time we were able to speak to thanks.
I really appreciate you and taking the time to speak with us couple questions how much parking is being sacrificed for these city bikes, one two when you guys get together and discuss the communities that you guys are trying to be active in how much conversation is surrounded around need.
I saw you debbie that at the last meeting on june 1st that we are going to put like a group of people together that live around our area, you know near those areas to make recommendations and to see how we could really make it make plan.
Not only the city but also the community parking is a you know, is a problem in our you know difficult community, and I think that we were supposed to be having a meeting something like tomorrow.
They gave us few dates to see which one would be you know better for all of us and tomorrow I think it's june 24 in the morning with something you know something like that, but I'm trying to find my emails and my answers.
Do we have time to make that recommend final recommendation and we will, if they listen to us, because I mean we are the ones that live around here in this you know the vicinity of the 157th street and you know by broadway and morgan plays and things like, so that so the question is: do is there still time to make recommendations before it's by june 30th?
Of course I want to know about that, but I have captured the points about 157th as well as the excellent and it's not just one suggestion about alternative sites for that, and so the process again is that while this isn't a resolution item, the community board comments from our community board, members will go back to dot in a consolidated form, so I'm sort of I'm not sure what the gap is.
As duffy said any comments, any extra questions can go straight to the committee because there's still time to compile all of this information so go ahead.
I want to know, since lyft is running this, if people, especially because we have many lower income, people in community board 12, if there will be based on like the metro card status or some other indicator, that they will receive a reduced rate, because I believe the standard rate for a metro for a city bike is something like 90 a month which is not cheap.
The next person, catherine, it's domingo, okay, yeah, so my concern again is around parking because it seems, like you, have different sectors of the community already being able voicing their concerns.
What's going to be, what's going to be done in 184th street and beyond 181st street, because I'm assuming that dlt already canvassed that area, but there's a big set like there's a lot of restaurants and and dining areas which already limit the amount of parking spaces for the community so being taking further more, I think, would be, will create a sort of catastrophic, very chaotic area.
So I would like to know the breakdown of parking spaces being lost north of 181st street yeah.
I just really wanted from a process standpoint to let people know how they're going to get on the public session list.
So like the what going back to what we said earlier in the committee, so they one thing to know is that, yes, they do get cleaned every so often when a maintenance person has to go fix a bike or when they're parked adjacent to hospitals such as the one on 169th street and and fort washington avenue.
Well, I think I believe that I did answer the question about kovid and the kind of the cleanliness that the bikes go through, but in terms of the first sort of parking question, I can let jennifer answer that, certainly, and in regard you know, we can try to get additional clarification as to what additional measures lyft is taking for cleaning.
Four that the city doh, you know like the department of health, tries to share right.
So going to the first question about parking, we did speak about this at the committee level and our process is this: you know we don't come to the board with a final set plan, formal surveys that are completed.
Please share that with debbie reach out to us, like you know, we're trying to provide as much information as we can that we have available at the moment.
Do you know how much that's going to impede putting these sites up, and can you explain how that's going to work and how you're coordinating with other agencies sure yeah whenever there's construction, what we try to do is find a suitable area.
12 is citywide problem and I believe the mayor's office and the police department in general are working to find out the way to stop how to bring the firework to the city of new york.
The department of transportation have more questions than answers at this time from the district manager and these go guidelines and we'll continue having some meetings.
You know the details of how the boss way going to be implemented at 101st street, the department of parks and recreation informed at the district service cabinet meeting that four swimming pools will be open in manhattan during the summer, but not high bridge swimming pool, because this site is being used as a coffee, 19 testing center, the asia raid, the department of human administration, informed that they are replacing all the air conditioners over five years to the people that are in the program receiving air conditioner by age or eight.
I want to let everybody know that the office, the community board 12, has a facebook page.
This meeting is being broadcasted right now live in facebook and also in youtube, and we encourage everyone to visit and become a friend of our facebook page at the name of the page is office, facebook page and for cb12 and be as a member, you know, login, you know, send your request and you can see all the information we're planning to reboot this facebook page during the summer time and be able to post all the information.
I think it's extremely important ebenezer when you have information like that to share with businesses that you actually communicate with folks who chair these committees, you know so that we could try to potentially send an email out or add it to the agenda and as far as the bus lane goes, is there anything happening where, like a community conversation about it or it's just they're, doing it and that's the fight because, as we know, we have representatives here from d.o.t, but there seems to be a certain level of cohesion when we work with them and the mess that they leave is for us to deal with while they move on to another messy project, yes domingo.
But, yes, I will be sending it to you as well, but it's not much information there to give out yet, but this the manhattan district managers, we are working very diligent to find the details and we're going to be sharing with you as soon as possible and regarding west 101st street.
It was sent out wayne at the beginning, we're going to send out again and we're going to, like I said before, we're going to be working to revamp and make sure everybody knows about our youtube channel and facebook account as well.
I don't know if jonathan is able to count that it doesn't work like that, we had a discussion before steve in the last executive committee meeting and the last meeting we're working on that to try to do the best.
I am forwarding to both you and ebenezer a report that our transportation policy- analyst paul, wrote right after that last minute, dot, meeting summarizing it and providing the relevant links so that you can share it with the entire board.
Welcome johnny yeah that my first started your community board meeting, and I really appreciate that you guys hosting me today, I'm bringing up a situation that going on in our neighborhood, I live by 107th street between broadway and for washington, and the only situation around our neighborhood is out of control.
Okay, it's at the time that sometimes early in the morning, we even had to walk through the street, because you cannot even walk in the sidewalk and, like this morning is basically, I was walking to go to work around seven something in the morning and the homeless, people even using the drugs on the street, you know and even getting high.
In the first week of march workers at five new york city, restaurants went on strike after chipotle catherine, the next person I didn't hear the last part.
In the first week of march workers at five new york city, restaurants went on strike after chipotle managers, pressured workers to work sick with coronavirus symptoms, despite the mounting crisis of the pandemic, and studies that have come out since then show that there were likely already thousands of coronavirus cases in new york city.
By that point, we only recently learned of these license applications and, unfortunately missed the june committee meeting, which is why we're here tonight, and so for all of the reasons mentioned, we ask that community board 12 oppose chipotle's application for restaurant wine licenses at 3781, broadway and 4240 broadway.
Okay, yes, hello, my name is theodora and I work at chipotle on 355th ave in empire state building, I'd like to talk about the issues at my company that affect both workers and members of the public.
They haven't been following a lot of the requirements and just implementing basic things like sneeze guards to protect workers, and they also have like a lot of other outstanding issues related to fair work week, laws as well, and basically you know that you know theodore- has children and she's lives in her neighborhood and she needs to protect herself and her family and her community as well eduardo.
So I'm not sure why all of those folks didn't raise their hands to speak during the public session, but I felt that for our board members who may not be monitoring the chat, it's important for them to have the benefit of knowing that these are some of the questions and concerns that the public is raising.
So all the questions that I know is on everybody's mind: how is this going to work and so on are more relevant in manhattan than anywhere else.
Number two: the issue that liz ritter just brought up and that I hear about every single community board is this tension between the need for the restaurants and the question of what they could or could not do, etc.
And the answer is absolutely yes, but what the city is thinking of doing and thinking of is the word that I was told is a mediation process for restaurants that are having challenges and where there are complaints and supposedly to use oath or a private organization called jams which I probably should know, but don't and apparently they're willing to do the mediation for free, so community boards need to be absolutely front and center, as community board three said tonight, nobody ever consults the community boards and guess who is on the front line the community boards.
I know that housing is utmost of importance to community board 12 and all of us without getting into the wonderful work that's going on in albany and the city council and the fact that there's a new housing connect portal.
The data not names, not specific addresses, but knowing where there are hot spots in terms of evictions or holdovers, or anything that could indicate that there's a challenge regarding this area and people getting evicted again, not a lot of details to give you right now.
As you know, the mayor cut the pickup in the budget, but we are pushing at least have one organics drop off per community board, because if we lose that momentum again, it goes right to the landfill.
We have one on the 25th on landmarks and one on the 29th on more advanced zoning, but we will find another time to do this, one in terms of all the great work that the protesters have done, just not in board 12, although I think you do have the best murals in the united states right on dyckman and that certainly to me, is part of protest.
Compliments support collaboration that has come out of it and I just want to say thank you very much, because we have lots more work to do, but I think it's been extremely helpful.
Thank you very much and congratulations to board 12 on so many levels and I think it's great in terms of your public.
I certainly want to work with miss rojas about her concern about what's going on in her neighborhood and, of course, all the other issues that you brought up thanks.
So this was a resolution that was brought forward by tanya, and the committee made some modifications and we felt that it was prudent being that, as things are beginning to as businesses is starting to reopen to be able to start advocating for equitable processes in which we could but support our local businesses, whether it be via lenders or etc, but just make making sure that we're able to provide equitable access to communities of color within new york city, specifically district 12., so, okay, so that be the end of your presentation.
Do people have any questions or friendly amendments or anything that they would like to add or comment about before we move forward to the next resolution presented by eliza reader, our fabulous secretary to the number one two and three, so we don't have any domingo.
Thank you, steve for your questions, tania, for being so prepared and domingo for making the presentation so lisa your resolution, please!
Yes, okay, so a couple of things I just wanted before I present the resolution.
The language doesn't change the meaning of it, so I'm not going to go into those specifics and I'm waiting to hear back from the washington heights inwood food council on exactly what their yield is and how many people they serve and how many, how much space they have and so we'll add that into a whereas just sort of by the numbers information.
Of course you do yes, steve in the fifth, whereas I would like to suggest that instead of saying inadequate, that you should say inappropriate and and that you should indicate due to soil contamination, slope, park, alienation and accessibility issues and then end the, whereas clause at that point, because I don't believe that the money had was ever transferred to d.o.e. Okay, that's fine!
Can you send me that language, because I'm kind of juggling a bunch of things- and I don't have that screen open, but that sounds perfectly reasonable, yeah, no problem and in the resolve clause I would delete the commas that were housing yeah, that's fine, okay, very good and steve.
Okay, tony okay, do I have anyone else before I move on to house houses, but no, I think I would like to commend liz because if folks didn't participate in that meeting, you would see what being somebody who brought everybody together and developed a constructive way of being able to take negative situations and not let community members go against each other, but identify issues and figure out how to commonly attack them.
You know- and I think that was very greatly done- I left with the understanding that as a community, we must advocate for more garbage bins within our parks, but also being able to figure out how to have the community members also engage with anybody who they feel is doing something that is out of out of that would impact the area, but also letting folks know that this neighborhood, carrying effect of being able to call the police and falsely accuse people was, is not going to be tolerated.
This word there's been a lot of information on facebook lately about you know, people posting photographs of parks that are strewn with garbage like totally trashed, and then there are literally hundreds of comments about.
She is currently actually looking to go back and work with some of the members of the lgbt task force so to try and make sure that it is, you know, even more further inclusive of other language that we would like to have included in the future.
The committee was really just looking forward to try and pass a resolution once we've gotten, you know a bit more feedback from the lgbt task force, so it's to try and present it on our own end and hopefully in the future, move it forward as even something that we use across the entire board.
We of course want you to please review and let us know what you think of this individual resolution.
I think a lot of people have realized that it is, quite frankly, not gonna present many of the resolutions that we would like to see, and I think that there's a bit more of a conversation needs to be had in regards to the passage of such legislation.
It is essentially referring to a language that was previously voted on and supports, making sure that we are allocating money in the city's budget so as to ensure that we're providing any refugees that are potentially moved to new york city as a result of the federal government's responses you know so as to get essentially aid.
In the event that happens, we saw that in the aftermath of hurricane maria that had left a number of recently resettled refugees and immigrants seeking opportunities that were not necessarily being made available, and so this is just continuing that kind of work that we've already presented prior to everyone, and we just want to make sure that everyone is aware that this is now going to be essentially passed for this board.
Thank you at home, okay, thank you, quick question or observation scenario or two of them going through the resolution.
So are you asking then and correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like then an amendment and if there's specific language that you would like to use, then just let me know I mean I'm more than happy to try and well.
So, if you're going to make, if you're going to cite that statistic, I would suggest breaking it down so that we have a better sense of what the experience of native born is by race, so that at least you know we can get a sense of if foreign-born are experiencing things similar to native borns, who are of color or if across the board, the experience is dramatically different, all right yeah I mean I just want to point out one thing.
Okay, so again, it just seems like you want an amendment to include further language and just another, whereas yeah I mean basically you're saying it verbally, just whatever you're saying just add it as a, whereas to the resolution, okay, all right and being that it's okay, I'm sorry to jump in here, but I think the reason why wayne is not giving you specific language.
I think it sounds as if we're going to have to just make a vote, because it's an amendment, no it's a friendly amendment, if you're good for that, you can just you can just put that in you can accept an additional whereas, yes, because the amen, the amendment that wayne is proposing is not anything that changes that materially changes the resolution, it's a it's a modification as to form to clarify the language that follows he's not proposing a substantive change, even though it's a bunch of words.
Before we move on to our next public safety, no landing news, yeah wayne you're next, the resolution on the board of standards and appeals.
Okay, so thank you eliezer, so the I think I've spoken on two prior occasions about this board of standards and appeals special permit, nc8 zoning districts, schools, residential community facility uses are not permitted as of right, so the washington heights inwood community music charter school, which is currently actually co-located on in a public school ms.
The community board passed a resolution asking the department of city planning to in fact, rezone most or all c8.
Finally, by dep the transportation studies, including any traffic mitigation, has to be signed off by dot the board of standards and appeals will not issue a special permit until you know both dep and dht provide their sign offs at the june committee.
We have steve simon, steve simon, you mean the steve simon, hello, yes, steve, you're, okay wayne is a very good resolution.
This is obviously another one of those issues that is a byproduct of what's been happening around the country, as people begin to think about reimagining public safety reimagining, our community policing, we're not advocating for a lack of resources, we're advocating for budget equity, and we really believe that there's a way to you know to support our community maintain public safety with a certain amount of money and being cut from the budget.
I debated that myself for several days thinking that it would be moved because the action had already occurred, but I felt it was still important for us to to show our support for its repeal and also to reinforce our commitment to the issue and also it also mentions several other issues as well such as you know, you know overall, reform efforts in general, so there are tons of reform efforts happening right now at the state level, and I did mention a few of them in the reso, so we can add additional language to clarify.
You know expectations, but I do think it was important to just move forward with the resolution because it was discussed in committee and our committee voted, so I don't want to make a decision to not write it after we had already voted on it at our community level right.
Yes, okay, yes, I can most certainly do that, and I can accept that as an amendment, meaning that, on whatever day the state legislature, the governor signed this and choosing yeah he's got it right.
That is exactly what I was going to say and in terms of a specific language suggestion there would be a where an additional, whereas I would add it as the last, whereas on whatever the date was the legislature passed whatever the legislation number was with the senate and the assembly same as, and the governor signed it and then changed the there now, therefore be it resolved to, instead of encouraging them to pass applaud them for having taken that action, and then everything else in the rezzo should be fine, to the extent that it's calling on them to take positions on other things.
There were two people, I'm sorry you're breaking up yeah kind of like he was talking about the resolution.
So while this is next or you said, someone else, hey guys curtis, thank you for all the work you've been doing and and for doing two resolutions, and probably fifty I know, there's a lot of public safety issues and I'm sorry about throwing another one at you and also kind of like aligns in parallels with parks.
Excuse me, but just like overall just the incident is just bizarre and eerie, so just wanted to just comment on it: yeah, okay!
I had something else to add, but okay, so that incident actually happened on the morning of our of our committee meeting.
I think you know there's obviously a lot going on and it's you know it's a very challenging charging charge time for all of us, and I think we are all learning new details about everything that's going on in the community, including the you know, the fireworks and other issues each day, everything's changing you know.
I think it's too easy to just say, cut a billion dollars without really knowing where it's going to come from, and it seems like this is really a pretty deep cut to to the agency, and I think we need to have more.
Okay, so you have an opportunity to vote yes or no so whatever, and then I also have an opportunity to voice my opinion, which I just did yes, thank you yeah.
There are many elected officials that have these same ideas and so we're sort of just reiterating things that have already been mentioned by partners that doesn't make it right, yeah and also I just want to actually also thank you to my thank you danielle for adding that okay.
So it's almost it's just kindly just to raise your hand and just wait for your turn, because I'm getting four five six people at the same time speaking so, let's just kind of like you know, go back to bases and just speak once at a time, paul curtis.
I wanted to ask mr chair for the office staff that, when we send out a notice about to change the method of operations that this be more specific, in the sense that, if you're going to ask for the committee to request or to allow perhaps a dj karaoke, that this be stated because oftentimes, it's just in general terms about math operations, and that covers a lot of different items.
So we would like the staff to be more specific when we send out the public notice, but you know we can work with them.
So, as you stated, we have resolutions for march that were passed by committee, but not by the general board meeting.
We want to hear like face to face what you know.
Mr chair just wanted to thank rosie for submitting the minutes for june very helpful.
Thank you so, okay, I guess oc, doesn't have a question anymore, so liz and then steven speak simon, sorry, yeah, thank you isidro for your work on all of these resolutions and thank you rosie for your minutes.
So you know, then time is an issue here, so we should proceed with it assistant, okay, all right, then let me let me ask you about, I, don't I don't.
so, on your first question, number six and you're referring to for june right no march the six.
Then they will request later on when that party is completed for the hours they're going to operate outside the hours that they requested of for 4 am has to deal with the inside once and if that will be approved, the patio enclosure, they will come back to the community report to request specific hours for the patio, okay, very good and number 17.
Well, somebody did that same for you I'll, try and look at it during the meeting, but I don't I don't know if I'll have time to vote on these resolutions, questions ones, questions.
My favorite part, yes, sir dude, okay, so you're going to be voting on lettered resolutions, a through f and then there are a bunch of licensing resolutions.
I am referring to them by number so for june, there's licensing one two, three, five, six and eight numbers four and seven were withdrawn, and then, for march we have licensing 1 through 11 and 14 through 17, and I am referring to those by licensing march and the number so we're licensing june and the number licensing march and the number one quick thing ariel is back on ariely wanted to say something: liz based on the friendly amendment that steve, oh, yes, yeah.
I was I'm a little confused about the licensing, I'm trying to look at the general meeting agenda and seeing, if I have it straight okay, but it sounds like there are several people who didn't get the or who can't easily access the agenda for the march items.
In the meantime, people can look at an email from paula on june 17th at 2 16 p.m. June 17th at 2, 16 p.m. Just this morning at 11 06 for the march items that was just separately right today at 1106 from chanel barbara, this morning's email, where it says, there's an image with the agenda and the second page of the second image under the june includes numbers one through eleven, okay, the.
Yes, we are okay, all right, so the committee is still working on trying to see what we can do to these.
We have daryl and jay with questions yeah hi, just one quick statement, mary, I know when I was at the transportation committee meeting.
So I don't know who's communicating with the front desk, but they may want to talk to them about that.
It appears that there are two different versions of the march items and some versions have it incorrect as 4020a broadway and some versions have it correct as 4020a 10th avenue, everyone should be advised that it's 4020a 10th avenue broadway one is wrong, but thank you for pointing that out and if anybody has the broadway address just know that it's 10th avenue.
Yes, thank you wayne, yes to all, except for the june licensing yeah.
What I heard was yes to all, except what I would like you to tell me is: I got that I'm telling you now okay, so it was yes to all, except for the june licensing.
Thank you yes, yeah.
Okay, so just to be clear here is how I would like people to give me their votes.
I was using you as an example, so you are voting no on june six and eight no on march 9, 10, 11 14 and yes to the rest.
Okay, so no on june 8, yes to the rest, correct!

The overall problem with the health disparities- and we will continue to look at it, but we tend to pass resolutions that are specifically targeted to situations and- and I think, on the whole, on the balance, our committee has been dealing with providing arguing and advocating for for making sure that we have appropriate medical care for all of the people who live in washington heights and inward all right.
Okay, yes, thank you, mr chairman.
What community board for john may, you know working on the transmission making all this possible and and all of you for even taking time and watching those videos other than that.
So they need to come to us to talk about september, and I will say, I think I know ebenezer provided information on this, but just in terms of the 181 busway.
You know a sort of public input of all kinds and sort of a yeah, and but we don't- I at least have not heard any timing on it.
I was on you know, we were talking to them and I think the timing of us being on the short list again.
People in your buildings who may be in need right now we're giving away substantial boxes of dried goods and fresh produce, and it's something that we hope to start this thursday and continue going forward and the one thing that hasn't been discussed as much today that I would just put on everybody's radar from our work in the senator's office.
I just want to say thank you, chris I'm going to be reaching out myself as that's personal, that's going to be a lot of me yeah!
So if folks would like me to share that, I can do so as I always do with ebenezer, and I also wanted to say that we had a tenants rights forum or a few of them in which people got to ask questions to a legal aid attorney this summer.
But I would like to say thank you so much all for having me here for being patient as well as listening to my report, and I will be in some committee meetings over the summer, but we'll definitely see you all, hopefully in person in the fall.
Where the same thing is happening, so I just want to flag that so that we can open up a conversation not now, but during a during the next committee meeting for either parks or public safety, because I do think that something needs to be addressed in that regard.
Thank you, liz for coming to help me on wednesday at 1 p.m. You know anybody that needs food.
