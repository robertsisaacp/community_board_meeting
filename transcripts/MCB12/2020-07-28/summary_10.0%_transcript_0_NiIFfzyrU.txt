And there are many people that come from outside the community to make noise in front of restaurants.
I have a short video which should be played during the public session, since it relates to noise, correct So. As folks who have seen the agenda tonight, we have a presentation from dr wendy chung from columbia, university, medical center related to the Covid-19 recovery corps and they'll be talking about a new research initiative related to Covid-19, And I.
Their issues and they've been helping us to design a study to look at individuals who have previously been infected and understand, as I said, differences both how long it takes for people to recover and then the symptoms that seem to recover faster and those that aren't recovering so quickly and long.
In addition to that, it may be issues in terms of access to care being able to get to doctors being able to get to medicines continuing to need to work, not having access to healthy, food, all sorts of stressors that we might have and understanding these contributors is important to us.
Ago, we had so little testing available that we've had many people who thought they were sick, but we don't really know for sure if it was Covid-19 , The main goal is, as I said, to understand how people are recovering and whether or not this is any different.
Who can be able to give permission for themselves and that think they've had Covid-19 19 because again we're looking for people who are positive, who actually were infected in the past, and then we can check and see how they're recovering, as I said, because many people may have even mild symptoms.
Well, first of all, I think it's important If we're having a discussion about covert 19, that we recognize the fact that 914 people in our community have died as of today from this disease, we should not.
That, obviously, is right next to us, at columbia, I wanted to make sure had first dibs, so to speak, that they knew about it and were aware of the opportunity, remembering also, though, that people don't have to take the blood test or the test in general to be part of this.
We want to put that information together on as many as people as quickly as possible, because we obviously want people to recover and, as I said, before, I think colombia, unfortunately, having had the first wave first is going to have a lot that we can teach the rest of the world.
But, what partnerships are you utilizing or leveraging to ensure that you are getting that diversity of people that you're looking for and understanding that the black american and the hispanic american community have been disproportionately impacted by kobe Spanish version is in the process of being approved by the irb, so they are looking at the translation to make sure that everything is exactly as it should.
I'm hoping we'll be able to launch that within the next two weeks in spanish, but everything has been translated and I said with the irb: we've had many community partners, alianza, dominicana, rafael antigua, has been one of our partners in terms of thinking.
The second part of things, though, was that who got infected those individuals who already had issues like diabetes or who had heart disease, even people who didn't know they had those conditions or even people who may not have been overtly diabetic but may have had some pre-diabetes.
But yes, I'm looking forward to is there is any particular you know, kind of behavior that this community are achieving things that they are not doing, and this is exactly what I wanted just to find out, because I heard that, but I've been wondering until now that you kindly you know, have responded.
Certainly that captures all of community boards, 9, 10, 11 and 12, and I would think you want to take.
As wendy said this 25 mile radius, well, certainly gail brewer's office can be of you know: assistance to you and pulling together the Manhattan community, boards.
I know that dr alexander melamed at the medical center and the medical school has done research looking at why black and brown communities are disproportionately affected and has tied that directly to their living, situation.
I think one of the things that colombia has been working on very diligently in the hospital is about healthcare, equity access and justice, and so I think we've got lots of new resources available that are going to be very useful to the community in that way, and then I guess just one more quick, thing.
I mean I, know that data like on a city, level, But I, think it'd be really helpful for us, as a community board, to see where we have these hot points and to be able to potentially do education around that yep.
There are all sorts of databases that link to different factors with social determinants of health that you can start to tease apart some of these various factors, and so we're looking forward to being able to do that and get into like, I said, even more granular data, and if members of the board can help us in terms of analyzing the data learning from that data and then disseminating that information back to the community.
Next wednesday august, the 5th with the borough president's office and the other upper Manhattan boards to talk about the columbia university's plans to reopen and will include a discussion about covert, 19 and quote helping communities.
Thank you so much, mr chair, and thanks to cb12, who, my goodness, I think, you've been probably the most out front of any community board and focusing on the pandemic for months on end and, unfortunately.
You know help out the community And I asked members of the facebook group to participate in a short data study, so I had people track from July 17th through the 25th.
I want to remind folks, too, that we are having a full public hearing to actually dig in deeper and have, I think, more robust, conversation, ideas.
I also had some concerns about the noise For those of you who don't know she's an environmental psychologist who is on the board of grow, NYC she's been she's been appointed to that position under five different mares and her work in anti-noise advocacy, Actually started in inwood at p.s 98 in the 70s.
Another was a fight where somebody got knocked to the ground and wasn't getting up and another was a man and a woman fighting over a gun, and she confirmed that there is a link between noise and crime, and she said that when you give license to violate the noise ordinances, you give license to break all laws and she was concerned about what is going on in the neighborhood, and she has agreed to work with us and with respect the group for respectful decibel levels to get these noise issues resolved up.
And I just want people to know that she has agreed to speak at our hearing next week.
What are you guys, as community board members, doing to help us out, because there's only so much that we can do and we're all extremely frustrated, and I just want to know what actions are being taken specifically also for spanish speakers.
Seeing on the screen that you may not know that are actual neighbors of yours, The biggest limitation of not being in person right now is that hearing is going to be in english right, and so we are leaving out a fundamental major part of our community, which is spanish-speaking elders, who are deeply impacted by all of the quality of life issues that we spoken about, tonight, And, so I think it does push us to go into the drawing board and thinking about how we can make it accessible, not just for spanish-speaking folks, but just in general, accessible for those and gen who have different issues and challenges in terms of the virtual english space.
We've asked why we they have much more proximity to the people who make these decisions than we do as community board members.
Are they going to do to work with this community board to make sure that we address these issues and get a resolution?
Anybody that was has lived here for 30 40 years can never remember the noise and public dis disturbance are as bad as the early 90s when people were starting to become concerned about living in this wonderful community, which still remains to be a wonderful community.
And I'm, going to ask our leadership as a lifelong resident and for people that have can't speak right now to please don't abandon us and step up here and take care of business.
What I think is that a small number of individuals and groups are victimizing most of us and are making this beautifully diverse community divided, and I really want to foster a sense of community so that we all fight for what is right and for condition living conditions that are healthy for all of us, and you know the last thing is that we need to address this noise issue as a public health issue and as environmental and environmental justice, issues.
She actually wanted to speak today, but she was worried that she might not have somebody to translate for her mother passed away her 83 year old, mother, passed away after having an anxiety attack from the fireworks on July, 4th, So I just think that is, I can't imagine if my parents passed away, survive Covid-19 but pass away from the fireworks, and she said you know if I go into the community.
And I walk through the street, and, I, see I pass people I realize I'm talking a long time, but I want to thank you very much for holding the public hearing.
I hope that we can do something to reach out more to the spanish-speaking community as well, and I really just want to.
I have I've been living in this community, All, my life literally I'm 29, since I was born, And, I, think I'm listening to a lot of the the public speak and a lot of what you guys have to say and what it is What's going on a national level, the police.
We have several hands from board members, so barbara will be the first one, because you know I think.
Also an issue and, and those two in particular not to mention many of I want to say thank you, keep talking because you're having thank you so new business before we called the meeting to order sally The first.
I appreciate the board setting up a public hearing about the noise violence and the health risks associated with that.
If, you are a member of community board The vote.
That, being said, I, believe that, in the context of the august 4th hearing of noise complaints that we should have this be a part of the discussion and possibly representation to people who can speak to this.
Movement These, two issues of the police of black of the of the movement- You know: noise, complaints.
You know arresting people for these infractions, but to fix what happened, but to figure out a way to think of this holistically and come up with a solution that is transformative and restorative at the same time, but also holding the NYPD accountable for their lack of interest in engaging in this conversation and their lack of response to this particular issue, not just the mayor, but the mayor, the NYPD, our local elected officials and even our community board.
I wanted to say that I agree with curtis and hearing that people were calling the police on people who are making noise I think we should work on finding an alternative to that I hope he is, but he said that the reason why there's a rise in noise complaints is because of black lives matter.
They are the people who are responsible for them, they're, the ones that carry noise permits Let everybody know that, with the last couple hundred bucks that the community board had in fiscal.
