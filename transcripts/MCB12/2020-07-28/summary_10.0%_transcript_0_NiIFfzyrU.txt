Then compliance and a lot of people come from outside to make this noise, and it's really annoying- I have a short video which should be played during the public session, since it relates to noise, correct So. As folks who have seen the agenda tonight, we have a presentation from dr wendy chung from columbia, university, medical center related to the Covid-19 recovery corps and they'll be talking about a new research initiative related to Covid-19 and I.
We would pay for all of this and share information back with each individual participant, as well as what we're learning as a community, sharing that back through forums like this, but also through newsletters and other email alerts, and updates to do this We're thinking about doing it on a scale, and we have the support already to do this for 11 000 members of our community Testing from home So phase one-- and this, which is a critically important test, is to think take what we think will be about a thousand people where we can take samples, blood samples, but also a sample that would be easy to collect from home, something like a saliva bowl or something where you would prick your finger and put a spot of blood on a blood filter card But, something again you could do from home without having to go Get blood drawn so in phase one we're going to be having individuals where we compare what happens when we measure from a blood drawn in the regular way from a finger stick or from a saliva sample, but once we know that test with home testing works, then we can get kits out to on the community and, Covid-19 recovery core, which is up on the upper left here.
Like I said a blood spot, or else one of these saliva samples The whole point, though, is to learn along the way, and as we do this we're going to be having videos that are on the website community board meetings, newsletters that are going to go out, but as soon as we know, you'll know as well These are the just examples of the test report: It's the same test report that I myself have gotten the right results and, as I said, we're getting these results out quickly to people so I'll wrap up here, but just to say and give credit to survivor corps which has been one of the community groups.
We have curtis stephen sally, just whoever hasn't said anything put those first and then those who have already spoken then puts us on the second tier, well steve, all right, Well, first of all, I think it's important that, if we're having a discussion about covert 19, that we recognize the fact that 914 people in our community have died as of today from this disease, we should not.
I should mention I'm, the chair of the health and environment committee and I'm sure that my committee and personally I would like to be able to work with you on this project First of all, thank you, dr trump, for that thorough presentation, My, question is:: how are you all doing, you're conducting your outreach in the non-speaking parts of the community What partnerships are you utilizing or leveraging to ensure that you are getting that diversity of people that you're looking for and understanding that the black american and the hispanic american community have been disproportionately impacted by kobe?
I'm hoping we'll be able to launch that within the next two weeks in spanish, but everything has been translated and I said, with the irb: we've had many community partners, alianza, dominicana, rafael antigua, has been one of our partners in terms of thinking of I, would say, sort of the north of columbia and then south of columbia, harlem hospital, as well as many of our faith-based organizations, our community health care worker, core we've tried to reach out to many individuals and I have heard this before as well- that minority like african-americans spanish These, are the community that has been more affected, and this is something that I constantly it's not the first time that I hear it only for you, but for other folks as well- is at this point, you may have any idea.
You I, don't know if you mentioned this, but you mentioned in the presentation that one of the factors that might contribute to folks being more predisposed to getting the to getting Covid-19 is not having an insurance or access to medical care One of the things that I think is good about this is that at least for the first thousand people we'll actually get the chance to meet them, so we'll be personally I.
I mean I know that data like on a city level but I think it'd be really helpful for us, as a community board, to see where we have these hot points and to be able to potentially do education around that yep.
Some of these various factors, and so we're looking forward to being able to do that and get into like I, said even more granular data and if members of the board can help us in terms of analyzing the data learning from that data and then disseminating that information back to the community, I've got your name down kelly's, going to be all over that great and also the school of public health might also be able to assist you because absolutely we have their internships and great suggestions.
So we've already got a whole core of people that have been part of that in terms of helping us think about how to design this So, you can contact the community board office to get contact information for, and there are a number of tenant advocacy organizations So we're going to open up to the public captain one second I lost the screen for a second, oh, we actually don't in terms of the q, a chat you mean regarding the presentation you know like.
Who is a professor at the school of public health and has been on the university's Covid-19 task force, I'm glad to hear because I didn't know that was finalized with community board 12 Mark?
Racing We got to fix our testing, which is taking far too long in most cases and is again leaving communities of color behind So. Let's take this time not to rest on our laurels, but to do the hard work to get ready for the fall to address inequity and to build our public health infrastructure Obviously, here as a partner for you throughout as long as this pandemic lasts and we're more than once, there's any additional literature for the community, we'll be happy to put that out, along with the website, as I shared in the q a so next up on It's, not necessarily on the agenda but related to obviously public session tonight and a lot of what started our meeting Let you introduce jen, who will be speaking for about five minutes before we usher in the brief public session, and she has done some interesting work on her own to analyze, 311 complaints generated from our community during a specific period in july.
Think that's a great first step for us to really get all of this out there So I, that's the data I collected and I know that we've been we've been coming up with some other solutions we actually accomplished from the community sat in with senator jackson Last week he had a center at your corner and he seemed very open to the idea of having a town hall having these discussions creating a coalition to try to deal with some of these issues.
Gonna have a hearing next week in which, given that everything is on the agenda and given that is already presented to the board prior to is shown again so moving forward For those of you who don't know she's an environmental psychologist who is on the board of grow, actually started in inwood at ps 98 in the 70s One of the questions that she asked me was about crime in the neighborhood and if that's been on the rise lately- and for my personal experience for the locations that are recurring noise issues on my block.
Another was a fight where somebody got knocked to the ground and wasn't getting up and another was a man and a woman fighting over a gun, and she confirmed that there is a link between noise and crime, and she said that when you give license to violate the noise ordinances, you give license to break all laws and she was concerned about what is going on in the neighborhood and I just want people to know that she has agreed to speak at our hearing next week.
So there's a lot of people What are you guys, as community board members, doing to help us out, because there's only so much that we can do and we're all extremely frustrated and I just want to know what actions are being taken specifically also for spanish speakers?
Space, though, is that it's a great bridge in being able to understand like who is in decision making powers within different city agencies, but also hearing who else and who else you're Seeing on the screen that you may not know that are actual neighbors of yours, The biggest limitation of not being in person right now is that hearing is going to be in english right, and so we are leaving out a fundamental major part of our community, which is spanish-speaking elders, who are deeply impacted by all of the quality of life.
and I agree with daryl that we need to start to ask the public, the elected officials why there have been, and I only got one response, and that was from senator jackson, office- We've asked why we they have much more proximity to the people who make these decisions than we do as community board members To address this issue.
I have tried to address it on both of my committees, from health and environment, to the business development Are they going to do to work with this community board to make sure that we address these issues and get a resolution?
but it is culture where it contributes to the cultural life of the city and it when it's used to foster community building, So I think ending noise pollution is basically about justice because we all deserve to live in an environment that is healthy and just speaking of impact on a personal level.
We lost so many people in new york What I think is that a small number of individuals and groups are victimizing most of us and are making this beautifully diverse community divided and I really want to foster a sense of community so that we all fight for what is right and for condition living conditions that are healthy for all of us, and you know the last thing is that we need to address this noise issue as a public health issue and as environmental and environmental justice issues.
Just think that is I can't imagine if my parents passed away, survive Covid-19 but pass away from the fireworks, and she said you know if I go into the community and I walk through the street and I see I pass people I realize I'm talking a long time, but I want to thank you very much for holding the public hearing.
A lady mentioned that it's a cultural divide and it is most dominicans like to be downstairs and listen to their music, but it's not going to stop and unless we put different political leaders in and stop political movements that have that tie the hands of police that aren't able to enforce these laws, we have several hands from board members, so barbara will be the first one because you know I think if you've already spoken, we have a lot to speak about next week.
That resolution needs advocacy There are any questions about which resolution that is I have no problem, providing that That being said, I believe that, in the context of the august 4th hearing of noise complaints that we should have this be a part of the discussion and possibly representation to people who can speak to this I did a training with the defund police movement.
You know arresting people for these infractions, but to fix what happened, but to figure out a way to think of this holistically and come up with a solution that is transformative and restorative at the same time, but also holding the NYPD accountable for their lack of interest in engaging in this conversation and their lack of response to this particular issue, not just the mayor, but the mayor, the NYPD, our local elected officials and even our community board.
