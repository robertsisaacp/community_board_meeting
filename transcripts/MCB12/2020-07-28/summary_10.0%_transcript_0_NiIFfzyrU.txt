I just wanted to mention that at our last health and Environment Committee meeting, we had a very robust meeting about fireworks and the noise that creates, as well as subsequently people just hang out, while they're shooting the fireworks and after and create the noise, and One is to thank tanya for spearheading.
And there are many people that come from outside the community to make noise in front of restaurants.
I, have a short video which should be played during the public session, since it relates to noise, correct So. As folks who have seen the agenda tonight, we have a presentation from Dr Wendy Chung from Columbia University, Medical, Center related to the Covid-19 recovery corps and they'll be talking about a new research initiative related to Covid-19, And I.
I've been working with a group, that's called themselves survivor core and they've called themselves long- Their issues and they've been helping us to design a study to look at individuals who have previously been infected and understand, as I said, differences both how long it takes for people to recover and then the symptoms that seem to recover faster and those that are not recovering so quickly and long.
In addition to that, it may be issues in terms of access to care being able to get to doctors being able to get to medicines continuing to need to work, not having access to healthy, food, all sorts of stressors that we might have and understanding these contributors is important to us.
Ago, we had so little testing available that we've had many people who thought they were sick, but we do not really know for sure if it was Covid-19 , The main goal is, as I said, to understand how people are recovering and whether or not this is any different.
We need to check in the blood for antibodies and see who was tested and then once we know who was tested that allows us to then go forward to know who's getting better and to be able to make sure that we know that it was Covid-19 related realizing that this is something that we wanted to offer free to the community.
We've wanted to allow people to do testing from home, and What I mean by that is, you do not have to miss work.
The eligibility criteria are pretty straightforward, it's adults, so it's individuals, 18 or older, who can sign, who can be able to give permission for themselves and that think they've had Covid-19 Because again we're looking for people who are positive, who actually were infected in the past, and then we can check and see how they're recovering, as I said, because many people may have even mild symptoms.
Well, first of all, I think it's important If we're having a discussion about Covid-19 that we recognize the fact that 914 people in our community have died.
What partnerships are you utilizing or leveraging to ensure that you are getting that diversity of people that you're looking for and understanding that the black American and the hispanic american community have been disproportionately impacted by Kobe The?
Of, I would say, sort of the North of Columbia and then South of Columbia Harlem hospital, as well as many of our faith- based organizations, our community health care, worker, core we've tried to reach out to many individuals, but I'm sure we're not finished, and I'm sure this is going to still for Covid-19.
Second part of things, though, was that who got infected those individuals who already had issues like diabetes or who had heart disease, even people who did not know they had those conditions or even people who may not have been overtly diabetic but may have had some pre- diabetes.
But yes, I'm looking forward to is there is any particular you know, kind of behavior that this community are achieving things, that they are not doing, and this is exactly what I wanted just to find out, because I heard that, but I've been wondering until now that you kindly you know, have responded.
As Wendy said this 25 mile radius, well, certainly Gail brewer's office can be of you know: assistance to you and pulling together the Manhattan community, boards.
I know that Dr Alexander melamed at the medical center and the medical school has done research looking at why black and brown communities are disproportionately affected and has tied that directly to their living, situation.
How many generations might be living in a household and also the controller, has done a report on the number of essential workers by Community, Board district And, I think acrosss, the city We're number four in terms of having the num the highest number of essential workers.
I think one of the things that Colombia has been working on very diligently in the hospital is about Healthcare, equity access and justice, and so I think we've got lots of new resources available that are going to be very useful to the community in that way, and then I guess just one more quick, thing.
I mean I know that data like on a city, level, But I, think it'd be really helpful for us, as a community board, to see where we have these hot points and to be able to potentially do education around that yep.
Looking forward to being able to do that and get into like, I said, even more granular data, and if members of the board can help us in terms of analyzing the data learning from that data and then disseminating that information back to the community.
Following up on the point that wayne raised earlier about reaching out to our adjacent community boards, we're going to be co, sponsoring an event with Columbia next Wednesday August, the 5th with the borough president's office and the other upper Manhattan boards to talk about the Columbia University's plans to reopen and will include a discussion about Covid-19 and quote helping communities.
I'm glad to hear, because I did not know that was finalized with community Board, 12 Thank, you so much Mr chair and thanks to CB12, who, my goodness, I think, you've been probably the most out front of any community board and focusing on the pandemic for months on end and, unfortunately.
And we're more than once, there's any additional literature for the community, we'll be happy to put that out, along with the website, as I shared in Next up on it's not necessarily on the agenda but related to obviously public session tonight and a lot of what started our meeting.
You know for the noise issues that we've been having our neighborhood and, as you guys have all stated- This is nothing new, it's not just the quarantine, but it definitely has had an uptick.
You know help out the community And I asked members of the Facebook group to participate in a short data study, so I had people track from July 17th through the 25th.
And I had complaints coming in you know all times of the day from people all over.
I want to remind folks, too, that we are having a full public hearing to actually dig in deeper and have, I think, more robust, conversation, ideas.
Okay, I think it is extremely uncalled for that happened in the community But we're going to have we're going to have a hearing next week in which, given that everything is on the agenda and given that is already presented to the board prior to is shown again so moving forward.
I also had some concerns about the noise And I was talking to Dr Arlene bronzeft today, for those of you who do not know she's an environmental psychologist who is on the board of grow, NYC she's been she's, been appointed to that position under five different mares and her work in anti , noise advocacy actually started in Inwood at P.S 98 in the 70s.
Another was a fight where somebody got knocked to the ground and was not getting up and another was a man and a woman fighting over a gun, and she confirmed that there is a link between noise and crime, and she said that when you give license to violate the noise ordinances, you give license to break all laws and she was concerned about what is going on in the neighborhood She has agreed to work with us and with respect the group for respectful decibel levels to get these noise issues resolved up.
And I just want people to know that she has agreed to speak at our hearing next week.
What are you guys, as community board members, doing to help us out, because there's only so much that we can do and we're all extremely frustrated, and I just want to know what actions are being taken specifically also for spanish speakers.
If I could, because I have not spoken as a member to add to Lyanna's point- is community boards do not play an enforcement role right, so we can't force NYPD city hall, any city agency in general.
Seeing on the screen that you may not know that are actual neighbors of yours, The biggest limitation of not being in person right now is that hearing is going to be in English right, and so we are leaving out a fundamental major part of our community, which is spanish- speaking elders, who are deeply impacted by all of the quality of life issues that we spoken about, tonight, And, so I think it does push us to go into the drawing board and thinking about how we can make it accessible, not just for spanish- speaking folks, but just in general, accessible for those and Gen who have different issues and challenges in terms of the virtual english space.
: What: are they going to do to work with this community board to make sure that we address these issues and get a resolution?
Anybody that was has lived here for 30:40 years can never remember the noise and public dis disturbance are as bad as the early 90s when people were starting to become concerned about living in this wonderful community, which still remains to be a wonderful community.
What I think is that a small number of individuals and groups are victimizing most of us and are making this beautifully diverse community divided, and I really want to foster a sense of community so that we all fight for what is right and for condition living conditions that are healthy for all of us, and you know the last thing is that we need to address this noise issue as a public health issue and as environmental and environmental justice, issues.
She actually wanted to speak today, but she was worried that she might not have somebody to translate for her mother passed away her 83 year old, mother, passed away after having an anxiety attack from the fireworks on July, 4th, So I just think that is, I can't imagine if my parents passed away, survive Covid-19 but pass away from the fireworks, and she said you know if I go into the community.
And I walk through the street, and, I, see I pass people I realize I'm talking a long time, but I want to thank you very much for holding the public hearing.
I hope that we can do something to reach out more to the spanish- speaking community as well, and I really just want to.
I have I've been living in this community, All, my life literally I'm 29, since I was born, And, I, think I'm listening to a lot of the the public speak and a lot of what you guys have to say and what it is What's going on a national level, the police.
The people who are supposed to enforce the laws are not there because their hands are tied, so it becomes a problem where none of us can solve it right because it comes from a part of this system that is almost unreachable for us, because the media, our political leaders, are all backing this movement to defund the police.
We have several hands from board members, so Barbara will be the first one, because you know I think.
Yes, I, believe a man who spoke a few ago about the party outside of his house and how winds radio is picking up on it and that they're going to bring De Blasio to task Is, really the essence of the problem, because the police, who are generally the enforcer who engage in enforcement, work at the behest of the civil authorities and take their marching orders from the civil authorities, for example, of that Is. The ending of stop and frisk at the direction of the mayor.
Also an issue and, and those two in particular not to mention many of I want to say thank you, keep talking because you're having thank you so new business before we called the meeting to order Sally The first.
I appreciate the board setting up a public hearing about the noise violence and the health risks associated with that.
Several people may address this noise, the quality of life issue complaint, and there was a young man who spoke, and I just wanted to clarify a few of his statements.
I'll turn off my, but when I like hearing people say that they were calling I'm, Now much better, I wanted to say that I agree with curtis and hearing that people were calling the police on people who are making noise I think we should work on finding an alternative to that I hope he is, but he said that the reason why there's a rise in noise complaints is because of black lives matter.
They are the people who are responsible for them, they're, the ones that carry noise permits I just want to let everybody know that.
