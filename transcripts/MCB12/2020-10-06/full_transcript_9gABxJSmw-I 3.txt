All right there we go so we're going to get paula, you could get started. You could get started, give him what we we're doing on youtube now we're streaming already you're live on youtube right. Thank you. Thank you all right, so so yeah. Those were my welcome remarks. The only modification that I would say we need on the agenda is a committee business, adding I sent over some files. As far as like the ranking the committee priorities. I do not know if you all saw it yeah. I saw that yeah, so I would make that number four under committee business. That's the only modification needed. This is a perfect time if any of the small business owners have would like to speak first due to time to be able to switch it up now. But as of now, we have Jennifer Wilson from sisters, uptown Bookstore, first Tara wally from Hilltop Park, Hill House and then followed by Peter Walsh from Coogans hi, I'm Jennifer Wilson, Keeper of the space sisters, uptown bookstore and cultural center. We're located at 19th century. Give me one second we'll get to you in a second. Let me just get the agenda approved yeah. We have to motion to adopt agenda with the modification. All right are you all in favor? Oh, I need a second yeah, just a second. Nobody wants a second older notice. I'm going to give this a try, a second as my first time. Ah there we go okay, cool I'll, put that down in the minutes, all right all in favor. Yes, there you go opposed abstain. All right motion passes awesome now back to the business owner testimony. This is basically a space that we introduced this year to make sure that we hear from those directly in the on the on the on the front lines. Just because there's a lot of misconceptions around what people want what people need and that usually gets lost with the messenger. So this is a perfect time to be able to hear from those again in the front line and being able to provide what type of advocacy work where what type of direction do we need to be advocating more effectively on, and what do you hold important and what are some areas you're having difficulty with and seeing? How we could function as a bridge with other city agencies to make sure that the proper resources are distributed equitably amongst the community, small business owners, and with that said, I would like to matter of fact tanya. Yes, I would say moderate this portion of it, since these were a lot of people that you brought and you were acquainted with so just moderate, this portion of it. Let me know if you need an e- sport. Okay, thank you! Okay! Well, first, we have Jennifer Wilson of Sister's uptown bookstore. You know I really wanted to hear from Jennifer for many reasons, one I you know she's in the lower part of Washington Heights and we wanted to kind of bring that voice out, as we've all talked about as you've talked about the bingo in terms of bringing everybody to the table. So we wanted to do that and she also has been you know, really doing a lot in terms of their online book club events over the summer. So you know they're finding ways to get in there. So I just wanted to hear from Jennifer, so you can go ahead Jennifer. I do not want to take up your space and welcome to the Business Development Committee. Thank you. Actually, our business opened about 20 years ago, January of 2000, so we've been on this lower end for a long time making a difference in the community. We, our doors, were actually closed, March of 2020 and we actually did not get to open back up until May 28th, and that was as a result of us, realigning and recreating ourselves by embracing a online bookstore. The actual store itself was closed because of Covid-19 and the fact that businesses were closed. So we had no foot traffic and so we're actually closed. We did not receive any funds for the PPE, because we have no employees, it's my daughter and I and volunteers, so I did not qualify for any monies, and so we've just been by the grace of God holding on and it's a day at a time you know maintaining our existence in the community. I do not know about sustainability because of you know their the fact that we were closed. The fact that we were able to come back and the only funds that we received was a small grant from the hispanic federation society. We got a small grant from them, but basically our online store is the reason we still exist and then thank God for Community League of the heights. They launched a program over the summer where we've been doing virtual book clubs and so we'll be doing those book events through December of this year, and so it's been an interesting journey because you just do not know I they say we can reopen with 25, but we're not defined because we they say we're non- essential. So I do not know what 25 is that 25 square footage 25 of what? How many people is? That is that five people, two people, we really do not know it- has not been defined and there's been no one actually to tell us how we're to function moving forward. There's no communication from any agency in terms of how non- essentials or to move forward. So I do not know we're open now, but still curbside, pickup, wednesdays, Fridays and saturdays from one to five, and so that's the extent of how we're operating, because we have no communication with any agency. In terms of that they talk about restaurants. They talk about. You know other entities, but I've not heard about bookstores and how we're supposed to be functioning on this end of Washington Heights. We basically the most input we have is through cloth, there's no con connection to any other businesses. I do not know how how anybody else is functioning, we're just sort of down here finning for ourselves and not really sure, because I've talked to some of the other local business businesses and they're. Like me, they're not sure how we should be moving forward. Most of them are open six, seven days a week, we're surrounded on Amsterdam ave by Delis and grocery stores, beauty, parlors, barber shops. Those are basically that's the gist of the businesses on Amsterdam, unlike broadway. So the businesses on Amsterdam are not connected, we're not sure of direction. What anything means. So if there is a way that we can get connected and get info from the community board, it would be greatly appreciated because we're not certain in terms of sustainability, we're not certain of how we should be functioning. At this point, there's just a lot of uncertainty. There's a lot of questions you can reach out to 311, but they do not have the answers either. So we're down here functioning at the best. You know basically the best way that we can without a lot of resources and exchange of information and ideals, which is what our motto is for the bookstore. So I'm grateful that I was invited to this community board meeting tonight. Hopefully, the committee that you have now is new. I actually sat on the board for almost three years, some years ago, when Martin, Collins and Pam North and Maria Luna, those folk were on the board, even Mark Levine. That was the time that I was there for almost three years. I was a part of the Economic Development Committee, so the Business committee that you have now is something that I think can be instrumental in terms of helping with insight that you may have for some of the businesses on the lower end of Washington Heights great. Thank you jennifer Tanya. We have Francisco and I'll go after him on Stack right, yep, Francisco yeah, how you guys doing Jennifer. Did I get it right? Yes, I first want to apologize, because I had no idea. You guys existed and that's my fault. I should know that. Secondly, did you guys qualify for any small business loans from the SBA? No because I do not have employees. Okay, I'm only saying that, because I worked for myself and I was like pre- approved for loans for the SBA. I think that should be something you should look at again and lastly, what programs were you informed of besides the ppp that are that you might be able to qualify for, or is that, a source of any type of frustration? Yeah? I mostly dealt with the women's chamber of Commerce those programs that they were offering. So those are the ones that I applied for, but I did not hear anything back from any of them, so it may have been about five at least five that I applied for, but I did not hear anything interesting. Okay, hey Jennifer, how's it going so there was a uptown fund. Did you apply for that? I do not know about an uptown fund. It was basically done through Columbia, Presbyterian and man. Oh yeah, I did no did you get approved for that? No okay! I did not even hear back from them. Okay, because we've had several businesses raised the concern around all these resources and not being accessible. So we we're encouraging. I reached out to the hospital trying to see if they could schedule one of the individuals or the organization manage the fund to be able to break down for us what were their criterias? What were the like? Some of the factors that led to them being able to approve certain businesses for these grants and also who were these businesses so stay tuned for that because it's wonderful, that's it that's extremely important, particularly for a business. That's been working in our community for over 20 years. I think it says a lot and then my other question is as far as the virtual, because I seen the flyers is there: is there any way? Are you communicating with some of the schools to be able to incorporate some of the book club, programming and partner up with other individual schools? Well, the thing that's hindered me from getting into the school is that there they have certain requirements. You need a vendors, they already have their vendor vendors that they use. So that's been a drawback for us because we have not been able to get into schools there. One is one school which actually is not Washington Heights Hamilton Heights actually invited us in. We were able to do a book fair there. So most of the schools already have their vendors, and so it's been difficult for us to actually get into the local schools, because it looks like that's sort of a an institution that's already developed, so I do not know how to go around and become a new vendor with the board of Ed all right, and I could I could help you out with that. So I'll tell you just connect us via email, so we can start coming out. I've helped certain businesses get their DOE vendor, because it's just a number once you have that number. It opens up a lot of doors and a lot of different revenue streams Christina how you doing Jennifer my name is Christina nice to meet you and thank you for sharing your story. I just have a few questions. I firstly want to know: were you able to apply for the economic injury disaster loan, the Eidl loan? No, I did not know about that. One! Okay. My second question is this: may be a personal question if you're comfortable sharing, I would like to know how has rent been for you know, I'm sure it's been a little bit hard right all the time during the months that you were closed, so I'm wondering how has rent been for you and what kind of support have you gotten from your landlord? If any support well the when we opened up with the online store in may we made enough money to pay our back bills, and so that was not the rent. Thank God was not a problem because we made enough from May, I think, through about July 22nd, to pay our bills, so that was a blessing, but we at the building that I live in is cooperative. It's been in the community for about 40 years, so there was no problem in terms of the rents and maintenance, because folk were able to give reprieves based on you know the fact that we've been in the community, the we were close shut down and then we were trying to get monies from agencies in the community. So the building worked with us on that and then once we got our monies, we were able to take care of Con Edison the phone bill you could, we were able to make the deferred payments. You know you had to call everybody and say: listen, I'm closed right now I ca not pay my bills, but hopefully I'll be able to pay, and so folk work with this. Thank you for answering this question. Jennifer you're awesome. Thank you Jennifer. I do have a question for you. I want to this. I wanted to find out from you. What is it that you, if you could say the things that would make a difference for you right now as a small business owner like what kind of support that you actually need at the moment? What are those things? What was real key was the fact that I can now have the information shared to get the vendors licensed for the border bay, because I'm surrounded by schools- and I ca not do any business with them because I do not have the vendor license to get in the door, so that is, would be surmountable. For me to get that vendor's license, awesome, yeah and- and you talked about before- about being disconnected from other parts of the community- has that because I know you've been there for a while? Have you have there been other efforts to kind of close that gap and what were the results of that? And why do you think that kind of gap has been persistent? Is there anything that you feel could be done other than, of course, looping? You into information can be done to close that gap that disconnect well. One of the reasons I actually joined the community board is because I thought I could make a difference. You know from this end, and then I learned that actually I could not so I sat for about two and a half three years. Thinking that I could find out what resources, because we have had a lot of problems on this end. You know in terms of drug trafficking right across from a school loitering. There are a lot of issues the community is dirty. Those were the things that I was trying to work with. Precinct Council- and you know the police department to try to you- know, get some continuity in terms of agencies that are in the community and how can we, you know, improve the quality of life on this end of Washington Heights, with what I've been trying to do over the years and I've not been able to get it done. I was not able to get it done on the board because you would have to step off the your seat and present from the you know, as as you know, someone that's not on the board, so that did not work for me and then now, there's still the same, disconnect the same problems still exist, and it's almost you feel like it's futile because you know who can you talk to? Who can help you with? What's going on here? I've spoken to local politicians who are aware: I've spoken to precinct commanders, who are aware, so you know I mean it just it almost seems futile in terms of the help that we need on this, and so sometimes what I do is I just take it upon myself clean the area speak to people about their behavior in the community or whatever. I they respect me, and so sometimes it you still there. You beauty yourself all right in terms of community and those kind of things that we need help with on this end and then just to organize the commercials that are in the in the area. We we're all here together folk do not speak, we do not know of each other. Like the brother just said, I've been here 20 years. He does not know of me. So I'd like to have a forum where at least our neighbors come together. We can do things together for the community and make it a safer place for all of us to live. So I would like to know how do you connect merchants? How can I connect the merchants on Amsterdam avenue, even though most of them are spanish- speaking, but I we can have interpreters so that we can come together and figure this thing out, yeah, so we're we're going to you raised your hand again, Christina, all right, so we're going to get Christina and then we're going to get. We got to close it out because we have more speakers, but I I I'm sure we will be able to find some mutual grounds. As far as one of our biggest goals this year was to be able to do a fair where we brought all the city agencies and we're able to see their procurement process processes and how we can connect local business local businesses to the city. Funding stream, you know like Mwbe, was extremely important, but that's something we could talk offline about, but I I'll let Christina and then we have to move on and Jennifer will just follow up via email or phone right. Okay, wonderful! Thank you! Thank you, domingo. You read my mind, so that was one thing I was going to bring up to Jennifer if she knew about the Mwbe and, secondly Jennifer I just wanted to let you know that you can still try to go ahead and apply for the Eidl loan SBA. It's a loan, that's meant for small businesses and non- profits and it has a deadline of December 21st 2020. So if you know, Tanya wants to connect me via email I'll be glad to share that info to you. Okay, thank you. Nice talk. Thank you, okay, thank you. Jennifer you're welcome man. Thank you, and one thing I will say, even though we understand this extremely complex communication seems to be a pro problem across the board, whether a city agency or via a community, but I think one thing that is important, like you said, is to take it upon ourselves to really put ourselves in as problem solvers as just instead of just being able to like see the problem and not do anything about it. So I really do commend you Jennifer for taking the initiative and going the extra mile making sure that these communication pipelines are developed. Now we just have to come together and see how we can all strengthen each other by being able to create these communication pipelines, and I think that should solve a lot of our problems. Thank you, okay. You want me to move on to Tara. So basically we have 10 minutes per person, so I'll be keeping time do not feel like I'm trying to rush anybody, but it's just we got to give everybody a fair chat: okay, Tara, Wooly, wally, sorry, we'll talk, Park, L House and you know you're next, so you're up, I wo not take up in your time, hi everyone. Thank you. So much for the opportunity to speak and thank you tanya for asking me. I've found that Tanya's someone who gets things done so I've appreciated knowing her now so thank you. Hilltop Park, Yale House has been you know. We've struggled like everybody else. We've had some positive aspects to our business. That's helped us get through this and some negative ones as well, and you know like Jennifer, said I think that was the when she was talking about the communication, how we were getting a lot of information coming from so many different areas, and I would get notifications from anywhere from city agencies to my attorney. Well, I'm lucky to have an attorney. Not everybody has an attorney, so you know I understand that it's it can be difficult. When you do not know you do not know who to look for because there's so much information coming from different areas- and I did find, though, that the community League of the heights was really helpful and I know she's connected with them now, because they were really consistent in sending out information to businesses. If you were on their mailing list- and I found that the information was really relevant and really up to date, so I think that they were a really helpful resource, especially with possible loans and grants and pretty much across the board everything. So I thank them for being indispensable during this. We outdoor dining saved us really like everybody else, and we're very fortunate to have a really large outdoor area. Not everybody has that, and I think you know some of these guidelines have come in not fast enough. They've been too slow to come through, and I think, if some places that had the opportunity to extend their lot lines and put more outdoor seats where there are empty spaces next to them, things could have been different for a lot of places. So another frustration, I think everyone feels is these: how slow the city has been to react and to come out with clear and concise guidelines that make sense, because then sometimes they'll put out some guidelines and they do not necessarily make sense. There has been. I we found that when the uptown restaurants can sort of group together, it's really helped everyone, and that's why I spoke with lauren, and I asked her to join us today, because she she's got places in Hamilton Heights. She also has a business developing business in this neighborhood as well, in this CUNY board district and she's really spearheaded this very large group. Now we've got almost 100 people on an email chain across all different city agencies, and I think it's the uptown restaurant coalition, I'm not exactly sure I'm going to let her speak more to this, because she's really put a huge amount of effort into grouping getting everyone together, so that we can all express what our needs and concerns are, and she I really do not want to say, get too much in the details. I'd like to give her an opportunity now to talk about some of the things that she's been involved with and what she's done, because it's been very helpful and things that still need to come out. We've had some recent news and guidance. That's come out, but there are more things that are not clear. I think, on a higher level more on the state level, perhaps- and I think she'll speak to that. So if it's okay, I'd like to ask lauren to jump in okay yeah, you can, you can give your time to wherever you want hi everybody. Thank you for letting me crash your meeting. I am not in community board 12 yet, but I am part of the north end project at 4300 broadway, which has somewhat fallen apart through all this. Our hope was to open in May and now our hope is to be able to get another six month. Extension on our on our liquor license, which may or may not happen. That's my dog, I'm sorry so yeah. Basically on September 1st, you know we we're Covid-19 is very serious, we're in the restaurant industry. We know it's very serious, no one's poo pooing it by any means, but I think after six months of restaurant tours being patient and relying on you know, government officials on the state level, the you know the city level on all levels that we just needed to start having our own voice. So I basically wrote on September 1st to literally lady quiet, literally every person that I've ever worked with over the last nine years in every level and just begged for their help and said that this is not a city problem. It's not a state problem. This is you guys need to dovetail this together, whether it's SLA issues or a plan for outdoor dining, a plan for indoor dining and we just kind of started a petition, and we got you know Cm Levine, to write a letter backed by you, know, Senator Jackson and Senator Benjamin, Al Taylor, and you know I work with the borough president, quite a bit because I'm on the Broadway Mall Association, so basically throwing everybody together along with like 75 restaurant tours, and then we tapped into the New York State Restaurant bar and Lounge Latino Restaurant, Bar, Lounge Association. So I've been working with Jeff Garcia and their whole group, and it's just gotten bigger and bigger, and the truth is we've all just been kind of standing by and hoping that our best interests are are going to be met and no one's asking us what we need. So I really appreciate this kind of forum, where somebody can really talk to us about what is needed in order for businesses to survive, because every day right now, like the business across the street from Tower just went out all these little mom- and- pop shops are going out. Businesses, I never thought, would fail, are going out and businesses that should be remaining in these communities. So that's I do not know like. I can speak for myself, but I realize that I need to start speaking for everybody, because not everybody has the time right now, when you're in there and you're, washing your dishes and you're, trying to figure out the new guidance and all these other things that I'm fortunate enough in this moment that I have some time to put people together and make some initiatives and try to push for to be heard. Uptown, because a lot of these decisions are happening downtown and we're not being asked about it. So that's it! That's where I'm at awesome. Thank you! Lauren. You have a question tanya, because I think I saw Francis yeah. I just want to know what is the name? Oh sorry, all right, so, basically I'll do it in whoever spoke the most so nobles says you have not spoken. Tanya, Francisco cool thanks to Mingo, and thanks for both your stories, tara and lauren. My question is: are you familiar with any other? You know, community board resolutions that have possibly been made to you know assist you in your fight to get some clear direction from the many different you know even city. I guess divisions on like just to get like a clear leader here in terms of who's actually running this ship. Have you heard of any resolutions from any other community boards like that, because maybe the Manhattan borough president could be pretty good in that regard? I'm not a hundred percent. I mean, I think, a lot of the issue within the hospitality industry is that you know you have the irc. You have the New York Restaurant Association New York City, Hospitality Alliance, like everybody, it's almost like a jockeying within the industry. We do not have that major, like airline lobbyists or something like that, but this industry makes such an impact on this country. I was just reading a report from the comptroller's office, saying that I think 27 of the workforce in New York City, is hispanic 44 work. The restaurant industry is hispanic like these are major numbers and going to impact uptown much more than it's going to in different, not more but in different ways right. So I do not it's. We never had clear lobbying, so it's getting together and there's all these different people. It's like. Do you go after the insurance companies? Do you go after the landlords? Do you go after? Do you want more ppp money like what is the route and, in the end, what I realized is. I do not know who's running against, who I do not know. What's going on next election, I'm not very into politics, but if I cross your path even once you're going to be on an email with all these people, I do not care if you like them or not, and we're going to try to like drum up and get some things done. Uptown, because that's really what we need- and we do have a lot of community board members from Community Board 9, just because that's mostly where I operate and I would love to be able to add more of community board 12, especially you know a business development group to be joining the joining with us. Is there a restaurant czar in New, York? Sorry, there's one last question domingo: is there a restaurant czar in New York? I have a nightlife major right yeah, but that's more bars, not restaurants. Okay, a lot of different politicians, a lot of the uptown politicians are involved, but- and I just keep adding more and more restaurant tours and bar owners as they reach out and hear what's going on. So all right. So thank you. We reached the time so I'll close it out with Tanya and Francisco, and then we got to close it on to the next. Thank you. Thank you, domingo yeah lauren. I would not say we had the north End food hall in twice in front of our committee and right before all you know we had them in a couple of times and every time I go by there and I look at it closed like that. It's really sad. So I thank you. I'm glad that you're involved in that I'm really hoping that they can, you know, find a way to survive this and open at some point, because we were you know anticipating that a great deal, but I want to ask you: what is the name of your organization? Your group? Is there a specific, a specific name of your group? Can you tell me that and what is it that you're? What is your goal? If you can describe your overall goal? What is it that you're with this group this formation this coalition? What are you hoping to accomplish? I mean I can I can forward to you guys the petition that we came up with what we realized in the beginning of our efforts. It truly only started September 1st is, I mean a lot of other efforts have gone on, but for this core group we just we just had we just realized that we were pushing. You know whether it's council, member Levine, writing that letter supporting outdoor dining or Senator Jackson right now, working on a bill again like that is going to hopefully correct the SLA so that they stop do using these gotcha tactics and they're working with us instead of against us, like we have these different initiatives, but when they're announced by a politician it everybody, the regular people, the normal population just starts tearing it down. So we realize the importance that we need to come up with our own statement on the city and state level of what we want to see instead of piecemealing this together. It's like this is an overall of what we want to see now on the city level. The outdoor dining thing has gone through, but of course the mayor announced it with absolutely no plan, as I can attest to from sitting through three hours of the council meeting talking about it last week. There's no plan. He just wanted everybody to figure it out after he got to make his announcement. So you know there's things moving forward and it's not just our group, but I'm happy to circulate the petition and you can kind of see what we're outlining and there's a lot of great comments from different restaurant tours and how they're feeling and what these initiatives would do for them. If it's a link, would you mind adding it to the chat because I'll put it into the minutes? Sure I do not. I was trying to do that before and I do not see you can probably access the Q&A button on the bottom and just put it into that. Okay, all right. Yes, I will go ahead and do that cool thanks. Thank you so much. Thank you both of you all right and lauren. Thank you, Francisco. I mute myself, hey how you guys doing okay, quick question. Well, two questions: how does the new indoor guidelines help or hurt your business, considering it's at 25 correct and that's the one question one question two: what would be the cost for you guys to stay to keep outdoors open if you had a mandate, if you had if they mandated heaters in the winter months, would that add stress to your financial situation by adding heaters and keeping outside open? I mean when you look at the petition and anything we've been pushing for it's straight- up options to operate. You know we you peter Walsh on this call right now, who's operated like coogans, is very different than hilltop. Tavern tara owns Hilltop Tavern. She also owns a very small place called hogshead. All of our places are very different, so for one of my places, 25 makes sense and I can easily do that and control the crowd and feel safe doing it. For my other bar at the wallace, which is more of a communal setting, it's a long bar. It does not make sense under the current guidance, so an outdoor situation where we can do like a partial covering or something like that would make a lot more sense there. But at the Honeywell, my cocktail bar that we're using the backyard right. Now you get any kind of rain and the backyard starts flooding so any kind of like inclement weather, I'm not opening up the backyard. So I think that there's ingenuity within restaurant tours and business owners in general and they need to have the overall CDC guidelines to make sure that we're doing what the CDC says, but we need to be able to have options to operate, and some people have 600 square feet and their entire place is a bar and now literally no one's allowed to walk up to their bar to get take out delivery or anything. So that makes no sense. They might as well close their doors unless they have a really heavy online platform and can survive this winter with delivery. So it's all over the like. I just want options, that's all for everyone, and I like, I would love for you to stay for our town hall, because we want to have just a conversation. I think what gives a scope it's its density, like the ability to be able to understand better, is being able to hear from people in the front lines you know. So we want to make sure that out of our town hall, we got resolutions we have because at the end of the day you know it all boils down to you know what I say about New York is the richest city in the world quote unquote right, but it's also the worst city that has ever been planned as well. The city planning in New, York City. You could tell how catastrophic it is. It's a ticking time bomb. You know because you go to Europe, you go to these, you go to Spain and you see how, like you see the difference in and the importance of city planning. You know, and I think like what Covid-19 has done is unveiled a lot of issues that were brushed under the rug. You know, and it's being put at the forefront of conversations at this moment, so I think in Essence, City Pla, it's very poor city planning that leads to these type of situations happening when you have a pandemic that arises or any type of situation that might change what normal life looks and I want to say thank you lauren for coming by. I would love to just hear your input in our town hall section. So we could, you could be one of our collaborators and we can all work together in creating a space where we are able to identify and have different lenses right being able to hear the barber shop owners, the salon owners, the Delis and get a strong enough response from the community where we could provide city hall with actual like hey look. This is what we pre. This is what we proposed in uptown. You know, and I think that's going to be very impactful and thank you. Is there anything else and yeah tanya go ahead? No, I just want to thank you lauren. Thank you for coming. You, like Domingo, said you're going to be a huge. You could be a huge asset to us in this town hall that we're putting together. So I hope that you know you can stay and be a part of that discussion and thank you so much tara for joining us. I really appreciate you and we will definitely be in touch and connect everyone. So thank you, oh and I just want to say elias. Our chair is also here as well, so another good resource to be able to push the agenda. Okay, you want to move on to Peter now Peter hi needs no introduction. Peter Walsh is an institution I want. We have not had a chance to talk, struck us and you were gone and I wanted to make sure we had a chance to do you right bring you here, talk to you about your experience. What happened, what you're doing now? So thank you for the bottom of my heart for being here. Thank you for having me and thank everyone there for what you guys. Do I mean a lot of times, especially the people on community boards is a thankless job. It never has been uptown in Washington Heights because you guys have always defended us, the citizens, small business from the streets up and you were always our representative. So what I'm going to say? I mean this, I'm serious about it and there's a couple of things that I think can be done. I'm closed. I'm finished I'm out of business, that's a finality! I'm living with that. I hear the frustration you know when I listen to lauren and Tara and Jennifer. I hear the frustration in their voices. We lack leadership in the city of New York. Incredibly, the confusion I mean the mayor ca, not even talk to the governor, the governor ca, not talk to the mayor. We have an idiot as the president of the United States. We have a lack of leadership so right now it's you guys, and you have to remember this. The American Revolution started in bars, Francis Tavern in New York is where it started in New York in Boston. It started in a bar, so this is another little revolution that has to start in our bars, because the bar and the tavern is the local newspaper of our neighborhoods. It's where people share, whether with a guy who has the barber meets the Beautician meets the doctor when they come and they share that's the real oral tradition of bars and what it means to our community. So you know when I'm talking when we're talking about lauren and tara. This is important. This is our meeting place in our first line of communication. So what can we do? Well, one thing we can do right away. We have, and this is the time to do it if there's any time. This is the time to push in ceilings on rent types for commercial properties. If we ca not do it now, we will never be able to do it. I know how strong the real estate lobby is, but now is the time for the little revolution once a bar restaurant small business starts doing well, they get piggybacked on by the real estate. He wants to become their partner now, if they're losing money he's not going to bother them, but he wants to keep them. There he's going to take care of the we're going to take care of his taxes and his water bills, but once we're successful that real estate is living with us, that has to be stopped. We need same as commercial has to follow residential, it's a form of rent control. They can still go up a percentage at a time, but this got to be attacked now, along with this, real estate is have to be required when they have empty stores to light those stores up not to shutter them not to make them look what they used to look like back in the 60s and 70s and 80s, and you guys were puppies- and I was still running around, but now it's attractive to what drug dealers to people who will want to go to sleep and do not confuse homelessness with those who are psychologically deprived and need 24-hour care. This is a trick by the city. They will let these poor guys and they I call it sleeping and sweeping they sleep them, and then they sweep them onto the street. No programs, they do not know what they're doing they among themselves, they're robbed of their own prescriptions, they go out and they fall into the crack epidemic and they call this homelessness. It's not. Those are psychologically deprived people that need 24-hour care, and I'm saying this also for restaurants, you try to run a restaurant with 200 people right out of jail for around the corner from you try to have an outdoor cafe, it's not right to them. They have to be different. The homeless, who are psychologically proud, have to be defended and they need 24-hour care they used to have farms. They creedmoor there's plenty of room on Manhattan island right now they could build little villages where they can walk around, have a cup of coffee as they get better. They become the guy who sells the coffee. These things have to be done now. The other thing with the requirement real estate is, they have to donate their windows that are unoccupied to either non- profits or to artists to light up that space at night time. So when you're walking down the street with your wife or your children or you're coming from something late like tonight, what you guys do when you do have the meetings? That's Community board. I know you come home, sometimes at midnight when you're walking down the street. It should not be shuddered windows and darkness. We have to light up our neighborhoods or we're just going to volunteer to be a ghetto, and we ca not do that. We fought too hard to get out of this and I'm going to tell you our community board not up. There was great, but our community policing in Washington Heights should have been copied by the rest of the nation. If you look at our police people up there right now, they reflect the neighborhood there's more Dominicans African- Americans on both the 3- 3 and the 3- 4. I'm proud to see that and that baseball league, the Michael, Busica League, 47 kids, came out of that baseball league, mostly Dominican, who became policemen, that's their neighborhood, and now the cops up there, and these are all cops. These are our people, they know the people up there, they know the families and when they talk about safety, everything begins at safety without safety, nothing works. If you want to have joy, you got to be safe. First, if you want to have an intellectual experience, you have to be safe. First, when you walk into one of the bars or one of the small businesses you're not going to walk into one that is not safe or not going to walk out. If the streets are not safe, safety is number one. So our communication with the police up there is so important- has to be positive. They have things they have to clear up and we have to challenge them to that, but we ca not paint them with the brush that all these guys wake up in the morning saying oh gee, I ca not wait to beat up somebody in the street. They do not want to lose their their retirement. You know nobody gets up, saying oh gee I want to. I want to do that and that's the way, we're painting the police right now. The problem with that is undernourished. Neighborhoods get the lease police then, and that's where the most primer, who the victims, the victims, are people of color. The first victims of most crimes in New, York City are people of color and we have to defend those people from these extreme thinking and thought things and believe me, a bad cop has to be found out, and it happens in the locker rooms of America is where people got to start talking up when people are changing their shoes, whether it's a sports game or it's a police or a factory. You ca not get away with those stupid, racist, biased, jokes. Those people have to be called out on it same thing as around the water cooler at different corporations and businesses. So a ceiling on commercial rents, a real estate obligation to light up our windows. Now these closed stores- I do not know nobody even knows how many stores are closed. We got to count, we got to start counting how many small businesses are closed. Nobody knows they do not know in a city, and anybody who thinks it's a great idea to let street vending take over is out of their mind. How do you think you put small businesses that turn them into small businessmen instead of them pulling up in the truck and selling bagels and coffee right outside the bagel and coffee shop? They should be told they have to. They have to become small businessmen and suffer like small business people and pay taxes. Nobody even knows the taxes, what the taxes are from street vending in New York, but they will pull up the tariffs, place, they'll, pull up in front of lauren's place and they'll start selling food and there's no gsp gps on it. How come they ca, not gps? These people- and these are legal and licensed. The other thing is inspections and you're right lauren. I think you said it in tower. I agree with you they're going to have to re- unify how inspections are done on restaurants, especially right now they got to take health department. They got to take fire department, they have to take consumer affairs, they got to do it as a unit and forget about fines, and this is the problem with bureaucracy. The self- perpetuating bureaucracy loves giving out fines because then they rationalize their own salaries, but they have to go and help small people. Small business people they're not there to come in and whip us and beat us and then find us they're there to come and help us, because we are a service to this great city, we're the people that we're the backbone of the it's the working class and I'm going to tell you the middle class is shrinking. We know that we know the middle class is drinking, so what does the poor class aspire to if they do not have a middle class? We have to help the middle class, because that's the class that will pull up everybody else behind them and the rich class they got to learn how to pay their taxes like real Americans and not just[ _ _]. I hear all the time excuse my language, I'm a little angry, not about closing I'm angry for the people who are trying to stay open. I mean I care about the people who are trying to stay open. We have to reinvent New York City. It's never going to be the same guys. It's not more places are going to close before this thing is over this epidemic. I was just in the hospital Monday and according to two doctors, I talked to they believe it's getting worse before it gets better now, the vaccine, possibly by the time it takes effect, we might be dealing with March April you're, going to have another 15 to 20 of small businesses. Closing. This is not a good news thing I'm talking about. I wish I had good news, but the real good news is, while this is going on, we have to reinvent the city and give new leadership to the city. I know what Lauren's going through the confusion of City Hall right now is despicable. It's I mean they do not even know what they can. They could not organize their own garbage can if you have any questions, go ahead all right, so we have stack so we have nobles Francisco, tanya and then myself. Well, thanks domingo, Peter thanks so much not only for coogans, but also for your point of view. I'm sure you and I rely on a lot of things that you said, especially in regards to everything in terms of budget justice and the help for small business and also our homeless and mentally ill community. My question is, you know, I completely agree with the bureaucracy element of this and you know there's a need for it sometimes, but also there's a lot of pain points with it to cut through that bureaucracy. Unfortunately, money talk[, _ _] walks so like when it comes to lobbyists for the restaurant or groups like state lobbyists, city lobbyists. Are there such things as groups like that and if so, where are their loyalties in mind? Right now, you have the national restaurant associates, which is now lost an incredible amount of membership. Obviously so they're right there they're limited to what they even can do right now, because they let everybody go, is working for them. Yet lauren is the street level organ organizing is the future. This lauren has is now de facto a leader I mean she's a leader anyway, but now it's because of the lack of leadership she becomes more important. Tara becomes more important because they've spent the time of just coming tonight and talking about this right now. So it's a very difficult thing, but the city does not know what it's doing. We have to listen and pay attention to what the health controls are for the future. We ca not be idiots about this, but you know we want to do things that are safe and I know lauren does not. I know that when they talked and they met- and I think I what we I introduced to some people downtown also- and these are people you know who want things that they want to get their businesses going. But you know they also have to watch out. Remember the restaurant business was fragile before this epidemic. It was a fragile business. You know the expenses went up on employee salaries. The expenses went out on commercial, real estate and insurance. You would not believe the insurance that has to be paid by tara. You would not believe her insurance and here's what happens now, and this is going to happen up here in Washington Heights. What's the first thing, the guys who have small business going to cut out insurance- and you know what happens with that two things, one: the breaking the law. That means they can be closed number two. If they're not insured, they have no money to back up one mistake: they make and they're out of business so that people are going to stop paying certain bills they're going to pay the rent. If they have to. You know right now, they're going to pay electricity they're going to pay for their phones, they're going to pay for the TV. What are they going to cut out? When we closed, I paid every single purveyor I paid every salary that owed. We took loans, David and Tess, and myself took loans to make sure every single we had almost 50 people working for us. Everybody was paid, then we had a nucleus to get them jobs. How are we going to get them jobs in their future and that kind of one? You know dempsey, Dumpster, Drano City, because of what happened with the Corona, you know happened. There was all the bars were closing. This is where we're going to get them jobs. So I'm very worried about the people who showed me loyalty for 35 years and we're going to take care of them. I mean that's my full- time job. It's making sure that our employees somehow or another get jobs. You know I mean that's what I'm going to be calling tara I'm going to be calling lauren, I'm going to be saying. If you need somebody like this, I can vouch for it. This is this person gives a hundred percent. So it's all little things that we can do it's all little things that you can do, but I mean that about getting that law of ceiling on commercial rents. It has to be done it because it's just greedy real estate is who put everybody out of business if they start making any money. It has to be that and again decorating those lighting up those stores at night and do not make everything. Look like we're falling apart, even if it's make- believe thank you, Peter Francisco yeah, how you doing Peter Hey Francisco, how you doing man it's a pleasure. I've had so many amazing nights at coogans, some that I wo not never share you, and, but with that said, even with all that, even with the facebook in and everything that we know now, they still ran you out right. So what I want to ask you is, so we can help other businesses that are coming in or the current ones to avoid some of the stuff that you have to go through with your landlord. I know the landlord tried to take you out a couple years ago, correct right in the in the community valley together what was said about the community. We and we fought to keep you because you know we had to so it was humbling how and then Covid-19 came and your landlord was still not like understanding your power and your influence in this community. Well, not necessarily. I have to tell you this. We did not have a you know. This is. We did not have a long time left on our lease when we saw what was happening and I looked at it and I'm I've been in the business 50 years and I said we're not going to make it even when we open, I saw it coming. I mean I looked at it. I was called. I had a look at it called, and I, when I had tests and Dave- and I said, listen, it's no bouncing back from this one. It's going to be longer than the telling everybody, and I think we were just you know nobody was being prepared or nobody's right, so it really had nothing to do with our landlord. At the end, okay, the three of us made a decision based on. We knew we could not make a profit again. You know also. You know, I want to point out one of the things that goes on in the businesses and taverns they're always sued for everything. That's why the insurances are so high. You know it's not just tripping on a sidewalk if the if someone works and they do not get lunch and they and they read one of those ads in a local paper. That says you know some lawyer and he's a bottom feeder. All he does is organize lawsuits and he wants to make a quick, fifty hundred thousand dollars for you to settle with and that fifty or hundred thousand that restaurants are settling with the insurance. That's why the insurances have gone up so much, because insurance companies did not want to go to court, so our insurance went up because the insurance companies did not have the balls to fight these people at court, so they just kept on raising our insurance, and now these lawsuits turn into four hundred thousand five hundred thousand dollars for these restaurants, so you're out of business. So that's another thing where you almost need, like a judicial review to say this case is bs and they throw it out now in Europe or in London. If you do a case like that and you're proven wrong, you pay for all everybody's legal fees. That does not happen here in New, York you're just going to the next guy, and you see the next guy. So you have a lot of things going on there that restaurants need protection from I mean, and as this thing's going on, they have not done anything about organizing inspections. I mean inspections that help the small business stay alive. This is no time to send out some inspector to say. Oh, we looked into your ice machine and you it would be found under the rubber lip here. There's some dirt. No, this is the time to go and help say: listen guys do this and do this. Do this we'll be back in three months and if it's not ready in three months, they'll give them another chance and then they can close them and do what they want, but they ca not the whole owners, how small business going to pay any of these fines they going to play these fines right now and you know up at Columbia, I was lucky enough for cougars. We had some very interesting customers and people. We had Dixon despie, the father of the vertical farm. We that's some of the things we have. You saw how fragile the food delivery system was for the city. At the beginning of the Corona I mean if the migrant workers got the Corona, they could not pick the food. If the truck drivers got the Corona, they could not deliver the food. If the storekeeper got sick, he woods in selling the food, so vertical farms should be developed in especially cities and places like Washington Heights in Harlem and Brooklyn, and we have a guy on vented vertical farms right marshmallows. We have Tanya next yeah, I'm sorry, I'm not wound up a little guys. Yeah. I hear you all right. No, I just wanted to just make a note that I want you to because I know your time is we're getting close to time, but I just wanted you to talk about what are you doing now like? What are some of the things? I know you started in a commercial yeah. We did that commercial and the deal we did was they gave us a hundred thousand dollars to give away. So the applications have been flying in actually united way is handling the you know how the thing is a proven, a valid one. At first we wanted. You know I mean I do not. I do not want to sound like an integrate, but when I said to Facebook I said well, we like to give people enough money that has an impact instead of a couple thousand dollars. You know you want to give them. Well, that's not going to happen, so we have a hundred thousand dollars. I think we got another 11 match to about 111 or so, and what is this? Can you tell us what this is, because it's a great it's a grant not only for small business, but you know a lot of people forget this nonprofits in our area and in other areas are part of small business, whether we like it or not, if you, if she stopped on non- profits, it'd be a lot of unemployed people up in our neighborhoods. You know you look into the bars and you guys know it. You came into coogans, so many people there it worked for non- profits, so nonprofits in small business. I treat in a similar manner, they're both very important to the economy, especially Washington, Heights, Harlem and large parts of our city. So we had a hundred thousand dollars. Was our deal that we would lend our name to the commercial and we, I think it's about a couple days left and then they're going to choose and decide who gets it, but it's going to be between small business. If you have not seen the application look on either United Way or facebook and you can put the application in for it but, like I said, I think they it's. They were overwhelmed with. How many applications came, you know, and how do you divide up? You know you know. 10 people would be 10 000, a piece that would be. You know: 20 people's 5, 000., 40 plus 2500.. So do you choose and you want to choose people going to stay in business. You know we gave money back on the March. We were offered money. They gave us a check, one of the grant, 25 000 they gave and we gave it back because we said we're not going to make it we're going to close. But we said it would not be fair for us to keep the money and close. We if we stayed up and we would have used it for salaries, but you know something we do so we did. The ad the ad was powerful one around the country and you know ego wise. It was great for coogans, it was a little ego boost that, but reality wise it's. It also was a. We had the longest irish wake ever in the history of irish weeks. Two years we were supposed to close the neighborhood saved us, so we've been dying, we've been dying for the last three years and you know if I was drinking the amount of whiskey I used to drink at wakes. You would I'd be on the floor right now talking to you, so I just been having a good old- fashioned irish week and but I certainly want to help as much as possible because you guys, because what you guys do, domingo nobles natanya, you know Gloria, I mean you guys are there and but you the revolution, and you ca not let these guys back down. These are simple laws. I mean if they go for that commercial, that's the key! That's a key for keeping lauren and Tara alive, yeah Peter, so part of the reason why we incorporated the small business owner testimonies to what we do is because this is supposed to be the energy that we need to turn the batteries on. You know so, just hearing you speak, I see a lot of passion. I see a lot of understanding knowledge experience, but I also think what's important to notice how you've already identified that this is, unfortunately a political issue. Right because, like the reality is the federal government can print as much money as they want and they know it and they've been having a choke hold on the rest of the country. If you do not abide by whatever the White House wants right so, but I also have seen what could come. What comes out of situations of uncertainty is people who do not just go with the wave. You know and like you've mentioned lauren there's a lot of individuals. Just saying like all right. Do not count us out, though you know, because resilience is very is within our community. Resilience is an aspect that helps us move beyond because of now we've been dying for years. Hey Washington Heights is an incredible neighborhood. Washington Heights is a neighborhood, I mean I saw it as a dangerous place. That became a neighborhood. I mean we lived through that and what happened? It's, vibrant and it's the american dre. It's you know it's[ _, _], sorry, what is people about being a melting pot in amer? We're, not a melting pot, we're a TV dinner, the peas spill into the potatoes, the potatoes spill into the gravy. This is, I mean that story about a melting bot is all bs. I mean you tell that to my irish grandparents that this was a melting pot. You know they. I know what they did for jobs. They had to work on North brother Island out there in the East River they during the typhoid Mary. My grandmother took care of Typhoid Mary. That was, she was a nurse who took care of it, but we Washington Heights is vibrant. It's wonderful, our music's, the best in the city. You know I mean they tell me, I'm so politically incorrect, because the other day I said to someone, I do not care what you think: dominican woman, walk better than white women dance and that's just the way. It is man and I do not care and they made me a lot of money by walking into coogans, because every guy would turn his eyes at him and buy that girl a drink and praise God Hallelujah. For that. So that's the way it is guys and but we got the neighborhood and, like I said we have so many victories that we won in our neighbor. We have so many reactors, I mean we have a police department up there. You can talk to I take tanya. Would you agree on that? We can talk to them. We have greatly hey, listen. Al Taylor is one of the most wonderful leaders I've ever met. He is, he means it he's honest and he's decent he'll probably never make it again to a higher post because she's so honest and decent. You know you always see these vicious people always jumping, but we got some leadership up there. We got to use them and you guys I mean there's going to be a lot of new leaders coming out of this Corona yeah, so Peter a lot of new people. Thank you for joining us again and if you have paper or tiny, just share my email with them that we could follow up. But I think our next conversation is going to be around our town hall. Why a town hall, because, as we could see, often restaurants and nightlife could dominate the conversation. We speak about small businesses and it's actually a bit broader than that right and I think our strength is going to be in unity and being able to unite all the different business sectors and business interests together to be able to create a strong demand right because they are going to be intersectional. Ask and intersectional interest that align with small businesses and we're going to transition over to that. Is there any closing remarks? The question for you to me when it comes to sorry point of secretarial yeah Question New, York, City, Doh's John padmore not happening on agenda tonight. I sent him the invite. I'm waiting for him to text me back, but if it does not, all he wanted to do is provide us with a glimpse of a webinar that we'll be doing within the next month or two, where he's basically going to be speaking about the Department of Health's stance and their. What, when we speak about inspectors, the DOH is the one that the city agency that sends the inspectors. So we want to have a clear understanding of what are the guidances and be able to see what type of what it what wavelength they're on you know so I'll just say, rescheduled for next meeting, then we could definitely do that. What's up Francisco quickly, just Peter! Thank you! So much you are more appreciated than I think you know, and I would love to connect with you offline tanya or you. His connect yeah tanya yeah, the whole committee everybody's contact information. All right! Thank you and lauren. Just one more thing: could you please add the petition link in Q&A? I'm not sure if I saw it. Oh, I was going to say I ca not do it because she ca not do it because she did not have the permission to post anything, and I ca not do it either, because I do not have a panelist whoever's, a panelist ca not or could only answer in the Q&A yeah. The way they would be able to do it is by typing an answer. So we have to type an answer. Oh okay, let me do it it's okay, it does not direct all the information over to tonya she'll make sure the entire committee receives it. Yeah I'll, send it out to y' all and I'll. Send you the link to his commercial. If you have not seen it to be this commercial because it was, it was in the Nba game, I'm in it too. Here's the only thing. I would tell you about the commercial. I got calls from people I had not seen in 30 years from all over the country, Canada included, and the Good News was that one of them asked me for a loan because they knew I was closed. One person asked you for alone, so I said: that's good news yeah. I love you guys. I love what you're doing and I mean I miss the neighborhood. I mean why I'm a Washington Heights Guy. I mean it's in my soul, it's in my heart and Peter in the time of telecommunication right. We all are bonded together, so there's a role that we can all play in contributing to positive impacts within yeah. Anything you ever guys need for me. For any reason, if you need me to walk around, you know a block with a picket sign. They call me up Peter for President Hey, for you guys love you guys. Thank you Peter. Thank you all right. So now we're going to go into our town, Hall conversation. This is a conversation that I thought was important to have. I felt I caught myself trying to rush it because, unfortunately, we're put in predicament where we have to go against time and seeing how the city had made, I believe it was October 30th the last day for outdoor dining, I felt like it was important to be able to be able to provide some sort of rebuttal to the city as to why this is important and our small businesses, or at least one sector of our small businesses, depend on them. So with that being said, I want to open it up to a conversation around. If we do have a town hall, when should we be scheduling it for and what are some of the dynamics that we should incorporate within them? My biggest thing was being able to have it in different sections right, because we know we've had meetings during Corona, where we had about 150 to 200 people in the zoo, and it could become very hectic. So we have to set a system in place where everybody gets to chime in, but at the same time, structurally structure it well enough where we could incorporate the needs and the ask into tangible demands. Oh man with that being said, I opened up the floor. There we go, I had once. Oh, I'm sorry did I enter from nobles Crawford. Ladies and gentlemen, okay, thank you domingo, one of the things when you just said that how do we get everybody's voices in there? I do not know how you feel about this, but have you what would you think about utilizing polls during the town hall to get people's feedback and opinions during the town hall, or one of the things that I was going to ask them was as part of a sign- up sheet where we could also build our get folks emails contact information just being able to ask them what were their top three top four most urgent needs and being able to use a form as a prerequisite like a prerequisite to be able to collaborate, nobles, you're, muted. I was writing minutes and had to jump back over from Zoom. You know the marketer in me, as is who I am, of course, you're always going to start with an objective and a target audience right. Yeah, and so you know from an objective standpoint. I'm wondering like is the objective of this to be an aide to the businesses, or is it more of a community awareness in terms of what our businesses are going through and how we can best support them? First question then, that kind of really dovetails in the target audience in terms of who do we want? You know this to impact. Are we trying to get more people to work in the new behavior that we need to kind of create with with our Covid-19 adaptation, or are we trying to? You know help the mindset of the business owners to build more structure around you know organic organization like Lauren's been doing and stuff like what do we want the objective and the specific target audience of these particular town halls to be yeah? So I think- and those are some great questions- objective right. The objective should be: how do we bring in different sectors of that's why I started that's why, when I sent the email out, I was like oh okay, we're just targeting one specific sector and not necessarily getting a clear understanding from various other sectors, because we've had salons we've had. We have not had Delhi's provide testimonies yet, but we have to get what are the different sectors identify? What are some of the common needs and be able to use that as an intersecting line? You know and then build off that so that, at the end of the day, we're not lobbyists, but what we can do is leverage our positions within the Community Board to advocate on specific needs, and that's why I was basically getting to the point of we have to be able to turn those ass into tangible, tangible goals. You know, so it wo not just become a back and forth around. Who has the better idea when it's like? No, this is what we're asking for it's on you to figure it out and I think, having a resolution come out of that where we are able to use the testimony and the commentary provided, gives us enough fuel to be able to write something, that's pretty impactful and could get the ball rolling. That's perfectly clear, like one of the more tangible objectives in that is to come out with a very strong ass resolution, yeah and that's a very clear goal thanks because, unfortunately, that's all we could technically do we function as a bridge right, we're obviously right. We function as a bridge, but we could do what we can do is use our leverage and our connections with city agencies to be able to say hey and project certain conversations. So that's why, with lauren, she they have a petition. How do we incorporate already a ball? That's already rolling into what we're already doing and therefore not having to recreate or develop different clusters. You know and really start moving together, but I suggest then perhaps we come with a resolution, that's as good as can be, and then get the town hall to input on either how we can strengthen it or build on top. So that way, it's like we're, not crowdsourcing a resolution from the get- go, but we come with the foundation that we get broad alignment and we can start to enhance from there well yeah. It's also source that developing like the infrastructure right, yeah, the framework yeah so maybe like we make it into different sections: small business loans. You know clarity of communication from city officials and in chain of command. You know outdoor dining assistants and what have you like? Maybe we come up with sections and then we fill in the details during these town halls yeah that works cool. Now I do not know the formal writing of resolutions, but I'd be happy to take it on from an organizational standpoint. Yeah sure I think we could create. I do not know about the Google docs, because supposedly we can I'll take care of all that message. Yeah all right yeah as part of this town hall or is discrimination and racism. A part of this a part of this will be part of the questioning. I think what we could look at is using that as a tool of capacity building. You know sometimes often we get. We engage in conversations on making them too. Open- ended without clearly letting them know what the expectations are. So if those are issues that we know are occurring within our community, then the question is the way we challenge. It is by making sure that we build capacity towards that, because I genuinely do believe I'm watching Mr 45's supporters. Some people just do not know any better bro and as I'm not even I'm not even trying to justify, but just some folks just do not know any better, and our goal is not necessarily to antagonize but to be able to provide a narrative that it's like all right, cool, just hear it out and let's build capacity towards that, and that should be an expectation. That's clearly said because I think, unlike we saw in the debate, I think it's not anti- american or promoting hate to America when we talk about racism and inclusion, so I think that's extremely important to tell that, and that could be something that you could speak on Francisco. We could have a segment on the importance of we want to do a series of trainings, but not as a community but as a city which I think it's much more impactful yeah I mean I did speak to you guys well in the email prior email about the plan that I had that I think could work similar to the grading system in the restaurant, so places are held accountable and you can anonymously send them a communications to a board or an agency where they're already an agency for that the human rights- oh right yeah, but I ca not go into a restaurant and know that information. I want people to have that information. Will we do hookah? You? Can you ca, not smoke it? This is bad for you that we need that. I would not. We need postage, but the question is who's. Going to pay for it and if it says well, we could we could ask. We could have a request for the board to see if we could put a postage in the community around if people feel discriminated against, what are their options and who should they contact similar to like a I know, the licensing committee does a good neighbors sign as some of the requirements often were there so they're going to be parts of whatever we come up with that are going to be treading the line of policy and basically self- policing, right yeah. And so you know if we want to have a policy conversation, because you know to Francisco's point here from a discriminatory standpoint that you know a lot of the vacant. Storefronts like Peter was talking about are in you know, highly underrepresented community areas, because the landlords are not responsible to filling those areas. When there's a major business opportunity in some of these areas, it's just more it's more equitable to have empty storefronts than it would be to actually putting a small community business in there right. And so, if we want to have the policy conversation, because if we're going to try to change the narrative here, we have to come up with the entire infrastructure. I just do not think that you know. We've got the volunteer time to do that, but at least like from a policy forward perspective like to address you know food deserts or what have you when it comes to? You know it all works together, so I can go down the rabbit hole here, but I do think that you know that should maybe be our focus here, not necessarily trying to provide the support of the infrastructure but provide the way forward from our communities. Crowdsourcing of how policy should be developed agreed and it starts at the local at the grassroots. We want to be able to diversify the conversation as well, so anybody else has something to say about the town hall. Is this something that we should plan out more and we might need two meetings to plan out? Therefore, should we develop tasks in this meeting? Will we prepare for next meeting and have the town hall in December or yeah? I was going to say just since we're going to do it. Obviously it's a zoom thing and I'm sure you already know, like just translation, make sure that we have. You know that built into the process, so everybody can participate right, I'm wondering if we could sort of break it up into two sections right, like one section, whereas we're hearing what the community has to say what organizations have actually helped them out, or I think that's super important, because it's like you hear all these loans and these fancy things on SBA and Yadda facebook, but who's actually getting it. What has their experience been like how easy how hard how much I want to know the details and then the other section could be just information. You know like we're providing information, whether it's like how to access the small business loans, how to access communication. What is the CDC laws and how should we be operating, because I know I heard from some people earlier? They do not even know how to do some of these things. The information has just been being thrown at them, but it's like how do I interpret that as a as a owner. You know so information and actually hearing is sort of how I'm thinking, but I really like the way nobles talk about like sectioning things. I think that's really cool just sectioning on the loans and then the communication, and then you know yeah, but he was referring to the to a resolution so being able to make up a resolution and nobles you could speak, but you know it all works together. I mean I'm 100 with Christina here, because you know as business development we look at if we look after a ton of businesses right. So maybe we have like a bar and restaurant session for like an hour and a half just like brainstorming writing things down whatever, and then we have like retail, right, mom and pop retail, or something like that. We have that session. We're brainstorming, we're writing it all down and then, as a part of a committee like, maybe we clean up all the brainstorm, we actually put the actionable things in the different sections that we've all aligned on and then in, like the committee meeting. After all this, like let's say a month later, we like one, invite everybody back. That was a part of that we'll get their information, invite them back, and then we discuss the resolution in that committee meeting and then it's there that we either fine tune. We have discussions about different pieces, but I think coming out of that committee meeting, we would have an actual document that we could prepare and get out just baby steps to the main objective. Oh domingo, one thing what you know I do not know who would do that, but people who are trying to open up businesses right now, like people who might be in was in the pro in the process before everything happened or they are trying to open. Could that be a part of this like what are some of the? What is this new landscape in terms of opening up a new business in this post? Well, I ca not say we're postcoping, but in a miss coved. What is what is this landscape? And how can you still be an entrepreneur in our community within this landscape, current landscape of Covid-19? Okay, I got, I got it lauren hi. I was just going to say from my our experience of kind of doing this. I think I think that what was important is like again, it's like it's such a lack of control and you have all these business owners who tend to feel they're. They own their own business they're in control of their own destiny. So I think that it's important for buy- in if things are whether it's done in like, like think group type things like. I think, Christina mentioned with like the different and then before anything's just like presented and then voted on, it's kind of like okay, we heard and then we're going to go off because that's what we did. We had a zoom call and a lot of people got to just you know and you're, not elected officials. You're volunteers, we like we appreciate you should not have to sit there and listen and keep people complaining complain. But I feel like some of it is just this need to let it out and hear people and be heard, and then it's like. Okay, everybody, like I know, you're really busy. We heard you we took that all down. Let us get a shot to put this all into actionable items exactly and we're going to reintroduce it to you. Instead of just being like all right, here's our actionable items- and you know you can vote on them or whatever just so that they're heard first. I think it's really goes a long way for buy- in, but how exactly that goes down across barber shops and bookstores and restaurants like it's. You know it's not. It's also not fair, for you know a barber shop to have to sit there and listen to this like crap about outdoor dining all day long like they have their own pain points. So it's really identifying first, and I think that Peter had a lot of good ideas of like what are these overarching things that are going to help every industry in our community, and that goes after the real estate that and the landlords that goes after the crime side of things and lighting up everything like even all these non- profits. Like I'm on the Broadway Mall Association, we have no money. We ca not light the malls this year. So all those malls like all the way up, are going to be dark and it you know from upper West side throughout. So I do not know. I just think that getting by in and then I do not know how it gets divided up, but each industry kind of has its own pain points and, more importantly, there's three of Us whities on this meeting like Jeff Garcia could have been on here like we need to definitely get like why the Wahi Group or Dikeman Restaurant Association. There are some of the most feisty women that own restaurants on dykman that are like so well spoken, so articulate like they'll tell you what to do, but they're fighters and they're amazing, I'm so lucky to have met all of them. So I mean I would love to bring you guys all into this group, and a lot of people are down here: they're, not in district 12, but there's a lot of amazing restaurant owners that are in district 12 bar restaurant lounge owners, and they know we all know our other community members. I know all my barbershops and I know all my bodega owners like we can bring them in yeah, correct yeah, so Cindy just emailed me so nobles, I'm listening to noble's idea about so she ca not. She could only listen to the audio because she's in her work, computer, I'm listening to the audio session with each industry type of. Let me I'm listening to noble's idea about sessions with each industry type and then narrowing it down to action. Adams. She seconds that and also looking forward to discussing items like access to capital and the role banks. The royal banks in the survival of small businesses, so that's cindy she's. I hope everybody knows Cindy's the branch manager at Td Bank in 207, so she brings in a lot of like the bank expertise. I think that's great. I mean I think that we should definitely be. You know not afraid to make bold proclamations in this resolution. You know banking goes hand in hand with rent with rent right, renters rights, commercial specifically for us. That should certainly be, as I wrote that down in the minutes. You know to talk. You know to bring everything to a point with you know what Peter was saying and everybody else timing wise, because you asked timing, Domingo and I do not think we really closed the loop there. I'm a little bit worried about timing of the holidays when it comes to our restaurants and our retail they're extremely busy. I do not think they're going to have time coming up soon too, as well, like all of that, and at the same time too, I do not want to put this off for next year, but I do not think to the table and there's some credibility to that. I think what we could potentially look at is a way of being able to develop an action plan per se for it where we develop the blueprint, we use our meetings to develop the blueprint and it might just be something we do in January. That's a good point to mingo. You know so amigo yeah. I was saying in the idea that you all have about talking to each individual people in different areas of businesses, industries. What about using breakout rooms as part of that, like you, can have a breakout room for people who are? You know, restaurants, one for salons and things like that. You could use the breakout room as part of zoom and then somebody one of the board members or whatever could host. You know facilitate that discussion, so we can hear from all these different businesses in the same meeting. Yeah that something, but back to Noble's point, though the Titanic, what Noble's trying to say, is there's a few months coming ahead, that there's going to be a lot of quote-, unquote, distractions, not only for us but for businesses as well, so you're talking about holidays that might be big peak business hours for certain businesses, where the question is. Am I going to invest time at this moment for this particular good intention conversation? Or do we time it to the point where we work, for instance, with like lauren, we launched something in from January to February, where it's like hey. This is what we're doing, and we have everything on the table already without necessarily having to do it on the go. We can have both it's not mutually exclusive. We can do breakout sessions when we actually get the semblance of the pillars that we want to fill in the details for breakout sessions in terms of tackling certain pillars with groups that you know gravitate toward whatever pillar. We can do a breakout session there and then come back and do it because I also do not want to sound like we're. Trying to drag our feet here because we need the action now places are going out of business now they're hurting. Now I think that you know Domingo. I think you had a great piece of advice there in terms of maybe we use pieces of our meetings as these kind of brainstorming sessions. I think that's fantastic, we're doing that right now and it's actually providing a lot of fruit that you'll see in the minutes in terms of an assemblance of direction. I think that's a good lead, so maybe for the November and the December meetings we say: okay, November is about bars and restaurants in terms of brainstorming. December is about you know: retail barbershops and clothing stores, blah and then January we'll do like the breakout sessions. You know for that meeting and then and then February. We roll out the the resolution and actually that timing is perfect because that's when, like it's going to be the heat of the council races so politically, if we're able to give that resolution to some city council members, they might start to adopt some of that language in what they're going to the market with yeah Correct agreed. That's right! That's good! Nobles, yeah, very good! I like excuse me. I think that timing works so I'll put that in the minutes in terms of a timing and then we'll figure out what the agenda is like moving forward. Then are we saying, let's identify a sector for next month right and let's just do the outreach and invite them so basically what our next month is going to look like it's probably going to be that DOH presentation. We could try to keep them to 10. 15 minutes started off with that and then just go straight into testimonies and identify. I say we welcome them all and yeah, so what business sector would you like to go on with next month? Francisco you're on mute was not saying anything so Ashley are you alive? Yes, I am, ah there you are Salim Ashley what you think, I'm all for it I'm. I think that this is particularly important, especially at this time now. I know folks have talked about like what the next six months holds in speaking to some business owners on my block and domingo. You know this. It's really scary, to think about what what's like, how the tides are about to continue. Turning so yeah, I'm on I'm on board with this all right, so I would say: let's go with the the majority of businesses here, according to the comptroller, are barber shops and salons, that's the biggest composition of businesses within our community, so really yeah. So it's amazing. I think it was like 74 of storefronts are barber shops and salons. He gave us like a nice little remember, tanya, yeah more, like a little booklet. Oh yeah, it was very surprising yeah. It was barbershop and salon make up the vast majority like 70 percent or 73 of the businesses within our community. Okay. So that's the November meeting, then we'll invite some folks here to speak on that. What do you think we want to do in December go ahead? Let me know quick question on the November meeting. Is the we moved it up because of the election? Okay, that's yeah! Yes, oh right, yeah! I moved it up a week to the second Tuesday, because the first Tuesday is election day, the election yeah okay. So it's the second Tuesday of November. I ca not afford the correction right. I took that entire week off from work. I mean[ _ _]. If I need to get out of the country real quick, you know, but look listen so December meeting right. So we could, I mean bars and restaurants have usually been very broadly represented at business development meetings. So maybe, since it's retail time period it's Christmas and Hanukkah and everything, maybe retail might be a good time to have the December meeting and then bars and restaurants. We can bring them back in like the main January meeting about deadlies and supermarkets. Do we want to incorporate them into retail? That's a good question. Yeah! That's a good idea with the supermarkets, because we do not hear from that now but yeah. Maybe we can all incorporate that because people are going to be using the supermarkets more holiday time, or at least hopefully that would be a con that'll be a high traffic place. You need a lot of money too. They raised the milk to like ten dollars once they're in Corona yeah, that's true! There you go. I do not know yeah, I'm wondering what's the priority in terms of who's suffering the most you know like who's, really I hear like barbershops and salons, or that makes up the 70, but for me it's kind of like ticking who's suffering the most. Who do we need to help the most? Who needs to know about Eidl, the most right before December and like who? What can we really do within the next? You know month and a half to help the most people, if that makes any sense? Well, business is still being done, even though we have this parallel path of creating the resolution. So you know to for what domingo said before we're still going to have you know, pieces of our you know, foundational agenda to you know, advance the community business conversation. So I'm not too worried about multitasking here, but it is. It is a concern for sure if we get too far down the path of brainstorming but domingo, do you want to add anything to that? Because that's more time management yeah and I think what we could potentially do is add a 15 minute conversation to resources so that it does it's not that's a good call. Yeah. It's not only meant for a particular like the testimony. What we're saying is we're receiving testimonies right now, so we're going to be targeting specific sectors for the testimony aspect of it, not necessarily the entire agenda. You get it so we could still say if there's a deadline for December and we want to encourage businesses to participate. It's like all right cool. We have the DOH presentation, followed by a resource right and being able to bring somebody to present on those resources, and then we go into testimonies and we're able to synthesize whatever we gather from the conversation added that to the minutes. Yes, 15 minutes on resources, fantastic! Oh, I was just going to speak before that when you were that retail should probably happen in November because come you know, as you get closer to the holidays, they're going to be under so much stress. That's all, would you say retail and like supermarkets, and I was really trying to think about that right because you're straddling between F and B, but I feel like with restaurants that that's super I feel like supermarkets are going to fall. I do not know it's hard. It's got me too. The markets and bodegas and everything are doing really well from what I am that's actually yeah. That's actually a great point. Lauren! That's true! That's a great point! You know it's it. I really feel like retail, like Jennifer's store and I'm also thinking about like there's a lot of different medical. You know it's like it's like yeah we're in a pandemic right now, but there's a lot of different medical places like I do not know. If you guys know. Ronnie Barbarus, who owns Washington Heights Pediatrics, he's also next door to us, and I know that you know I think, he's slightly south of north end, so I think he's like 180 east, just north of the bridge in Washington Heights, on the East side on Broadway yeah. It's like a blue and yellow sign, but like so I was, I do not have the whole. I only have the restaurant part of the comptroller's booklet. I do not know the whole thing, so I do not know who would be to identify first, but I feel like retail heading into Christmas, that's and leave the bars and restaurants out of it. Maybe that's a that's a great point, a good move to give them some help before the holidays and they'll be too tied up at the holidays. I agree and I want to say, if we're going to do retail, we should definitely invite the department of consumer affairs because they are the ones who inspect retail businesses and do all of that and license them. And things like that, so there may be some resources or questions that can be asked of them is just a suggestion yeah. So, finally, what we could potentially do is based on the sector. I always feel like the SBA has to be around for everything, because they're there's a city, you know they deal with businesses, but I do feel like identifying other agencies that cross with those sectors, I think, is extremely important. So it's no thank you lauren! Thank you. That was good. So what I put down the minutes domingo is, I too also malign. I think that we should definitely flip retail into November correct, and I think that we should focus, though, on like mom and pop clothing stores, there was another one that you had brought up because to Lauren's point like groceries in bodegas are doing very well right. Now, there's no fans or buts about that. So I'm not really sure if they should be the ones like really kind of spearheading the policy at this point, but you know mom and pop clothing stores. You know local doctor's offices and stuff like that could be very important and hardware stores would be good hardware stores right, yeah coffee shops, right, bookstores, l'oreal, yes, yeah. What were you going to say? Oh no, I was my name is L'oreal. I am the newly hired small business development director. I took the place of Jackie Tessman, who really paved a lot of what's been going on in Washington Heights, and I did want to. Let folks know that we do have the Washington Heights commercial districts needs assessment, which would be helpful for folks, yeah Jackie. Did that presentation I believe, like a month before she left right Tony. I think it was like a month or two yeah, very good yeah. So, as everyone's been mentioning, you know we have, you know 449 storefronts and then, of course, as you said, beauty nail salons, we have 41. for full service, restaurants, 36, etc, and then I mean even with the coffee shops they're pretty heavy in the neighborhood. So it would be nice to include coffee shops as well cool. So what I'll do here, then? The minutes is that I'll say like retail sands groceries and bodegas. It's like the opposite par garage owners, parking garage owners. I think they're doing pretty well now too bro I mean I got a car and everywhere's packed. I I'm just wondering: what's the impact with the CitiBike and them that would be on parking lots, though I mean I'm just asking well, because if CitiBike is taking away parking, then the only option is to pay for parking, so they go it's a boom. I wish I owned a parking lot right: now[ _, _], Man, Chop and shut it like, and it's also interesting that the people that had the monthly they paid monthly for their parking and let's say they lost their job- is that affecting them as well? I mean not, as far as I can tell dude like I Legit went to 12 parking, lots and they're all full with my car. I'm still street parking right now, yeah, it's pretty the one room for a while by like 10 o'clock, there's already it's full. It's wild yeah bike shops are doing great too yeah. I could. I could invite us manny. The one on 181St and Bennett he's pretty cool, but look I mean let's just throw retail in the soup here everything except for groceries and bodegas. This will be in November. Does that sound good, yeah easy? And then I think we do barber shops to your point in salons in December, their business is always kind of is always kind of moving, but it's also like the number one entry to small business in our area. So that's important that we look after those entrepreneurs, of course, and then we invite bars and restaurants back in our January meeting to kind of see where we're at- and I think it's extremely important for us to be able to frame the conversation as well. So yes, and just the time check is 8 56, so we already we're going to priorities our two hour mark. So I would say, let's finish up the conversation with just being able to understand the type of conversation we want to get. What type of information we want to be able to get and collect from all the individuals that attend the meeting. I mean I think that can be really organic. I think that we go in with like a set. Maybe we make the pillars before and then we just have like a brains and I'll take the minutes and you know put them all down and stuff, but it's not necessarily to align on anything while we're there, but it's just to source the ideas, and then you know, as a group in January, we'll come up, we'll, say those ideas and then we'll pick out the ones that we really want to kind of spearhead and flesh out for the resolution to be presented in February, all right cool. So let's do the so. With that being said, then I feel like we have a good. We do. These minutes are tight. Dude we've got a lot of good ideas here. Yeah does anybody else want to add anything else to it? I would, though, like to get lauren to speak on the her petition for next month, because that potentially helps other small businesses hear what what's already going on within the different sectors and hopefully inspire them to do one as well yeah I mean just to be clear, so we just did it's a it's. Mostly it's a it going back to what you said before it was tangible ass. That makes sense right that very few people could argue with, and that is we're still on the state level still being sorted out in the city level, but basically it was all of us coming together and being like. Why is not this happened? Yet? Why are not we like? We have no runway. What is going on here, there's a whole host of other things that we need to get accomplished for sure, but this was just a start, so I think tara you're circulating that to Tanya right and I'd be happy to talk about it and yeah. I have it I'm going to send it out yeah, who knows what additional traction will happen and please, if you guys believe in it sign it, send it to your friends Harlem public's about to repost it again we're trying to get. I think my goal is to get to like a thousand, so I can start barking, some more and yeah we're like 500 right now, all right perfect, so we'll look into it, we'll share it via email and if you feel that there is the petition speaks to you just make sure you share it out as far as the town hall, or is there anything else we would want to speak on prior to next month's meeting. I feel like it's also trying to never right next month, we'll also be able to see where we had to be better organized and better structured for the next month. So I think we could build on each month to make sure that by the time we have a resolution, we're pretty solid francisco. Are you in a closet or something? Oh me, no, my son, my son has a remote so he's turning it off and on he's going crazy all right. So with that being said, is there anything else you want to address during the town, Hall section aspect of it? I know I would like a motion to table the conversation with the DOH. I know he's not. He well he's not here, so I just put reschedule for next month. Yeah we'll reschedule it, and now we have our partnership conversation. So I know l'oreal welcome, jacqueline and all our partners always had a section where they could speak on announce any upcoming events. Any initiatives you have coming up so feel free to take this time. You got five minutes just basically, let us know what time it is. Well again, my name is l'oreal crowder. I actually started in August and I replaced Jackie Tessman, who I mentioned before, who really you know, built the foundation in terms of the campaign in Hungary in the heights? It's all in the heights which helped us partner with a number of the merchants in 2019, particularly with coogans, where we had the launch and we're continuing on with this particular grant, with Avenue NYC and what we did provide as Jennifer Wilson mentioned was you know the virtual book clubs, where we partnered with the two bookstores word up: community bookstore and then sisters uptown, so we were able to leverage the bookstores in particular, who were struggling by providing monthly bi- monthly book clubs that are on zoom, of course, which has been quite successful and has really helped in terms of reaching out to local artists, which we've partnered with the northern Manhattan arts alliance. This whole time on a mute, I'm so sorry, oh no, we heard you, we heard you. No, we definitely heard you yeah northern Manhattan yeah fantastic right, so we highlighted a local artist and then also partnered with local merchants in our corridor and raffled off a gift card. So that's one of the components in terms of the Avenue NYC programming, which you know we've you know helped keep now: you're muted yeah. That was my cat and you know what we're going to do is we're going to revamp the the campaign, particularly with the shifting you know. We, you know with pre- covert and post cover that you know the landscape is changing as we know. So we do. You know, we've lost a couple, but we've gained a couple, but I do not know in respect to the 50 plus merchants that we do work with who else we've lost, but it includes, of course, coogans and then latin bar and grill, but at the same time we've you know we are welcoming to new a bakery. There is exclamation point and then Pizzeria Antica, which is actually between 157Th and 158Th. So I'm not able to give a full report in terms of you know how many businesses have been lost. Although it looks as though it's you know it's, I would not say minimal, but you know if anything the biggest loss was coogans for sure. So we will- and in fact I think folks already and thank you for announcing the the gala for Class 100 100. 68th anniversary, which is in November, and I apologize because I do not have the date on me, but that's something to look ahead to as well. So that's pretty much the report that I have and I did want to sort of share my information if folks wanted to reach out. I'm also, you know very keen on assisting folks with connecting you to certain businesses, such as the beauty, salons and the barber shops, because we do communicate with folks. So I'm happy if you need assistance finding panelists or what have you and then, of course you know just emphasizing you know getting the word out about the commercial district needs assessment and I'm sorry I missed that meeting. But you know I think that it's been quite helpful in terms of connecting with merchants just so they have an understanding of what the landscape. You know the business landscape is in Washington Heights. So if you know I tanya yes, so thank you tanya. I really appreciate you giving me time to speak and I hope to speak with you tara at some point, and thank you all. I really you know this is one of my first meetings, so it was. It was unbelievably informative and I I'm very appreciative so if anyone would like to get a hold of me I'll, be sure to share my information with Tanya, but I'm looking forward to you know what what's ahead in November and December. So thank you. So much for yeah Jackie was always very. We understand cloth does a lot of great work in the lower heights and really do acknowledge what their contributions are to the to our community as a whole. But once again thank you. Thank you, tanya, for serving as a bridge for a lot of the conversations that occurred today. It's been a hectic month. You know school's opening this uncertainty. So now the new normal is not knowing. What's next, this, like information, void that we're in where we were deprived of a lot of the reality of things, and you know it's a shame and I always say that it's like when you fight when you work in a school you find out that schools was postponed awake on twitter. You did not even get it from your immediate boss. So now all the information is coming via social media, which is another new normal. You know, but again we do what we can. What we got, we just got to keep moving forward and making sure that our community keeps getting access and and access and equity, but thank you so much l'oreal and now I know we have the thanks. We have the committee rankings. We have to submit this before the end of the month, so I know that we have to be able to identify what our community deems is important. If we want to keep it the way it is, we just have to rank whatever items they are and yeah. So I send an email out to everybody so that you can have access to it. What we could also do is, I guess, email it to me, because this was usually done in person. I do not know how it works now, usually what I would have done is brought blank sheets gave it to everybody. We identify what new items we would like to include, but now it's like. How do we do this? Virtually? I do not know so. Yeah go ahead. Nobles. I have an idea how to do it virtually it looks like it's already in Google. Is it Google docs already? No, this is an attachment. This is okay. What we can do is upload the right ones to Google Docs. I think there's two of them here, there's capital right and then there's. What's this other one, it's capital and expense expenses. So do we just do the capital one right, there's only one that we usually do, at least in parks and cultural affairs. Do we do both of them, because what I'm proposing is that we put it into Google docs. You make a tab of this because it's in Excel for each of the different board members and then each board member goes in and does what either do it through color coding or do it through ranking. But the thing with that is that we technically ca not conduct business over supposedly over emails and stuff, like that. So the way that we would have to do it is you get the sheet you input. Whatever you want to input, then you send it back to me because, ideally it was meant to be done. Like an in- person like I I'm domingo. The way we it's a suggestion. The way we did it in healthy environment was. We just went to the items we know number one. So you see the experience and then we just asked should that stay number one. So just stay number two, and if we did, if we wanted to add something to the list, people can just shout that out and then we just all right so which one did they do tanya they did the expense first and then the capital last we did the expense for, because that's where the most of the conversation is, you know it's at the expense I'll read over what we have as business development and I'm looking at the expense priorities. So the committee's first priority was spanish- speaking health inspectors. The second priority was funding for Business Committee resources, Guide for new and existing businesses. Number three was education campaigns on potential impact of the inward rezoning on businesses and number four was marketing. Support for businesses. Is there anything folks want to add? Or would you like to modify how the committee ranked it? I have one suggestion yes, number two, which is funding for a business committee, resource guide for new existing businesses because of the climate that we're in maybe make that number one. Okay, instead of number two we still do not have. We still need to address the spanish- speaking health inspectors, but since there is, I just feel like we need some type of we. You know the resource guide, how people can navigate. Maybe that would include like resources and law and federal aid, and things like that might end up being it's just my opinion, so yeah, because the thing is that the inspectors were also raised during today's conversation, when Peter spoke about how you have individuals who just come in there, imagine language being a barrier on top of that sure all right domingo. When I'm looking at these four right, I think I'm with Tanya. I think the resource guide should be number one, because everyone's challenged right now. Okay, I think personally, spanish- speaking, health inspectors should be number two, because you know, as even you know, Peter brought up before about you know possible, like over policing of certain demographics, making sure that you know there's an equity involved with you know, with how inspections go so on and so forth to accommodate the demographic that we have in our neighborhood number. Three, I think, should be marketing support for businesses, because, along the lines with the support along lines, with the support for existing businesses and in terms of resources like marketing, is going to be key to get the foot traffic going again as we hopefully get in the spring, and we're able to save some of these businesses and I'll be honest, like the resulting piece of it. Even though it's important it's going to be changing like it's still in court right now, and it's going to be going back and forth. So I'm not sure if we can hang our hat on anything there. Okay cool. I agree with nobles the whole order. Okay, does anybody disagree perfect? So what else we're looking at? Is there anything we should add to the to the request and just step back here. This is for the money from the Manhattan borough president's office to actually provide these resources. Or what exactly is this? I think this is for recommendations for citywide, so I think that this is submitted to city agencies, so I'm assuming ours would go to SBA and other city agencies that we identify within the priorities lauren. This is your time to shine girl. Let's do this going to add something to this man? Okay, what do we need? What do we need? So what we're trying like explain it again to me right. It's just priorities that our community, our committee identifies priorities, and then these are sent over to city agencies to be able to understand the needs of particular communities. So it's basically just suggestions that we're giving city agencies around a ways they could. They should spend their budget and the number remind me what the number one was. I remember agreeing with it number one was funding for business community resource guide for new and existing businesses. Number two is spanish speaking health inspectors. Number three is marketing. Support for businesses and number four is education campaign on potential impact of the rezoning on businesses yeah? No, I would, I would agree with all of that I mean I think, from this phone conversation when Jennifer was on before I spent a lot of my time talking to different bar and restaurant owners that have no idea that certain resources are available to them. It is absolutely key above marketing and everything else, and then spanish speaking, you know working with Jeff Garcia from Wahi and, like the whole, like Dikeman Group, and you know, this is something that you know. English is my first language and it's clearly a severe pain point when it comes to the state liquor authority when it comes to health department, when it comes to all the Department of transportation, the DCA, the Dc, like all these departments, are you know if I speak English as my first language, and you know I was an english teacher and I'm having trouble understanding what the guidance is saying, because it's so ambiguous, then how is anybody who is not does not have English as their first language able to understand this? So it's very important question: lauren. Is there a text system for small businesses that provides you with communication? Similar to how we have in the DOE, where it's like, there's central communication systems, where you're able to update into a texting system where you're constantly communicated on hey this new legislation was passed that might impact small businesses. So, like a suggestion for SBA, basically, because I think communication was one of the the lack of communication or the overwhelming amount of people, communicating seem to be a problem during the pandemic yeah, I mean I've kind of whittled it down to my sources and it's not to say it's not still overwhelming and there's misinformation flying around everywhere. Right now, like even propane heaters versus vestibules versus fifty percent versus forward side. Like everyone, no one knows the answers to these things because they actually have not been. You know the mayor just wanted to come out and announce it without having a clear- cut guidance on exactly how this is going to work between the fdny between the DOB and the DOB as multiple divisions that have to get involved in this through city planning and the DOT whatever. So, no, I do not think we have something like that. Tara might correct me, but I do not. I do not get any kind of updates of that nature. Yeah I've got one. I've got something to add to so for lauren's pain point here. I've got something to add to this. I think it's a little bit different than resources. Can we add a virtual org chart of city departments and responsibilities online org chart, because if we have all these different divisions, saying like they're in charge of this they're in charge of that, but it's more like word of mouth passed down, freaking oral tradition in terms of who who's responsible for what and who can help you? Let's get this down online. So it's like an interactive org chart. We should put expenses to making that happen. So can we add that to this list? You know what I also noticed nobles as well, that these the city agencies were actually providing updates pretty frequently on their online sites. The thing is, I felt like people, I do not know if it's access, but people were not just reading it, because a lot of the questions I would get, I would refer them to the SBA site, they'd be like well, I ca not find it. I go on to it and it was literally like the front page, the home page of the, as so. I think it's like how do we make it more accessible or you know like? I think it also has to do a lot with accessibility, because there's this misnomer, where people automatically assume that, because a business owner is bringing in capital like these folks have an understanding of technology, for instance, you know what I'm saying I think technology is part of it, but I think it's also a lot tara and I had this conversation earlier, where I am fortunate right now that I'm not in triage, so I can work on my business instead of in my business I was in triage. I did not have employees, we had to lay most people off so the moment we were able to bring almost all of our staff back. I was able to suddenly free up this time. I did not even know what to do with myself and I'm like[ _ _]. I need to start advocating. I need to start figuring this out and taking control of my destiny and a lot of people are not in that position. You know, like Jennifer is her own employer. You know she is the employee, so how is she supposed to be spending all this time? Understanding you know what's available to her and and advocating or getting involved in these different conversations, because she does not have the time to do it. She has to run her business, and this is a triage situation that many many business owners are in and they ca not afford to bring people back to help, so they can work on their business instead of in their business yeah. So Christina you were going to say something yeah, I was going to say as a financial coach that helps individuals with all these applications. They're, not the easiest to understand you know sometimes they're. Just like super long. You know it's difficult language to understand like it's even difficult for me. Sometimes- and you know, I can understand why a local citizen or a small business owner who has those all these other things to take care of as lauren is saying- may not necessarily have the time and also understand the application, so I feel like there should be more local people. You know just explaining one two three. This is how you apply. This is what you're, legible and you know three making it super simple to understand. They're, not always easy trust me too, and then going back to the list of the expenses. I wanted to say that, along with what lauren was saying, making sure that the resources are bilingual, you know that you know that they give them in English, but also in spanish, because you know we have a lot of people in our organ in our community. That wo not be able to. You know, read a english application, a domingo. Yes may I may I thank you for Christina. Those are excellent points I wanted to see. Is it possible? Does this make any sense? You know how like we had navigators for the new healthcare with aca? Is it possible? We can have like a navigator system for businesses. You know where people like, as far as what christine was saying where there are places and people where they can go to navigate them to the resources that they, you know, based on their situation. Technically that's available tanya because they have a 181st next to the post office. They have a they have. Well, you have the bid on 181St right who applies for grants to be able to educate businesses down the block from there. You have workforce one right who does not work with individuals, but also works with businesses right, I believe, there's other city agencies within that building as well, that are supposed to be providing some sort of resources to local small businesses. The question is, I think, without well yeah. I think that we're going in a feedback loop here, because the term resources and our number one objective here or our number one choice here- is so broad yeah we're having a conversation on the specifics of what resources are, and so, if we want to put the specifics of a resource into this, then we need to align on what that is. But if not, we can let resources. You know in the current form of it, be the umbrella, because I think how previous pete folks did it was they wanted to make sure that it was broad enough where it did not limit what resources certainly not doing that yeah. Maybe those navigators can be expanded. You know, because I do not know like it seems, like people still do not know what research are available. So I do not know if we do have those systems in place. Maybe you know I do not know like. I said I just feel like there's still so many people who do not know. So we have a potential ass right now tanya, so we have the business, navigate the business resource navigators to make it more specific, and then we have nobles having a virtual city map, basically yeah the agencies are and what they provide organizational chart, yeah responsibilities and roles, and I think we got a case to really push this and make this higher up on the list, because you know the board only made it like number that the resource guy or whatever we end up, calling it 42. You know. So if we really could push right now to really push this up due to the situation that we're in and hopefully we can convince the board to make this higher up on the overall priority list. We need to go hard. That's just a 40-second, lo, actually you're right, tanya items yeah! I do not want it all the way at the bottom. I do not want to get into the board voting. Let's get into there's two items that want to be added to sure yeah. So is everybody? Okay with those two items, explain them one more time, just so we're clear. So you have item which would be number 45 right: Noble's categorized it as a business, I'm sorry an organizational chart with roles, yeah online organizational chart with roles and responsibilities of virtual right, yeah virtual organizational chart, yeah of roles and responsibilities of of city organizations or city departments responsible, for we already said responsibilities of city departments. I just want to say that I think that is extremely powerful. I am still trying to navigate. I remember meeting with Senator Jackson and starting to talk about certain items, and I had a woman a lobbyist next to me, who's absolutely amazing and she's like yeah. That's not really what that what he does! That's something and I'm like! Oh really, so it's like it's so confusing to know who has control over what and exactly for what. So I think that it's very powerful to have something like that: yeah government transparency, online resource for roles and responsibilities. You got this all right. So what we're talking about is number 45 again virtual organizational chart of roles and responsibility for city agencies. I think that we put that as number two to be quite honest, because even you know spanish we're just we're just saying: that's, not just yeah, and then the next one is the resource navigator for small businesses. Is that what you were referring to Tony yeah, because if there is a way for us? Oh yes, all right, yeah, all right! So now we have to. We have to tequila yeah. Now, let's I know right, let's all right, so what number would these fall into? Do? We have to redo everything, so nobles is suggesting that the virtual agencies be number one number two number two, the org chart be number two, because that falls underneath a more specific resource and spanish- speaking business owner or not. You need to know who can help you and if that's not readily accessible and known, everything else is defunct yeah, but I also think that having a resource navigator is actually better off trying to think of scale, though domingo. You ca, not have a lot well think about it like this right. If you have somebody who does not might not understand, the virtual aspect may not know how to navigate the world wide web right. A navigator is somebody who serves as a facilitator. To that you know what I'm saying understood. I understand that it's about how do we create a larger impact, but then, at the same time, how can we measure impact when it's so disproportionate? You know what I'm saying: what we're trying to do is provide access to those historically marginalized. Then, if I make, if I make it, if I may make a suggestion, I think we put that under capital, because capital was more money and larger resources to get it done. That sounds like a very human resource is heavy. Oh yeah, I get what you say commitment. You know what I'm saying could be incorporated into a hub, a hub that houses these yeah. All right I mean human resources are expensive. It should be a capital project whereas like making an online resource is cheaper, so it could be an expense. Do you agree with that? Tommy? I totally agree. I see that yeah because that would take integration like you were saying, that's right. So now, let's get to the ranking cool, so nobles is recommending that this be number two. Do you want to see after the resource after the resource guide right after the resource guide yeah? I totally agree because it's totally but in the community, that's predominantly spanish speaking. If they do not know who to go to what's the point well, they're coming to them, they do not go. Does the government agency ever come to you when you're, not in trouble? These health inspectors go to them? There's no yeah when they got ta, give them a ticket? No, they just go to give random expenses inspections, that's right, yeah, but if they have not, so we had a meeting a couple meetings ago. I'm sorry Christina, you wanted to say something I'll go after you. No, you guys go ahead, I'm going to go ahead, Christina, I'm confused! So we're are we making the resource guide number one or the navigator number one resource guide number one navigator because Noble's brought in and it makes sense it's a capital expense, because you would need a place to house them, so it would be like if we do create like a small business of having a business navigator, something that's ideal for the hub. Exactly okay, I get it. Thank you. So this is strictly about the ranking of like an online guide to roles and responsibilities. You know within the city infrastructure I think of it as number three honestly followed by the marketing. I'm fine with that, like dude, I'm totally fine with that yeah cause. I think like seeing last year, there was a lot of businesses that came complaining about inspectors, tiny remember that they would get the fines. I remember oh yeah, oh yeah, it happened last meeting yeah. Oh no. Last year it was like last year. No last year was like every meeting complaining about health inspector. You guys got it. Let's make it number two, I'm with it all right cool. So so we got number five would be inward rezoning. But again that's back and forth on the course. I'm going to re- read the expenses one being funding for Business Committee resources, guide, funding for Business Committee resource guide for a new and existing for new and existing businesses. Number two would be spanish- speaking health inspectors. Number three would be virtual organizational chart of roles and responsibility for city agencies. Number four would be marketing support for businesses and number five would be education campaign on potential impact of the inwardly zoning on businesses. Perfect great one. Last thing: sorry guys, yes, number one, I'm wondering if, along with it being online, if there's a way that we can print them out in English and Spanish, I think it just it just implied resource guide and say we could add funding for Business Committee resource guide, virtual and physical yeah. There you go because again, not everyone has access to you, know electronic devices or knows how to do it. So if we can like have someone give them out to all the businesses in the community, I do not know how you would do double covey but find a way where it's like every no one can say hey. I did not see it online because you got that printout. Maybe we mail it out or something like that. I do not know all right, so I reworded it to funding for Business, Committee, virtual and physical resource guide for new and existing businesses. There you go. Thank you all right. Is there anybody that disagrees with the ranking so all in favor of the rankings ranking as they stand hi I he's still here. Yeah his screen is off. I do not see him come here all right and then Cindy is going online, all right so Cindy's in favor as well I'll show it just that works all right. Francisco are you there? He does not look like he's here, anymore, all right cool, so I mean he's still on the list, but maybe he's you know off away from the computer. Oh I'll ask him when he gets back so, let's switch over now to let's switch over now to capital cool. Look at what you got at number, one: look: how quickly he's going to fit into the what nobles, with the navigating it kind of fits already yeah, because I see items here that I was going to call, for instance, the corner project: oh yeah, additional services offered by SBS yeah. Let's change this one to add the: how do we want to label that? So it's descriptive enough for them to understand yeah, so we're looking at business training, capacitation hubs additional to services offered by SBS? That's where we would add, then the navigators correct? Yes, absolutely up to including small business coaches, navigators in person, coaches, slash navigators, not necessarily it could be virtual. It could be in person, but there's someone there like. If for questioning correct, let me just copy and paste that because- and we should add the old up to and including you know, so it's like everything in between down a personal. You know personal coaching, yeah, sorry all right! So we have you good yeah, I'm just opening up a new Excel sheet, since it was a pdf format. I could not edit it. Oh, you did not open the excel that you attached that it's a pdf expenditure. I love the cats L'oreal just they are like. We want attention now. This is our time mama. If there's a keyboard, a cat will walk on it. There there's no ifes or butts about that, thankfully no keyboard, although the tail swishes on ever so often so all right cool. So here we go and you sent me the Excel sheet to Mingo. Oh, I did yeah man, it's in your email, oh no, because I think I found only the I opened up the pdf, but it's okay, all right, so we're looking at business, training capacity, capacitation, yeah and we're, including so after the parentheses up to and including personal coaches, slash navigators for local businesses, including personal up to and including up to and including personal coaches and slash navigators for local businesses, resource levels, small businesses, resource navigators, okay, fantastic, and that is currently ranked as number one. I think that's number one out of the three that we've got here for sure and business facade improvement funding. I do not know about this. One guys I do not think so, like business has changed completely in New York. I do not think facade is a big deal. I think, like weatherproofing will be a big deal in terms of outdoor eating and things like that. I'm not sure if they count that in this agreed, so weatherproofing yeah like outdoor eating, hate[, _, _] dude, I mean it should be like that's good, bigger like it should be bigger. It should also be we've closed down streets before it should be an entire to your point, amigo an entire infrastructure statement here, where it's not just money yeah, it's all about the city planning aspect of it exactly so like weatherproofing, safer streets initiatives in terms of we shut down streets and summer times or whatever for like bigger dining experiences like there's a lot, I'm not even sure how we even package all of that in but the money that needs to go to that should be a capital expense. Here we are legislating. Absolutely! No, I agree absolutely and Plaza investments. I think like seeing what yes what's happening. Indictment gives us. Yes, I felt as a driver also like that them closing down that street did not really impact my ride. As I assumed right, I think it's very important to also identify that there are closable streets that do not necessarily impact the traffic flow of a street. You know it's just being very strategic and that's where city planning comes in, so maybe it's a line item. Maybe it's a new light item and we put this Mofo as like number 10 between nothing and the rest of them is that we put like we put traffic? No, that would not be it. I think you like it. It's a community city like a city planning strategy to be able to or a study on, city planning. This is straight to the point infrastructure in business in business, subsidy infrastructure and business subsidy support for optimized, open restaurants- I mean, but it's like I was going to like the reason why I was stuttering. There is because it's restaurants, but it's also like I guess restaurants, are like the only thing that really needs help from a business perspective in that regard, like you're, not shopping for clothes on the street right I mean city fairs and stuff, but that's easy. You can shut down the street for no time and business support and in business incentives. You said right, you know subsidies of cities yeah because we should get. I mean as rich as New York is to your point like we should be getting subsidies if the rich pay their fair share when it comes to the health of our communities and when it comes to small business, so infrastructure and business subsidies to support the optimization of outdoor dining. Yes, yeah, I mean I'm sorry to jump in here. I'd be listening. This is something that lauren and I would be all for. She just took her dog for a walk, but I'm sorry to interrupt, but this is huge. This is something that we would welcome hugely. I know she was in the past talking to Gail Brewer's office, about making it easier for street seats and street closures for outdoor dining for uptown, that this is very common downtown and you hardly see it uptown at all. Why is more of this going on uptown? So I also think it goes back to the point of the disproportionate like how certain communities are even looking at that slay right and I think that's something that we have to discuss and potentially bring to our committee is the disproportionate impact on or the disproportionately ticketing of businesses within our community 100 percent. So, for instance, there has to be a study on how do they identify what businesses to target, because technically it's like you're not going to have a random inspector, just walking all the time in Washington Heights. While you have Queens like as an epicenter right now and you're, not hearing yeah, you get what I'm saying so add that study to the list- domingo, that's not on here or represented! Add that to the list, like a study of I do not know what it would be, but it would violation policing over inspecting like over policing over inspecting that would be subjective to put over inspecting, but just say a report on inspections, or something like that. I can say that I know that the Department of Health from our experiences and all the communications we've gotten from them has made. I do not know where this came down from, but a strong effort in this time to have their inspections be more about education and not about ticketing and fining. We had an inspector that came from the Department of Health, pretty much everyone's had at least one by now since Kovitz started, and they really focused on our procedures and our guidelines for dealing with Covid-19 and dealing with patrons and staff, because the guidelines are from the Department of Health alone are, I know, 10 pages it's a lot and they want you to comply with. All of that, so they're really focused on that more than they are looking at and Peter was talking about. Looking at the ice spins a little bit of this there in my experience- and I think what they've been told to do right now is not do that is to make this more educational and to not find you have a local business who one of their employees got five four thousand dollars, because she's working an eight- hour shift seven dollars into her shift. She just lowers her mask to like her nose and they get fined four thousand dollars. Well, let's do positive reinforcement here, yeah, that's the positive thicker authority that comes around for that that's the liquor authority. The religious authority is ruthless. I got no[ _ _] to contribute when it comes to how to do that. We're on the lookout now for anybody coming through whether it's described in transportation. Looking at picking apart everything with your outdoor or department of Health or State liquor authority, it's a lot. I do not know we're three out almost three hours into our meeting, so I know I know we got to hurry this up, but look. This is like the most important part, though, but it's always good that we save these. For the end, I mean parks and cultural affairs. Our list is longer than the dead sea scrolls, so feel sorry for me on my meeting next week, but like I'm presenting in that meeting so you'll be there with me one of us, but look. I think that we should add positive reinforcement here for that particular behavior that tara just brought up. We should have educators from Liquor, Authority and Department of Health. Put that specifically liquor authority and Department of Health educators on you know how to get up to code or I'm not really sure the technical language for that business training is broad enough where we could incorporate. All of that. You know so. It's like okay, like when we, when we do things like that, I think it's about us being able to write a resolution and then just sending it to the particular department. After it's approved, you know, okay, I think that's stronger yeah. I think it's true identify the SLA, but we're so crunched for a time right now, with the town halls and the testimonies to be able to develop. That, then that's another, like that's a that's something else that we would have that: okay, no, that's fair yep. So what I would say is then we have so those three items are I removed the corner project, one being that I have not heard from them. If that sounds okay with everybody, I mean. How do you remove that? Do not we just like list it last. Oh, you want. You want to still list it, because I do not know. We do not know what their situation is because they they've never come. How are they on this list? They just so you know that they do hold some meetings. They I've been at those they're doing stuff. I was just on one oh about two months ago, a month and a half ago where they are trying to steal. They are doing stuff they. Just because of you know we have not. We just have not brought them before us for anything, but we're active. I do not mean to keep them there, yeah just keep making it. Let's make it last right, it's just last. That's all thanks johnny, because I personally have not, they usually were very like they would always communicate with us. I have not heard anything from you sure. Let's make it last yeah all right, so I think that's it right or we have to vote on this. So let me just make sure that everybody knows what we have on the list so far. We're looking at these are the items we have business training, slash, capacitation hubs additional to services offered by SBS up to and including personal coaches and resource navigators, I[ _ _] love it. Oh I'm sorry number one that was too much now. I think we could put this these two together, which was the weatherproofing for outdoor dining, safer streets initiatives and plaza investments. Yes, well, not really, not really. I think that could be standalone. The three of those you should put those together. It's all about infrastructure. I mean I was going to follow up with this one, which was infrastructure and business subsidies to support optimizing of outdoor dining, which is some sort of correlation, but I think they could stand alone, yeah and then finally, funding for a new facility for the Washington Heights Corner Project, Hi Ashley, five Francisco is still here.
