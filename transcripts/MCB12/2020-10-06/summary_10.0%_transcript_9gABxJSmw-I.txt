This is a perfect time if any of the small business owners have would like to speak first due to time to be able to switch it up.
How, we could function as a bridge with other city agencies to make sure that the proper resources are distributed equitably amongst the community, small business owners, and with that said, I would like to matter of fact.
Our business opened about 20 years ago, January of 2000, so we've been on this lower end for a long time making a difference in the community.
We got a small grant from them, but basically our online store is the reason we still exist and then thank God for Community League of the heights.
So there was no problem in terms of the rents and maintenance, because folk were able to give reprieves based on you know the fact that we've been in the community, the we were close shut down And then we were trying to get monies from agencies in the community.
Know, get some continuity in terms of agencies that are in the community, and how can we, you know, improve the quality of life on this end of Washington Heights, with what I've been trying to do over the years So that did not work for me and then now, there's still the same, disconnect the same problems still exist, and it's almost you feel like it's futile because you know who can you talk?
You beauty yourself, all right in terms of community and those kind of things that we need help with on this end and then just to organize the commercials that are in the in the area.
Funding stream, you know like Mwbe, was extremely important, but that's something we could talk offline, about , You read my mind, so that was one thing: I was going to bring up to Jennifer if she knew about the Mwbe Let you know that you can still try to go ahead and apply for the Eidl loan.
Think, after six months of restaurant tours being patient and relying on you, know, government officials on the state, level, the you know the city level on all levels that we just needed to start having our own voice.
So I, really appreciate this kind of forum, where somebody can really talk to us about what is needed in order for businesses to survive, because every day right, now, like the business acrosss, the street from Tower just went out all these little mom- And you're, trying to figure out the new guidance and all these other things that I'm fortunate enough in this moment that I have some time to put people together and make some initiatives and try to push for to be heard.
Have, you heard of any resolutions from any other community boards like that, because maybe the Manhattan borough president could be pretty good in that regard?
The restaurant industry is hispanic like these are major numbers and going to impact uptown much more than it's going to in different, not more There's all these different people.
I would not say we had the north End food hall in twice in front of our committee and right before all I'm glad that you're involved in that I'm really hoping that they can, you know, find a way to survive this and open at some point, because we were, you know, anticipating that a great deal, but I want to ask you: what is the name of your organization?
It, truly only started September 1st Writing that letter supporting outdoor dining or Senator Jackson Right, now, working on a bill again like That, is going to hopefully correct the SLA so that they stop do using these gotcha tactics.
And they're working with us, instead of against us, like we have these different initiatives, But, when they're announced by a politician, it everybody, the regular people, the normal population just starts tearing it down.
Think that there's ingenuity within restaurant tours and business owners in general and they need to have the overall CDC guidelines to make sure that we're doing what the CDC says.
You, know because you go to Europe, you go to these, you go to Spain And, you see how, like you see the difference in, and the importance of city, planning.
So we could, you could be one of our collaborators and we can all work together in creating a space where we are able to identify and have different lenses right being able to hear the barber shop owners, the salon owners, the Delis, and get a strong enough response from the community where we could provide city hall with actual like hey look.
Do I mean a lot of times, especially the people on community boards is a thankless.
It's, where people share, whether with a guy who has the barber, meets the Beautician, meets the doctor when they come and they share that's the real oral tradition of bars and what it means to our community.
A percentage at a time, but this got to be attacked now, along with this, real estate, is have to be required when they have empty stores to light those stores up not to shutter them not to make them look what they used to look like back in the 60s and 70s and 80s, and you guys were puppies- And I was still running around, but now it's attractive to what drug dealers to people who will want to go to sleep and do not confuse homelessness with those who are psychologically deprived and need 24-hour care.
Small business people they're not there to come in and whip us and beat us and then find us they're there to come and help us, because we are a service to this great city.
They could not organize their own garbage can if you have any questions, go ahead, all right, so we have stack And I rely on a lot of things that you said, especially in regards to everything in terms of budget justice and the help for small business and also our homeless and mentally ill community.
What's, the first thing, the guys who have small business going to cut out insurance- You know what happens with that two things, one, the breaking the law.
They have no money to back up one mistake: They make and they're out of business so that people are going to stop paying certain bills.
Oh, we looked into your ice machine Then they can close them and do what they want, but they can't the whole owners how small business going to pay any of these fines they going to play these fines right now , We had some very interesting customers and people.
He woods in selling the food, so vertical farms should be developed in especially cities and places like Washington Heights in Harlem and Brooklyn, and we have a guy on vented vertical farms right, marshmallows.
I know you started in a commercial We did that commercial and the deal we did At. We like to give people enough money that has an impact instead of a couple thousand dollars.
Right because, like the reality is the federal government can print as much money as they want and they know it.
Just saying like all right do not count us out, though you know, because resilience is very, is within our community.
My biggest thing was being able to have it in different sections right, because we know we've had meetings during Corona, where we had about 150 to 200 people in the zoo, and it could become very hectic.
Ladies and gentlemen I do not know how you feel about this, but have you what would you think about utilizing polls during the town hall to get people's feedback and opinions during the town, Hall, or one of the things that I was going to ask them was as part of a sign- up sheet where we could also build our get folks emails contact information just being able to ask them what were their top three top four most urgent needs and being able to use a form as a prerequisite like a prerequisite to be able to collaborate, nobles, you're, muted.
I'm, wondering like is the objective of this to be an aide to the businesses, or is it more of a community awareness in terms of what our businesses are going through and how we can best support?
You know help the mindset of the business owners to build more structure around you know organic organization like Lauren's been doing and stuff like what do we want the objective and the specific target audience of these particular town halls to be And, I think, having a resolution come out of that where we are able to use the testimony and the commentary provided, gives us enough fuel to be able to write something That's perfectly clear, Like one of the more tangible objectives in that is to come out with a very strong ass, resolution , We could technically do we function as a bridge right We function as a bridge, but we could do what we can do.
So that way, it's like we're, not crowdsourcing, a resolution from the get- go, but we come with the foundation that we get broad alignment and we can start to enhance from there It's also source that developing like the infrastructure, right, So, maybe like we make it into different sections: small business, loans.
Some people just do not know any better bro and as I'm, Not even I'm, not even trying to justify, but just some folks just do not know any better, and our goal is not necessarily to antagonize but to be able to provide a narrative that it's, like all right, cool, just hear it out and let's build capacity towards that, and that should be an expectation.
We could have a segment on the importance of we want to do a series of trainings, but not as a community, but as a city which I think it's much more impactful I mean I did speak to you guys well in the email prior email about the plan that I had that I think could work similar to the grading system in the restaurant, so places are held accountable and you can anonymously send them a communications to a board or an agency where they're already an agency for that The human rights, But I, can't go into a restaurant and know that information.
What are their options and who should they contact similar to like a The licensing committee does a good neighbors sign, as some of the requirements often were there so they're going to be parts of whatever we come up with that are going to be treading the line of policy and basically self- policing So you know if we want to have a policy conversation, because you know to Francisco's point here from a discriminatory standpoint that you know a lot of the vacant.
Right, like one section, whereas we're hearing what the community has to say what organizations have actually helped them, out, or I.
You know like we're providing information, whether it's like how to access the small business loans.
I do not know who would do that, but people who are trying to open up businesses right now, like people who might be in was in the pro in the process before everything happened, or they are trying to open.
So I think that it's important for buy- We had a zoom call and a lot of people got to just you know.
It's really identifying first, and I think that Peter had a lot of good ideas of like what are these overarching things that are going to help every industry in our community, and that goes after the real estate that and the landlords that goes after the crime side of things and lighting up everything like even all these non- profits.
I. Do not think they're going to have time coming up soon, too, as well, like all of that, and at the same time, too, I do not want to put this off for next year, but I do not think to the table It might just be something we do in January.
I know folks have talked about like what the next six months holds in speaking to some business owners on my block and domingo.
If I need to get out of the country real quick, you know, but look, listen, so December meeting, right.
Who needs to know about Eidl, the most right before December and, like who?
I do not know the whole thing, so I do not know who would be to identify first, but I feel like retail heading into Christmas If we're going to do retail, we should definitely invite the department of consumer affairs because they are the ones who inspect retail businesses and do all of that and license them.
You know they deal with businesses, but I do feel like identifying other agencies that cross with those sectors, I think, is extremely important.
Let folks know that we do have the Washington Heights commercial districts needs assessment, which would be helpful for folks, For, full service, restaurants, 36, etc, And , then I mean even with the coffee shops they're pretty heavy in the neighborhood.
That's important that we look after those entrepreneurs, of course, and then we invite bars and restaurants back in our January meeting to kind of see where we're at, And I think it's extremely important for us to be able to frame the conversation as well.
I would, though, like to get lauren to speak on the her petition for next month, because that potentially helps other small businesses hear what what's already going on within the different sectors and hopefully inspire them to do.
I mean I think, from this phone conversation when Jennifer was on before I spent a lot of my time talking to different bar and restaurant owners that have no idea that certain resources are available to them.
You, know the mayor just wanted to come out and announce it without having a clear- cut guidance on exactly how this is going to work between the fdny between the DOB and the DOB as multiple divisions that have to get involved in this through city planning and the DOT I've got something to add to so for lauren's pain, point here.
The thing: is, I felt like people, I, do not know if it's access, but people were not just reading it, because a lot of the questions I would get.
You know what I'm saying I think technology is part of it, And I had this conversation earlier, where I am fortunate right now that I'm, not in triage, so I can work on my business.
Sometimes, and you know I can understand why a local citizen or a small business owner who has those all these other things to take care of as lauren is saying, may not necessarily have the time and also understand the application.
Like people still do not know what research are available.
I said: I just feel like there's still so many people who do not know.
Think like seeing last year , there was a lot of businesses that came complaining about inspectors, tiny, remember that they would get the fines.
If we can like have someone give them out to all the businesses in the community.
I do not know all right, so I, reworded it to funding for Business, Committee, virtual and physical resource guide for new and existing businesses.
One, guys I, do not think so, like business has changed completely in New York.
York is to your point like we should be getting subsidies if the rich pay their fair share when it comes to the health of our communities and when it comes to small business, so infrastructure and business subsidies to support the optimization of outdoor dining.
There has to be a study on how do they identify what businesses to target, because technically it's like you're not going to have a random inspector, just walking all the time in Washington Heights.
