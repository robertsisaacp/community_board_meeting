She will do more odd number to follow up on discussions from the last meeting, Hey Isabella's request for books and magazines, the future of meetings, seniors and community unable to join meetings because of lack of equipment, technology, skills, etc, long lines of businesses, including banks, post office, etc, making it extremely difficult for the seniors and disabled.
So a little more space here for myself and for the kids, but watching and listening to what's going on in the city closely I can't say it makes me want to return home soon, guys we're good thank God. So Tara your mother.
I mean I'm on their climate, democracy, working group and And I'm, not sure if it's for you or through fern what the issues are that are communities facing with respect to getting the air conditioners that were supposed to be provided by the city , how they eligibility might have changed and also you know, utilization and what they might do during the pandemic.
You know, I think we're going to taste a huge crisis, Oh great, and otherwise the other issue has come up in what I guess is the noise issue?
So I have a question for Sally this issues that you would like to add to the new business part of the meeting, or just these are just random questions that you have, the air condition you know for information, so I'll wait until the end.
Think the library has some special procedures once they reopen how they're going to handle books that come back into circulation, You know books with a lot of pictures, because a lot of the residents are, you know quite elderly and some have Alzheimer's Maybe you know, books with that, have different kinds of pictures, whether the history books or you know, but some that there's not a lot of reading involved because they do not have the concentration you know and the ability to focus.
I spoke to Domingo Estevez who's, the chair of the Business Development Committee I, spoke to him yesterday and one of the thoughts that he had was trying to reach out to you know, rather than change the hours, because some of them have hours for seniors like 8 o'clock in the morning.
Do you mean, meaning if I, if I owned a Rite Aid, do I have to have a senior error at the beginning of the day or the end of the day or just if I decide to on my own and Every business is deciding on their own I think that businesses are deciding on their own because right, If I had support from you, know elected officials and making this more something that they more pressure somehow.
We, have Domingo who's, the chair of the Business Development Committee, and we're hoping that between all these people, perhaps we can reach out to the businesses, and you know plea for their help with this.
This kind of thing, I, agree: I recorded the local bounty They have a senior line just specifically for seniors of people with disabilities and if they have someone on line that will take care of them My, you know, get up my better a Oklo to get a six o'clock to get ready and since I that for most of the seniors also have home attendant and they do not start working.
I will feel much better to see something like that done, that implementing or trying to implement some rules and regulation, the business You know and a person and people say.
I need to speak with Eliezer and a CEO yet, and you know, I want to pick up on a whole bunch of things that people said.
Do not, but I can only speak for a certain fact of the community that I've observed a few things, so there might be a little more tool both of the bank seem to be able to do then I kind of walk people ahead and have their own mechanisms.
I know that if you have certain things that you do not need they're able to skip people around, and they do not have an issue with that.
And then, when I actually got to the office, areas going to, they said, arrive no more than 15 minutes before your appointment Then you can come up because they do not want a lot of people.
I'm sure they will, because that's not a big issue and they also have to You know it's making it more difficult to educate people to stay on lines for so long, right.
If we get, you know, R 3, R, 3, board people who have access in a familiar way with those businesses and the.
I, just at least in my neighborhood I- think it's more business are hurting You can, because they're trying to make up for lost revenue that they do not know will ever come back and now that's you.
That, because I'm a person who's very much against the you know the unenclosed out, you know, sidewalk cafes or in close to whatever it might be, if they're compromising the ability for the disabled to get by, there's no way I'm going outside, because not only people idiots for setting them off, but they're idiots and do not have particularly good aim.
In, the past, historically senior centers have been cooling, centers, other locations have been cooling, centers I think they're actually going to be opening some senior centers as cooling, centers they're, making it optional now, and it's only going to be for their seniors, not for the general public, but in order to accommodate other seniors who might not be willing to go out or able to go out during Corona, there has been a very big high push campaign, That's, still not over to get three air conditioners to the seniors installed in their homes and basically the senior centers have been making hundreds and hundreds of calls.
You can contact, especially for seniors and people that have low exposure, so I think we have to take advantage and in another way to you, know these new condition.
Okay, good with the population we serve in the nursing home, any Megan extremely frail, but they also they do not have in each person does not have an iPad Let's get a zoom thing together, and then you get three or four people or five of one of ten populations.
Did we ever report any such number, so I need to tell you that fact is not accurate and if you want I can send you the link I believe it was already sent out in a prior email with the Health and Environment Committee Actually, that particular website contains all of the deaths in all nursing homes in New, York, State We have done everything by the book by the book.
All over the state I have a problem with a resolution that signal that singles out Isabella, because it does not take much for you to look at Jewish, home or client home Amsterdam Anyone in the nursing homes in New, York State, and realize that we're right in the mix with everybody else in terms of the kinds of horrible problems that we've had in terms of death.
That is because of many of the reasons Betty outlined as to the governor's responsibility in this matter, which lead me to believe it's extremely doubtful that his health committee, his health department, will conduct a fair and complete investigation, because it would inevitably involve his wrists by disability and I want to point out that 6% of the nursing home residents, the New York State died of Kovac 19, while 14 percent of the residents died at Isabella as to what Reddy said about the excellent work in the past of Isabella before it had been acquired by Mjh Edison, now, known, I, fully agree and I.
You know- Hallows, hold this committee on this particular resolution, because you are stating a lot of fact.
You, know disperse that to our committee, members and You know the way I feel I do not know how the other field, but I do not think that will be able to vote on this particular resolution right, now.
That is really not going to carry, because until we meet back official in September, that's the only thing I'm saying thank you And It send that resolution so that we can have something to look at.
I just want to make sure that this discussion appears in the minutes, along with the resolution that I proposed, and if the committee does not wish to vote on it, then they should not Maybe.
I think that, if we're looking at this an issue of what's going on with the nursing homes, we need, as Betty mentioned, to have the data for all the nursing homes in the Community poor, district, and that has not been looked at Not a member of the committee I'm, not even a public member.
There is some issues about you know the food coming being sent to differing areas, and things like that.
