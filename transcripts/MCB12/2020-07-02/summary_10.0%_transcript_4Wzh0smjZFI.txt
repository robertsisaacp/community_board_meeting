I know how's everything going with you, thank god, I'm, actually not in the city now we're in Maryland and my mother-in-law's home, so a little more space here for myself and for the kids, but watching and listening to what's going on in the city closely I can't say it makes me want to return home soon, guys we're good thank God, so Tara, your mother, Okay, nothing has changed, we're still in a pandemic right and there are still major problems.
with all with our community in general, I think you know what if this pandemic ever ends, the next crisis we're going to face is mental health care services because of the crises that people have been through, in fact that we are not providing many of the impatient.
They have a car full of like fifty five items, but anyway, that would be something that we need to promote to be kind to one another, no one's ours, Ella's ours I want to pick up on a whole bunch of things that people said:: okay, I, don't I, The, goodwill of business people, that's happening, , a that's, maybe a little more challenge than it sounds like for local stores, with narrow aisles and small spaces and what it means to weave one of us through those spaces in close contact, I Think.
You know it's making it more difficult to educate people to stay on lines for so long right, If we do, if we do send requests on the committee or the board since the request I'm sure they will they will, they will set up a line where we're on the other we will be, will have I mean priority, but You know in a in a organized way.
There's no way I'm going outside, because not only people idiots for setting them off, but they're idiots and don't have particularly good aim and I really don't want a roman candle landing in my stomach and I'm sure that those same concerns are affecting people at Isabella and the elderly throttle community people can't sleep and they don't feel safe when they go outside, Survey: I walked between 187th Street and Fort Washington, and a hundred and seventy fifth in Broadway yesterday and I didn't see one restaurant that had actually followed the guidelines which, in addition to six feet apart for the tables, include having a barrier and allowing for eight feet of sidewalk space for pedestrians beyond the barrier.
You know in this type of crisis I had mentioned previously because they had done work for some folks in Dyckman that people are concerns about and they were able to kind of not only make sure that people had an understanding of the rules, but had a copy of the rules that things have changed, but I think now they're a lot clearer, but after they have that conversation, they were like alright cool , we'll make certain changes that were supposed to make because again, as Maria said, that could be seeming threatening where people probably never spoken to them.
Well again, I think it's important to address that folks need to get around They need to get around safely, and it is not fair for you Mary to have to wait for people to walk by because there's so many things going on outside How can we best leverage, especially when there's a bunch of new places now, especially when the real locations are places that have been closed just to like work at the community?
Let me just back up for a minute, because the people that are not involved with you know the board, or you know, with the You want me to if the government of the aging is trying, since they can't really decide what they want to do about cooling centers, you know, In, the past, historically senior centers have been cooling, centers, other locations have been cooling, centers I think they're actually going to be opening some senior centers as cooling, centers they're, making it optional now, and it's only going to be for their seniors, not for the general public, but in order to accommodate other seniors who might not be willing to go out or able to go out during Corona, there has been a very big high push campaign, That's still not over to get three air conditioners to the seniors installed in their homes and basically the senior centers have been making hundreds and hundreds of calls Another list is dropping on Monday to seniors to see if they are eligible to get these free air conditioners, and we have had some success with it.
You know they used to have them open, or maybe we only had one in the community board district, one accessible polling, Center , they're, sorted out and sanitized just be careful As. You can imagine it's very difficult for the residents because I haven't seen family or friends in April, May , June Chats we've been doing that since the beginning, but we're also having window visits now, so people can arrange to have a window visit.
As you may know, from the press about why Governor Cuomo declared on March 25th to the hospitals to discharge patients had Colvin to the nursing home soon, even if you had a nursing home that had no call All over the state, I have a problem with a resolution that signal that singles out Isabella, because it doesn't take much for you to look at Jewish, home or client home Amsterdam Nobody wants to see that number of people die anywhere, but unfortunately it happened, but I cannot support and I Think.
Lady here for what you say: now: Maria, what you're saying now First of all the this a resolution with no second, so there was no We , didn't have a right to have a discussion on it number three, which is that probably the most important thing is that this meeting is in July, even if we come up with resolution or with both and since like that is not going to be an effective resolution, because this has to be brought in September to our committee and then to the full board at the end of September.
That is because of many of the reasons Betty outlined as to the governor's responsibility in this matter, which lead me to believe it's extremely doubtful that his health committee, his health department, will conduct a fair and complete investigation, because it would inevitably involve his wrists by disability and I want to point out that 6% of the nursing home residents, the New York State died of Kovac 19, while 14 percent of the residents died at Isabella as to what Reddy said about the excellent work in the past of Isabella before it had been acquired by mjh Edison, now known, I, fully agree In the past, the outreach which Betty supervised has been excellent and I Furthermore think she's been a big asset to the community board.
Bringing a resolution of this magnitude to front while committee, which is not going to go anyplace because this monthly Committee on the whole we don't meeting of other thing We had to go to September, so maybe also you can write J, send us something in writings and send this resolution in writing to Mary, and she will you know this You know disperse that to our committee members and don't know how the other field, but I, don't think that will be able to vote on this particular resolution right now.
I don't feel it was handled well, I think governor all know, handled a poorly I think insufficient guidelines were given to nursing homes, but with all of that, I think when one seventh of the customers of any business died, There's no way of getting around the question of the 90 of the hot 700 beds at Isabella, 98 people who had been residents of Isabella and probably infected Isabella, subsequently passed away wherever they might have died.
I believe I can't even have this conversation anymore because they listen well There's good to this community, as Isabella has been that we're being singled out , I think it's it open for discussion At this point, we need to take a vote on what I'm, not sure Maria helped me with us.
We need someone to second the resolution and then proceed to a vote, but I say that even if we take a vote in a way this has to be ratified in September, and that is like two or three months period between now and there, you know to continue working on that in the meantime, I suggest that he can send us Adam right into married, so cam married, so we can really take line by line to take a look at this resolution.
