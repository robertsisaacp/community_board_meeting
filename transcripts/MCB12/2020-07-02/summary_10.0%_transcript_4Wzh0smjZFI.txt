Isabella's, request for books and magazines, the future of meetings, seniors and community unable to join meetings because of lack of equipment, technology, skills, etc, long lines of businesses, including banks, post office, etc, making it extremely difficult for the seniors and disabled.
I know how's everything going with you, thank god, I'm, actually not in the city now we're in Maryland and my mother-in-law's home, so a little more space here for myself and for the kids, but watching and listening to what's going on in the city closely I can't say it makes me want to return home soon, guys we're good thank God, so Tara your mother.
I think, with the help of fern Hertzberg I have finally gotten the city to stop delivering uncalled for food, deliveries, Good, cheap right, the only way she and it was to send a letter on her behalf.
So I have a question for Sally this issues that you would like to add to the new business part of the meeting, or just these are just random questions that you have There was an issue because Daryl Cochrane had brought some magazines up to Isabel and security Actually Betty was you know on that meeting as well, and Betty took care of that issue.
I spoke to Domingo Estevez who's, the chair of the Business Development Committee I, spoke to him yesterday and one of the thoughts that he had was trying to reach out to you know, rather than change the hours, because some of them have hours for seniors like 8 o'clock in the morning.
Do you mean, meaning if I, if I owned a Rite Aid, do I have to have a senior error at the beginning of the day or the end of the day or just if I decide to on my own and Every business is deciding on their own I think that businesses are deciding on their own because right, If I had support from you, know elected officials and making this more something that they more pressure somehow.
We, have Domingo who's, the chair of the Business Development Committee, and we're hoping that between all these people, perhaps we can reach out to the businesses, and you know plea for their help with this.
This kind of thing, I, agree: I recorded the local bounty They have a senior line just specifically for seniors of people with disabilities and if they have someone on line that will take care of them My, you know, get up my better a Oklo to get a six o'clock to get ready and since I that for most of the seniors also have home attendant And they don't start working.
I will feel much better to see something like that done, that implementing or trying to implement some rules and regulation, the business You know and a person and people say.
But I can only speak for a certain fact of the community that I've observed a few things, so there might be a little more tool both of the bank seem to be able to do then I kind of walk people ahead and have their own mechanisms.
I know that if you have certain things that you don't need they're able to skip people around, and they don't have an issue with that.
When I actually got to the office areas going to, they said, arrive no more than 15 minutes before your appointment Then you can come up because they don't want a lot of people.
I'm sure they will, because that's not a big issue and they also have to You know it's making it more difficult to educate people to stay on lines for so long, right.
If we get, you know, R 3, R, 3, board people who have access in a familiar way with those businesses and the.
And I really don't want a roman candle landing in my stomach And I'm sure that those same concerns are affecting people at Isabella and the elderly throttle community Survey: I walked between 187th Street and Fort Washington, and a hundred and seventy fifth in Broadway yesterday and I didn't see one restaurant that had actually followed the guidelines which, in addition to six feet.
You can contact, especially for seniors and people that have low exposure, so I think we have to take advantage and in another way to you know these new condition.
We have a garden area in the back where people you know can gather outside And, then we can bring someone down to the coffee shop with they have floor-to-ceiling windows, Is, the family, member context, the social worker, and they work at a time?
Community Board twelve Manhattan urges Attorney General Letitia James to investigate the causes of the crisis at Isabella and responsibilities of mjh in this continuing crisis, be It further resolved that the state Senate and the state assembly health, committees, open investigations into the causes of the deaths and the spread of infection, said Isabella Carole.
What's being happened, what's going on, what's not going on etcetera, so I know that this has been a difficult situation in the state but Isabella and for all nursing, homes, we're not alone and whatever is going to come out of any kind of a commission or attorney general inspection.
That is because of many of the reasons Betty outlined as to the governor's responsibility in this matter, which lead me to believe it's extremely doubtful that his health committee, his health department, will conduct a fair and complete investigation, because it would inevitably involve his wrists by disability and I want to point out that 6% of the nursing home residents, the New York State died of Kovac 19, while 14 percent of the residents died at Isabella as to what Reddy said about the excellent work in the past of Isabella before it had been acquired by mjh Edison, now, known, I, fully agree and I.
A lot information there that I, don't know I would no be able to vote yes or no on this particular resolution.
Don't know how the other field but I, don't think that will be able to vote on this particular resolution right, now.
I just want to make sure that this discussion appears in the minutes, along with the resolution that I proposed, and if the committee doesn't wish to vote on it, then they shouldn't Maybe.
There's, a second to the resolution that doesn't preclude discussion of the question, no Jay We had to hold it wasn't after the after this resolution is said: We can respond, sir there's a bell of Fort, Washington or any nursing home on this committee at any time.
Is that in a sense preclude the resolution in the in the sense that as I think it was Betty who said all of the nursing homes that Cuomo referred, the patients to are being investigated.
So you can ignore what I say, but this would make me feel uncomfortable as a community board member that the research seems to not be complete or there's some question about the quality of the data, and So I think that the procedure now is Jay will send me a copy of the resolution.
I will send it to all of the people who were onboard here today and the committee members, because it's a couple of people, not here- So I think at this point that we are going to table this resolution.
There is some issues about you know the food coming being sent to differing areas, and things like that.
