While these the new faces of the license committee welcome once again, You know your background, your community, because we don't want to kill more of an intimate feeling as to who's who and why you guys are mean to a community.
We have positive comments from our neighbors and the priests and I recommend that committee members to our police are considered put on this application right.
You proceed out into the next agenda item to appear at in that number four They'll be in the purgatory for prison, say the character is not here: , okay, both I'm sorry, so looks like what I'm sorry you're right, I, second, that if you want to go in episodes, no committee, members We cannot obtain your application because we have to have that questionnaire completely filed and sent to the office at least by Friday.
I'm, sorry, okay, let's proceed in with agenda And now we're going to move to agenda item number 6, And there'll be a new liquor license Tweel m-sport pong incorporated doing business as TVA no DBA.
Based on my documentation, here, I see that there was a resolution passed by Business Committee, going back on 28 2019, and so there was some a solution passed by the committee and then a general Board by about 21 to 6 I'm, an attorney and I represent the applicant.
I mean I, don't say we will inform the community board and ask them to assist us for local help.
For many years, so we know like lots of people of the community We definitely be working in that area.
Although recommendation I would give so, the business owner is just make sure you put signage or hiring local and that you have developed some sort of flier that you distribute amongst the community, because there's gonna be a certain need for employment after this pandemic.
My question is more around and the reason I'm here is because I would like to have a dialogue with the licensing committee as the chair of a business development on how we're gonna move to truly tackle this issue of racism.
You know we're looking at situations like defunding the police, just because of that represents, but also have to be able to step up as community members to hold each other accountable, so I'm interested in knowing what would you say or potentially, how would you seek to combat any sort of discrimination as a new business?
The idea is not to punish just a business but sure that we come together as a community, and we have the same approach that we can not discriminate against anyone for anything and we're going to be very vigilant because I think that any time that we collect one small, regardless how small the issue might be, can become big and we're going to address it right away and very harshly so again.
My community, that you put a sign, adjuster Domingo, indicated to hire local, because I think this is going to be a good.
I just wanted to touch on something that kind of began last meeting where it was the first zoom meeting and our format that we've been sexually successfully fought for many years that kept these very disciplined very focused It gives space for everybody and time for everybody but sequentially and it respects an order It's not a four-hour meeting so typically for the past number of years, and we could always change it, but that would be under new business at the end.
We started changing the meeting where we allow the merchants to speak first, but before we could do that, Purchase for in the present residents or members committee members, so I'm new to the community.
I just had a question about the application that was put forth and is there a time that it becomes like that we would get to see it that it becomes more public That's on it, but I was just wondering if there was a time that I would be able to review it, or this information is given to the committee members for them to review.
The district office refused to give me the information about different applicants prior to the meeting after and the minutes, So right, now, I, don't know when we get to the general meeting, I'm, not sure exactly what I'm voting on, because I don't have full information.
Because again, it's good that we work together, because Domingo Yukimi will be more of an extra leverage, because now I can put any more pressure in making sure their businesses do bind by the principles that they are assigned, to, which would be to hire local and easy little And I think one important thing.
An important stipulations are considered moving forward, potentially adding if you've been discriminated or feel like you've, been discriminated against, potentially adding the managers number and posting that at the business just so that we co hold them accountable because they'll say: Oh I, don't know, but when they come to you or they come to me, it's like Not erase them and send them back later on to other community board.
Yes, very well, Dana we're going to request that we have a good neighbor sign, posted, so There are any restaurants that may have any issues and all clients that they will have access to someone directly right, away, that that's fine Yes, based on these four stipulations, does the rest of the committee for your comforter to move forward, or should we add some more steps?
Think that, for this particular applicant same as the one before I had to ask that'll be a signage to hire local it once they open and I.
I was just giving reference to different restaurants locations, but this one once open will also have a sign posted on the front door for hiring locally, very well committee members, any other recommendations, guys all right.
And I know I know many people feel that have been on this committee for many years residents showing up that care as much as you guys, do, and the effort that you made in terms of getting great information was made out of an interest for the community and of concern so that people can sleep at night and live in peace and that businesses can thrive.
Maybe you've always done that I, don't know, but I think that that's a great way of making this a really like a community board and not just some sort of like approval , process- Is, that there are commitments that people make I.
Member first of all, I, want to echo my dnr sentiments and in regards to making sure that we prioritize, like our local businesses, commitment to the community.
I have sat through community board meetings that have gone on for four and five hours, so All. The questions also did a stunning job in fixing the questionnaire the stipulations- What helps here- is that between the committee members and myself, most of you have grown up in this community, and you know this place inside out.
