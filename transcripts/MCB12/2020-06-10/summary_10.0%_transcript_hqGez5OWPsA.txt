While these, the new faces of the license committee welcome once again, You know your background, your community, because we do not want to kill more of an intimate feeling as to who's who and why you guys are mean to a community Roy, Dangle I.
We have positive comments from our neighbors and the priests and I recommend that committee members to our police are considered put on this application right.
You proceed out into the next agenda item to appear at in that number four They'll be in the purgatory for prison, say the character is not here: When, the prior 33rd precinct , okay, both I'm sorry, so looks like what I'm sorry you're right, I.
Second, that if you want to go in episodes, no committee, members We can not obtain your application because we have to have that questionnaire completely filed and sent to the office, at least by Friday.
Do not know v, IV I can hold on to the end no way treatments now, because the committee members do not have access I do not have access to what you wanted to hear.
Let's proceed in with agenda and now we're going to move to agenda item number 6, And there'll be a new liquor license Tweel M- sport pong incorporated doing business as TVA no DBA.
And I live in the Bronx and, We know like lots of people of the community We definitely be working in that area.
You see that, although recommendation I would give so, the business owner is just make sure you put signage or hiring local and that you have developed some sort of flier that you distribute amongst the community because there's going to be a certain need for employment after this pandemic.
My question is more around and the reason I'm here is because I would like to have a dialogue with the licensing committee as the chair of a business development on how we're going to move to truly tackle this issue of racism.
You know we're looking at situations like defunding the police, just because of that represents, but also have to be able to step up as community members to hold each other accountable, so I'm interested in knowing what would you say or potentially?
The idea is not to punish just a business but sure that we come together as a community, and we have the same approach that we can not discriminate against anyone for anything and we're going to be very vigilant because I think that any time that we collect one small, regardless how small the issue might be, can become big and we're going to address it right away and very harshly so again.
My community, that you put a sign, adjuster Domingo, indicated to hire local, because I think this is going to be a good.
We move forward and it's not a four- hour meeting so typically for the past number of years, and we could always change it, but that would be under new business at the end.
We started changing the meeting where we allow the merchants to speak first, but before we could do that, Purchase for in the present residents or members committee members, so I'm new to the community.
I just had a question about the application that was put forth and is there a time that it becomes like that we would get to see it that it becomes more public That's on it, but I was just wondering if there was a time that I would be able to review it, or this information is given to the committee members for them to review it.
There was a lot okay, so if I were you, I will check back with them about the great things that this place used to do for the community, and hopefully you could, you know, attach summaries.
There was product by the Wingo who is the chair, the common community, because again it's good that we work together, because Domingo Yukimi will be more of an extra leverage, because now I can put any more pressure in making sure their businesses do bind by the principles that they are assigned, to, which would be to hire local and easy little And I think one important thing.
An important stipulations are considered moving forward, potentially adding if you've been discriminated or feel like you've, been discriminated against, potentially adding the managers number and posting that at the business just so that we co hold them accountable because they'll say oh I do not know, but when they come to you or they come to me.
It's like I'm, going to recommend the following: first Not erase them and send them back later on to other community board.
Yes, very well, Dana we're going to request that we have a good neighbor sign, posted, so There are any restaurants that may have any issues and all clients that they will have access to someone directly right, away, that that's fine Yes, based on these four stipulations, does the rest of the committee for your comforter to move forward, or should we add some more steps?
If they'll be okay with the committee members and the residents attend, the item, number two is Flora deep, and this is every new one.
Any other committee members I do not know how you doing How. Do you vote on this?
I was just giving reference to different restaurants locations, but this one once open will also have a sign posted on the front door for hiring locally, very well committee members, any other recommendations, guys all right.
And I, know I, know many people feel that have been on this committee for many years residents showing up that care as much as you guys, do, and the effort that you made in terms of getting great information was made out of an interest for the community and of concern so that people can sleep at night and live in peace and that businesses can thrive.
And I just want to let everyone know that I spent three hours going over the video now, if I missed something I apologize, but you guys can give me suggestions, I'm, always open to it, but do not tell me what to do and how to do it.
That's consistent, so that everybody feels when they step into their space, whether it's the applicant, the precinct many members residents and others electeds and then committee votes that everybody really feels that they had their time in their space.
Member first of all, I, want to echo my dnr sentiments and in regards to making sure that we prioritize, like our local businesses, commitment to the community.
I have sat through community board meetings that have gone on for four and five hours, so All. The questions also did a stunning job in fixing the questionnaire the stipulations- What helps here- is that between the committee members and myself, most of you have grown up in this community, and you know this place inside out.
It's, not a task force, but trying to find a way how we can have businesses hire locally, so I do not know if you guys want us.
