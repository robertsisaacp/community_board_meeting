While these the new faces of the license committee welcome once again, You know your background, your community, because we don't want to kill more of an intimate feeling as to who's who and why you guys are mean to a community believe you here with the seizure on the rest of our committee, members, Ashley hi, everyone Ashley, Fernandez, I, am on licensing committee under Ysidro Approval process of sidewalk cafes.
I, hope that you stay for a while this community, because I think that you all have a lot to bring to the table number So as usual, we're going to listen, an entertaining application on the and then I say committee, we're going to decide or vote on each applicant when the residents have a comment, they're going to get a two minute time limit.
You see that, although recommendation I would give so the business owner is just make sure you put signage or hiring local and that you have developed some sort of flier that you distribute amongst the community, because there's gonna be a certain need for employment after this pandemic Now. My question is more around and the reason I'm here is because I would like to have a dialogue with the licensing committee as the chair of a business development on how we're gonna move to truly tackle this issue of racism.
You are a new business owner, so I just I'm just here to try to figure out what type of anti discriminatory practices are you looking to institute and also how will you deal with any allegations of that as a business owner, because I think the point to note that the times are demanding more of us You know we're looking at situations like defunding the police, just because of that represents, but also have to be able to step up as community members to hold each other accountable, so I'm interested in knowing what would you say or potentially, how would you seek to combat any sort of discrimination as a new business owner uptown?
The idea is not to punish just a business but sure that we come together as a community, and we have the same approach that we can not discriminate against anyone for anything and we're going to be very vigilant because I think that any time that we collect one small, regardless how small the issue might be, can become big and we're going to address it right away and very harshly.
In the past Before closer conversation within community members, only I'm going to recognize Ozzie The district office refused to give me the information about different applicants prior to the meeting after and the minutes How many people?
We support the slices right, So, 11, sports and bar very well did just let him say that Okay on the record, so committee members any issues are: do we want to provide some steps?
and I think one important thing: An important stipulations are considered moving forward, potentially adding if you've been discriminated or feel like you've been discriminated against, potentially adding the managers number and posting that at the business just so that we co hold them accountable because they'll say oh I, don't know, but when they come to you or they come to me , it's like not erase them and send them back later on to other community board.
very well Dana we're going to request that we have a good neighbor sign posted, so There are any restaurants that may have any issues and all clients that they will have access to someone directly right away that that's fine Does the rest of the committee for your comforter to move forward, or should we add some more steps?
Let's go back to agenda item number two If they'll be okay with the committee members and the residents attend.
They are you business about I, see none committee members, any issue: A police are proceed with a boat We now move to agenda item number five, and this will be a corporate change for 48.
No, my fault I was just giving reference to different restaurants locations, but this one once open will also have a sign posted on the front door for hiring locally, very well committee members, any other recommendations, guys all right, Having said that, you are going towards a stable okay, so for item number eight, a Caesar:: how do you vote?
This community is second to none and we're going to miss you much success to you I know many people feel that have been on this committee for many years residents showing up that care as much as you guys do, and the effort that you made in terms of getting great information was made out of an interest for the community and of concern so that people can sleep at night and live in peace and that businesses can thrive.
We really appreciate it as a lifelong resident of this community Thank you for your service and I just want to let everyone know that I spent three hours going over the video now, if I missed something I apologize, but you guys can give me suggestions, I'm, always open to it, but don't tell me what to do and how to do it.
