And, I'm, sorry to repeat myself for those that were able to hear Richard Allman is going to lead us in a conversation about Bennett, Avenue and renaming.
I just put a cop, a link to that article in the chat discussion has happened in a number of places and we have two things named after James Gordon Bennett in the neighborhood Bennett Park and Bennett Avenue.
I'm here as a member just to raise this as a starter issue with the transportation committee over whether we would want to look at proposing a renaming of Bennett, Avenue and I.
And I think it's time to open up this discussion to see what other thoughts there are over, whether we might want to consider a proposal on the renaming or co-naming thanks, Richard.
My thought is that when we talk about renaming or co-naming, however, the parlance that it would mean, in this case, similar to seventh Avenue, that both would still be operative in terms of mail, because I don't think anybody sees it as an option to not to have somebody not be able to receive mail at the address that they've always been able to receive mail.
This is much more preliminary, obviously a little more on that, if I may, when the discussion, when Parks Committee had its discussion last month, the representatives from the Parks Department said, If you're going to propose that this park be renamed, I think that's probably part of what we all like.
I mean you know the other thing I just thought of by the way, Maybe two.
Here, I think the one other that we all ought to try to do is to find a way to connect with people who live or run organizations on Bennett and make sure do our best to see that they're at least some part of this discussion.
Do agree that maybe some type of plaque that explains everything that happens could be placed like at the park, but I would rather go down the path in terms of renaming the street not trying to co-name the street.
And I just wanted people to know that I think parks, Liz and the Parks Committee are very focused on that aspect of that context and that I think we can presume that whatever happens on the park side will be robust and that, on the street.
I'm a little concerned about the ease in which we are glibly discussing changing a street name, and this really needs to be a community discussion, not a traffic and transportation.
Sorry that I didn't capture that anyone do we have somebody on the phone 9175, something that wanted to say, something, I, think what we've got coming out of this is all of us, giving some thought to just best course forward for people who have had particular proposals around technology around blacks, anything that can be done to gather more information in the next month or two.
Lyle is going to do some background at D.O.T, I'm glad to do some contacts along Bennett and at least make sure that people down there are brought into the discussion and would encourage Edith or anyone else who wants to be part of that out.
That is the opportunity for all of us to see a draft of what they're thinking for the rest of Manhattan above 184th street and like last time, we will.
Also gotten we've heard from like a community member who said you know, there's also some issues with the way like the safety of some of the crossing, signal, etc.
Like the you know, you, the work got done, but then, what's the look back process to make sure it's doing what it was intended to do and not having unintended consequences.
You, know, community boards resolve on street changes like this that were designed to improve traffic flow or pedestrian safety or all of the above.
Sorry, a no standing zone was implemented on Friday and Saturday, and so far people are not realizing it's an outstanding zone, and so as of right now, As far as I know, thanks to Bruce's real-time data people are parked there, but the other thing that is true is that the way it's signed.
What you look for is the next sign like that speaks about parking, regulation, You, know, Asp, Alternates, Street, Parking, sign.
So, but, So I think we'll need to follow up to make sure that traffic enforcement knows about the new change, but.
The he's, been the point of contact for many of the residents in that area and has done an amazing job over the past month of receiving the feedback and keeping things moving and getting questions answered and feeding information, back, and so thank you, Bruce.
Think I'm going to give us like a five minute break and then have us come back.
When, the okay, If you're, trying to cross Saint Nicholas, say you're running for the bus, vehicles are coming across 167 and making the right turn and the buses are sticking far enough back to be covering the crosswalk and the walk signal, and the problem seems to be when there's an m3 laying over at the 168th street end and then so.
You know how we're looking at it making sure it's working in the way we want it to work, and all of that, So maybe we can connect on that as well.
We leave this issue, I'd like to see us, And I, think you pointed towards part of it an overview of what's happening with at street buses.
You know where we can, if we think there might be an issue.
I want to thank Mariella Graham, one of our newer committee members, who took really took the initiative with this issue and making us aware, along with Dave Tom from the community.
What I'd like to do is hand this over to amber charter team and then to present, and then I'm going to ask give Tom from Inwood owners to just take a couple of minutes and share with people what he has shared with us about the area as well.
If it doesn't, Who knows so as she shares the screen, you will meet Anna Vargas who's, the founding principal of Amber Inwood.
We'll get started good evening and thank you, members of the traffic and transportation committee for giving amber the opportunity to present today.
Come, true for us, but nevertheless the facility on 187th Street didn't lend itself for us to go to a K-5 school, and so we found our permanent home in Kingsbridge, which is not too far away, and there we serve our students in a k-5 setting, and.
You could just see some pictures of our students enjoying music class along our music teacher and truly enjoying this experience of loving, to learn and loving to come to school, and now I'm, going to turn it over to our executive director Dr Bossie Dr Rusty.
Inwood I, actually live on Park Terrace East, so everything that's going to happen is going to impact me directly and therefore I have a special interest in making sure that my school is a good neighbor.
My great pride in opening up our school in Inwood comes from providing families with choice, especially because growing up in district 6, schools, I often wondered you know about which other opportunities or what my life would have.
To make sure that priority is given when our student lottery and our children are selected, We've decided not to have busting, because we know that the streets are very narrow and therefore to add busing would create even more congestion.
We can also support the community if they choose to advocate for a four-way traffic, stop at the corner of 215th Street in Park Terrace West as a way of being able to help with the traffic.
We, want a good neighbor and be able to offer a wonderful education for all community residents and through our school.
I. Think I'm, just gonna ask two specific school clarification or like specific data, questions.
And, then I think we'll move on to Dave Tom. The split between two through five versus the middle School, Six through eight like.
You know local children who are interested in a middle school or an elementary school, send them to Inwood because they're within walking distance, and then we wouldn't necessarily have the issue of the additional traffic right.
Terrace, there's no way to actually cross this street as a pedestrian coming up the stairs without stepping into moving traffic.
Park Cul-de-sac, if you didn't want to theoretically cross the street and so for an elementary school population.
What is the plan for the existing school parking zone on West 215th street.
So sure middle school students will travel independently, but east Harlem is quite challenging to get to and from Inwood.
Finally, The experience with local schools suggests that all the best intentions in the world are maybe not enough when it comes to that parental need to drive to the front door of the school, and the committee will remember the experiences with psms, 780 and ps18, where my other son goes to school and where 219th and 220th streets over a long period of time, we were able to convert those streets to one way to better manage the traffic.
We asked Amber here because you know, because we have seen when things go wrong with a school.
The streets in that section of Inwood are astoundingly narrow and what I think we, as a committee at some point, should call upon the department of transportation to do.
Everybody has to maybe from Iceland Street or walk up a hill or something like that to keep traffic out of that.
You could respond to that, like there's some things, potentially a stop sign, and certainly a crosswalk, but probably both that don't really have to do directly with the school.
You know we can you can do it independently of the school being there in regards to the stop time.
You know independent of the school coming in.
I know the DOT says that they haven't studied this quite yet, and yet there are some pretty basic traffic flow models that you can find determine the maximum number of cars that can pass through any given section, and if you put a reasonable drop off time to this section, you only get about 200 cars that can pass through.
Like I said it's probably going to be best as the school is coming.
You know thanks again to Inwood charter for being here and sharing the plans with us.
However, I think that some of the things that have been highlighted here tonight you know again as it relates to the intersections on 215th.
And, I, guess I would just you know, ask amber that as you get more visibility into the census of the school and that split between walking distance and public transportation and vehicle drop-offs that we always welcome.
I think it would be a good move to build community trust, And I also think it might help with any blind spots that might happen in moving through, like the general logistics of a school, Given the unique nature of this neighborhood, as you know, from living, here.
So, you know, I, just want to offer myself to be a part of this committee.
