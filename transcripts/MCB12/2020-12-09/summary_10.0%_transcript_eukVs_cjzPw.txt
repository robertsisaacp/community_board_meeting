He had seen on social media for the benefit of people who, like aren't necessarily on Facebook, So we try not to have conversations over email, because it's not public.
If you have the ability to do it to change your name so that it's your name so that like, if you have your hand, raised, I, can call on you by name, and it also makes it a little bit easier when we take our minutes and we have the attendance for people for us to be able to say who was there.
Is the community board 12 parks and Cultural Affairs Committee.
This evening, which is a discussion about Bennett Park, which I think will be, which I'm really looking forward to devoting.
And I wanted for people to just hold that in the background, as they consider the parks renaming that we're going to be discussing later in the agenda.
In terms of oh, this morning, very important got to start my day off right with a parks.
It's metal, but it was, you know, shout out to council member Rodriguez for his tremendous support in directing funds to the parks department, which is the bulk of what no most of that renovation was the anchor park from the mayor.
That's in high bridge park along the entrance is that there are multiple entrances, but the main entrance is at like 164th street, across from the former state, elementary School and the correctional facility.
It has 83 different items related to housing, schools, infrastructure, road, infrastructure, small business and workforce community services, arts and culture and parks and recreation.
So Wayne Benjamin, who is the land use chair, suggested that each committee should take a look at the Poa just to see where some of these things are and are there things where we want to nudge our respective agencies, along in terms of whatever commitments may have been made under the inward rezoning.
And I will send that along to you after the meeting, because it's too many things to do at once, but items 26 through 38 and then items 69 through 72 and item 75 relate to this committee, going in reverse order, Items, 69, 70, 71 and 71 relate to the Urpa the immigration research center and performing arts facility, and there was an RFP for that.
That's, going to be a hand up from Dave Hunt who I believe is looking to speak to the Bennett Park issue, correct, putting hand up hands up on that already eh.
So again, as I announced a little bit earlier, We are definitely going to be taking lots of questions on that issue, but not until we get to that point in the agenda.
You're going to have to like physically raise your hand and wave it so that I detect movement in the screen, and it also means that panelists can answer the questions in the chat.
Think if I take questions on each thing it's gonna take longer than it needs to reopen the high bridge water tower that is in design and is moving forward as a construction, renovate the dikeman rest and transform the space into a welcoming.
Okay award awarded for construction, excellent, renovate, Inwood, Hill park soccer field, one, that's another one of the ones that is on hold correct, It's in design.
Okay, install adult fitness equipment in Inwood hill park, that's done, and people are using it.
As you know, we voted to have an Inwood rezoning task force that comes under the responsibilities of the chair, and there has been no report by the chair to the executive committee with respect to appointment of members or any kind of working structure.
Okay, so I wrote it as a question in the Q&A as well, and I'm, not sure if this committee can help us, but the ring garden got 50,000 capital grant from borough.
So you know because I just don't think we need to have 91 people listening in on that, because it's a very specific technical, question.
We are excited that there are many neighbors stopping by dropping in as they wander along Broadway to see the exhibition and we're also pleased work plan to do another exhibition this spring on the terrace, and we think these are really important ways to engage the local audience who live around Washington, Heights and so forth.
But there isn't an approval process from the board, so you're gonna want to be in close consultation with your council member with your DOT reps with your these all these organizations and to follow this bill.
We, just confirmed our participation with artist Andrea Arroyo at the reimagined digital event, with New York, City's, missing them project on Sunday, from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. We'll be posting that on our social media, basically reflecting on those who have been lost to the pandemic and her our public art installation in Roger, Morris Park, with Andrea of the same name, Covida will be on display until the end of the month.
So I basically wanted to fill the group in and let the CB know that the mosaic that you mentioned at the beginning is being installed presently at the northwest corner of 163rd and Broadway next to the pharmacy, and the mosaic was assembled by the artist Carlos Pinto and John Siri, and it's in progress and people are encouraged to come and participate, apply glue to some tiles that have not yet been installed.
They're, going to do a bald eagle watch meet at Henshaw and Dikeman Street entrance to Inwood hill park at 9.
You want to know more about your park history, You can join NYC parks rangers on Saturday December 26th to learn more about what pre-dated Inwood hill park, the different types of fuses that were there.
I think we can move to the next item on the agenda, which is I, suspect what everybody is probably all here for the possible renaming of Bennett Park.
By way of introduction on this issue, I hope that people I know many people were here at our meeting last month, where we talked a little bit about why this is an issue that James Gordon Bennett, who owned the land on which Bennett Park now sits, was a 19th century journalist well respected in his field, who, As it turns out, is, was quite a controversial figure and a vowed racist, a secessionist someone who routinely used inflammatory language around African-Americans and slaves, who opposed Lincoln, who supported secession.
Why, when I saw a lot of different comments on Facebook I, frequently said things like.
Please come to this meeting, so I think that a lot of people have a lot of different opinions and I.
I, don't want for people to think you know this is a timely, conversation.
They had lengthy conversations in several of their committees around the removing of the Marian Sims statue on central on Fifth Avenue in central park on the renaming the ways of honoring the exonerated five, because I think it's important.
You know we're not the first community board to get into a conversation like this, so I think it's important to look to what our colleagues and other boards have done.
The conversation about Bennett Park specifically, is new, but the idea of how do we honor people.
Are there folks on the committee who want to just jump in we actually have, or people from the public.
I feel like secretarial question, just really quickly, Instead of recording all of the names that say exactly what I was wondering if I could just give a summary of the conversation between board and community.
Until about a week ago, When the patch article came on at that time, I thought it was extremely appropriate to rename that park in memory of Jim Dwyer and the feedback that I got from the community was tremendous.
That completely goes against that to fight back against racism and therefore the Dwyer family came to the conclusion as wonderful as an honor, as it would be that it would be much more appropriate to back a suggestion that would represent a person of color to rename Bennett Park.
For three years, So there were many wonderful suggestions of people who are living and, As my grandmother used to say, we're not even going to discuss that, because I don't want to bring the evil eye on anybody who is living that feels.
I, look and I see what goes on in this community and if those of you that knew her and those of you that have a memory of what it was like 10 years ago, a lot of changes were going on, and you know this would be something incredibly positive when you think how much she gave to this community and did to help and others like her coming up.
My grandfather worked very hard to make that happen and I think it would be a really wonderful way to honor, not only him again, but the immigrant community and the legacy in our neighborhood.
Much for hosting this conversation, I, similar to the previous commenter, am a local parent right along for Washington Avenue, and you know back before.
Pandemic rates were so high, was often in Bennett Park, as well, and I'd encourage the community board to help us kind of understand what this process is.
I'm really appreciate hearing from you, Liz that you want to have the conversation be as expansive as possible, but I know that folks who frequent the park would also love to kind of understand how the process even works.
Bureaucratically, and the last thing I'll say, is having heard all of the wonderful suggestions about names that one thing I would like to propose that folks have been talking about in my smaller groups has been potentially reflecting the Lenape land that our parks are all on, and.
We may not so I think the I don't have a set road map for what this meeting will look like in terms of moving towards resolution.
We would then take it from there, but in terms of this meeting, I'd actually like to spend as little time as possible on process and as much time as possible just hearing from people and hearing people's thoughts so that we can, as a group figure out what's the best way to move forward, make sense to everybody.
I started a Facebook group called Bennett Park parents a couple years ago after my son was born and it's grown and people have really become involved with the park.
And I was very aware of the renaming of the Gordon Bennett Award to chief Ganci and I, just kind of wanted to follow that, with a renaming of our park, I thought it was appropriate, and one of the suggestions in our group was that I really took to was what was just mentioned: kind of giving recognition to the people that were here, and you know pretty much devastated the indigenous people that were on this land and had names for the land.
And I have been trying to reach out to local indigenous groups, still kind of waiting to hear back, but I think it would be important to reach out to them and get their input and not speak for them, because this might be something they don't even want.
I did also want to say one thing that I forgot is Bennett Park, like many other parks, has interpretive signage, with some fairly lengthy text talking about the park and if indeed, we do make a recommendation to rename the park.
And I guess, The unspoken question that others may have is part of the reason why it's important to have this conversation here, as opposed to on Facebook, is so that the minutes can reflect all of the different names that people are recommending.
I, Don't think we should decide for the indigenous community, but we should collaborate with a member of the Lenape to decide if they would like an indigenous name.
All of these names and the history of the park is just like sending me down a rabbit.
Fernandez I live right across the street from the park, and you know my kid is 13 years.
Like many people on this call with kids, have spent a lot of time in the park.
So I just want to appreciate Daniel Glover for starting the conversation in our Bennett Park parents group, and thank you Vanessa for what you just said so powerfully I just want to agree.
And I want to throw support, Daniel and the rest of the group with collaborating with the Lenape peoples to find a name that they think would be appropriate to name the park and as the everyone's covering everything I would have said.
One thing I would like to say is that I think we are at a very crucial time in history.
I had asked Richard at the last meeting to reach out to the fire department to get a little bit of information about what their process was in renaming their Bennett award.
The issue had been coming to within the fire department and actually raised, especially by someone who had been given the Bennett award, that it was just not an inclusive way of honoring people in the fire department and that the name should be changed.
Whatever is the discussion that we're going to have around Bennett Park.
Having said, that, I want to add my own suggestion for a name that might make that we should consider, and that would be to consider naming it Sosua, Park or Sisua Square, which would be Sosua, which would be a way of acknowledging some of the intersectionalities in this community ways that different parts of this community have supported.
The need to acknowledge, but I also want to point to the erasure of black people and black history in this community.
We don't acknowledge the pain and the suffering that has occurred to black people in this community and to hear all the comments about all of that and not really deal with the who this person directed his hatred toward like Maya Angelou said when you take something for someone give it back, And, so I think we need to figure out how to address that pain and suffering caused by this man to the people.
So I just want to thank everybody for taking the time and all the comments have been extremely informative and it's been extremely heartfelt to see all the names and the suggestions just because of how important this is.
Yes, there is a gentleman named Michael, who is a former FDNY firefighter that mentioned in the chat that he would like to speak, but I, don't think he raised his hand.
So I, think we can look at this in an imaginative way in terms of the park and the playground.
And I think we want to look throughout our community hoping.
I was not expecting what we're getting today from the community and in general, How I wanted to put my hat in the ring as far as representing and showcasing and highlighting the indigenous folks of Manhattan, especially those that were uptown and I, wasn't sure if there was going to be a lot of support for that, because, typically, unfortunately.
Nobles native american culture is very big in me, and the injustice that has been done to the indigenous people of this country is horrible, and everyone here knows that, and so that being said, I want to fully put my support behind the Lenape, having the right to name Bennett Park to whatever they want, and if they do not want to do.
That, I still think that we should honor it for the indigenous people of this land, maybe not specifically Lenape focus, but maybe something a little bit more broad.
So I also want to say that I'm very pleased with how this is how this meeting has been going, It's, really nice, to see folks working together in a really positive way.
You know, I, just want to bring it to a broader conversation and maybe not rush us into naming it.
There are various new, like gates coming up in high bridge park that you know can be renamed.
There's, overwhelming support for the idea of looking to the tradition of the people whose land this was first for guidance on how best to rename this park.
I do want to throw out that, through this process and through the wonders of Facebook and Wikipedia, I did learn about Lamar Bennett, who was an african-american sociologist and historian, who worked on a lot of the storytelling and reclaiming african-american history and how you talk about memorialization and how you have these very conversations.
In light of this conversation, so I'm gonna recognize Jennifer, in, So I just want to say you know this is the, This, isn't the only opportunity.
As obviously there's consensus about renaming Bennett Park and the parks Department wants to hear.
And I really appreciate people's willingness to just go on the journey of a conversation and not feel like we had to come up with an answer, but that we could just sit with our questions and then figure out, together.
Right I was wondering if you want to save that, for the elected officials, part of our conversation, okay, no, She had her hand up for a long time.
