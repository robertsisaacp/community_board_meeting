Hello: everyone we are waiting to have forum once we have forum we're going to start the meeting so just give us a couple of minutes. Hello. Everyone I see that we do have coral now, so I'm going to call this meeting to order at 6:35, I see Ronaldinho, chair of the license committee, deciding of this meeting with forum before I start and before anything else, I'd like to introduce the person that is doing our translation services now to please identify himself and tell us how we're going to proceed with the translation services, foreign and if they do have any questions, they can easily raise their hands very well. At this point, I would like to thank the staff from the community board 12, particularly Avenisa, for bringing these documents even when it's raining snowing you're, always there to make sure that we have all the proper documentations in order for us to have a very productive meeting. So I really appreciate that Ernest from the bottom of my heart. Thank you so much also to Paola and Chanel. So now I know that I require a lot of attention, but you know we like to do things right and I appreciate your patience as always, so thank you so much Chanel also to the committee members. You know. Thank you so much for your support. As always so we're going to proceed with the introduction of our committee members, then I'm going to introduce NYPD and if there are any elected officials in our representatives, we're going to recognize them as well for the purpose on how we're going to conduct this meeting we're going to go through the agenda assist we're going to review all the applications. We will have input from our merchants, NYPD every now and then I'll probably say a couple of things here and there to add to contribute in making sure that we proceed with agenda assist and after that, of course, we're going to have residents to see if there are any issues or recommendations or even compliments for our restaurants. And then our committee will make a decision on each applicant again. This is just a recommendation that the committee is going to provide to the General board. It is not a final recommendation, so whatever we decide tonight is not. The final decision lies with the General. Board was going to convene this month and they're going to convene a next Tuesday. So it's going to be a very rapid alternative for the general meeting to take place. Usually it's on the fourth Tuesday of every month, but this time around because of the holidays we're going to a meet next Tuesday, which means that this committee has to work really hard to produce the minutes and also the resolutions. I, don't know if you are aware, but this is the hardest working committee that we have on the community board, because we do produce a lot of resolutions and, of course the minutes have to also be in conjunction with the resolutions. Isn't that solo do I? Absolutely thank you so much so I would like to start by introducing the members of our committees and, if you're so kind, please just don't introduce yourselves. Just by your. You know names. Please tell us something about yourself, because we do have a new committee members decide just going that has just joined us and I would like for that person to know who we are where we're coming from, and you know how we stand on some issues and how we're going to push the agenda for this community forward. So I'd like to hear more about who we are so that a new committee member will be aware as to who we are as a committee. Having said that, please take your time.

They came here back on December 18th of last year. We have presented here for monkey room since that's not the case. We're going to ask the NYPD to see about their opinion about monkey room. This is the private 34th prison, lieutenant Taveras. Yes, can you please service yeah regarding the monkey room, I'm gonna just go back to 2019 for 2019. We had 11,311 calls mostly noise and people hanging out in front of the location, and we also had four 911 calls for fighting those type of things that was in 2019 2020. There has been zero calls, so they I really appreciate what they've been doing, so they just need to keep it up. We want to work with the community, but we also have to respect the residents. So it's good with me. Thank you. So much lieutenant Alvarez for your recommendation. Do I. Have any other comments from residents saying none we're going to proceed with committee comments committee members, please feel free and tell us anything that you would like to share without the rest of the community. Before we go into a vote there is no one present for the premises. I'm sorry, there's no one pressing right now, yeah, there's no more present. It's not required that they come.

Thank you familiar face at the owner rice also Mr, Saucer, yes, I've been I was one of the first ones that joined this meeting. So you heard all the comments from the 34 precinct. There was Soma 311 calls earlier in 1999 2019 around this year. There have been zero calls. So the idea is that we want to make sure that you proceed in keeping this business running the way that you have been running lately. So your menu for that, yes, I've been here 15 years. Let me ask you: how are you doing now during pandemic, terrible just trying to stay alive? I gotta hold that tent. It's terrible, slow clientele this just that. You know my time. That was a little later and it's always it's just it's terrible, but I'm surviving. That's the point. Keep it up, I! Think you know. Sooner or later you we're gonna, make it yeah. We it's got to come to an end sometime. This is a very hard working community and I'm sure that sooner or later this is going to pass and it's just work as we can just keep yourself afloat, we'll be back to normal God willing. So on that note, I see no further notes from committee member disciples. I recommend that we proceed to a straightforward. Second, yes, please you're right, so we're gonna. Do a roll call Essedra. How do you vote you're right, a recommendation on my end if there are no strong oppositions either from the prison, the residents and the recommendations been fluid before we can call for an acclimation of the any objections. If there are objections that we're going to proceed out on a one-to-one vote, yeah, okay sure do you think they'll help well I mean: will we we'll ask people to vote on it, I think we do? We have I! Think no! Yes, typically, we do we vote on it. Yes, we need to vote on it yeah, but I'm saying that, as we vote on it, we can ask to vote on the application by acclimation, which means that if the no positions it will pass. Yes, okay, yes, if someone opposes, then we go into the voting one by one. Okay, sure I think that's right! Yeah! Sorry! So, as chairman asks, are there any objections to yes vote here? No, okay! So seeing that it's unanimous I still have to fill this out, though right it's either or no. Yes, so I think well so unanimous everybody's vote in favor, right and I just want to be sure. Let me just Cindy: are you here Cindy's, not here? No, while these okay, so I'll just put a yes in for everybody, that's perfect, so it'll be 11. I mean by a vote of a nine to zero. That's fine! This now with the vote. Okay, if people would abstain, then we have to go to a regular vote. Okay, so committee members, if you feel that you're going to abstain, please let us know so we can go to regular voting very well. This application passes by a vote of nine zero congratulations, Mr Salsa, and we hope that you stay afloat. My friend, thank you very much. I appreciate it excellent! Thank you. Okay, everyone have a good, happy holidays. Thank you too. Next is item two 187 restaurant co-op, Dba refried beans, mexican grill present. Yes, what happened?

Yeah, there's, not another premier, accounting on attendees. Thank you so much. You know so we're going to proceed. This is also with the prairie 34 precinct. This is a renewal lice or the license for full equal license. The last time this applicant came to the board back in November 29 2018. There was no objection by this community board and all the community and based on the health inspection that you have received from our department.

Please tell us your name and affiliation to this establishment. Okay, I know yeah, I'm the accountant, but what I'm trying to say is that the president, which is Elisa Rossi, Delis Rossi, is already on the meeting. So if you can allow her to talk about the restaurant, it's possible to do that Maria we can not find another premier accounting. So right now you are oh, my god, because I see her I see the picture where she can speak because she's, a panelist, okay, Rosie! Please! Yes, can you hear me? Yes, good. You have two minutes.

Well we're going to proceed now with 34 prisons to see if they have any issues and all comments, lieutenant altavera. So what is the opinion of the fourth person so why descendants, restaurant and corpse 2019 zero 311s? They had a 911 call for a disorderly person at the location 2020 we have zero. The 3-4 precinct does not have any objection. Thank you so much lieutenant for your recommendations. I will now open up the floor to see if there are any comments from residents. I see none I now move to have the committee members share some comments and thoughts. I see none I would like the base on the recommendation from the 34 precinct and on the fact that they do have a really good health record and the community board not object. The last time that I came on board I recommend they go to straight vote. I can see that you are please stop receiving vote. Okay, so are there any objections to a yes vote for this applicant by our members, not great seeing none? That would be a again a seasonal, nine right, one, two, three, four five, six, seven eight would be nine. Yes, no objections. Congratulations! Nine! Zero! This application passes. Congratulations to the folks of thank you. Refried beans at Mexican, grill I, hope that you do prosper and stay afloat for the community. Okay, stay strong! Thank you! So much have a happy holidays. Next year next is item three: a La Nueva Potencia Corp Dba Zoe restaurant Bar and lounge 1559 Saint Nick Avenue corner of 188th street present good afternoon Aurelia Tavares Representative for Zoe restaurant 1559, Saint, Nicholas, Avenue, a dominican fusion restaurant. Thank you so much before I give you the floor. Let me just make some comments about this establishment before the last time that this applicant came on board a little committee that was back in January of La last year, and there was no objection by the community board based on the health records that they have a name so doing really well, and this class is about to expire on the 31st of December of this year. So I do hope that you know this is going to take a quick effect so that I can get a certificate as soon as possible. Having said that, I really have two minutes evening: members of community board 12, it's a privilege to be before you and I'd love, to hear everything you have to say. So this is Zoe's restaurant 1559, Saint, Nicholas Avenue. It obviously starts as an apostle Dba Zoe they've been around. This is my third renewal with them. I'm really proud of them. They've stuck around. Despite having a lot of challenges, you know Covid-19 and we're just we're in the process of renewing same license same people, no change. You know in the operations of the establishment, no complaints, they really are running a clean shop and you will always find Zoe on the premises, the father or the daughter on the premises- and this is a father-daughter daughter and angel. Then so I'm really happy if anybody come to Zoe's. Thank you so much Aurelia. So now we entertain the position of our 34th precinct lieutenant Taveras. What is the final 34 prison, hello, everyone again Zoe. So this is what I have 2019. Only one 911 call for a stolen wallet 2020. We have a total of three 311 phone calls for loud music and people hanging out in the front. I know that the bars open on the sidewalk- maybe that created some of that I- do have a little concerns of this location. When I drive in the area, I do see an increase of double parkers in that area, I'm not going to say it belongs only to soy there's a couple of other businesses that are contributing to the situation. So maybe the owners of Soi could help us out if these people hang out in front of their business, get them moving along, because it's just getting a little chaotic in that area and I just don't want it to get worse. Thank you so much lieutenant. This is an area that has been an issue not only for the prison but also for the residents. I have often times passed by I encountered a decent amount of people drinking in public, which is not legal, not allowed. I, don't have a problem, people playing Dominus and all of that, but I see that it is a problem. Aurelia do we have? Is it one? The owner, you call camera one of the Ma One is the manager is he's on, but they can't speak they're having problems with the audio are on the line they're having I, don't know why they're having problems but I will address I just want the officers to know. Zoe has almost 98 percent improved. We will work on moving people along, but now you can't they don't have a budget to hire security guards to move people along. So it's a little challenging and it's not right we're not asking for them to hire anyone we're asking for ownership to take on and on the fact that if they can move people around, they can do that. It takes only 15 seconds because these problems that we have on these streets are going to be tagged to this business and we don't want to have that. I know. There are some issues or noise around that area and we don't want to prejudice the business because of people hanging out yeah. So we want to make sure that we perceptive you know we got to do our part. So please relay the message out to Juan that it is a concern not only to the prison but also to the residents. If I can ask yes, please yeah. At the same time, if you are to approach anyone, I don't want you to get into any confrontation. That's what we're here for, but if you could approach somebody and ask them politely, if they could please move if they obey is fine. If they don't want to move, then you could call us then we'll address the situation most import most important. Is your safety I? Don't want you guys to get into any this match that you can not tell me to move or any of that. So let's be clear on that very well nicely. You ask if they give you a problem, just go back inside and then we can address the issue very well. Lieutenant are very well set up. Point is well made and well taken committee members, any issues seeing none I recommend before I move on. Let me see if there's a comment, I see a comment from my share Amelia also. If they are also going outside and drinking, then I'm wearing masks also you're distancing. It is the problem that we have now with pandemic. If you see that they're, not social, distancing or not very much, please ask them to do so. This is something that we have to confront together as a community, and you know the health of Juan matters to all very well committee members. Any issues questions if not I recommend them go to straight board. You're right, please proceed. Are there any objections to a yes vote for this applicant by our committee members, saying none we'll put yes for all and I want to note Cindy I think I saw you come in. Yes, I'm here introduce yourself to wrestle comedian to all the attendees. Please hi, I'm Cindy Mato's board member. Thank you all right, hey Gerard, Police is here as well. I'm sorry oldies welcome, hey, please repeat, of what we had to read upon on the voting procedure from this on these items. Sure on the just for the rest of the our colleagues who are just coming in on the renewals. What we're doing on those is we'll just ask: are there any objections to a yes vote? If there are no objections, we'll just give yes vote to all of them. If anybody has any objections, you're more than welcome to raise it and we would actually get into the discussion or your concerns got it. Thank you great all right on the record for the record, because we got to keep clean, clear record now. We have to add Cindy and Walters to the voting records. Yes, very well, so we're gonna, just we'll do one more time, we'll say author to licensed committee members. Are there any objections to a yes vote for this applicant, with no objections raised we'll put in yes vote for all our committee members and it's just one two, three, four: five, six, seven, eight nine! Well, we got eleven full house. Yes, we have eleven love and yeses. Congratulations! Okay! Next, on the agenda is item number four is Sol's Restaurant Inc, Dba, Ill, Seoul restaurant. It's located at 229, there's 233 Dikeman Street, that's at the corner of Seaman Avenue Present. Welcome! So again this is with the prairie 34 prison. This is a restaurant located on Dikeman, it's solid. It's the place that we leave it or not. Sandra I have not been to your place. I've been around but have not gone into your place. It's a shame that I've not been in, but soon I will, based on the record that we have here. I see that you got an aid on the latest health inspection and the last time that you came here before this committee. You had a recommendation of no objection for your license, so congratulations I know that you're facing a tough times now, but you know, hopefully things will improve. Having said that, Sandra please for the purpose of the minister. Please introduce yourself and tell us something about yourself and your business hi. My name is Sandra Jacquez, I'm the owner of El Soleil restaurant I've been here for 16 years. I was born and raised in Washington Heights, actually Inwood heights and I am now also the owner of Satakos restaurants, which is right next door to El Soleil, which I just recently opened in May very well welcome. So this is when the preview of the 34th President lieutenant Taveras. Please surrender the recommendation of the 34 episode so we're facing a condition on this area, because there is so many restaurants and then you have the dirt bikes. And then you have the people coming. The cars playing music and sometimes the restaurants end up paying for it. But I'll give you the breakdown so 2019. They had four 311s and four 911s, mostly for music 2020. They have zero 911 and they have five noise complaints from 311s. Like I told you I know these are difficult times it's just sometimes, then I'm gonna use this word. Knuckleheads messed up the things for us, the good things we got going on for us and they go there. They go across the park and they go with their music and then they play the music and then, when people complain they give that address of the restaurant. So out of those five complaints that I have noise complaints, I'm sure some belongs to the restaurants. Maybe couples don't belong to it, but if right now you know they're closing a tank. So if there's any other calls after 10 it shouldn't belong to the restaurant, but whatever the owner could do to help us out if she sees a condition she could reach out to us like I said: try not to engage some of these guys because some of them don't think right. So that's just my breakdown, the whole area. I know there is a another item, number eight taboo. It's pretty much the same thing. Actually, they do have more 311 calls, but it's pretty much the same thing on the whole area. There is a few restaurants and some of the people that hang out in the area are messing up the area for us. That's all I have thank you. So much lieutenant arrows I'll now open up the floor to see. If that any comments to my residents I see, none I will now convene conversation and dialogue with committee members. Any input saying none again, Sandra. You have done an outstanding job on your place college that I have not been into your place, but perhaps Jiraiya and I can drop by and have a drink. I don't know when you're more than welcome and, of course, the rest of the community members as well. It's not going angel Leo Wildes. Have you guys been around Isola I. Have yes plenty of times? Oh really! Thank you. It's a fantastic establishment and congrats on opening the new spot, Samuel I! Thank you so much. Thank you guys. Thank you hope to see you soon once this is all over. Yes make sure you keep the truth rascal the same way. Please that's never going to change. Thank you all. Maybe perhaps I'll try that you're at least a proceed with voting procedures. Sure. So, if there's no objections to this applicant and us voting all yes, are there any objections by any of the committee members? All right, as there are none we will put yes straight across and that'll be a unanimous yes for this applicant. Congratulations! Thank you so much guys beautiful evening. Thank you. So much Sandra and I hope that you do prosper and stay afloat please and happy holidays. Thank you bye. Thank you. So much all right. That will put an end on all the renews now we're going to proceed with individual licenses. At this point your perhaps we should cancel now the voting proclamation, because perhaps there will be questions and or concerns. Let's all proceed are we voting as we used to sounds good. I would say that please call the next one, so the next up on the agenda is under item c on the agenda again, this is for renewal of taxi and Limousine commission. It's delivery based license. It's item, five on the agenda. It's Gds Transportation Corp, Dba, Upper car service and they're, located at Amsterdam Avenue, it's at the corner of West 179th Street. Welcome. Now we refresh the newer members for on the committee. It is required that the base delivery come before the community board. Of course they don't serve alcohol, but it is the license. Nevertheless, usually what we request are from the owners is that you know they keep the place, are clean and not to honk and see how you know things are going with providing accessibility to people who might not, who are disabled, I just general question, but they do have to come to the board in order for the licenses to get renewed unless the 34th prison has any. We have any question about this particular agenda item I recommend that we go to a vote unless committee members will have some issues lieutenant Taveras. Any issues with this was a perfect 34th precinct yeah. The three four doesn't have anything on this location. So I'm good to go very well. Committee members, please say: no. Do you write? Let's go to a straight vote. Great, so is cedra. How do you vote? Yes, all right: Gerard votes, yes, Cindy; yes, okay, Marielle, yes, great Leo!

Take care yourself! Thank you. Bye-Bye next up is item d and this is under state liquor authority for it's for a class change license, and this is item six Business Inc Dba pick and eat it's located at 4179 Broadway. That's at the corner of West 177th Street. Welcome hello, gentlemen, hi, hello committee, how's, everyone doing Aria we're doing very well. How are you and your family we're doing great I just beat Kovitz. I'm excited about that. God bless. You stay healthy! Thank you. So this is a class change for committee members, particularly one that is new to our committee. The class Chaincha means that there will be an upgrade from a Bmy license to a full equal license on this application. The last time that picnic came to the board. There was no objection that was back in October of 2017. I do see that there are issues with the health inspections very concerned, because this inspections are go back to a couple of years and as of now spending which means that the issues that they have to fix are real. You are the representative, and you have known these owners for a long time, because I know it's in the history that you haven't presented them before. The concept that we have right now is the health inspections. It goes back to 2017 March 3rd of 2017 up to January 16 of this year, where you have had consistent violations on the health code. Can you tell us what's going on there? If you have any information, so we're consistently they're consistently working on that they're consistently trying to get better? Some of the issues are building issues. So it's also some of the things that have to be taken care of also with the landlord and there's some stuff back and forth. It's been a tough corner to try to control, because since it's right on top of the subway there's a lot of rodent issues in that corner, they're always trying to be in the forefront of it and they're doing their best to try to tackle that issue. I have a quick question on that. You know. Oh sorry, okay, do you know what so first of all, I love the establishment, but there are other establishments that are also restaurants that have liquor licenses that are on that street. What are they doing to help maybe mitigate the rodent or the vermin situation that could be maybe translate. You know adopted practices that can be adopted to help fix, alleviate the problem and you're. So if it's outside, if you don't mind Andrew, so let us proceed on how we have been doing consistently, which is to have our committee members state of opinion and or comments after we have heard from the precinct and our residents, I'm totally right. Sorry, a lot of problems so I'll recognize you right away. This is within the private third precinct lieutenant. Can you please tell us your recommendation and all input about this establishment all right good evening, it's over to brown again from the 33rd Precinct year to date, I just like to speak about we've, had no criminal activity inside or outside of that location, directly in front of pick and eat, which is great. No 911 calls no SLA reports prepared in regards to 311 year-to-date we've had 38,311 calls. We've had two in June one June 10th, for we got a 301 complaint for not socially distancing and we got another call June 1st through 311 for our staff and patrons not wearing a mask. It looks like those calls those social distancing conditions have subsided because we haven't had any since June 10th was the last one. Oh, we did have 36,311 polls year-to-date for loud music. We had one in June 6 in July, August had 18 calls. September had 11 calls so 36 in total. So regarding the loud music, we just asked them to. Please keep in mind that it's a residential block when you go further down past the other restaurants and establishments that are making these calls, so they could just be a little more mindful of playing music, especially at nighttime when people who live in those buildings are trying to sleep. If they have work in the morning stuff like that, and also just since June they've, been great with the social distancing, we haven't had any complaints so if they could just keep that up as well. Thank you so much lieutenant sambrano do I, see any comments from residents see. None I will now turn into a committee. Members- and you see you have your vote- is either do I get to respond to the police officer? Yes, you will and you I will, because I have further questions for you as well, but then you I know you'll be the first one sure I mean you heard my that's my question yeah, so the you guys can adopt so definitely heard your question. One of the issues that we have is the great the not the great stuff the holes that come on the sidewalk corner. I guess they connect to the train station and through there, a lot of them come out and since we're right on the corner, we deal with a lot of that issue. We've been working, we've been at working with department of sanitation to see how we can implement we've reached out to New York city to DOT for their rap. So for the rodent program, and it's that hole right there that that's the issue. Some of the restaurants are have been closed down. The block you got bar 177 they're closed. The store has been dealing with a lot of the issues as well and we've been working together, but it does that issue doesn't really go down to 176 on Broadway, it's more like that corner issue and that's pretty much it Maria you're. Next, yes, thank you, Aryan for being with us this evening, yeah I mean a little concerning the 311 calls and the number of them, but, as the lieutenant mentioned, it seems as if the social distancing and the mask wearing was addressed and I hope that continues for everyone's sake. I would recommend- and this is kind of to the committee- possibly posting- a good neighbor sign regarding noise, just kind of keeping that in mind. You know with everything going on thanks. Oh definitely yeah and we did address. We had a staff meeting and we addressed the social distancing and we made it very strict. Anybody who doesn't follow our social distances. Guidelines in the restaurant will be sent home and also be filed in their paperwork. As far as the noise complaints, we addressed that issue as well. What happened was- and you know a lot of the restaurants. You know they saw that some other restaurants were doing live music and they thought it was possible for them to do it. So they were doing live music just to attract people to sit in the outside area to try to survive. We, it was brought to our attention of the noise complaints. You know we did join, there's a Facebook group, I, don't know if some people know that watching the Washington Heights Decibel Noise group right and we joined them and we put out a notice there. We started speaking to people across the street. We started speaking to the members of that Facebook Group and we eliminated the live music. So there's no live music whatsoever. That was the issue addressed exactly actually September 11th. When we reached out to the group and ever since then there hasn't been any live music since September 11 September around the 11th. That was around the last time and you know, we've been constantly working. We built the communication line and we've said: hey any questions, any complaints they could reach out to us. They could reach out to me directly. They could reach out to the manager, the owner and we've been present, and we haven't had any issues as far as those I want to say after September. Thank you. So much Ariel did I interrupt anyone, no just putting my back my heart as a executive director for the Washington High speed area. If you do need a mask- and this applies to other businesses, if you need face colorings like masks, face shields, also sign about wearing the mask, and all of that please don't drop by my office. We have that we are the one receiving centers of the city to give out mass for small businesses, so here Pisa, let the staff know that I can pass by and I'll give them masks, so they can be following the regulations. This is very serious stuff and we would like to contribute to making sure that we stop this pandemic. We truly appreciate that we have the mass the issue. Is, it hasn't been a supply of mass for us, the issue has been staffed, wearing the mask right below their nose and having to remind you know, make sure that they're keeping it fully covered in their mouth and their nose. Look I I've seen this problem and you know it doesn't matter how many times you tell employees what they have to do, because I've seen owners running my presence telling the you know employees what they have to do when I come back when they're, not there guess what happens: they're not properly wearing the mask, some of them, not all of them, but I've seen this taking place. Ariel So for the 311 cause. This is an issue you're not going to have a full equal license that it's beyond one and b, as you know very well, we would like for that establishment to have, as it was recommended, by angel to I'm sorry by Mariel, to have a good navel sign post it on the establishment, and we also like to have a stipulation that they also post a phone number or the money you charge in case. There are issues with social businesses and also known as outside that they will call the manager to address any issue and or concern before the proper authorities are called. We have those numbers, we have those inside the establishment. Already we don't have a problem with that. We went across the building and we can't we informed everybody and also contact information is in that Washington Heights Noise Decibel group as well. So it's the visible from the outside. It's invisible from the outside I believe so, but we'll double check. I know we do have them inside on the counter, but we'll def, we'll definitely I'll double check to make sure we have it on the window. Please appreciate that. Having said that, I have all further comments. Committee members, if there are no issues, I recommend to all forever saying that please proceed and just to let you know the reason why we're applying for the full liquor license is the owner of Pikani is the same owner of the restaurant of the bar next door possible we're going to be closing pocion due to the pandemic and due to lost income. So a lot of the patrons from there like the health infused cocktails that were created, so we're just going to be Trans transferring that over to the picking inside, but we are going to. We are going to be closing posion, which was a vegan bar, but close all right. Just a reminder. This is item six that we're voting on it's Jeff business. So we'll start to vote now is cedra. How do you vote? Yes, I vote. Yes, Cindy! Yes, Marielle! Yes, Leo! Yes, while these yes Robin all right coming back to Robin, yes, okay, Ashley, yes, Rosie, yes angel, yes, and I'm sorry to hear about Posio no worries and yes great, so this is a unanimous. Yet! Yes, congratulations! Thank you very much have a great night. Everyone be safe and stay healthy, all right. So next on the agenda is under the e category of state liquor authority. It's a corporate change license. It's item: seven ill post, Trantaria, Rustica, Corp, Bba Cafe, taboo located in two pardon me located at 227, Dikeman Street. Could you mute please whoever yourself and they're located? Just for you know our neighbors? They are located at 227 dychman streets between Seaman, Avenue and Broadway present good evening. Everyone Aurelia for the restaurant cafe taboo. It's. This is a corporate change to add Yancey into the application. This has actually been applied for before what happened was the corporate change was disapproved because some matter, some items were not provided and by the representative and we're just here to recertify Yancey's Fontes participation in this organ in this business he's a manager now, but he wants to be part owner very well. So this is a corporate change. Just so you're saying that Jan C was a complete name for the police. I'm sorry, I'm getting the documents so I don't give you his wrong name in front. I'm sorry! Infantes finale, yes, he would be co-owner with Carlotta Correct and what how many shares will he have he's gonna, be at this point he's going to own a percent of the shares so question about before we proceed with the president and the residents. What has been the experience of Jensey in the restaurant industry he's been working there as a supervisor gosh with Calota for a while. This is just his opportunity because of the market and everything to become a co-owner. For how long has he been working there? Well, this corporate change was initiated for two years ago three years ago, so three years so he has been working here for the last three years. Correct has he had any other experiences working in the restaurant industry? No he's been no justice as far as I know that you know, has he gone through some type of training in alcohol certified and trained, so the license will continue to be another name of Kalotta or we yes, Carlota and Yancy very well so committee members anytime, there is a purchase of a shares of an establishment that is beyond 10 percent. It is an obligation of the new owner to let the community know about this new change. Oftentimes. What we ask is about experience about alcohol handling, because you know now they're going to be more involved. So these are the type of questions that we will raise for the new owner right. So on that matter, I would now recognize the 34th Precinct lieutenant Alvarez, hello, everyone again. So for this location, 2019 we have five 311 calls mostly loud music. We have four 911 calls differing loud music complaining harassment for 2020. We have a total of 11,311 calls and two 911 calls just like I stated before that block of dikeman all the way to Payson it's a basin yeah, all those restaurants. There are suffering because of the people that go there with their cars and play music, and then the residents call they. You know. People live above these premises and the owner got to make sure as far as they can that when they close, they pull the chairs away. So people don't hang out on their stuff. That's all I have thank you. So much. Lieutenant I will now put the floor for residents for any comments. I see no hands up. I will now turn into our committee members for any input angel Ariella. Can you go over some of those issues that needed to be resolved? The first time around when you came to the board asking for a change. You mentioned that some changes needed to be made. I was just curious as to what those were well at present. There's the two owners on that liquor license are Calota Chevre and Wendy Hernandez. One of the main changes that I think is going to show that there's a huge, substantial change in the way the business is run. Is the removal of Wendy Hernandez and the addition of Yancey I think you're going to see he's interactive, he's always on site, he's really hands-on and he's really trying to make a difference with cafe taboo, and he follows the model on the Dykman Strip. He there really that strip was highly scrutinized this year and the he really helps. You know set the tone so that taboo, you know those some of those noise complaints can not be attributed to taboo, but is it between motorcycles? And it's just been a that strip is historically problematic and I find 11911 complaints as unfortunate as they are they're way down from years ago. We would get 40, 30, 60,100, so I think that he's doing a great job I think it's a great venue for anyone that would like to experience some inside dining. Perhaps you know a way to support them will be to classify and buy some drinks. I, don't invite the whole community there right now, because you know by ten o'clock we to be out nice, perhaps to hold a meeting from a tiger one time in the near future. So we all can see ourselves face-to-face and you know, support these businesses. Maria see that you have your hands up and I'll recognize you in a second. So please not respecting support. If I'm real, you have the floor now. Yes, thank you just a quick question. When did Wendy Hernandez step down? Well, he was supposed to actually step down last year, but because the corporate change failed, he needed to be participating until this corporate change was effectuated, so he's kind of needed to stay around. But now, with this change now, effectuating now going forward, I think you're going to see some really there's already been changes. I mean the just in following the whole. What's been happening on Dykman street I mean the kid. The business is right in line with the rest of the ones that are following the rules. You know Mahwanna Cafe, Il Soleil, just you know really trying to be part of a team as opposed to you know how everybody was running their location. You know it's really. It's been really heart-wrenching to watch Ariella. Thank you. Aurelia. There have been some comments from I city from a resident indicating there have been a hookah in use this summer. What can you tell us about this comment made by one of our residents Dave? You know this hookah bill has so been so controversial. They're we're in the process of getting it amended for outdoor use, but there's been so much confusion. Could you use it outdoors cafe taboo historically from the beginning of its inception, has been a place where hookah has been smoked. So you know the I, I'm not sure the status of the permit with all these changes, but I believe that they thought they had one and now they don't because they applied before the October 30th and they thought they just applying. They had it. So it's been clarified so they're not gonna, do it until they have their until this is this matter is clarified, I, don't think you're gonna have an issue anymore. Please I clarify that issue that there will be no further complaints from this establishment. I see that you have had the ownership I had like a really good review, so please make sure that this is that this issue gets addressed. Having you're right I just want to note that one of our residents wanted to note that taboo was one of the loudest clubs. Just reading comments section people taboo was one of the loudest clubs on the strip. I saw hookah smoking on the street in front of taboo, at least on six occasions this summer. So it's just a data point from a neighbor and please give consideration to the neighbor. Thank you. I directly read the comments and assistant committee members. If you see that I missed any comment, please feel free to interrupt any time. Sorrelia, please address these issues with the new owner. I can see so that we will not have further complaints of my residence. Please try to address that as soon as you can are there any other topics, issues yeah, Lee, Sidrow I would like to say something about that who could comment? Yes, please so base I'm the accountant for the premise. I really has represented the money application. The location does have a hookah license. It was issued back in January 2019, so they actually operating legally and allowed to serve hookah. Thank you for that update. So the base does have a license for hookah. Yes, correct. Thank you so much for that update and that will clear up a lot of the questions that we have definitely will I recommend that go to a vote record. Just a second can I clarify just one thing: will this be? Yes, please proceed I just want to let the owners be mindful of when they do. They have this thing that they sell as hookah. But sorry it's actually tobacco, so just be mindful that inside your premise, you're gonna sell I'm not saying you're doing it. I'm just letting everyone know understand. That's all! Thank you. So much lieutenant point well-made, you're right. Please proceed with the voting. Absolutely so just a reminder that again, this is for item seven on the agenda and this is for a corporate change. The next is for alteration, but this is for the corporate so for the vote. How do you vote on this item? Seasonal? Yes, okay, Gerard! Yes, Cindy! Yes, for me, Marielle! Yes, Leo! Yes, Robin! Yes, Ashley! Yes, Rosie, yes, angel, yes and one yes, so this passes unanimously. Yes, congratulations! Thank you. Everyone next on the agenda is under item f and this is for state liquor. Authority alteration license. This is for the addition of next door space to a large area. So and again this is for El Post, Tataria Rustic. So it's the same applicant 227, Dijkman street. It's between Semen Avenue and Broadway and I believe. If I'm reading this I don't believe this is for item nine. Is this to it an addition of 74 people? No, it's to be 74. It's a tiny space. It was a tiny space before I think it took 45. Now it can take 74, there's a wall that separates he's not using the wall he's not separating and until his application is approved by the liquor authority, and this is part of the changes that Yancey is bringing to the location because with Covid-19 with all that's going on and the landlord, because he they've really turned this place around they're happy with the way it's being run, it's a legit location. They gave them this extra little space, they needed it because people can't be on top of each other, like that, so, okay, all right so Lieutenant Taveras. This is an expansion of establishment to add more space for committee members. Just for your observation, anytime, that we have an establishment that requires a renovation that goes beyond ten thousand dollars. They have to let the community report know about these changes. This is an expansion that went beyond ten thousand dollars and that's why they're here so Lieutenant Tavares is smallest, the same. It's the same establishment. Are there any concerns? No I. Don't have anything just what I mentioned before very well. The noise nice issues yeah, and we hope that, with a new addition, space Jessie's is going to be the new owner. Please make sure that the noise level stayed at a minimum so that you will not have to deal with that noise consequences later on. I see that we do have one attendee. That has a question Francisco. Please tell us what the sun is all about for agenda number seven number, eight Francisco as a resident, you are being recognized. Please unmute yourself. Can you guys hear me? Yes, we can how you guys doing and happy Wednesday Licensing Committee I was I raised my hand for the prior agenda meeting and I wasn't called I'll apologize. Oh all, good, oh well! It's just about the noise complaints and about dykman is specifically because all summer it's been closed, so everybody in from I say Starbucks to Mama Juan, as if I'm not mistaken, are all part of this community dining experience where you can eat outside. So when I think about that I think how can someone single out one place for noise when literally the entire strip is the same? It's built the same people are eating outside people eating inside we're not inside or eating outside. Everyone was out there in the summer, like literally everyone was out there in the summer. It was a new experience, so people were there from Westchester New Jersey everywhere people were there, especially with the murals and the paintings. There was a lot of people there. So how can one establishment be responsible for noise in that location, considering there were like 10 other establishments in that strip, so I just want to know how is one? How can one establishment be pointed the finger at when there's like 10 others in that same strip? Thank you so much Francisco. We understand that there are too many that a lot of establishment on this corridor and it's hard to pinpoint like you said so. Your comments are well made. We're proceeding now with agenda item number eight again and are there any comments from other residents concerning the expansion of this establishment? Let's see very well committee members, any issues recommend that go to straight vote. Second, great again reminder it's. This is item eight we're voting on and this is for a alteration item eight. So all in favor Sidra. How do you vote? Yes, Gerard votes? Yes, Cindy! Yes, Marielle! Yes, Leo! Yes, Valdez Rob, Robin, yes, Ashley! Yes, Rosie, yes, angel! Yes, one! Yes, this passes unanimously. Congratulations have a good night! Everyone! Thank you so much Aurelia and Jesse. We hope that you do well. Please make sure that you keep the noise level to a minimum and we hope that you prosper. Happy holidays. Okay, so under category f on number, nine was withdrawn. So we'll go to the next item on the agenda. The next item is under item. G state liquor authority. It's a new license! It's an on-premise license item. 10 is power 202 LLC, located at 3775, 10th avenue, space number three, and it's at the corner of West 203rd street present. Yes, on behalf of Mr Oltanias Welcome to goal. Thank you so Miguel Acosta is the representative correct. So this application is being revisited. Thank you, Miguel of all the newer members, particularly one that just started joining us today. We now have four liquor license applications. We do take full equal licenses, of course, and the other licenses seriously, but when we meet as a committee to discuss a full equal license, it's required that the applicant has a complete questionnaire, that they have a cut to the menu and that they also submit a copy of the floor plan that will be considered a full application right. If any of these three items are missing, usually we recommend the applicant withdrawal because it's not a complete application. If the applicant decides that to move forward in the process oftentimes, the application will not pass for obvious reasons right. We can not entertain an incomplete application and on this type of applications we tend to be more in-depth. We ask a lot of questions because it's a new application that is coming to a community. We have to make sure that our neighbors are well protected. We are the first filter in making sure that we protect our residents and, of course, we support economic development. We support our small merchants, but we have to strike a violence right between what is convenient for the community as a whole, and we take account it takes into account the economic development, the new merchant, the input from the 34 and 33rd prison and, of course, comments from our residents. So then we make a tough decision right and now and we make those decisions. We don't have a problem with that. So just start, keep your mind open and ask any questions that you see. That will be important or pertinent to any application as we move in the process. If there are no questions one do you have any questions on how we doing thus far now those far you know, it's very clear from you see Joe, so I'll keep it mindful when each new merchant presents the other proposal and then if I have a question, then I'll definitely ask very well. So let me just go over specific. This is a new license power 202 located in 3775 Avenue, all right. So basically this application. Oh I'm, sorry, music, all right! I, don't hate you! I'm sorry! So I this I see that this applicant came before this committee last year for a request for a follicle license. There was no objection. There were some concerns from the 34th prison. However, based on the resolutions that was written here- and let me go now to the specifics for the precinct and for the rest of the committee members to please understand what type of our license we're getting right. So again, this is on it's called Sonar Sonarosa. It's a restaurant located in 3775 at 10th, avenue, full equal license, there'll be no there'll, be Jukebox, no Jupiter, there's Dj recorded and live. It will be Dj recorded music and live music right, correct, very well. The space has been properly soundproof, correct, there'll, be Nother party promotions, correct, you will hire a New York state registered security personnel, correct the hours of operations listed there from 5 p.m, to 2 a.m and on the weekends for Brunch, Saturday and Sunday will be open at 11 a.m to 2 a.m. Thank you so much. The capacity here is 1998. correct, you're going to have 15 employees, 24 tables and 109 chairs. Yes, along with that 19 bar schools, I believe there's a license. There am I mistaken. Well, that's the building, El Mundo, so you have actually two licenses there already. You have Brazil and you have Luxur and white luxury NYC on one on each end. Now this entrance to this establishment it's in the middle of the street, so they all have. We mean right in the middle of the Avenue of 10th Avenue, so Brazil has an entrance on 200, 2nd street luxury has an entrance on 203rd street. Now this building has the capacity of two more restaurants inside there's. One license that's already approved, which is Jri Urban restaurant, which is also located inside that building, which is, on the left hand side when you walk into the building, and this proposed application, which is being processed at the time, but had to be revisited due to the expiration of the notification to the community board, which the state liquor authority now changed to 270 days. So that's the reason that we had to renotify, but it's currently being processed. So in that entire building, you will have four licensed premises all with different entrances, except the current license. That's approved but hasn't been picked up, and this proposed premise so that will have entrance in the middle of the block on 10th avenue, while the other two have on each end of the street very well be good. I've seen some places getting shut down because they have not properly registered the security personnel with the state. Well, these are companies that are being hired, so the majority of the establishments. If you have your own security personnel, you need to have a proprietor license by New York state issued to your establishment. When you hire a security watch company, they have trained and licensed security guards that they place in your establishment to supervise the premise. I've seen an establishment that it was closed, most mostly in part, because the company didn't inform the establishment that a couple of security guards had expired permits. Yeah that does occur at some times. Yes. Well, there are new requirements for that now. So, basically, when the security guard signs in on a daily basis to the establishment, the state also allows the owner of the business to go online and check their license to make sure that on that night, the security guard that was sent is active and the license has been renewed or the other certifications that they are required to maintain are also up to date. All right. Okay, I see that two of our residents have to send hands up. Franciscan Catherine I'll recognize you in a minute, but first, let's hear the opinion of the 34 percent lieutenant Tavares. What is the opinion of 34 prisoners? You heard this new license. Yeah I was wondering when I got this location, I ran the address, I was getting brazier and on the other, licensed frames on the other side. Just one thing: fire accent: are you guys gonna have do you have one on your yeah? This building is basically right. Now the certificate of occupancy for all establishments is approved and they are required to maintain all proper fire exits. Maintain that correctly they're also going to have handicapped sex accessibility via electron and electronically. So when you walk in to the, if you're handicapped, you're going to be able to get on a ramp and the ramp will be able to get you up to the staircase, they also have rear exits and side exits as well. This is a pretty big building. I, don't know if you recall this used to be El Mundo many a couple of years ago. Since then, the location has been divided into multiple establishments and which are now established in restaurants. So you're gonna have four different restaurants within that same address, but different entrances, so they're all located with different store numbers. Okay, are you someone concerned yeah I'll? Let you know what it is so pretty much the whole black, not the whole block, but you know what I mean yeah, whatever Isabella is restaurants, yes, correct I have seen on, especially on 202 street, yes from 9th to 10th, pretty much everyone is part illegally like right now. Are you parked illegally? Yes? Well, that could be more from Kachopa, please or something like that. Well, they have a parking lot right next to it so yeah I guess people are choosing not to since we're not really enforcing it that much. They part right by the plant electric plant. That's there yeah I, just let you know I'll make them aware of that, because I'm actually the accountant for all those establishments on that low on that address and there's actually two parking lots right, one right next to Brazil, which has two entrances one on each side and then there's also another parking lot right next to sushi mambo. So in the past, there's never been any concern when it came to like double parking or any of that there was always concerns about. You know a lot of people getting together. That's why these hours of operations have been changed, as you can see, this application's being submitted they're closing at 2 am while the other establishments close at 4, so that's a big plus to the neighborhood and things are changing back there. A lot of people are being compliant with all the guidelines, and you know, regulations that the liquor authorities implementing and the neighborhood is implementing. You know business owners don't want to lose their licenses, but I see I went through that. There's some, you know so I think that I can address that to all of them and make sure that we can fix that problem in that neighborhood officer. I, just wanna mention two things just to make your everyone aware of it, I'm sure when the crossed out you're gonna have outside sittings in that area, we do get a lot of 311 jobs, complaints just making you aware of it. Obviously it's not you yet, but it's gonna, be you that's one thing and you guys, whoever has restaurants I want to put something out there. We are getting a lot of stolen cars in the 3-4 prison. Pretty much people leave the car on, they have the key fob, so they think they lock the car and they go real quick into your restaurant. To pick up the food and by the time they come out, there's no car. So just your scope will make you yes, I just want to make you guys worried about that. I would definitely address that to the business owners on that neighborhood. Thank you. So much. That's all I have I see that Catherine Sullivan has her hand up Catherine. He had to flow Catherine. Please don't mute yourself once Catherine, please unmute yourself coin twice very well. We now move to committee comments. Committee, members, questions issues, comments, hey see, there's waldies, I'm just curious to the officer or the 311 calls like noise complaints because from like residents, because I know that back there there's not too many residential buildings. I'm just curious to see like. What's the notion of these 311 calls officer lieutenant Taveras, do we have anything yeah, I, guess yeah. Just give me one. Second, like I was saying this is what I do I get the address. I run it I get what I get I'm not making it up. I could go through some of them. If you want to, you got to be mindful that right across the street from these premises, there is the housing development, so yeah the decline, houses walls are right there right in front of that establishment, even though they are like. Perhaps the avenue is very wide and then they're like a trees that separate the Beckman houses and that venue, because also was a problem with 10th avenue when they opened up. It was a problem, so we got to be cautious that so I don't know who was speaking, but if he wants I'll go okay, if you want to hear some 11 things all 124 hours, loud, music, 11:10, all one or nine hours, loud, music room from the nightclub on 203 11, I'm sorry 10:11 at 6:01 pm, loud dining establishment, that's actually a bar, usually every weekend it is too loud. Speakers outside checking my house. That's what they're saying I'm not making it up right and that I could continue. Like I said, I just run the address and I get what I get I, don't know who's making these complaints but they're making. We understand that lieutenant and sometimes it can be cars that are just you know, passing by or park with loud music and the establishment get tagged by it. So this is an issue Francisco I ask around about residence. I'll. Give you like one minute because I it's just committed, but I just give you an opportunity to speak. If you have, if you can I see that, on your hand, are you going to speak yeah? My apologies I, actually thought I just never put my hands down, but thank you so much Francisco. So now, committee members, let's continue with the conversation, please any other comments. I have a question as well for the officer in terms of the complaints, the three-on-one complaints. Are there specific addresses coral like when someone submits a complaint? Do they have to put, and do we, the addre, that kind of information I just want to get the sense of are the complaints actually coming from the people that live in the dikeman houses across the street or not okay, yeah okay, hold on I'm sorry, yeah like I, was telling Miguel when I ran the address. I was getting complaints from brazier and the other restaurant on 203, so it was because it's the thing the building is the same building for both establishments, so some people were saying that their house was shaking windows vibrating from loud music. The restaurant has very loud speakers with music outside music, so loud every night, from coming from two or three, so I'm assuming that's the restaurant on 203 and then social distance customer no way mask extremely loud music. Sometimes the address is the same address for both establishment. Sometimes they say the name of the establishment, and sometimes they just say on two or three or two or four so I have to assume, probably from sorry I guess, I wanted to clarify my question: is the person putting in the complaint? Do they have an address associated to them so guys so usually when they make 311 most of the time is anonymous. Unless you want to be contacted which most of the time people don't want to be contacted, I didn't go that far looking into to see if we have a specific complaint, I was just getting the information, but most of the time I could tell you when they call 311. It's anonymous very well. I recommend that I go to a vote, taking into account that I'm going to ask for three steps: Miguel, a good neighbor sign to be posted. Also a phone number to be properly displayed on that side that so that residents have any issues they can not call the manager in turn and that phone number has to be properly displayed. Also that be a sign about no valet parking, because we know that is illegal, but just to address the consumer 34 precinct. Let's make sure that people know that they can not have a party as well so Miguel that will be a noble parking and please do not park illegally in the area you see through real quick. I'm sorry who says this is Francisco. Yes, it's real quick when he means illegal parking, because I'm very familiar with 10th Ave in that block. There is no parking anywhere. It's not double parking. It's just parking in general. It's illegal! Thank you! So much Francisco! So Miguel. Please have that as a step, I'm clear with that you're right, please, yeah I, know I noticed that you had your ends up you're right on yourself, all right. Sorry, a quick question! Miguel is the owner present tonight with you. No he's actually not like I said this is a revisit. We already went personally back on June back in June 2019. We I have the stipulation that we signed. He met with Officer Pena purchased the sound limiter issued. It gave it to the community board. So, like I said this, the reason that I'm notifying again the community board is because of the fact that the liquor authority changed their date on the submission for the community board notification. It expires after 270. Thank you, Miguel appreciate it Miguel the owner for the establishment, Jose Ordonez, ortanius, Right Correct- has he had any experience in the restaurant industry. Yes, he actually mentioned the experience that he had when we were. There I think he worked. He used to work like an umbrella and some other places many years ago, but I don't recall right off the top of my head. I do recall he did say he had some experience and I. Don't have it on offhand right now very well. You always proceed to vote with these three steps. If our committee members have no objections, thank you. I'll fix that again. This is item. Seven, just item 10, just to remind everybody, that's for a new on-premise liquor license though. Yes, I'm going to abstain on this one Cindy. Sorry, that's a yes for me! Yes, Marielle! Yes, Leo! Yes, while these yes Sir, okay, Robin Ashley, yes, Rosie, yes, angel, yes and one! Yes all right, so this vote passes with one two three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine yeses, two abstentions! Congratulations! Next! On the agenda! Moving right along is item 11. This is under restaurant wine and it's item 11. Jw, Lemsmark Corp, it's Dba, Serrano salsa, it's 49.79 broadway at the corner of Iceland Street, and we might as well talk both. It sees what's: okay item 11 and 12. right and yourself, please so I'm gonna be confused because I see the addresses are very close to one another. They will have a different restaurants, pizza and mexican food from what I see here, they do have a complete address, I mean where they have a copy of the menu, complete questionnaire and a copy of the menu. So do we have representative here for this? Yes- and you are the representative- yes very well, so for the 34, prison and committee members, please are listening to a description of this applicant agenda. Item number 11. again. This is for wine and beer license they're, saying that there'll be no jukebox. No dj! No karaoke, no live music, no need to install sound limiter, no need for security record. No need for the third party promoters seems like a very straightforward place that you can go out. You can go eat and not be bothered with notes based on the application that we see here. It's a very straightforward hours of operations which is 8, am to 10 pm mondays through Saturdays and then Sundays from 8 am to 8 pm. It's a very small place, 20 people in capacity so Franklin. Please give us a free, a brief description about this establishment. I experience where the honors is from. They know the neighborhood and so on. Okay and said, basically, a new place, the years open in January of 2020, but the owner is being there for grandpa bricks. An oven pizza, they've been there for at least three years. They sell family food to the neighborhood and Mexican, of course, is a new enterprise that they have with this pandemic. It's been kind of slow, but they still, they have managed to continue working. They use one of these applications to the neighborhood. Most of the food right now is being delivered to the client's place and Franklin. This is a mexican food right. Yes, very well, I received a letter from one of our residents, Mr Marin Collins, indicating that he is writing. Support of agenda item number 11 and 12, it says here that is a new business. That's been revitalized, a vacant storefront with delicious food and excellent customer service. Grand pops are pisces almost for a year about 4970 Broadway and has served up public convenience and advantage along great Visa, so Mr Collins is urging this committee to approve this license. That is in the record from my colleagues. I would like to hear now the opinion of 34 prisoners, lieutenant Taveras, yes, Sir. The three four do not have anything on this location, so very well. Thank you. So much I already took a comment from residents. Catherine are you still there I said? No, she I forgot to left her hands up. I hope she didn't get tired, but going back now to committee members, Committee I am still here. I am still here and I want to echo Martin Collins's support for these two businesses, genuine mom and pop operations serving public good. Thank you so much Catherine. Thank you very much in support of this establishment. I will now move out to committee members input committee members. If there are no issues, I recommend to go to a vote all right. You have to use that proceed with one person. Okay, so this is for item 11 and these are both under restaurant one. But item 11. How do you vote? Yes? Gerard? Yes, Cindy!

Ten! Yes! So congratulations. Please note on the record that Maria was not president for this vote so that there will be no question discrepancy on the number of votes. So this application passes. Congratulations, yes, and can we vote? Can we go to? Can we go to vote on number 12. right, I heard someone? Yes, it's Marielle! Sorry I had to step away for a moment and it sounds like he has voted on this applicant and we can not undo the vote or add additions. But it's the same owner with a different address, very close by so you have a chance. Okay, so for item number 12 on the agenda again: Jw Lensmark, Corp, Dba, Grandpa's, brick, oven, the last one was serrano, but this is Grandpa's, brick, oven, 49.73.

Thank you so, last on the agenda under restaurant, one would be item 13, and this is La Bay Sports Grill, Inc, Dba El Canucko restaurant 65, Sherman Avenue at the corner of Thayer Street. So this would be very present. Welcome all right very well. This is a complete application for Konunuko. It has a completed questionnaire, has a copy of other floor plan and a copy of the menu. Let me go over the math operations and some of the specifics they'll be Miguel. Help me out so when you cross out, for that means, whatever whatever's crossed out means no, it's not gonna, be so they're gonna have I background music, they're gonna have a cat karaoke once a week and basically live music just to be on their license, just in case they want to bring in an acoustic. You know singer yeah. They could be allowed to do so all right. So you have no jukebox, no dj. You will have recorded music karaoke and live music. It's probably some proof. Yes correct. This used to be a bar before it's now a full service. Restaurant they've been open and operating for over a year and a half they're. Looking to add this wine and beer license just to see if they get some more revenue very well, so there'll be no need for security guards right no and 74 yes, correct. Now the hours of operations that you have here, yeah open, it's open on mondays, through Thursdays from 8, am to 12 midnight, correct and then Friday Saturdays and Sundays 24 hours right, yes, correct, I know that may be a concern. My client, she understands her hours that are allowed by the liquor authorities to serve alcoholic beverages. So I already have addressed that and I expressed the concern when I was receiving her as a client and filling out this application. I explained to her that there may be some concerns because of the fact that sometimes people do get carried away and bring in patrons after the hours that are allowed by the liquor authority, and this may cause an issue. So I will still address that to her again she's very familiar with what I explained to her. So I know it might be a concern, but they they've been operating for 24 hours prior to the pandemic. Had no issues so I'll express my your concern to her immediately Miguel. So what hours are they going to be selling alcohol? My that was going to be the next morning, because this is concerned. You know that they can be selling a call four o'clock in the morning because it's allowed by SLA right when things get up to be normal right, yeah, correct. So, basically, the hours that are allowed by the state liquor authority are from eight a.m to four a.m, so you're not allowed to sell from four a.m to 8 a.m. So those are the hours on the weekends that they unable to sell on sundays. They can't sell any beer Pri before 12 noon, so that's explained to her as well, so it's just I understand exactly the situation here it. This is, you know like a family restaurant where they have a steam table, you know, so they don't have a. They don't have a service bar where people can get up and go so all employees will be properly trained after x, amount of time you're unable to sell like this is not a bar, so you're unable to get up as a patron and get up from your table and go to a bar and ask for a drink. This is basically the servers got to go to your table or you know if the law continues. If you're going to grab-and-go, if you're buying food, you could grab a beer, but it has to be within the time. Let me hear, though, lieutenant what's the peanut 34 hello, everyone just one quick question: Miguel: are these the same owners as when he was viva tapas? Oh, no, completely different owners, Biba tapas used to have a bar there. Basically bar lounge. This business has been in operation for almost two years actually and they've been operating as a mom and pops restaurant steam table. They have no bar like I mentioned before this is they're going to continue the same operation. They just want to add wine and beer to the options of the patrons. It's just wine beer, no hard liquor right, no hard liquor, just wine in bed. Well, I'm a little concerned about the 24 hours, but I don't have anything else. Besides the 24 hours like I, said I'll definitely express everybody's concern. I was concerned myself when I was receiving the application, so I'll express you know the community board's concern and the precinct's concern like I said: yeah. I've been in the neighborhood for many years, representing a lot of clients and I want all my clients to do well, but they need to follow the rules and regulations and make sure that everybody's safe and that there's no consumptions after hours or to minors all right I see oh yeah. Oh my god, you know like I. Just I want to make sure that we're going down the right path with this establishment and we don't put them in a space where they end up. You know, I, live close to. President I saw what happened at that establishment. I, just don't want them to go down that path, so I mean if you're gonna have conversations with them. Have conversations. I am so hesitant about the 24 hours. To be quite honest, just because, like I've seen so many other businesses be destroyed because of it, and if we can protect them from being destroyed, I would rather go down that path, but I mean I'm torn is where I am no and I understand. Your concern, like I, said what alleviated my concern was that it was wine in bed. You know I know that a lot of people go to other places that operate 24 hours. Like president, they had a full liquor license, so they were selling you a mango and a shot of Hennessy. You know so that's a little different story, so, like I said, I have a lot of experience when it comes to the operations of these restaurants and things that they can do, and it can't do so. I was alleviated a bit. We know when it was wine and beer. You know, because not a lot of people, you know. Sometimes you may get a patron to come in and have something late night and grab a beer, but, for example, Dickman Express operated for many years until they upgraded to a four-legged license. So it'll be something similar to that. You know, even though they they're not on indictment but they're, all for dykman, and they don't have the type of movement that Dickman has indictment. Express had back in the days when you had all those clubs getting out at the same time and just going to Dickman Express, and they you know, Cedillo was very organized with that, and you know up to Paul with all his rules and regulations, and you know I basically focus on my page, my clients, you know operating similar ways, I give examples you know so like that they can understand exactly what I'm trying to do. Okay, I'm a little bit thorn as well Miguel about having this establishment open, 24 hours. I recall that in past times the 34 prison are rejected or was against an applicant that wanted to have a 24 7 service, and the concern back then, was that there are a lot of. There is a specific part of people that loves to go to eat this type 24 hour places getting drunk from other places ending up here to eat here, thus creating a lot of problems for establishment. Like angel said you know, we don't want to put them in a road world to fail, but at the same time we have to protect the well-being of the community. That's completely understood, I could definitely speak to her. You know these are hours that were provided at the time. I received the application, you know, maybe I can address the concerns, and maybe we can, you know, cut it off at earlier time on the weekends and not operate 24 hours. Maybe they could shut down for at least six hours before they reopen at eight o'clock again maybe shut down at three then and try to get you know, look I wanna make sure that they survive right, yeah, definitely yeah and I know that is at this point four o'clock: it's not gonna happen anytime, soon, yeah, no, definitely and I, understand and I, and I've seen many businesses operate 24 hours and fail. So you know I know that these things that business owners create at this time I doubt it's gonna happen right now, everybody's shutting down at ten o'clock. Some people continue with their curbside and deliveries and some are successful. Some are not. You know right now, we're going through something that was unexpected and, like I said when I received this application. These are the intentions that the client has and I could definitely address the concerns and maybe structure these hours and put it on a stipulation after that, no I don't want to shut them down like if they have survived. For you know serving food for 24 hours a day. What I would recommend is perhaps to come to some type of an agreement as to when alcohol will be stopped from being serviced. Okay, that will definitely work, at least on the weekends, because you know what 12 midnight on the weekdays. It's not a problem, I, don't think it's a problem for the committee, but you know on the weekends. Perhaps I think that we should come to some type of understanding as to when they would serve alcohol. I would go in this case. Speaking on behalf of my client, I would go in this case at least Friday and Saturday. We can allow them to what the liquor authority allows, will be 4 a.m and then on Sunday we could do 2 a.m, which is a work day the following day, so Sunday 2, A.M and then Fridays and Saturdays 4 a.m for the sale of Apple 4 a.m. So that way you know very well. What would the rest of the committee feel about this recommendation? I? Think it's fair, I, agree. Cindy I definitely agree. Juan agrees with it. I agree with it very well. I think that you know we do have consensus so Miguel for the record. We have agreed that for alcohol to be served on mondays through Thursdays, until 12 midnight, then Fridays and saturdays until four am and then Sundays until 2 a.m, sounds good to me very well. Having said that, I think if there are no positions, I have to go to vote, but before I do that, let me see I see that there's a comment from Catherine Sullivan, saying 24 hours, a par idea for number 13 covered, and all of that so I understand now. The concern I think that we just addressed it that too many hours we came to an agreement between the merchant and the committee. Well, there will be a limitation on the hours of serving alcohol if there are no comments from the committee. I'd like to vote, okay, that you're right, please stop proceeding great. So again, this is for item 13 under restaurant wine and Caesar. How do you vote? Yes? Okay! Vote. Yes, Cindy! Yes, Mario! Yes, Leo! Yes, what is yes? Robin? Yes, Ashley! Yes, Rosie! Yes, Angel! Yes, Juan! Yes, this passes unanimously. Congratulations! Thank you. Have a great night guys see you guys next month. Thank you. Our concerns. Congratulations, happy holidays to you and your family, and we do hope that this business will prosper. The rest of it I'll see you at the General Board meeting. Thank you. I know, I have your back and you have mine. Thank you. So much for your support. Stay safe, stay, healthy and I. See you soon and I will now call for a call for I turn. Second, by Gerard. Third motion passes have a good night guys. Thank you. Good night happy holidays.
