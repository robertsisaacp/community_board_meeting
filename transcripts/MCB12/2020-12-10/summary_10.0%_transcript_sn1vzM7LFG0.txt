All right, good, evening, it's over to brown again from the 33rd Precinct year to date, I, just like to speak.
Please, keep in mind that it's a residential block when you go further down past the other restaurants and establishments that are making these calls, So they could just be a little more mindful of playing music, especially at nighttime when people who live in those buildings are trying to sleep.
I mean a little concerning the 311 calls and the number of them, but, as the lieutenant mentioned, It seems as if the social distancing and the mask wearing was addressed.
And you know, we've been constantly working, And we've been present, and we haven't had any issues as far as those I want to say after September.
Is, It hasn't been a supply of mass for us, The issue has been staffed, wearing the mask right below their nose and having to remind you, know, make sure that they're keeping it fully covered in their mouth and their nose.
This is an issue you're not going to have a full equal license that it's beyond one and b, As you know very well, we would like for that establishment to have, as it was recommended, by angel to, I'm, sorry by Mariel, to have a good navel sign post it on the establishment, and we also like to have a stipulation that they also post a phone number or the money you charge in case.
Committee members, If there are no issues, I recommend to all forever saying that please proceed and just to let you know the reason why we're applying for the full liquor license is the owner of Pikani is the same owner of the restaurant of the bar next door possible we're going to be closing pocion due to the pandemic and due to lost income.
They are located at 227 dychman streets between Seaman, Avenue and Broadway present good evening, Everyone Aurelia for the restaurant cafe taboo.
I, Don't invite the whole community there right now, because you know by ten o'clock we to be out nice, perhaps to hold a meeting from a tiger one time in the near future.
I see that you have had the ownership I had like a really good review, So please make sure that this is that this issue gets addressed.
Now it can take 74, there's a wall that separates he's not using the wall he's not separating and until his application is approved by the liquor authority, and this is part of the changes that Yancey is bringing to the location because with Covid-19 with all that's going on and the landlord, because he they've really turned this place.
They gave them this extra little space, They needed it because people can't be on top of each other, like that, so, okay, all right so Lieutenant Taveras.
This is an expansion of establishment to add more space for committee, members.
We're proceeding now with agenda item number eight again and are there any comments from other residents concerning the expansion of this establishment.
Let's, see very well committee members, Any issues recommend that go to straight vote, Second, great again reminder it's.
202 LLC, located at 3775, 10th, avenue, space number three, and it's at the corner of West 203rd street present.
We ask a lot of questions, because it's a new application that is coming to a community.
This is a new license power 202 located in 3775 Avenue, all right.
I, see that this applicant came before this committee last year for a request for a follicle license.
Let me go now to the specifics for the precinct and for the rest of the committee members to please understand what type of our license we're.
One license that's already approved, which is Jri Urban restaurant, which is also located inside that building, which is, on the left hand side when you walk into the building, and this proposed application, which is being processed at the time, but had to be revisited due to the expiration of the notification to the community board, which the state liquor authority now changed to 270, days.
You have your own security personnel, You need to have a proprietor license by New York state issued to your establishment.
A lot of people are being compliant with all the guidelines, and you know, regulations that the liquor authorities implementing and the neighborhood is implementing.
I'm, just curious to the officer or the 311 calls like noise complaints, because from like residents, because I know that back there there's not too many residential buildings.
Sometimes it can be cars that are just you know, passing by or park with loud music and the establishment get tagged by it.
Do, they have to put, and do we, the addre, That kind of information I just want to get the sense of are the complaints actually coming from the people that live in the dikeman houses across the street or not okay.
I, recommend that I go to a vote, taking into account that I'm going to ask for three steps: Miguel, a good neighbor sign to be posted.
He used to work like an umbrella and some other places many years ago, but I, don't recall right off the top of my head.
Support of agenda item number 11 and 12, It says here that is a new business.
I would like to hear now the opinion of 34 prisoners, lieutenant Taveras, yes, Sir. So much I already took a comment from residents.
There are no issues, I recommend to go to a vote, all right.
Okay, So this is for item 11 and these are both under restaurant one, Yes, and coming back this time to Marielle, How would you vote Mario.
34 prison restaurants and committee members, lieutenant Piharas.
Invite both community committee members to stop by the restaurants and have some good pizza have basically as well definitely support you.
24 hours, right, yes, correct, I know that may be a concern.
I explained to her that there may be some concerns because of the fact that sometimes people do get carried away and bring in patrons after the hours that are allowed by the liquor authority, and this may cause an issue.
I was concerned myself when I was receiving the application, so I'll express you know the community board's concern and the precinct's concern like I said: yeah.
Just I want to make sure that we're going down the right path with this establishment.
So, like I said, I have a lot of experience when it comes to the operations of these restaurants and things that they can do, and it can't do.
I recall that in past times the 34 prison are rejected or was against an applicant that wanted to have a 24 7 service, and the concern back then, was that there are a lot of.
Like angel said you know, We don't want to put them in a road world to fail, but at the same time we have to protect the well-being of the community.
I received the application, you know, maybe I can address the concerns, and maybe we can, you know, cut it off at earlier time on the weekends and not operate 24 hours.
I, don't think it's a problem for the committee, but you know on the weekends.
The concern I, think that we just addressed it that too many hours we came to an agreement between the merchant and the committee.
I'd like to vote, okay, that you're right, please stop proceeding great.
