You have 10 members of your committee, okay, so we do have a quorum right.
Obviously you can mute yourself, some house keeping I like to have some members of the committee timing, the residence when there is a remark and also when those remarks and questions are brought to the table.
So Robin will keep our timing two minutes maximum for each resident or speakers, and that will only be when we have the residents asking questions and providing concerns.
I would also like to assign tasks from the committee members before we do.
So at this point, I need another volunteer to pass attendance before we start and after the introduction of everyone, I would like to pass attendance of all the businesses.
Thank you rosie at this point, I would like for all the committee members to please introduce yourselves starting with alphabetically.
I guess, what's considered the lower Washington Heights area in the 160s part of the neighborhood of the Community Board.
I'm, a member of Community, Board 12 and the chair of the parks and Cultural Affairs Committee, and thank you for welcoming me to your committee.
The committee is going to render as a resolution, all a recommendation for the General Board to pass when we meet later on.
A restaurant, an establishment has done a really good job of complying with community issues, and so you support their application, or there might be some very particular reasons that come out in the discussion as to why you're opposed.
They had no problems, no issues and based on the last resolution passed by the community report on October 26 of 2018.
Yes, you know what just say it vote say your name just keep talking and not have to go and not get confused.
We move to agenda item number two, and this is a crystal restaurant and doing business as Guadalupe.
I would like committee members to see if you have any comments.
On the last resolutions that this community report passed on November 29 2018, there was no objection to the general report and from what I see here, gondolu has the health inspection of an aide.
I'm, going to request that the committee goes to for straight vote.
So at the same time I'm going to see the any committee members we're voting.
Yes, any particular matter on that this is spending I, see that you have try to fix your audio I, see that you have violations here of going back from June 2017.
So this should not be a problem on my end and having said that, committee members, if you have no objections, I'd like to move for a boat on this particular matter and also to pass this up acclimation.
I had an additional application in to remove one of my partner, Jason Berger's name from yeah the decoration as he's as he left, and that does not show up there agenda item number 10.
My partner has not had any hand in the restaurant in quite a number of years, and we would just like to he wants to be off the liquor.
Do that so committee members, as you know, we do have access republicans that want to do a corporate change.
Is that if there is someone new coming to a license or to the partnership, we would like to know like experience that these people have in the restaurant industry how responsible they're going to be in handing out more.
We, you can ask type of questions as we have a new corporate changes or someone coming in into the corporation, all right.
Yes, sorry to sound like a broken record, but my new home, where I live, is quite near Nile's establishment, I find them to run a clean, place.
It gets a little bit loud and their staff is always on top of trying to keep people outside quiet, which I appreciate and they've done a really good job of making sure that their tables are far enough apart and that everything closes up when it's supposed to so they've been really on top of Covid-19 regulations.
That's fantastic, because it gives you know us a little more information and I want to complement, try on house, because really they have succeeded in serving diversity and community.
To present we have six seven eight violations, I know the place because I go there every now and then but communities.
I see none committee members I would like to hear your input on this matter.
I do not know what we're going to do, but I guess on my end.
I. Do not think I going to vote.
Well, as I said, I am hired to do a renewal application for a liquor authority, and this was placed on the calendar.
But if the community has any issues with my client getting a renewal of his liquor, license, please say.
So, based on what I hear from committee members and myself, it's concerning that one, knowing that the owner has problems in the restroom with a health inspection and they did not come to this meeting is very troubling, because now we have questions that do not have answers at this point.
I would like the committee members to see.
Who could answer the questions and address the issue of the health violations or whatever, like that, so that it's clear to the full board when they vote on it.
No objections in terms of noise, but I would like to see better spacing of their tables and less crowding on the rest on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant, so that there's easier, passage.
So much liz committee members saying none I recommend that we go to a vote and at this point, since there are some consensus, are going to.
If there are no comments or concerns from community members, I would like to move for vote and at this point, I would like to ask for any objection.
The ask here, residents and committee members is to add a dj.
So I think it's about time for my client to be able to submit the request to the liquor authority with the support of the community board.
There are no concerns from committee, members, I'd like to vote to vote and now this time, I would.
I'm sorry dancing advertised showtimes for entertainment or cover charges, no cover charges, no entertainment, and if you consider dancing like people jumping on the table next to the table, you know.
Procedurally I understand that people may have questions or concerns with Papacito, based on some incidents that happened in or around the establishment.
If the committee and later the board, were considering a renewal of their license, then all of those things really come into play, I, think.
So I'm, not really sure why the Community board has to weigh in on that frankly, at all, and why these sorts of questions and concerns which are legitimate questions and concerns I, do not think they really relate to this particular kind of application.
We need to know how to school very well committee members and with that I just want to say thank you for letting me join your meeting.
And, as you know, Covid-19, has sensor restrictions that we put people in the streets and whatnot, but they've been doing a pretty good job of limiting with time.
It's important that us as committee members recognize when things are getting done.
So you're, going to take ownership of this restaurant Las Quina de Nava, which is I, think close to 172Nd street.
So since, when you have been affiliated with this restaurant straight since September, but before that probably like a year or two prior to 2015.
Sorry of this year, I started working here, full time, and now you have been part of that restaurant.
Yes, and what's the name of the place in Jersey, it's called the pier house, the warehouse, the pier house, and have you gotten some training and alcohol handling in New York state, not in New York state, not yet at least who's going to do your partner in this establishment.
Again kind of you know to your point to see that all to the gentleman Christian who's trying to purchase this establishment.
Other committee members, good question.
Yes, I'm, going to have a manager here as well for the days that I won't be coming in, because I'm also currently doing a course right.
The Community board objected to the change of the math operations, so taking into account that there have been so many noise complaints, too.
You, know, I'm, sorry who's, this committee, member.
Also understand that you know it's your first time and you want to make sure to take over and actually get these issues.
You know they should not be in front of the business to take it down the block around the corner, fix these issues and then come back to us.
I. Think Maria, no I just wanted to echo Leo and just say also for for Mr Christian, just to take some time to get some training, because it sounds like you're, relatively new in the the restaurant business.
Committee members, please be ready to vote, is going to abstain.
This is a transfer of ownership and he has many things to do and he does not have the time to be in front of the restaurant right now, because he has a family in New Jersey and that the committee is preventing him to move on with his life at this time.
If, an objection from the question from the committee members saying: none is going to vote.
The community board is that you want to expand the establishment.
Martin collins indicated that he's very concerned about the time of operations for this establishment indicated that this stylish is like in a seven story building and to have music there until like two o'clock in the morning, could be an issue for residents very well.
The questionnaire this mexican place and for the community members I'm going to go through the specifics.
And I felt like I, wanted to bring it back to where I was born and raised for my community.
The hospital you know: I have family members that drive the MTA right around there.
And I, just want to you know give back to the community.
I want to do lunch, and actually we put 12 P.M and because of everything, that's going on.
We would like to put we put 12, but since we got a lot of a lot of people walking to the when we were there decorating the place and when we were going to open and a lot of empties.
This is going to be a 500 hearing, because it said there were three liquor licenses in the area.
You know wonder if you think about going for a restaurant wine license first.
We wanted to do the wine and liquor for first to start off, but it would take the same amount of time and it would have cost us more in the long run because then later on, we will also have to submit for like a hard liquor.
We want to give time for people that get that get into the restaurant, let's say to eat at 12.
There are no questions, I'd like to move off a vote, I had my hand up, Mr, Dro. If I might speak, again, I'm, sorry, who's, this.
That's, okay, and your comments and Nancy's comments covered a lot of what I was going to say: I mean we all remember: names like Kawala, Cafe and Hashi Sushi, which were neighboring businesses to the space, but generate a lot of problems.
Seven days, a week, one A.M very well so you're recommending that the change of I always be straight until 1 am yes any other committee members that will have same or similar recommendations, it's okay for it to be a two o'clock on a weekend.
You know I, like your approach, I, like your flexibility and I, think that you're going to prosper and when you do prosper.
Flexible I, see that we can work with you, like I, can see that you know we going to work as a community.
This application is not going to work.
I had a Koa restaurant between 170Th and 171St. Let me speed up the agenda because I'm going to keep you here, forever, actually.
We're now going to go into our agenda item number 17.
Oh, my god, you remember so this style, this establishment that has been in place, but the license is going to be transferred.
I do not see residents committee members, any questions saying no, let's go to a straight vote.
Hopefully we're going to survive this colvit thing and stay here for whatever years we can omega I, really appreciate what you have done for the community.
So I'm very grateful for the work that you have done for that place because I know it was a travel area for the community.
Have any questions from our committee members saying no I recommend that we go to a boat.
It has the questionnaire floor plan and also a copy of the menu, so is going to vote in favor, next.
So by a vote of seven zero, this application passes.
Committee members, you know, I can attest.
I'm, missing ninja, yes, okay angel vote, 700, this application, passes.
So we're going to not end up in this application, all right.
Yes, next Rosie's going to vote.
Thank you committee, members.
