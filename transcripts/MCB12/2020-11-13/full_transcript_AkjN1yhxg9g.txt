So I'd like to start this meeting on time because we do have a full technical in front of us and there's plenty to cover and it before I start driving. He said: do we have someone doing the translation or not you're still muted. Not today is Israel. I'm sorry about that. I did not get in touch with those people, not a problem. According to my list, you have 10 members of your committee, okay, so we do have a quorum right now and I see that actually also janus very well. So at 6:33, I'm calling this meeting to order with Quorum instead of presiding over the meeting, and at this point I'd like for all of you to please mute yourselves. If you do have a comment or question, then obviously you can mute yourself, some house keeping I like to have some members of the committee timing, the residence when there is a remark and also when those remarks and questions are brought to the table. That who is answering the question we'll have two minutes so I need someone from the committee to please time so who would take on that task? I will? Who was that rival? So Robin will keep our timing two minutes maximum for each resident or speakers, and that will only be when we have the residents asking questions and providing concerns. I would also like to assign tasks from the committee members before we do. Anything. I would like to have someone to do the minutes and someone to do the resolutions. Last time we had Cindy Matus and also Rosie Cruz, Rosie Paris being a volunteer, so I think that some two people volunteered to take other minutes and the resolution this time around who were those they all can do the resolution so Leo will do the resolutions any volunteer for the minutes do not be shy. It could be anyone I, send a template for the minutes and the resolutions Leo so I'll send that over to you later on, I think I sent that last time around right. You guys received it very well. If I know one volunteers, then I guess you know we can always hit me up by tomorrow. If you're one of the minutes, if not, it means that I will have to the minutes and I'm going to be tired, but we got ta. Take a business right. So at this point, I need another volunteer to pass attendance before we start and after the introduction of everyone, I would like to pass attendance of all the businesses. It's just meaning going through the agenda to see who's here who's. Not that way we would know who will be present to a percent and will be much easier and transparent. It's Ashley, sorry I missed the part where you were asking for volunteers for minutes. I was putting my dog I was putting down food for my dog, but I can do the minutes for it tonight. You so much I guess I can do the roll call problem. Thank you rosie at this point, I would like for all the committee members to please introduce yourselves starting with alphabetically. As you see on the screen, so I think. Can you the first one and you please introduce yourself? Oh I'm, sorry I did not hear that you I did not hear you call on me. Yeah angel vasquez, you know resident in the I guess, what's considered the lower Washington Heights area in the 160s part of the neighborhood of the Community Board. Thank you, Next stock committee member should I just call her on everyone. Yes, Maria Rivera, Robin, Cruz, Ashley, Fernandez, hi, everyone, Mariel, Ali, Rodriguez, all right so cindy I think is on the line, but she's not available at this point. I would like. If there are any board members are present to please introduce themselves I see liz ritter is present as a participant welcome list. Thank you for your support. As always, at this point, I would like for the prisons the police side to boost this house. I, see that we have a territory prison present. Yes, how are you doing lieutenant concepcion on the third precinct present very well. I see now that do we have any elected official reps present. I do not see any. If you do come on board, please stop feel free and pretend list video has your you have your hands up. What's up the point, please alice I think you can be promoted, please promote Lewis to be a panelist, chanel or vanessa. Please thank you list. You're not promoted leader support member. Please introduce yourself hi. My name is Liz ritter, I'm a member of Community, Board 12 and the chair of the parks and Cultural Affairs Committee, and thank you for welcoming me to your committee meeting. Thank you so much liz, a couple of things that before we proceed chanel if you're so kind, when you send me the package, please have them separate print them like each one at a time, because sometimes when you print all at once, we have documents that belong to the previous applicant and then, when I separate all these documents, it goes away with. You know that package. So if you so can just please print them like one by one and not that way. You know the information will not be misplaced. On my end and also the voting card I should now they have to be on top of every single applicant, not like all together as we have it as you sent that out. So each applicant will have the voting card in front of them right so talking about this, so each applicant will have this on top of our applications. That I would know what the ask is: hey vanessa. Are we able to get a response from the 34 person? I do not see them here, try to contact them, we sent several emails and phone calls and voicemails. No one has respond. Okay, are you sending that to officer Matinouchi or you know that officer pen is no longer there? Yes, we did to Martin Newsham and also we sent it to Chris and Haiti very well. So she now we go you're going to share the screen when we have the documents that you sent me tonight. I mean this afternoon right because I did not have access to a printing, the printer, all right, how you say that let me just go over how we're going to proceed with the meeting I'm going to do a roll call you're going to indicate if you're, here or not all of the applicants should be elevated to be panelists. I, do request that you please put yourselves in nude, so that we can have a very fruitful conversation and also to proceed with the meeting. After that we're going to listen to each applicant. We will ask the prisons to provide an opinion on these applications. We will ask the business also to give us some understanding as to what's going on and what they want. We also give an opportunity to our residents to make sure that they are informed as to what's coming to the neighborhood and will not take them by surprise and after which we hear comments from the residents the NYPD and the applicant. The committee is going to render as a resolution, all a recommendation for the General Board to pass when we meet later on. At the very end of the month, so what the committee will do is to provide a recommendation to the General Board. It does not mean by any way way or form that what we do here or decide is final. It has to be the decision of the General Board as a whole, so ours will only be a recommendation. Are there any questions on how we're going to proceed? Let's see no question, let's proceed. If by any chance you see that you're not being recognized that when you raise your hand, feel free and just you know, state your opinion, then I'll recognize you because I know that you know using this thing is not the easiest way to provide information to everyone very well. So let me do the roll call beside your restaurant. Are you here? I'm sure you got the agenda, so please review the agenda while you're here just to meet yourself and stay present right, so I see the side. It's not here. Guadalupe is here trying public house present. This award has not answered Uptight Corp people pool; oh, did Lara slap, it yeah! Thank you! New Haven Radio Blaster, Dispatch, Hey President, the President Cafe Matthias all doing businesses, not here present Taco Coco Seafood here for La Cantina, is present la Cantina, Heights correct, yes, okay, Coco, Seafood, Lavazza, Sport, Bar, Arthur Cafe, very well, so we're going to start so gerard, who is the vice chair of the community here he usually assists me with some administrative work here, so I'll try to do my best, so please bear with me so let's proceed with the applicants before yes, who is this present? Yes, thank you before we move on list. You have some some comments. I see that you put a statement but I like to listen up to what is that you have to say yeah. Thank you earlier in the meeting. I was just hoping that the resolutions include a little bit of the reasoning behind why why an application is supported or why it's opposed, because sometimes there are particular reasons. A restaurant, an establishment has done a really good job of complying with community issues, and so you support their application, or there might be some very particular reasons that come out in the discussion as to why you're opposed and I think that's makes for a better rounded resolution than just they came before us at this meeting on this date and we agreed to oppose or to support the application are not well taken noted and we would have more meat to it on the resolutions. Thank you. It's a great point and thank you for your input. As always so the first one we have inside your restaurant. Do we have a representative saying no, this is with a priority for precinct. Do we have the 34th present I had a note from obviously Matunuchi that he he might not make it tonight, but he was going to do his best not to to make sure that he sent someone. Unfortunately, we have no representation from the committee from the prison, but we would go as such. Do I have other representatives here, I see, none do I, have comments or concerns from the residents me list rhythm. That's actually why I dropped into this meeting. I just wanted to I used I no longer live near there, because I have moved, but for many years since they opened I had lived near that establishment and I know them to be. You know, responsive good actors, they keep a clean sidewalk. They run a good business. There have not been any complaints and I had actually logged on to the meeting so that I could speak in support of them. I'm surprised that there's no one here and hopefully they will they're just having issues signing on or something and they'll show up at some point during the meeting and I hope that they enjoy the committee's support. Thank you. So much do we have any other residents that would like to add in staying on I see that, as you indicated this, they had no problems, no issues and based on the last resolution passed by the community report on October 26 of 2018. There was no objection so at this point take into account that we do have positive comments from our residents, even though we do not have the presence of our 34 prisons. I recommend the community to go to Auto Street vote. So Jiran will usually help me on this, and this is what I missed Gerard So committee members. You see yourselves on the screenshot right on the right-hand side. You see your names there right angel. Yes, you know what just say it vote say your name just keep talking and not have to go and not get confused. So anger, yes, yeah next Leo! Yes, Leo! Yes, cindy! Yes, oh yes, Ashley! Yes, better!

Thank you liz for your comments very well. This application passes 700. Next. We move to agenda item number two, and this is a crystal restaurant and doing business as Guadalupe. Do we have any representatives from Guadalupe? Yes- and you are the on representative- yes, which one are you the owner or the representative? They won't know very well. This is with the purview 34 prisoner. Not here, do I have any comments from residents say. None at this point. I would like committee members to see if you have any comments, if not we'll go to straight vote. Based on the last resolutions that this community report passed on November 29 2018, there was no objection to the general report and from what I see here, gondolu has the health inspection of an aide. It seems like a serendipity I understand from previous I recall that previously the 34 prison had no issues with your establishment and I'm sure that they are known. Are there any issues that have transpired recently that you know of any fines and entiendes De tables? She said? No. Thank you so much at this point. I'm going to request that the committee goes to for straight vote. If there are no objections, so at the same time I'm going to see the any committee members we're voting I have no objection. I just wanted to say it's a phenomenal establishment that I feel, like has been. You know, safe in an addition and a beautiful addition to our community yeah I, like the establishment when I go there, I have fun. The food is great, the price have not been so high, but you know the ambiance is really great. Thank you angel for your stay. Thank you yeah! So follow us in favor, say: hi, bye, hi, saying no positions. This application passes seven zero, senora felicidades. Thank you sure. At this point, I'm going to call agenda iron number three, which is Indian Rock affair. Do we have a representative from India Cafe? Yes, I'm right here for the purpose. Please tell us, I'm sorry Jason Minter and you are I'm the owner very well. Thank you so much jason for coming over this is when the program 34 pc on your last I have inspection. You have a I'm sorry. What was your last inspiration here great pending right, Jason I, believe so. Yes, any particular matter on that this is spending I, see that you have try to fix your audio I, see that you have violations here of going back from June 2017. It's fine, it's just an internet connection. I think do I, have any comments from our residents. I see a hand that is up, and that is David Thorne David, I'm going to ask that you'd be promoted, so you'll be able to speak so venice. If you're so kind to please subscribe, he can be a panelist and then he can ask a question two minutes right. David. Now you have the floor for two minutes. Oh can you hear me now is that working now? Yes, we can. Okay, sorry about that yeah! No, my name is David Tom I live a few blocks away on 217Th Street just wanted to express support. You know the restaurant is an excellent example of how to cooperatively function very well within a residential community, and you know strong support from the community is all I've ever seen for Jason's establishment. They do an excellent job. Thank you so much David for your input and making sure that you also complement business when they deserve to be complimented. Do I have any residence that I would like to add say no, I'm going to establish that Sadra list. Yes, please yeah I, just want to echo David's comments. Indian road cafe runs Jason, runs a clean bar and they're a good neighborhood establishment, so they have no noise complaints and they're extremely gracious about allowing parks users to use their restroom, which is a much appreciated community amenity. So we love Jason. Thank you. So much Alex and I will say that the last time they came on board, November, 29th or 2018. The community report did not have any objection in approving the renewal, so this should not be a problem on my end and having said that, committee members, if you have no objections, I'd like to move for a boat on this particular matter and also to pass this up acclimation, but if any anyone against, then we can run at the regular vote. If the objections this will pass by acclimation any objections saying this application passes. 700. Jason, congratulations and we hope that you continue to prosper and continue to do a great job. Thank you. I had an additional application in to remove one of my partner, Jason Berger's name from yeah the decoration as he's as he left, and that does not show up there agenda item number 10 we'll take care of that right away so that you do not have to wait online. So the idea here is to to add or delete someone patiently to the lead. Jason Berger, because he's not been had any involvement in many years in a decade and yeah, we've all never met him. I can promise you to delete, who I'm sorry so Jason Berger my partner, Jason Berger, another jason who's. My partner has been my was my partner has not had any hand in the restaurant in quite a number of years, and we would just like to he wants to be off the liquor license essentially he's off the corporation now and he's gone, not a problem. Let's do that so committee members, as you know, we do have access republicans that want to do a corporate change. You will see this more frequently as we go through some economic hardship, not saying that you know it's just going through that now, but you will see a lot of corporate changes later on what we like to say. This is that if there is someone new coming to a license or to the partnership, we would like to know like experience that these people have in the restaurant industry how responsible they're going to be in handing out more so we you can ask type of questions as we have a new corporate changes or someone coming in into the corporation all right. So having said that, are there any positions to this application committee members? It's a corporate change. Staying known this application passes anonymously, congratulations! Jason! Once again, your corporate channel is here by this committee to take care of yourself. Thank you. Community always appreciate it. Thank you so much. We now move up to agenda item number four. Do we have someone representing trial and public house? Yes, I'm here for the purpose of the minute. Please tell us your affiliation name, an affiliation. Please sure my name is Niall Henry, I'm the owner of Tribal house. That's it very well Henry. The only thing that we would like is for you to have a submitted. Other questionnaire. I did last. Oh sorry, I did last night or yesterday at some point all right. Sorry, Tuesday I did on Tuesday. Okay. Now. Thank you. Chanel final point. So, as you can see she now, please move up this questionnaire in case our committee members will have some questions slowly. You can, you know, keep on scrolling up. What's your capacity henry capacity right now is 74 legally, but we're going for a public assembly. It's going on for about three and a half years now with the department of buildings and everything else. So when we get when we get the public assembly it'll be more, but so that number has not been determined yet everything Makovid has slowed it down, so it's taking a lot longer than it should take, but it is what it is understood. I noticed that you have access to the outside dining. Yes, I have basically established it a couple of times. It's a nice place. The world they have a couple of drinks never had an issue there. It would be nice, though, if every now and then I know that you know we celebrate different cultures, as maybe has not been my luck, but I've never seen the public house celebrating either Cinco De Mayo the dominican Independence day or any other latina holidays or special days. Maybe my bad luck, but you do it yeah we do th this year. We did not. We did not do a cinco De Mayo because of the Covid-19, but every year prior we to the Cinco De Mayo and and we do a small dominican day parade event, but I. I've also been asked for the dominican independence Day celebration and we're going to do that going forward very well. Thank you! So much do you have any comments from our residents. I see that list. You have your handout. Yes, sorry to sound like a broken record, but my new home, where I live, is quite near Nile's establishment, I find them to run a clean place. Occasionally it gets a little bit loud and their staff is always on top of trying to keep people outside quiet, which I appreciate and they've done a really good job of making sure that their tables are far enough apart and that everything closes up when it's supposed to so they've been really on top of Covid-19 regulations and they run a safe place. So I appreciate that. Thank you list anybody else so sheena. Please take this presentation out because, like I can not see who has their hands up, you have a nancy Preston once Nancy Preston. Can you please you have two minutes nancy? Yes, hi! Thank you and first of all, I want to thank you for sharing the questionnaires. That's fantastic because it gives you know us a little more information and I want to complement, try on house, because really they have succeeded in serving diversity and community. If you go in there, you know you do not really go in there like you used to now, but you see people from all over the community, all different ages coming, and so you know, and they as you've heard. You know they really do operate a respectful business. There is a fully occupied residence above them and I'm unaware of any noise issues even when they were operating inside, and you know they have proven to be really a good operator and I live right around the corner and are there 150 units in our complex and, in fact, there's a whole group of people that go there regularly from our complex. Thank you. Thank you. So much nancy for your comments. Part of our record at this point I, would like to go to straight vote. If there are no objections from our committee members, unless you have questions committed members, any objections seeing none I recommend a call to a straight vote. Any position I see no position, so this vote passes anonymously. Now, congratulations keep doing the great job, I think it's a beautiful place that you have there and it's an asset to our community. Thank you. Thank you. So much I also have something on here on the number 14 for method of operation change. We it in the past we've gotten requests for. You know if someone's having a birthday party back when we're open back, you know pre-Covid if they could have a dj or have karaoke and I've been not necessarily been open to it, because it's not on our license. So I'd like to perhaps get that on my license to have I'm sorry you do not have you say number 14 is that is that on there method operation change we have like Kayla for 14. Oh now, I'm looking at a wrong calendar, then I thought I put it there. I thought I put in there for the renewal and for and to add a dj in karaoke. Basically, the office expert. Do you have a maybe printed? A very recent I mean very old agenda, because I do not see that here. What's the name of the business same business, it's 4740, Broadway, restaurant llc I did not receive a method of operation for that business. Okay, I'm looking at an old agenda, I guess from it's printed out! Oh wait! No worries! I can put it in again. So now we will definitely and hopefully see you next month. Okay, all right guys! Thank you very much. Take care. Take it easy bye-bye at this point. I will move forward and do agenda item number five punto El. Do we have a representative from Punton sc non? No representative? The prison is not here yet. This is within the prairie 34 prison. This particular agenda item going back to the last agent. The last time they came to the board January 28th of last year. They had there was no issues. However, we do see a lot of health call violations very. Concerning going back from my June 6 2018 to present we have six seven eight violations, I know the place because I go there every now and then but communities. You have access to this report, the health inspection. Yes, no, so there was evidence of our mice or life. Mice are present in the facility toxic chemicals improperly labeled. So we do not have anyone present. I'm sorry! This is Marielle. I. Have a question? Was that emailed to everyone I, do not I'm trying to see if I can explain, it is part of the package is, was it sent under the research one or is that a different one on the research? Okay? Thank you. Let me take a look. Thank you. So there are some violations. We do not have any representative from the restaurant nor from the precinct. Do we have any comments from residents. I see none committee members I would like to hear your input on this matter. Yes, I do not think we can it's a resolution that we have to do a negative vote because they have a lot of violations and they're, not even here so to explain what happened with those violations that they have. You know if they correct it or they continue to have it. I do not know what we're going to do, but I guess on my end, I do not think I going to vote positive. You think you're not going to you're not going to vote positive yeah. No because I'm wondering, if they're not here, and they have a lot of violations, can we even vote or yes, we can okay. I have a question, though it looks I mean. Maybe the person stepped away from their computer, but in the Q&A it says that the person's here we're talking about Punto, De, Sabor, correct, yes, and it looks like that person's in the panelists as well. Nihal, no niall henry is from the previous one, no not niall henry. This is nihal trevetti, where the person put I'm here for Punta Lisa, but maybe they stepped away from their computer. No, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. Oh okay, I think this is for renewal. I represent the client. I do not know the client well, but it was on the calendar. So is he there I do not know if he's there or not. Now you are representing this business. Yeah I represent I'm the attorney who's business and you do not know if they're here should not I should not that be your job. Well, let me try to call them and see if they've checked in or not. Are you aware the violations that are listed here? No as far as the building violations know? Are you talking about building restaurant has a lot of violations, okay, anything specific relating to the liquor authority violations, or is it just any noise anything for the community? It's all about health. The health inspection that they have guy has not been positive at all. Okay, so- and it started me to know that you are representing this business and you do not know anything about this business now, let's not go that route. Well, as I said, I am hired to do a renewal application for a liquor authority, and this was placed on the calendar. So obviously I'm here to advocate them, but if the community has any issues with my client getting a renewal of his liquor license, please say so and I'll address it. We can maybe have a second time on the Second board meeting next time, but I'm more concerned about the renewal of the liquor license this. It is the renew of the legal license. We do see and check everything that pertains to the establishment and health is critical and important, especially with a pandemic sure. So please tell me your concern and I'll bring it to my clients, attention and I'll try to address it with him, and if you have any objections with his renewal, please say so that it would be more concerning to him and for his business. So very well. So, based on what I hear from committee members and myself, it's concerning that one, knowing that the owner has problems in the restroom with a health inspection and they did not come to this meeting is very troubling, because now we have questions that do not have answers at this point. I would like the committee members to see. If they want to go to a straight vote, we can. We can vote. Let's go to a vote. Let me explain a little bit later, all those in favor, please say your name whoever's in favor, I can't so I'll be who else you know: Cindy Angel Abstain and your abstain. I think we're missing. Rosie I abstain, so we have rosie and angel abstaining and I, see Rossini Maria, Leo and Robin against so by a vote of Zero I have to put this application. Fails. Neo I think that you should have a chat with your client. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So much on that note. I would like to call on now the next agenda, which is which is one of your first 181st ethereum. Yes, please so. This would be an example where the resolution it would be helpful if there was a, whereas that said, whereas there was no apple, no represent no representation from the applicant. Who could answer the questions and address the issue of the health violations or whatever, like that, so that it's clear to the full board when they vote on it? What the issue was and why the committee opposed the application. Thank you so much Lisa Pointless well taken. Thank you! I'm sorry, it's Irelia quick question: have they gotten to Coco seafood or arthurs I was on the other? No, oh thank God. I'm sorry guys! I'm just listening very well at this point.

Okay again, this is when the purview 34 precinct the prison is not present, but I'll read what is what was written in the previous resolution, which was November 29th 2018. The community report ran the recommendation of no objection to this license and the renewal do I. Have any comments from our residents? I see no comments from our residents. Our committee members I see a list. I'm sorry list no objections in terms of noise, but I would like to see better spacing of their tables and less crowding on the rest on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant, so that there's easier passage. Thank you. So much liz committee members saying none I recommend that we go to a vote and at this point since there are some consensus, are going to. Please say your name and tell me how you're going to vote I see a robot in favor next angel, yes, Leo, yes, Ashley, yes, by a vote of 700. This application passes, congratulations, Lada and I hope you do continue to prosper, but please take into account the comments that were made about social distancing. As you know, we do have a spike in the pandemic and it would be nice if you take care of the concerns of one of our board members all right. Thank you. Thank you to take care of that. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. The next item on the agenda is people pull. Do we do representative here from the last time we did the rocco again. This is with the purview 34 prison they're. Not here, people will claim that this applicant came to a community board. There was no objection before and that was on the cemetery for the of the minutes. Please tell us your name in relation to this entity. Bertie Rivera and you are they represented these people very well. Do I have any concerns from residents. Saying no I will stick out comments from the committee members no issue: I recommend that we go to stray ball on this matter. Any opposition to that I see no position, so this application passes seven zero, congratulations, berkies, congratulations and I hope that you guys are welcome. Thank you very well. So now we move to agenda item number eight, which is, which is part c of our agenda. I would like now to call the representatives from the New Heaven radio dispatch, and if, for the record, please tell us your name, please, yes, hi, my name is Donald Amadour manager and you have already discussed and I'm the mentor of Rodriguez, I'm president and you have not radio dispatch very well. How long you've been in business we've been in business, 2011 very well so for committee members we also are in charge of addressing licenses for delivery corporations. So anytime that we have this type of our licenses is required. I come to the community board I, it's a formality that you know they come, but it's important that they keep the spaces that they have in front of the stores are clean and not allow their the drivers to stay there for too long and not to be hunging horns, that's most of the things that we are concerned with, but what they must do is that they need to renew the license, but they that got ta, bring it to up the community board. It's usually formality, and it's nice. You know that they come, but if they do not get other approval from the community board, they will not get the license renewed. Do we have any comments from residents saying none again? This is with the period 34 precinct they're, not here. So if there are no comments or concerns from community members, I would like to move for vote and at this point, I would like to ask for any objection. If not will pass anonymously, no objections, seeing that it passes automatically seven zero. Congratulations, Sarah Metro! Please thank you. Thank you. Guys do not have to stay for the meeting. If you want berkeys, you also do not have to stay for the meeting. Those resolutions that we called you do not have to stay for to the very end you guys can leave. Thank you stay safe. Everyone. Thank you at this point. We're going to move out to part d of the agenda which is agenda. Item number nine cafematis is next and the idea here is to add a dj to a method operation. This is with the preview 34 precinct they're. Not here, do I have representatives. That's how are you doing? This is Miguel Acosta, representing cafe, matias doing business at Savannah Tacos, so Miguel is Matias. He has an age which is interesting, very well Gino. Do we have a questionnaire for this applicant? So the ask here, residents and committee members is to add a dj correct. So let's go through the math operation, slowly, just right there. Okay, so you have you, do not have a jukebox correct. You do not have karaoke. You do not have like music you're just asking for dj right. Yes, correct, okay, ashina! Can you please move up a little bit and what's the capacity here, amigo, 74. okay, so stop that down? One second go call down a little bit up: sorry yeah up so the hours of operations, it's usually 3, P.M to 1, A.M, Correct and then Fridays and saturdays. Until 2 am so the last time that you came on board, there was no opposition from the Community board. Let me see what the prison had to indicate. There were no issues from the 34th precinct, just a question. Why would you like to add a dj well on the previous method of operation? This location was this business was located on Broadway. There was a method of operation, well, a petition to remove this license from Broadway to Nagel Avenue, due to the history of the location from the previous establishment. That was there. The SLA did not approve at the time that the license was petitioned to remove to be removed. They did not approve a dj at that time until my client operated for at least a year and a half. So it's about that time now. So basically, the hours of operations are not changing. The business has been in compliance. You know, with all the rules and regulations has been. A good operator has not had any 311s as I had no police activity. So I think it's about time for my client to be able to submit the request to the liquor authority with the support of the community board. I do not think they will have a problem. So you've been saying that you're saying that the business has been running smoothly for the last couple of years, no complaints well, since it was since it was petitioned to be removed and located at this address now, prior to that, when it was at Bro on Broadway, it had no issues, it was moved from Broadway the operations was moved to Nagel Avenue has not had any issues so very well. Committee members, any questions, yeah cdro. Yes, please again, it would be helpful if the if the resolution states the nature of the change in the method of operation but I just want to say this seems like a good example of the kind of thing that we like to do. When we ask for an establishment to establish themselves before they get a later, you know, sometimes we ask for a place to have a restaurant wine before they go for an opl or to operate till midnight until they get to operate later, so it seems like they've, established themselves as a good as a good business and that it would be appropriate to grant them this next step. Thank you. Thank you. So much liz point. Wall Maiden will take him at this point. If there are no concerns from committee members, I'd like to vote to vote and now this time I would, since it's a change after my operations, I will go one by one. I still vote. Yes, next, robin yes angel, yes, Andrew, yes, Marielle, yes, Leo, yes, Mario, yes, Rosie, yes and missing one by a vote of seven zero. This application passes mikhail. Congratulations once again, like. Let's indicate it a clear example that if you do business the community and the Community board would support you and reward you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. So much. Thank you for your business. We will now move out to agenda item number 11 because we did number 10 already with the Hudson fulton cooperation during the rockefeller. That was done. So now we go to agenda item number 11, which is Vita Mexicana doing business. Hello. Is this one wendy yeah Wendy Hernandez Hi Wendy Hernandez and you are I'm the owner of Papacito Mexico, Vitamin, Canada, okay, so you're the owner. This is with the purview of 34 prisoners. The 34 Christian, however, is not in the house. Okay, very concerning, because I understand that there have been some issues with papastathon, which are have been very public very well. So the ask here is for corporate change. Correct yeah, yes, very well for competing members. As you probably know, owners have the right to buy, sell to sell and what's going to come on board, we can ask some questions so now: wendy who's taking over and who's leaving the this license. Stella mateo is leaving and I'm taking over the rest of the percentage, so I'll be 85 percent, so estella mate, who had ownership over 50 right yeah, is leaving yeah and you taking over 85 percent. No 50 and I'm 35 percent already the system 35 owner, so you will have 85 percent ownership, yes, very well! So wendy there were some issues with Papastito and coming from the report from the NYPD, we got from back. That's January, 14 2017, where there was a lot of issues assaulting the third degree summons on the reach out noise under unreasonable noise on the age operation, which result in positive, sell, summons for overcrowding, 5,217 assault on the third degree same year. This early premise latch fight, eleven, twenty seven, seventeen large fights inside establishment, someone slashed across the face 2018 with NYPD and SLA inspection. The security guard presented a fake. I d, who was that security is that person still employed the summer was misreading for the by the officer, because what they were saying is that the security was not in the book or register. So after that, we provide all the proof to the court and I believe I have core I'll. Tell you right now, because everything got pushed back because of kovi. I was supposed to be on court in March and they push it back and I have core I'll. Tell you right now with the proof of that summonses and others. So yeah I have court on so Miss Mateo had majority ownership of this establishment right. Fifty. How long have you been there one day since day, one 13 years now what you think you guys need to do now as new owners to rectify some of the issues? Well, right now we are because of the Covid-19. Things have changed, but last time I was on the community board. We implemented different security system, we had a new manager and some of the staff we have replaced it, and you know part of the operation is the Hookah situation is like. We do not have hookah, we do not have we stopped the dj. We stopped a couple of things that was bringing a crowd that we know it was. It was not really welcome into the business, so we eliminate all that before the Covid-19 started so with the Covid-19 is like there's. No, you know music known. We comply with all the rules and regulation for the copyright team, so this has not been any overcrowded crowd or anything like that very well, especially the new manager, because, as you understand, we I can't be there 24 7. So the times that I'm there, mostly when the summer was rained I was there personally and I looked into everything, got arrested, I address it and that's why I'm going to court on the I'm sorry it's next week, which is being rescheduled for next week and I, have all the proven provider approved to the to the court. What can you tell us about a shooting that took place and from your establishment last year? It was not real. It was not really from establishment. It happened on the whole strip, not on the strip, but it happened really on broadway. If you really are aware, it happened right in front across the street from right around the corner from the starbucks, which is the entrance of the subway and every escalating to the front of the gas station a black over. So it was like. Basically, the australian came out from Broadway I mean from Papacito, and that was all part of the argument that we have it in court, but I understand that somehow your establishment was how to report to the SLA in this matter and NYPD right yeah. Well, actually, I'm the one that called 911 to report the accident, because it was a big fight that happened in the whole street. It was not really inside but Pasito or apa Pasito. So, but everything like I said before everything is playing up a positive I guess: I do not even know why you know, but we saw we show and have the proof of all the civilian cameras and none of the people involved in the problem was coming from Papacito. We still have all that proof and the the civilian camera recording very well. So you think you have this place in order and save us. You take over us on the new ownership yeah. Do we have any I see that there's a hand from Jennifer Bristol Sheena if you're so kind, please put, as you know, as a panelist, so we can unders hi there. First off I'm kind of shocked that one of our neighborhood establishments have had so much crime. I guess I am not informed. That's really scary, as someone who lives a few blocks away to know that so much violence has happened in one establishment. The other thing is you guys do have. Yucca I actually witnessed it a couple of weeks ago outside seating people sharing, hookahs and I saw it with my own eyes. You're shaking your head. I have video I mean I've. Seen it I was kind of dumbfounded. I did not think you could have hookah when we have a pandemic. Breathing is one thing: blowing smoke in each other's faces in a small space is another. So I just want to put that on record that you just said you do not do hookah and I know you did he'll go. So that's all I had to say that's my 30 seconds. Thank you so much Jennifer. You actually have two minutes, but thank you for your input. I think I see myself hulka there. If I. If I'm not mistaken, no I mean that the problem that I have is that I have dagman bar right at my door and I have videos I have all the videos of the daily operation and the closing every night, since we gave up permission to use the street and I have dikeman bar right at my door. Most of the problem that happened at Taikman bar is like people walked into Papacito when the caps comes and when it's complaining about the whole. You know within the area and it's similar to look like Papacido, but I do not even have hookah and establishment I do not serve Hookah and I have like I said the videos talk to himself I mean I'm throughout the whole epidemic. Mama, Tsuchi and Papasito does not sell Hookah taboo sells hookah like my bar sell hookah. They both next to me and I'm more than you know, happy to provide you all kinds of civilian cameras, and you can see because I put with the street I move some of my cameras to the street to secure and record any accident or eventually happen within the street, and then you can see that there's no hookah I mean I'm more than happy to provide you with all the proof. Thank you. So much. Can you remind me again what type of corporate change is it that they're looking for I'm sorry, I missed that and I am going through all the applications and I just can't find their application. It's a corporate change. I mean that someone is taking over got it operation in this case is some wendy who had I believe I think was, if you're not mistaken, like less than 35 percent 25. Now he will take 85 of the share and the rest will be shared by some other member very well committee members. Any questions any other questions either. I'm not sure but I see David Tom David. You have two minutes. Please tell us. Yes, thank you again. My name is Dave Tom and I'm an Inwood resident. My question for Papacito is: do they ever does it ever occur in the establishment that they have either dancing advertise showtimes or cover charges and depending on the answer to that is the rest of my comment: live music and dancing and what else I'm sorry dancing advertised showtimes for entertainment or cover charges, no cover charges, no entertainment, and if you consider dancing like people jumping on the table next to the table, you know clapping yeah, but if it's like like a place where people get up and go to the stage and dance, no, we do not have stage. We do not allow people to dance very well. Thank you. I see that thank you. David I see that Jennifer that you said that you have video please send out, can I can I speak for again, I know can I. Let me let me recognize the board member first, then I would I just I just want to correct myself. So I'm sorry Mr Hernandez I relooked at the video and it's definitely on the border. It could be the other restaurant. It looks like Papacito's, but it might be the it might be just on the border of the two places. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. So much really appreciate it. Listen! So I'm just a little perplexed. Procedurally I understand that people may have questions or concerns with Papacito, based on some incidents that happened in or around the establishment. So if we, if the committee and later the board, were considering a renewal of their license, then all of those things really come into play, I think. But what you're being asked to consider right now is the removal of someone from the license and the expansion of the number of shares of someone who's already on the license and not the addition of anybody new on the license. So I'm not really sure why the Community board has to weigh in on that frankly, at all, and why these sorts of questions and concerns which are legitimate questions and concerns I, do not think they really relate to this particular kind of application. I want a second I want a second those sentiments. Thank you. Thank you unless any time that there is a proper change or someone taking over a specific number of shares beyond ten percent. It has to be notified to the community report later on the SLA. There is an application that it has to. They have to file it's very thorough application. They have to detail who's taking over what, and for that reason we need to know who the owner will be and for you know, security purposes and for reference purposes. We need to know how to school very well committee members and with that I just want to say thank you for letting me join your meeting. Unfortunately, I have another meeting. I have to go to so I got ta hop off, but before you thank you for your input. Thank you. Do I have any other questions. If not we'll go to straight vote. I see, that's obviously, there's Leo I just want to say to Wendy I went about a month ago and, as you know, Covid-19 has sensor restrictions that we put people in the streets and whatnot, but they've been doing a pretty good job of limiting with time. So you can only sit there and eat for about 90 minutes, which I think is really good. Socials distancing has been upheld by Wendy, Hernandez and Papasito, so I, you know I commend the change for the last couple of years hearing all these incidents, so what it is now I commend you one day. Thank you. Thank you so much rio for your input, anytime, that we have any comments from our committee members. You know I do take that into account, because it's important it's important that us as committee members recognize when things are getting done the proper way. Thank you Leo. On that note, I'd like to go to a vote so and I'm going to call names. Zero votes. Yes, next, Leo! Yes, Leo! Yes, Robin! Yes, Robbie! Yes, Rosie! Yes, Rosie! Yes, Marielle! Yes, Mario, yes, angel! Yes, Ashley are you around, so I'm going to go over the vote. Isidro Leo, Robin Rosie Mariel Ninja vote! Yes, Ashley! Not! Yes! Okay! Thank you! Bro! Thank you, Ashley! So I vote of seven zero. This application passes wendy. Congratulations on getting. Eighty-Five percent of the shares of Aposito is a nice place. I have not been there in a while, but I'll, be sure to drop by and say, hi, congratulations and I hope that you do prosper. Thank you so much very well. That will put us back on agenda item number. 12. and I will call now Las Quina de Nava to come to the floor. Las Quina de Nava. Do we have any representative? Yes, no, yes, who is representing so we're going to have a venezuelan mind to please translate in case that Carlos does not understand something that we are going to proceed. Carlos so you're the owner. Can you please tell us that why you want there is a corporate change. Someone is buying or some someone is selling. Can you please tell us about? He said that he want to sell his axe. His portion of his corporation chairs to another member of the corporation and his name is of this. New person is Christian. What's the last name? Yes, I'm here, yeah Christian is here very well christian, so you're going to take over this restaurant. Do you understand what we're saying? Yes, I do all right, Kristen! Thank you vanessa! So you're going to take ownership of this restaurant Las Quina de Nava, which is I, think close to 172Nd street. How have you been part of that business before and if so, how long I've kind of been on and off I joined the military I joined the marine corps a few years back, but before that I used to kind of be here and help out and work out and then once I got out. I came back to start working again in September. So since, when you have been affiliated with this restaurant straight since September, but before that probably like a year or two prior to 2015. when do you started working there? Here's to September of 17 sorry of this year, I started working here full time, and now you have been part of that restaurant for how long seemed like about 16 17 2000. But you said that you have been on and off about this. Oh yes, because, like I said, I was in the marine corps, so I was I was stationed prior to in South Carolina and then I went over to Japan. What has been your experience in the restaurant industry in the restaurant industry I also worked as a bartender in a bar down in Jersey, and then I would I worked there for about five six months in Jersey right, yes, and what's the name of the place in Jersey, it's called the pier house, the warehouse, the pier house, and have you gotten some training and alcohol handling in New York state, not in New York state, not yet at least who's going to do your partner in this establishment. We have somebody here, that's currently qualified for it. What is your knowledge of the neighborhood? How long do you know this neighborhood, this area I lived here, my entire life as far as I can remember, I lived in 172,174 178 and I'm currently living in 177. very well. This is with a fair video, 33 piecing hi, a couple things here: I noticed back in September of 2019. They tried to make another change as well as change of method of operation and the Community board. 12 denied that, and also most recently, in the month of October of this year, we've received 41 noise complaints from that location, whereas compared as all of 2019, they only received 44 in total. So in one month they almost surpassed the noise complaints for the totally for all of 2019. and those so you're saying that the 41 noise complaints came when which month officer the month of October this year. Oh that's a lot anything else officer lieutenant consumption, that's it so Carlos you're taking over a place that is increasing in noise complaint and you want to buy this establishment. It seems that you've been there since September, you say, and just a month after you came in now we have new concern with a lot of noise. It's not a coincidence that you started taking over this establishment on September 20th, September, 2020 and I. Just we have a huge increment in noise. Complaining is that coincidence? Can you please allow a rate? It's definitely a coincidence. I actually have not been fully aware, but I'll definitely be sure to have that under control and make sure that it does not actually like become an issue in the future. Do we have any residents maria before I go to you I? Would let me see if there's any residents any issues from residents I see known Marielle Lisa. Yes, thank you, I'm just looking, I'm not necessarily a question, but a concern of the sanitary violations that I see here. So just looking at you know food not being kept at the proper temperature evidence of vermin and roaches. You know plumbing not properly installed, so you know just some concerns of that evidence of rats. Again kind of you know to your point to see that all to the gentleman Christian who's trying to purchase this establishment yeah do. How are you? How do you attempt to address those sanitary concerns as well? That's my question. Oh we're going to definitely like switch it all up, we're going to definitely take some time where we're going to do like, and it sounds like a deep clean as well to make sure that all the issue that is going on won't happen again. Just I noticed about that too, as well. It happened right before I, essentially kind of took over at least started getting an idea of it and once I found out about that, I started shortly, correcting it as well. Any other committee members good question: Christian: do you have a manager beside yourself or you're, just running all operations on your own? Yes, I'm going to have a manager here as well for the days that I won't be coming in, because I'm also currently doing a course right now, so I'm definitely going to need help question those health code, violations I, see seen a lot and there's a pattern here. Besides that, as it was indicated by the lieutenant the last time you guys came here, the Community board objected to the change of the math operations, so taking into account that there have been so many noise complaints too. Many serious health issues with your restaurant, I'm not sure if we wanna we wanna move forward with this type of issues that are affecting this restaurant. Have you considered perhaps and again, I would hope that you have negotiated your. How much money are you going to spend taking possible so many issues, because at this point I would I myself will not get myself involved in this type of situation? But you know I'm not you. We are a crossroad. I do not know if you want to perhaps consider about taking care of the health code violations first and then I'll come back or you want to proceed with this matter and see what happens. There are some concerns here. What's your take, I feel like that's a reasonable I'll come for it. So I understand I said that I get I, see that as a reasonable situation to occur, I got an understanding of this community and everybody there is concerns about in regards to noise as well as health. We are currently working on and we are trying to definitely get this corrected. So you like to proceed, or you like- to withdraw I like to proceed, though very well, so taking into account everything that has been said. Committee members. You know, I'm sorry who's this committee member. So what in your vote is Cydra Medina, I'm going to abstain, address the board. The committee okay Carlos, go ahead yeah. He says that the noise that had happened is people is standing outside hanging out outside the out of the control that he's in contact communication with the prison with detective Valentine, and that when you give him an opportunity before he was not able to pursue because of the coffee 19. However, what happening outside is people hanging out there out of his control and he wants to address that and what happened before was not able to happen because of the coffin pandemic. He was not able to do the formigation in of the establishment, because people can not be able was not be able to go there, so he was not able to do it. Also, this sanitation is not cooperating with them. What it means not cooperating. What is there to cooperate with situations? He said that sanitation was not able to do the inspection, because the court has is closed, that he tried to have the inspection, but sanitation courts are closed. So my question now is at this point: has the fumigation happen? Have the vermins been eliminated or the rodents like? Did they do what they needed to do to get rid of the health issues? So if sanitation comes in tomorrow to inspect they would be fine. Okay is a suggestion to Christian. It seems like there's a lot of issues going on internal I know the pandemic has caused and has delayed certain things. I suggest you take three to four months. Try to mitigate all these issues, build a relationship with Mr, Lieutenant concepcion in the 33rd preset and come back to us and reapply. You know we understand that you're a new owner or you want to be a new owner. We also understand that you know it's your first time and you want to make sure to take over and actually get these issues, but I suggest you take a few months. Get it straightened out figure out the issue with sanitation and the courts fix the noises. If you guys have people congregating outside tell them. You know they should not be in front of the business to take it down the block around the corner, fix these issues and then come back to us and you have a better a better case. I think Maria, no I just wanted to echo Leo and just say also for for Mr Christian, just to take some time to get some training, because it sounds like you're, relatively new in the the restaurant business, so using that time to also upskill yourself and the staff members there and the manager and so on. Okay, thank you, Christian, based on the sentiment that I've been hearing from the committee. This might not be a positive resolution. Do you still want to proceed? This is one of those things where that, due to the fact that carlos he lives like very far away, he can barely be around this area. So it's one of those things where it's just that kind of like more around the area like I, said: I live here. I'm currently employed here and stuff like that, so it's more suitable for me to be taken care of and taking over this establishment very well. So I'm going to proceed with the vote so I have a question. Is this just a transfer of ownership? Is that what's occurring? Yes, oh okay, very well! Committee members, please be ready to vote, is going to abstain. Next year's upstating Leo sustaining next actually Abstain, actually abstain. This is a tough one, because to me it's not like we're giving them a license. It's more along the transfer of ownership I. Would I'm going to go with? Yes, very well, thanks for watching, he said that this is not a new license. This is a transfer of ownership and he has many things to do and he does not have the time to be in front of the restaurant right now, because he has a family in New Jersey and that the committee is preventing him to move on with his life at this time. If you permit me again christian it's it's fair to the community that when we have a transfer ownership that the new owner understands what the problems are, because we do not want this problem to perpetuate and therefore interfere with the well-being of our community Christian. You do have some work to do. I recommend that you get to it fix some of those health issues which are critical with this pandemic and we hope to see you pretty soon do take care yourself. The next agenda item is agenda. Item number 13, which is junior status good evening again it's Israel Miguel Acosta, representing Ayaka's Corp Junius Tacos, and this is another transfer or corporate change. This is where we are 34 precinct. The 34 prison is not present very well so Miguel who's buying and who's who's selling well, Scarlet Rosa has recently been added to this license. As a 75 percent owner. She partnered up with her cousin, danny tavares. Danny tavares is now selling his 25 percent to her she's, going to remain on danny all right. What you're saying that's correct? How many shows is she selling no he's selling 25, which is right? Yes, correct, okay, she's going to become a 100 owner very well. Sorry, I want to say thank you bye. Thank you, Carlos. So the last time that this merchant came here, the 34 prison has some objections to this application, which was a a renewal. There was some double rock issues in front of the location. Yes, correct, a lot of people. Aside, January 23rd of last year there was a cell of margarita to an underage. An arrest was made April 26th of last year. The SLA I joined with the general progression with NYPD resulted again on the underage cell, big problem yeah, that's that is correct and I am 100, aware of the incidents that had occurred during the previous ownership. As you in your records, you should have that danny tavares was operating with his cousin, Maria tavares and basically there was no time being spent in the establishment the employees were selling. You know alcoholic beverages to go since Scarlett became the owner. There has not been any incidents she has been operating. The business actually has her stepfather in the kitchen working as a cook and during the pandemic after the pandemic prior to the pandemic, the business has been a good operator but see scholar. Was there when this violations took place minority owner right? No, she was not there. Maria tavares was not. She was not Scarlett. Acosta was not there. No Scarlett Rosa was not there. She became last year after the incident she became the owner. So is she become donor after the incident? Yes correct? Thank you for clarification. Do I have any residency non committee members. Any questions, I recommend that go to a vote. If an objection from the question from the committee members saying none is going to vote yes, Robin, yes, Robin, yes, next angel Rosie, yes Ashley was that you yeah sorry, there's fire trucks, mario, yes, very well, by a photo of seven zero and again this application passes. Congratulations hope that Scarlett understand the nature of the previous problems and that you know these errors will not be committed again. 100 aware, thank you. Thank you. So much. We have moved far now forward with agenda item number 12:14, which is now for full equal license, and on that note the first one is Kayla. Actually is that directed to the license? It's not a new license. Is that residual license? So do we have a representative for Kayla hi good evening, Michael Kelly? Actually, my name is claire donnelly. I'm the manager at Lakeland Michael could not make it this evening and what's your name again, I'm sorry Claire donnelly, claire donnelly. Okay and you are the manager yeah correct, and the ask that you are presenting before the community board is that you want to expand the establishment. I think you want to expand eastward you're, not mistaken. We are trying to expand into an adjacent space, to leave space for more tables and chairs and more room at the bar for bar stools. So committee members, whenever there is a request where room has going to be added, anything that is beyond the 10 thousand dollars, expenditure needs to have a community board approval. How many square feet are you adding claire I, do not actually have the square footage. I just have the tables and chairs and bar stools in front of me. Right now is that where the tobacco room is yes, that's exactly that's it very well. Committee members I do not see any residents with questions committee members Sid I've been there almost like every week and I think that they are getting established.

This application passes seven zero, claire, congratulations, one request thanks very much. You guys I appreciate your help with us. Thank you so much take care. We now move on to agenda item number 15, mama Taco, and there is a concern that was sent by one of our residents. Martin collins indicated that he's very concerned about the time of operations for this establishment indicated that this stylish is like in a seven story building and to have music there until like two o'clock in the morning, could be an issue for residents very well. This is from the just one. Second, please 34 precinct they're not present for the purpose of the minute. Who is on the line? Can you please tell us your name? Can you please tell us? Your name rose, Rodriguez rose Rodriguez and you are owner and my partner is on the line: Natalia hi, how you doing Nathaniel Valerio, I'm 50 ownership, also from the establishment. So you own. Fifty percent of this right yeah for girls, for you guys and rose owns 50 right. Yes, sir, very well. She now, let's see that you do have a complete. You have a floor plan. You also have a draft of the menu. The questionnaire this mexican place and for the community members I'm going to go through the specifics. This is a full eco license and there are three full equalizers in the obscenity of this establishment. There are no schools or places of worship, there'll be a no jukebox there'll, be no dj. There'll be recorded, music there'll be no karaoke, no live music. The space has been effectively sound, proofed there'll, be third party promotion, there'll be no need of for security personnel. The capacities are 73. The hours of operations is from 12 P.M to 2 A.M, seven days a week, so this is a complete application. At this point, I do not have the recommendations from the 35th person. Can I ask it's a new restaurant right? Yes, it's a new license license is this is in terms of the corporation that owns that's trying to become the establishment there. Is there any relationship to the old owners of that establishment or is? Are these okay? So these are brand new brand new, not in any way yeah? No, okay, no just I! Just wanna! You see that I'm already thinking about the General, Board meeting and I know exactly where this can go in terms of that area. So I just want to make sure that we're talking about new owners with a new reputation. So these these are new owners for the record. You said that both rose and Nathaniel 15 each. So how long do you guys have known the community? How familiar are you with the community with that area? Yeah? Not that you want me to go first, will you go for it? Yeah first go ahead. First, I'll go next, so yeah I was born and raised in Semen, so I'm very familiar with the community, my mom 25 years at the Allen pavilion and the Columbia presbyterian, so I had left for five years to Massachusetts for a better life for my kids and I left New York, but I wanted to do something and I felt like I wanted to bring it back to where I was born and raised for my community and I can give back. You know to my people where I was raised, the hospital you know: I have family members that drive the MTA right around there. I know the guys that do the sanitation and I just want to you know give back to the community. I want to have something for the kids. I want to be different than what was there before I had previous went numerous times. Nice place nice ambient spot, we're not trying to portray that we do not want music we're trying to go for more calm. You know a nice mood, good food and a great service. My chef is coming from the hospitality world from Pwa, so our priority is to provide amazing food and great customer service. I was a waitress for six years, Bronx Queens, Brooklyn Manhattan and I've served most of the restaurants in the uptown area, I'm very familiar with I'm sorry. You said that just give me one. Second, please. You said that you have pretended in New York City, for how long I'm sorry, maybe I did not hear right, but did you say that you have bartended for how many years or did I hear you around? Oh, yes, waitressing for all, like five years, time's up 809, fantastic Mama, Juana Cafe. Let me see what else up in Manhattan a lot of downtown places. I did queen Brooklyn, but in the uptown yeah, eight or nine I did not chain when they first opened fantastic, mama, okay, so rose you see that you have been working throughout indictment. You know, you know you have you worked in places that are well known, but also places that could be a concern to our residents, understanding that 215. This is around 215 right yeah! That's why we pick that area, because we want it to be a little different, we're not. We do not want the music. We do not want the. We do not we're not looking for that type of environment and I like that, because I see that you do not you're not requesting any a karaoke and not requesting any live music you're. Also not requesting any pjs, you know you did not have a jukebox, no I think we're going with sonos music. It's more. You can just play on your phone. Just you know, music, where people can speak and hear each other, nothing that would interfere with the community or the people on top of us. We know it's a residential building. We know exactly where we bought this location and what we were. What we wanted to do there very well sorry who's. This no I was just going to say, would you say you're committed to providing a family environment? Yes, I very much I wanna have high chairs I wanna, do kids, I wanna, do very family stuff, provide amazing food I want to do lunch, and actually we put 12 P.M and because of everything, that's going on and they're trying to take away more hours. We were thinking- maybe you know, start a little earlier and you know we're going to close early anyways but to provide more lunch services. I, I'm really going for the hospital, and you know I, was born and raised around all the doctors and all the patients. Because of my mom, so I really want to focus on giving really good. You know good and fast delivery for lunch, so you say you only have 45 minutes. You want to open up 11 in the morning. Well, we put 12 P.M, but we can start yeah if we can start the kitchen and start getting food out. You know we want to be fast. We want to provide good service for lunch, but I'm asking you do you want to start 11, because I have to put that in the minutes yeah. We would like to put we put 12, but since we got a lot of a lot of people walking to the when we were there decorating the place and when we were going to open and a lot of empties- and they were oh what time you guys going to open so it was like hey. We can open like at 11 o'clock, just to offer that lunch service for them. Let me go now the restaurants, then let me hear some issues. I first see and recognize nasty, President Nancy. You have a floor, yes, hi. Thank you. Looking at this here are, this is going to be a 500 hearing, because it said there were three liquor licenses in the area. Correct and so I just wanted to point out that you know there's a higher bar for a 500 foot hearing for public interest and advantage and I hope that you know what you're saying what you're explaining sounds like a great plan and that's a troubled location, I think people are aware of it angel, always kind of brought up. What could happen with this, so I think being clear about the intentions of it being a family environment, and you know serving hospital employees and the advantage and convenience of the area is really important, and you know of course, because it's new and it's a troubled area I would I. Would you know wonder if you think about going for a restaurant wine license first, so that's all I have to say just because of that area and the residential component directly above. Thank you. Thank you, nancy. That was a question for you guys feel free to answer. Oh okay, I mean yes, we wanted to do the wine and liquor for first to start off, but it would take the same amount of time and it would have cost us more in the long run because then later on, we will also have to submit for like a hard liquor license. But we was like hey. Why do not we just do it in one shot and we can provide the full service instead of just wine and beer service for the alcohol and like that, we do not spend that additional money. You know, makes economic sense, but we got ta, also be protective of our residents. So the hours of first year from 11 A.M to 2, am on a on a daily basis. Will you consider perhaps cutting out the hours, perhaps on the weekend? Maybe sundays through I will say: maybe thursdays until maybe one or twelve midnight or one A.M, oh yeah. That would not be an issue once everything opens back up back up because we said 2 A.M originally because we wanted to close at 1. But we want to give time for people that get that get into the restaurant, let's say to eat at 12. We want to have like a quick drink or whatever, so they can sit down and have a chat, but- and you know, and then for everybody to pick up and just be out of there by like two like which will be the closing. You know so like that you know people walk by and then see, oh, but this is still open and it's you know is it's 1:30 A.M 1:45. But what I'm saying is that you have here on a daily basis who I am for that area. I would not recommend that you stay open on the weekdays so late. Take into account that you have a new manager that you are coming into. The community and I was asking you to see if you want to consider staying open sundays through thursdays from 11 A.M to perhaps one A.M at the latest yeah. That does not sound valuable and then fridays and saturdays until 2 Am sounds reasonable. Yeah, that's good, so fridays and saturdays 11 to 2 am very well. I would like to have two stipulations that you put a good navel sign and also put a phone number of someone who is in charge of establishment, whoever's supervising establishment. Yes, I will provide my information. They see that if I can add I know they said they won't. Have you live your jukebox, but I do know that. Sometimes you know if you put the sponsor low and you want, can we maybe add a sound limiter just to mitigate that issue that they have with the residents that in that building, so also a proof of purchase? Thank you so much leo, so you guys need to submit a proof of purchase of a sound limiter and installer. Obviously so we would like to have a copy of that receipt being submitted to the board office Bef on the Friday before the General Board meeting I do not have a candidate with me, so that will be on the 20th, which is November, not this yeah, the 20th of November before 5:00 pm. Okay. So what is that called sound? It's a sound limiter, I check on Amazon or best buy I. Think also sells this sound limited. It limits the amount of noise that the noise level or the volume that can go out on the speakers. All right so do some do some immediate homework and make sure that you buy the proper equipment because we have actually turned down and rejected applications because they submitted the wrong receipt. So if I were you I'll go to some areas, some restaurants and ask which ones they have and to give you proper guidance? Okay sounds good, so I remember before next Friday at five o'clock. Please submit that document. Otherwise I'll be forced to reverse this possible recommendation. Yes, thank you Leo. So we have three steps: gone sign phone number, someone who's in charge in case an a was have an issue and proof of sound limited to be sent to the community board. If there are no questions, I'd like to move off a vote, I had my hand up Mr Dro. If I might speak again, I'm sorry who's this, it's David, Tom David, I'm sorry I apologize, so yeah! Thank you have you do have the flow. That's okay and your comments and Nancy's comments covered a lot of what I was going to say: I mean we all remember: names like Kawala, Cafe and Hashi Sushi, which were neighboring businesses to the space, but generate a lot of problems and I appreciate this is a totally different business and to be clear, there's no connection to Mama, Wanna or Mama Sushi. Correct, no I know the name everybody's asking, but no yes, there may be confusion on that note. But in any case we appreciate this is a different business. It's just the history is problematic because even though it's Broadway- and it might not seem apparent- this is a residential zoning district, it's primarily residential. So actual nightclubs would not even be illegal here and any kind of nightlife brings potential for conflict. So I appreciate the chairs recommendation of altering the hours, but for an initial term, 2 A.M on weeknights is still potentially problematic for the residents not only above, but because of all the residential windows from Park Terrace East that face onto Broadway and pick up traffic noise and so on. When there are busy nightlife spots so I, the request that I would ask is, if is if it could be earlier than 2, am on the weekends for this initial term. Thank you. Before we go to a vote. That is a question for ownership. Please feel free and address it rose and Nathaniel. You can ask a question, though question is, if you like, to consider closing before 2 am on the week of Saturday Saturdays, Fridays and Saturdays all right, so we just agreed that Monday through Friday Monday through Thursday. We would do earlier and then just on Saturday just to give us more time if the kitchen closes at 12. We have time to clean up, and you know give time to people to pack up and go it's not that we're going to close at 2. Am it's just? We want the time to have it available so that if we are, we do not get. You know, you're not allowed to and then, but that we have time to make sure we're cleaning the establishment correctly, especially with Covid-19 and everything you know, making sure everything is properly done ready for the next morning, I see that there's another resident, Maxillina Canton Maslin. You had the floor for two minutes. First of all, I posted a bunch of points and the question and answers which I guess you did not see, although some of them have been addressed, but I would say that one o'clock on weeknights is too late and I. Think two o'clock is too late on weekends as well. The third one o'clock on weeknights is too late. Thank you so much maxine, let's go back now to committee, Members, Committee members say Rob. Yes, I think they can go through one o'clock, one A.M, every seven days a week. It's a good deal. They can they can do that if you know we can negotiate with them. Seven days a week, one A.M very well so you're recommending that the change of I always be straight until 1 am yes any other committee members that will have same or similar recommendations, it's okay for it to be a two o'clock on a weekend. It's the weekend, that's how that's normally the hours that they have in that neighborhood around that strip. Okay, thank you, rosie. Anybody else. Only for the weekend, if it's the weekday, then I do respect the closing of the earlier hours. Rosie is saying that we proposed that they closed on the weekend early and then on the weekdays. What on the weekends I feel like 2 am, is reasonable and then for the weekend effort for the weekend. 2 Am is reasonable and for the weekday to close earlier, so you say close up 12 midnight. Then that's fine with me. If it's, if it's for the week weekday, so the weekdays close at 12 midnight and then on the weekends at 2, A.M right, yes, I, agree with that, one that can that can be important. You agree Rob for what rose proposed, which is a weekdays. Yes, weekdays on 12 midnight and Saturday Sunday on 2 A.M, Friday, Saturdays, Friday, Saturday, 2, A.M I. Think that that's very reasonable, so I agree with that as well angel yeah. Thank you Leo. So the idea is on sundays through thursdays, until 12 midnight and then Fridays and saturdays. Until 2 A.M rose, I think that committee was unified in this proposal operations. Would that be something that you agree with? It sounds fair, I'm willing to work with that and, and you guys giving me a try and seeing how everything goes and then later on in the future. Maybe a year from now or so. When things are, you know you guys we can rethink it over, but I can work with that. You know I, like your approach, I, like your flexibility and I, think that you're going to prosper and when you do prosper and or if you need perhaps later on to adjust other hours. This area is well known to be under the scope, because the neighbors there care about this particular community and anything that happens there. You know we will definitely know about it, but I'm very happy that you're, flexible I, see that we can work with you, like I, can see that you know we going to work as a community and I'm happy to move this application out to a vote so with three applications. Three steps grenade was signed phone number to be displayed and a sound limiter proof of Sound Limiter. This application is not going to work if Sydro is going to vote in favor next yeah, yes, Robin, yes, Robin, yes, whoever, yes, Marielle, yes, Leo, yes, Rosie years, especially yes and your yes and last. This application passes seven zero. I'm really happy how this community this community is working. Thank you so much for the craziness. Thank you so much so much. Thank you so much for your application. This passes. We hope that you prosper. Thank you! So much have a good evening. So much so. Let me just put this here: they need to bring proof of purchased sound limiter. We now move on to the next agenda item, which is agenda. Iron number, 16 and I have to move a lot faster than this I had a Koa restaurant between 170Th and 171St. This is a new liquid license. So let me speed up the agenda because I'm going to keep you here forever, actually, no right, it's only we've been here for how long couple hours forever. Thank you very well. So we have had our core restroom I. Think this establishment this one this time it's already there but I do not know. What's going on I see that they have the menu, they have the floor plans and they also have a completed questionnaire. So this is a complete application. Now do we have recently here from our restaurant yeah Maria? What's your last name, Maria Rivera and you are the owner of a senator the owner very well lieutenant concepcion. This is what the Private Authority corporation idea is. There is a license there, so I'm not a little bit confused. This license we're just transferring the license from the old owner to mine. That's what we're doing got you clear now, the last time this America came to community Board. There was no objection for the purpose or to inform the committee members. So you'll be aware the specifics great. On the last health inspection, you got a name, that's really good. It's a very small place. I see a capacity 30. The hours of operations end up at 11 P.M on a daily basis. 7 A.M, 11:00, P.M there'll be a jukebox. Are you going to have a dj man? No dj recording music. Are you going to have recorded music? No be sure, maybe later on, not because of the Covid-19? Not right now, because we just got the Jew back, but we do not even play the music now, okay understood, maybe in the future, if we can okay. Thank you so much and live music, no I like music, very well. So these are the most important things for the committee members. This is with the preview of the 33rd present lieutenant concepcion. What's the penalty yeah? Well, we do not have any issues for the location we have. Just 10 calls around the vicinity of the location for noise for the year. That's it no other problems. That's really good! Any residents saying none! Committee members, any questions, so the only my recommendation Maria is that you guys meet with the new ownership meet with lieutenant concepcion so that he would know who you are so that he will know the specifics in custodial emergency, which he's caught his shoe called in case. If there are problems with the neighbors, you know he would not know how to address that. So please recommendation only meet up with the 33 person, no problem. Having said that, can I answer your question. Maria, I'm sorry who's going to be owning the license. I'm sorry Maria! You have ownership of license. What's your experience with alcohol? Well, I do not have any I did own a restaurant back in 1996 with my ex-husband so but I, but I do not deal with the liquor. Somebody else in the restaurant do and that presence has to be a fully a train. They've been there since when we bought it, they were there. Okay, so the bartender has the license. I mean: has the permit yeah very well? Many members are coming to a vote. If there are no objections, please indicate your vote by saying. Yes, no Kenzo abstain. Israel is in favor Rosie, yes, Robin, yes, Robbie, yes, Marielle! Yes, very well! This application passes seven zero, Maria, congratulations! I! Hope you prosper! Thank you.

No complaints has been working with the 3-4 for quite a while already is currently operating and work during the pandemic demonstrated to you know to be in full. Compliance has not received any violations due to any Covid-19 rules, regulations or guidelines, so this guy has been training with angel, for the last couple of months has decided to purchase this business and angel will continue as well to assist them after this liquor license is transferred to new ownership to make sure that the business continues working accordingly angel may have something to say this is a transfer license.

If I made to elaborate on what Miguel said, you know miguel, so you are I thought that you owned the place right. I do own the place, yes I own, the place. I've been owning this place operating for over seven years, but unfortunately, kovi has landed a lot of economic stress and I've been forced to to sell to sell pretty much the whole business I would remain in the business as the money operator, as the manager I will remain on board, but it's just I do not have the financial strength to keep it. You know, I applied for the SBA loan and I was denied. I did not get any funds and things are not getting any better and I feel attached to this corner. I was I, was born and raised in this community, and a good friend of mines decided to jump on board and take over the business, with the condition that I stay on board and I run and I operate the business and the person he has. My friend Joshua has a lot of knowledge into the restaurant. Unfortunately, he could not be here and we we want to keep the business running as we've been doing it for the past seven years and we plan to stay here. Hopefully we're going to survive this colvit thing and stay here for whatever years we can omega I, really appreciate what you have done for the community I thank you angel. He has the name of Miguel that was celebrity confused right, yeah, the representative angel's, the owner. It's it's angels and you're really grateful for what you have done for the community. That area was was a problematic place for NYPD I recall some years ago you came in you cleaned the house. It's a really nice place. It's well kept, I'm very sorry that you have to sell, but at the same time I see that whoever's finding the business really respect the work that you did in trying to keep you as manager. We hope that the new owner will come in and hopefully through we will survive the pandemic. I'm sure we will you'll be stronger. I'm very sure that I will take some time, but you know we will be resilient. We will work hard and we will survive. So I'm very grateful for the work that you have done for that place because I know it was a travel area for the community. You turn it around. So thank you so much angel so who be the new owner, Joshua Sanchez, who Joshua sanchez? Yes now is he underlined? No, he was online, but he's not he's not online right now. Okay, so I'm the other you're going to stay on and that's important because you know for our community you'll be the manager. You will keep the place the same as it has been and to handle the alcohol it will be good hands. Yes, I will be I'll, be the operation there's like. As a matter of fact, we have a contract in place that I'm the I'm going to be the person in charge, I'm going to be the person running the day-to-day operation and I plan to continue running the place as I've been doing for all the time. Thank you. So much do I. Have any questions from our committee members saying no I recommend that we go to a boat and we want we're going to call our names. This is a complete application.

So we just came back to re. The liquor authority wants us to come back and revisit this to make sure that all the stipulations are still in place.

They were reporting it from the past the year prior we've had no incidents. You know right. Committee members, you know, I can attest. I live not too far around the corner of the establishment. They make good food. It is a family-run business. I walk by there every day, I never see an issue, never see anyone acting out of place. So thank you so much I love you for your input. Anybody else, rosie, no I just had a question, but she already answered it was pretty much just trying to figure out how long ago it was, but since it was a long time ago, it's irrelevant for this now. Thank you very well at this point. I'd like to go to about, if you guys do not mind, saying no positions. Ice is next robin yes, Leo Rosie, yes, Rosie! Yes, Ashley! Yes, Ashley, yes, Marielle! Yes, mario, yes, I! Think I'm missing someone! So you see there are Robin Leo, Rosie, Ashley, Mariel, Angel right, hey! I'm missing ninja, yes, okay angel vote, 700, this application passes. Congratulations have a good night. Thank you guys. No wait! You're not done with me. You I think I'm the last one I think you did on purpose to keep agenda yeah that that'll, be me. I, see Joe again Miguel Acosta yeah. So we're doing agenda item number 9:20. Sorry! Now let me check with you now: I not received the questionnaire for this application. I see a floor plan, but I do not see a questionnaire. Let me see because it would say, Chanel was attached to all the questionnaires that was sent yesterday. I did not see that I saw everything else, but I did not see the last thing. Yeah I do not see a menu and I do not see a questionnaire because I actually I have the questionnaire. I have everything? Let me second at this point, miguel yeah I, think you might want to consider this and withdrawal I guess so. I have everything in front of me and the police that you sent the whole thing. That's what I'm saying if you said you have a menu: no I do not have a menu, I have a floor plan, I, have a floor plan and I. That's what I'm saying like you would have. You would have a floor plan with a menu because I'm looking at the email from yesterday my assistant sent them checks. You know just check for me yeah, because if you have a floor plan there should have been a menu and everything attached to it. What time did you send the email she sent it yesterday around I think it was during the afternoon. I can I can fold it. If you do not mind, I'm sitting right on it. You know you said you did not receive this. I'm searching again see yeah. This is just a little weird that Cedro has the floor plan and everything yeah I know. Last month, I know. Last month we was on the agenda and I ended up taking it out withdrawing the application, because I did not have all the information ready, we're missing the menu and we're missing the questionnaire Miguel. I'm surprised that you will not see sneed on this email if she scented that's what I'm saying, but my what I'm finding weird is that you received the floor plan and all the applications have been attached to everything, but usually Chanel will send me the whole package and I guess that you know that Isa should have ccu on it and she did not. I was not. It was actually my secretary, so she sent everything she sent yesterday, a package of five. So yes, what I have from your secretary is Juniors Tacos, Havana, Tacos, Nava, Seafood, La, Cantina Heights, and you guys sent it to me like three times and that's it yeah, okay! So we're going to not end up in this application, all right, I, just I, guess I'll just withdraw the application and discuss next month very well. This apple application has been withdrawn and looking forward to having next year with a complete application. Very well at this point like to call the last agenda item, which is a Arthur cafes and billiard, located at 90 naval avenue between Elbow and Sql speed. Very well. You said that your representatives- here, yes Sir this- is the purview of the Vr4 present that here. Thank you so much chanel. So this is a wine and beer license. They will have a jukebox dj music. We played the recorded means that we, karaoke sound limit, has been properly installed. Space has been properly soundproofed, they'll, be not third-party promotion, no security personnel, as you can see there, they'll be go scroll down a little bit. You know please scroll up, I'm sorry, so the House operations are daily basis for Ppm to R4. M capacity is 74. very well I see now do they have a complete because I do not have no floor plans. I do not okay, there's a floor plan. Just leave it there, so there will be two pool tables and I see that there will be seven postals. The restroom restrooms will be. Where is that the only rendering that you have go back up to a floor plan? That's one restroom! So it's by the bar entrance. The entrance has some steps aurelia. Yes, it's only. It only really seats less than 45 people, as you can see there. It only if you want to go be literal, it has seven bar stools and it has three tables of four. That's all I can see because it's really just a billiard. It's part of the it's right next to Coco seafood, it's her! It's she she's taking both businesses because she's there you see a restaurant, hello. I'm sorry, I can't hear you I do not see a restroom, then I'd have to send you the restrooms right to the left, I'm sorry to the right and that corner. That's the restroom, where there's like a circular, that's a restroom all the way to the far right on the top. Far right, where it says, Hw, that's m! It's yeah! It is small. It's a small location, it's less than 800 square feet. It's tiny I do not even know how they said they have an occupancy of 74, maybe standing, but nobody feel it. It's a small. It's just the two billiard tables are there and the bar and the seats on the side and the food is, you know they have it's a it's a minimum food service is this on the corner of Sherman and Thayer? No, it's actually right. Next to Coco seafood going down the it's not stairs, not a ground, it's not a storefront! It's going down the stairs! It's part of her she's, going to run that as well since they're right next to each other. It's under the barber shop, the barbershop salon. So it's under it's going correct, yeah! Please go back to the questionnaire to the meta operations, the music and all of that you know wherever I used to be yes, so you know we have dj. We have karaoke. We have all of those things. We only have them if and if they even use it once they're in violation. So we and we even have security- it's just if they use it once we want to make sure that they're able to use it they've been there for a while. Yes, they have, it was run by that place, has been there for over 15 years and was it running without equal license or it was no, it had a liquor license. It was owned by Sucre Corporation, his demand. It's a. It was a little man he's in he's retiring now, he's been there for 15 years. No incident, no disorderly. Nothing of that nature. You see you know that's place, is more like a local like they have their customer base. They are always there. It's not nothing crazy. Every time, I think it's literally the same people. Okay, let's go to here. It's like I, go to some because I like to shoot people and you're right I see like the same faces consistently. So it's like the same crowd. I think you're right same my clientele. Okay, thank you! So much. Thank you.

Okay and I'd like to have a phone number display the premise in case I'm any problems of where I was going to be in charge.
