However, I've been with the organization since July, 16 1997 and the majority of the work that we do is in affordable housing, but we also provide a plethora of other services, including the creation of Community Health Academy of the heights in 2006, which is a middle through high school. We have since our inception provided after-school programs in yes, twenty-eight been in four, so we are a long time providers of educational services. Thank you very much one man. He was up. You still had another video I think it was just a warning. Yes, yeah you have another benefit. That's okay. I will yield great okay, our last panelist miss Sharon Jacob good evening. Everybody hi I'm, so very honored to be part of this conversation with everyone, and thank you so much for the invitation, and my name is Sharon Kim and I currently direct the uptown hub, which is a youth development program and drop-in center for 12 to 24 year olds, we're how was that New York, Presbyterian Hospital, and basically we you know we launched back in 2017 with the support from the Manhattan district attorney's office. They had this vision to set up five youth opportunity hubs throughout Manhattan and it would be a place where young people could come. They could connect to different resources, connect different opportunities, especially around educational support, employment, readiness, health and wellness recreation and creative arts. All of oh that any young person could desire- and you know a large part of our model- as our name hub would suggest- is to provide these opportunities through a network of community organizations. So I have really had such a privilege of working with five incredible CBO's in the heights. Dominican women's Development, Center, northern Manhattan, Improvement Corporation people's theater project Police, Athletic League and the Y up in Inwood I think some might be tuned in so huge shout-out to them. I'm really honored to be here to represent, and thank you so much. Thank you welcome so before we begin, I just want to note following the panelists discussion, we're also going to be hearing from a couple of our parents and it's one of our students, so I just want to note them, but I want to so sorry. I had to go between screens all right, so I want to know you better know. Alaska is one of our parents, as is what Safina vs, and we also will be hearing from our students. He daily Vince, Coleman I'm. So sorry I got that wrong, we'll be hearing from them at the end. Okay, all right so welcome all, and thank you guys for participating in for joining us in this very important discussion. So mr. Dees Williams, you go first, so we wanted to know and ask what are some specific dy programs that will continue to address the needs of the community third, this pandemic and what programs will not be available. So let me let me start before we get into the programs to say that one important function that dy city plays is to get money to our nonprofit organizations with the pause we have it. Mr. B, we have kept the money flowing, but contracts all the stuff that isn't sexy, but is kind of the lifeblood to specific to programs. We've transitioned cornerstone programs. Some of you may know into food hubs. We've partnered with the new foods are to make sure that our 700 food pantries soup kitchens are part of that system of delivery. A lot of people don't know that we fund all those programs, but we've also been sharing that information with a lot of our families. Food bank, for example. Our programs are mostly continuing to operate. There are very few that have shut down altogether. They have transition to online services, so most of our are continuing to operate. Some of them are doing amazing things and partnerships with the schools. They've joined, Google classroom, so the young people have a more seamless experience than having to go to from a DOA platform to a dy CD service provider platform, we're offering citywide activities that young people can join. So some of you know about our film book still happening. Virtually our cooking competition still happening virtually step. It up is offering classes with renowned choreographers once a week that we are marketing to participants and it's great because you don't have to travel to be part of it. So most of our programs are operating virtually the two potential programs that continue to operate us is runaway and homeless. Youth, shelters, pills, drop-in centers, as well as the food rooms that I mentioned everything else. So those two who are determined to be essential by the mayor and all of our other programs went to distance opportunities as services, Healthy, Families fatherhood, offering case management and workshops, and things like that, but at a distance. Thank you. Thank you so much so. This question is for mr. Tomita. What are some of the challenges of principals experience with remote learning in their school? Well, you know that many students and families had emotional health and learning challenges even before coronavirus, and now this copy 19 has really highlighted or accelerated. Many families were stable before community now facing financial -. Insecurities family now need additional support, grief inside in isolation. So all this requires the recognizing teams and creating it and putting emphasis on providing support and resources for now social, emotional well-being, including mental health services. So, that's why you see schools now receiving resources, including food to family training, to staff out to support families, and another big challenge has been also the expectation regarding teachers providing instruction. The community has expressed many times that they see that there is a big difference when teachers provide life instruction over non-life instruction, and this remote learning is something that had never been done on this scale ever so we needed to create climate roles and support for innovation on pacing young-sun, our missteps, but that has been one challenge: finding that balance between life instruction and not life instruction the devices on the connectivity right now right now, these receipts have four hundred twelve devices listed as outstanding sixteen or been happy no reading ship, but we hope we have 255 devices now in process. You will never be 100%, because you know families all is fine issues, whether it was the Wi-Fi, whether is that device is broken lost stolen, so those are just to mention, probably the most three, the main challenges that we have right now. So I just want to ask a follow-up question to that. You mentioned the remote learning. Do you, how do you? How effective do you think they were about learning? Is that for all students at this point, if you compare with more learning with the learning that happen before this pandemic, we will never gonna, be there students, especially the little ones, especially student with disabilities, especially student with language development. They need the contact, the engagement with their teacher. They need the teachers to actually help them step by step. They need to learn one exceptional skill. They need to learn how to they need to know how to learn, and that's one of the challenges that we have right now. I think, based on what I know that has been happening over States, because I know, people who teach in Washington DC, I Massachusetts, for example, I think what has happened in your city has been remarkable to switch three more learning that happened in a matter of a week and to the scale of this of this initiative, actually created a huge challenge for and given those challenges, I believe that we have minimized the loss, that's gonna occur. We have minimize it with the type of work that has been happening. Thank you. Thank you all right. So this Blanca petite, oh yeah. We know so. We know that you have been in communication with teachers, principals and parents in our district to learn first head what they have been experiencing. What are some of the issues that you're concerned with and they're concerned with I think mr. Ramirez had mentioned some of the critical issues, but in talking to teachers and looking at how it was affecting children, one of the things that the teachers expressed over and over again was the need of improvement of their own technical skills, especially when you consider that many of the staff are over 40 years old and are not as tech savvy as some of our younger teachers. So in order to be able to have all the tools and all the programs at their tips and be able to use them to individualize for specific needs of different children, it's more difficult. So one of the things that the teachers asked over and over again in the different schools was that they would like ongoing professional development in this area. They wanted to be embedded into what the state and the district plan will be, and the city plan will be for the staff. They also asked for other support, because what happens in district 6, as you know, eighty-four percent of our community is second language learners and the there's also twenty point. Nine percent of them are new immigrants or people who have been in our communities for a short period of time, and the language issue became critical in terms of the activities and the lessons that the teachers were providing. Although there are Spanish programs and many of the teachers were taking advantage of this as part of their bilingual programs, I said it was sometimes very difficult that miss mr. Ramirez had said for our parents to be knowledgeable enough in the area of tech, technological area in order to support their children. So the achievement gap was actually increased between what children were doing prior as to what children are doing now, and this became paramount in what teachers were saying continuously the students. They feel very frustrated with the work at times and as mr. Ramirez had pointed out, there have been many issues and in the community, in terms of economics, the pandemic rode up a lot of survival needs. There were also needs of resources. One of the things that was out there was that we meet more resources for our children. 4,500 computers, iPads, were given dismantling of classroom technology. Labs was done in order to provide for children, so it shows in the face of everything that was going on the disparity that is happening between our communities, who are marginalized communities. Our children need to have that support and they need to be ongoing, so our parents were asking: will they have computers again next year? Will they have the internet because part of the economic issues that some of the parents were having they cannot afford to have the internet? Optimum and spectrum were actually raising the prices for many of our parents. There is a need among our community that we have to have those resources, materials and other supply. Sometimes, when teachers gave tasks to do, they were very sensitive to the needs of the community, so they would say to the children. You know you have these things at home, but parents then were saying yes, I do have paper towels to do the science experiment, but they're not that easily replaced anymore and I'm afraid to go out and purchase anything because if I go out, I might get cold at 19. So what was happening was that they were read. They were in need of materials and supplies. It's a part of our community that is dead. I. Do I just want to note that time is up but I'll. Let you finish that last part. What I wanted to say is that materials and supplies and resources have to be provided for our children for equity of and success for them. Thank you. So much as what you know so in the Senate I have a next question is for you. So just really quickly. We know you've been actively involved in Covid-19 19 response efforts. So if you can give us a little bit of information as far as like how you have personally been involved, what that looks like what those duties look like and what are some of the initiatives that you and your organization I've taken to support the community. So on day one we took a serious look at what services we were already providing and what services we could enhance to meet the needs of the community, and one of the things that we have done for decades now is to provide a food pantry. We were providing that food from the pantry. Two days a week we were seeing some 250 people, March 13th. We immediately revved up the services and started opening the pantry four days a week since then we have seen upwards of 500 people four days a week, so we have from that time till now served over 6,000 full packages, 60,000 food packages, the other thing we did immediately. We purchased a van so that we could go around and service the seniors that were homebound, and/or, disabled and we've been doing that every Tuesday and Thursday since March 13. In terms of the school and the, let me add one other thing: we've been working with merchants as well, because, as you know, our merchants have been devastated. So we worked with a number of them trying to make sure that they could complete the packages so that they could get whatever loans and grants were out there to maintain their businesses, we're still working with them to see whether or not they will be able to start and I'm dismayed to say that 50% of the merchants we've worked with have pretty much said. They don't see a way back, which is quite devastating. The other part is that we've been working in our school community health academy of alliance, as well as with the parents of ps4. Our after-school staff has now become counselors and translators. Many of the parents, as you know, English, is their second language, not their home language. They do not understand the work so that they can be the quasi teachers that they need to be now, so we have had to become translators for them and we spent a lot more time working with the parents. In some instances, then we actually do working with the students. Distance learning has become a real challenge, we're seeing that students now are becoming disengaged. It was once very exciting for them initially, but now it's wearing off, so we've had to think about ways to continue the engagement in a social way coming up with activities that make them feel that they should still participate in ways to learn and ways to stay engaged. I. Think it's an ongoing battle. I, don't see food insecurity going away, nor do I, see distance learning doing all that it should do and can do to continue educating our children. Thank you. So much miss Sharon Kim. How is your organization supported the community? There? Is this pandemic Lauren thanks for the question, so just to caveat and a little bit of a disclaimer. While you know the uptown hub, we are housed within New York Presbyterian, and the hospital has certainly done much for the community. I'm, definitely going to focus in specifically on the hub and how we've been providing services to our youth and through our hub partners, and so like my fellow colleagues here tonight, you know due to this pandemic, we have had to quickly adjust and make a lot of decisions about how to continue providing our services. You are young teachable in a virtual way, and you know really in collaboration with our partners. We have been able to offer different virtual programming and services. Basically, what I have been describing as three main pillars, so the first main pillar is our supportive guidance program. Basically, every young person who officially enrolls in the hub as a member they are immediately assigned to what we call a hub advocate, and so that is their one-on-one mentor, their champion that person that's connect to resources, provide emotional support, and so, as soon as we had to close our physical space, our main priority was making sure that every one of our members was reached out to you and to determine if they had any immediate needs. And so since then we have been able to stay connected with almost 200 young people and we've even had some new members join our program via our enrollment virtual enrollment process. Another pillar is our virtual programs via zoom, so we're all about zoom and all of our programs are actually co-sponsored by our HUD CBO partners. Summer actually are Co facilitated by them. We have self a year movie nights. We have game night, all the a zoom and at this point we're offering something basically Monday through Friday every day and in May alone, we've had 125 unique visits. By the way these programs are open to the community. You don't have to be a hub. Member to join, and so we've had youth who are just friends of our hub members or youth, who are part of our hub partner organizations, drop-in and then third, we have our behavioral health arm. So we have three hub psychologists on the team who exclusively see our members, who express an interest in getting therapy either individual or group and as I'm sure you can all imagine since coab in May, a lot of our members are have been struggling. We know how to cope, how to manage, and so fortunately, through Telus it-- we've been able to enroll new patients which, as you know, you can imagine, has been an incredibly important service for our young services. We, as a hub network, have been thinking a lot about. You know the summer and the summer that's coming up and how do we continue to support our young people? And so we have some plans in the works and I'm happy to say it's really been spearheaded alongside the Y up in Inwood, who is an acai key provider and so learning from them. We were thinking about having some kind of Summer Youth Employment Program. So that's in the works, but you know more to come on that. Thank you so much you so much all right. So next Miss Williams. The next question is for you, oh I, think it's already music. So the next question is: are there any new initiatives that the department is undertaking to address the specific needs of our youth as a result of the kovat 19 pandemics, so as a result of the pandemic, but also the what's been happening over the last couple of months? I can't say just the last couple of months as a black woman in this country, but the trauma we've all experienced with the murders we've all had to witness. Over and over again, we are launching youth town halls, which will be starting in August for led by young people is both an opportunity for them to express how they're feeling about what's happening, but also, we hope, develop a Youth agenda that they want to present not just to this man but to the candidates who will be running for mayor. So we are working on designing that we are partnering with an organization called amplify which is part of CUNY to do youth, participatory action research. So it would be some young people, partnering grad students and CUNY- to conduct research on how Colvin has affected their communities, particularly people in their communities, and have them develop a set of policy recommendations that put in it to the children's cabinet, which you know as part of its made up of commissioners of all agencies who in some way touched a lot of young people through Wayne, homeless youth initiative. We have issued a request for proposal and funding innovation provide isolation beds, as you can imagine so. In our shelter system they are practically social distancing. So that's one, but if the young people, young person, has symptoms, we don't want them having to stay in a group setting and so yeah isolation, hotel rooms where they get supported, organization, food and care, but they can be away from the shelter like settings so that they can recover from if they have cold like symptoms. So those are the three. The last is that assuming we are the recipients of some of the NYPD reallocation or, frankly, the bigger issue. If the federal government decides to have another package legislative package that we hope wants, the state and municipalities have more some economy and we have been working on the past six months. Computer-Based web-based program call hats and ladders SYEP, so you do all of the curriculum work. Readiness developing resumes all of those kinds of things through this platform network. We would launch this summer and the reason I'm excited about it, although it was developed for SYEP all of our young people 14 and over whether then began or I'm sonic programs or Cornerstone could so participate. Thank you. So much I'm really happy to hear that work is happening. Just a really quick follow-up question. Do you know when any of those programs will be starting to take place because I know I, know I'm, seeing this in the Q&A comments that SYEP something that's been mentioned a lot so I know that that's going to come up in QA, but any idea of what? Let me talk about the two that is short when you talk about that's. Why I think so the youth town halls were in the planning phase and we're expecting to launch the first one at the end of July. Amplify is going to start in July and run through September I'm very excited about that, because not only will they do research, it's kind of a different version of else YP, so young people will be paid to participate and learn how to conduct research. I don't know if you know a lot about the mission field, but it could use some people of color in the field, so we're excited for them to be partnering with any grad students. So those things will be happening this summer, I will say that as kind of as surprised as I'm sure, all of you were hopeful about redirecting funding to youth programs. That's all we heard we have not heard anything definitive. I know the council was very interested in restoring some aspects of SYEP. You know that in the past couple years we've served 75,000 young people, I, don't know that we'll get size and scale again, but July is almost here, and so we do need a decision fairly soon if to be able to mobilize providers the thing that I will say that we were really focused on safety and a lot of job sites that we would usually go to whether it was corporate or others were either teleworking. So you're not sending a young person to a site like that. So the original reasons not just about funding in the gap it was really about safety and how who would we had withdrawing the applications to be sites because they were moving to either just canceling altogether or their staffs were going to be working online? So it's not just a matter of getting the money, but how to do that safely and not expose young people to unsafe situations. So, of course we want it to be the right thing and we're excited about the opportunity, but in fairness to the providers you know we have to make a decision to give them the time to offer experience this summer. Thank you appreciate that just wanted to make sure, because I know that that's why he's been on a lot of our vines. So it's one of judgement when ours too absolutely yeah. Thank you. So mr. Manuel Paredes, we wanted to ask what actions have you taken to rectify these kovat related issues and what needs to be what needs to be put in place for the future to facilitate the remote learning implementation? So, as I said before, as soon as we face this pandemic, we had to think about not only the academic need of the students. Also, everything that was gonna come to our federal community, including families, were experiencing loss of a loved one financial burden that this was gonna. Bring about them and I wanted to say this. Mr. Cruz cuz, you said why I'm taking and I think it's not fair to say that this is action that this was six taking I think the most accurate statement will be what the Department of Education is doing under the leadership of Chancellor Carranza. That's just because in this moment, in this crisis that we are facing as a society right, we all came together and start to follow. The duration is our leader, as I said before. Yes, you know we have about 20 school buildings in our district who are serving school hard serving thousands of meals per day to alleviate the financial situation of our families. We have been very digital in providing devices and connectivity to all our families too, to compensate for the lack of connectivity for that we were facing at the moment before school closed, we distributed almost 5000 laptops to family lost, almost 5000, more iPad after school closed. We are in constant communication with school leadership teams school principal to ensure that not only the academic part of Education is at rest, also social-emotional need of our students on some families. Our schools are all promoting at least two workshops on parents to talk about how to handle crisis, and the type of conversation need to engage students, so they can understand what's going on around them, so they can face a and teaching parents, also certain skills, or they can learn how to teach the children as well. So again, this is not something that these three six only is doing. This is something that the city new year has embarked on, and I am very lucky to work with a group of teachers who actually are having a pleasure to what we do at this time because of their positive attitude, also community. That has been very supportive and understanding of the situation that we are weighing myself. I wanted to ask another follow kind of follow-up question. If you could answer that within a minute or so regarding summer school mean that it's kind of more the median future is summer school still taking place, and if so, who will attend? So the answer is yes summer school will be using remote learning. We don't even know if next school year we're gonna go back to school. So it's very possible that in September our kids will continue to be under this type of obstruction. We are expecting approximately one hundred seventy eight thousand students to attend summer school district one now last year in district 6, we had 2,500 19 students in summer school last year this year. Actually, today we began collecting the data for students, lobbying that will be requested to attend summer school, so we expect that number to eat twice as much. So definitely this is gonna, be the structural aid for teaching or learning. The only difference now is that we have required teachers to provide between 75 minutes to two hours or life teaching everyday, that it didn't happen. That's not happening right now because of the agreement with a unit, so students will be having a life interaction with each teacher on everyday basis. Okay, thank you. So much just to ask what I mean it's just a fact. You said that I just want to know that numbers you said -, that about 2100 students last year were summer school in the district wide correct me if I'm wrong, we're 2014, 580 and then this year. As of today, no this year we started today to collect the data regarding the students will be required 14 to go summer school. We don't have a number yes kind of early for that we should have that number in a week, but we expect that number to be approximately twice as much not it. Thank you so much appreciate it. Thank you so missus, you know I know earlier we left off. You were sharing with us some of the challenges that teachers have been experiencing during this time. I wanted to ask you: what are the steps that will be you'll be taking to address some of these concerns, and if you want to address the concern, there are a lot of steps that we need to take, and the whole school system really has an opportunity. I believe at this point in time to make drastic changes in the way they are teaching. Although there is a point of being that people are saying that schools will not open well everything that I've read and everything that I talk to and everyone that I've spoken to at different levels have said that yes, school will reopen. It will reopen in a different format, but it will be reopened whether it would be blended learning, which is a combination of computers using computers as well as teaching in the classroom or what they call hybrid learning, which is similar. I said school will happen. There are many issues involved with that as well, and many questions that parents have of the safety of the children. This is a time in which, when we look at the problems that our community is having, as was mentioned by vine and Denise, and everyone who has spoken and mr. Ramirez I said it's a time to begin to look at activities when we begin to work with children that actually decrease stress, because, as you know, executive functioning brain does not work. Kids cannot learn if they have stress or trauma in their lives, and we know that our community, as mr. Ramirez had mentioned, had prior to the pandemic, stresses so now we're increasing those stresses. So there has to be a comprehensive plan and practices put in place in every school in the city that requires social, emotionally emotional strategies to use on a daily basis and to integrate that into the child's learning. In order for you to have success and for kids to actually learn, there is more to learning as neuroscience research has indicated than just giving them a lot of work. As people have mentioned parents, our kids are disengaged, as Yvonne had mentioned, they're, disinterested unmotivated and now, on top of it all, they have this issue with what is happening in terms of justice, especially for our high school students, where parents continually say I, don't know what to do with them. They don't want to do anything. They don't want to login. They don't want to submit work. They are depressed. You're talking about it, suppress community, a community is suffering in every which way and I had seen this community suffer prior. But after this pandemic, the things I've heard and seen a really mind-boggling and our communities. They live in double up residences, four or five families to one apartment. I said in order to survive, and all of these things say that as a priority, we have to have social emotional learning placed in a way that is holistic, unified and practice driven. We have to help our children in our community, one of the other things that was mentioned before and I really do believe. We have an opportunity to deal with the answer: the questions of justice and race discrimination through videos, activities available in the internet, promoting discussions providing factual information and in order to build a student's, self-awareness, build relationships, because if we do not do that- and we know that neuroscience says that research has indicated that this will lead to motivation, predictive in achievement and I'm. So happy that you have the summer program that is working on this, because we need to have it not only in summer programs. We need to have it every day as part of the educational system in our schools to make change to help our children feel the hope of being able to make those changes. Sorry that I'm very adamant, all right, listen, I'm, a social worker I focus on social, emotional learning right. There was hip right, yeah miss Yvonne. What are some of the challenges that you have experienced with these youth engagement, and you mentioned before that students are disengaged and how have they been addressed by your organization? Yeah I had to unmute yourself. Could you hear my solution? I just gave the solution to world I. Think I want to I want to address it through the work that we've been doing in our school I cannot magnify how much the social and emotional piece is affecting our young people. It's not just affecting our young people. It's affecting their entire family right. We've had to create certain programs for about 50 students. We are actually servicing 30 of them, who were directly impacted by kovin, along with the deaths that they experienced. Some of it was parents, some of it were siblings. They extended families, along with the fact that they were hit with unemployment, because, as most of our service, our population is in the service field, completely out of work, and so a multitude of students coming to us with a lot of problems. Not only did we have to create kind of a wellness advocacy group that actually checked in with these families daily checked in with the students, but also had to check in with the parents to find out where they were on that mental stress ladder and try to figure out how to engage them, not just about how their children were doing, but how they were doing their homes are not prepared to do distance learning everyone. You know that it's not like they had a desk set up, for this is a totally different environment for all of them to deal with, and it is an extremely stressful. Mmm-Hmm. We've had to create a feeding program just to have meals prepared for these families to come up because the idea of coming home for those who could work and then having to do homework and deal with the stress of what was going on it was so much that they didn't have the ability to prepare meals. Thank God. We were able to partner with Anna with a catering company. So now we prepare meals for them every day, but one of the other things we had to do was to make sure our guidance, counselor, our social worker and a support team was checking in with these families on a daily basis to ask them questions about how not just the academics, of course, we're checking on that. But our things happening in your home. What are the kind of conversations that you are having when this issue, this horrible issue with George Floyd came about? Our students got another pandemic on top of another pandemic, so they're dealing with multiple pandemics within their hearts, their minds and their homes. We had to create a platform we had about 90 of parents, teachers and support people come together to talk about what was that racial impact and internalized racism that now they're taking one in order to deal with that. So the multiple pressures that are happening to our young people right now to think that they can comprehend academics on the level that we want them to is just it's not possible right now, without putting in a lot of antidotes without putting in a lot of mechanisms. That's going to help the entire family I heard that someone's got to be a tester I'm, not getting. Thank you so much for Senate miss Sharon Kim. My question, for you is what are some of the concerns of our families during this pandemic? That you're, seeing yeah I mean I feel like my fellow panelists have really covered a lot of the concerns. I mean we are definitely seeing similar things at the hub. You know we most of our work really is centered directly working with our young people, and so they have been expressing directly to us a lot of what those concerns are, and you know it's been mentioned. The remote learning that has Pershore been an issue access to you appropriate technology, all the things that have already been mentioned. You know something that has been interesting is the suite schedules. I mean sleep is just really not. You know not regulated I. Think as adults I feel like we're having a hard time sleeping during this sort of pandemics. Time I think you know. Another thing that you're realizing and has sort of been mentioned is just that the living space not being so conducive, not only because it might be cramped- and there might be you know so many family members, but we're also finding that for some of our young people they're in some, you know possibly dangerous or unresolved situations at home. You know, what's up people that they're living with and having them now stuck at home, it's really been a great challenge for them. You know something that has been interesting to realize during this time. Is you know our young people? They choose to be part of our program. You know it's of their own initiative that they come to our drop-in center and it quite honestly is linked to the fact that they have nowhere else to go. You know they don't really have that safe place. Home is not necessarily that safe place. So you know during this particular time. You know we have been just realizing more and more. How important are our spaces? You know physical space and it has been something I see for myself and for my staff it's been a difficult thing to swallow, but when we continue to do the best that we can and sort of as von WA see, you know it's a lot of texting and a lot of colleague on the daily just trying to trick me hopefully were able to provide some amount of hope and let them know that someone cares about them so that they can get through one more day and that honestly has been a huge thing, I think having our virtual programs. You know every week we get like one or two or three or five more young people that are tuning in and so I think that has been tremendous I. Think just the fact again that we have been able to work with all of our hub partners. So we have multiple people from each one of our organizations. Checking in on the same young person, I think that actually has been really tremendous and there are weekly and sometimes multiple times in a week, conversations that our staff across our organizations are having, with each other, to make sure that no one is falling through the cracks and so I think that has been just so huge and you know, but with all that said, I do want to just mention that we're also very blown away by our young people's resilience. They are resilient. They are really I, think you know handling this whole situation much better than I think you know we could have expected, and that has been so encouraging and I think inspires all of us to just continue in this work. So yeah and now they're leading a whole revolution so totally or I mean it is completely yeah. That is very true. Thank you. So much. Thank you. Listen, nice back to you. What are some of your? What do you believe are some of your future concerns for life, post kovat and some recommendations for possible solutions. I'm not sure I have solutions, but some of my worries are the disappearance of some of the entry-level offset our young people used to carry or families individuals with a lot of language proficiency or degrees like I'm, worried about a whole range of jobs, disappearing, I'm, worried about the tax base, paying attention but they're talking about a lot of people relocate from the book city, that's Hamza's and other states that are relocating and, as you know, do ICD it mostly tax levy. I refer to us as a nice-to-have, not a must-have. You have to fund Department of Education, you have fun some of the things or even you know, homeless, services by the court decree. But whenever there's a cut, youth services is the first to go. So if we lose the tax base, that's going to be a problem. I worry about us, not getting the money. We as a state from the federal government, because New York City alone is looking at 7 billion dollar cut, and at that point it won't matter. This is not gonna be about the NYPD and DYC be like this is going to be about hundreds of people being laid off that will further decimate communities from first responders to teachers, to you know other folks in city agencies and a lot of government jobs that provided a ladder to you know the middle class with folks. I worry about not being there as well, like you know, everywhere, I'm going I'm talking about protesting policy, it's not just about being in the street. You have to understand voting. You have to understand policy stand, holding folks wheel accountable for what they said during the campaign that they're not doing they're in office. Encourage young people understand why what the federal government is doing. You're not doing really affects us. It's not just the mayor in the capitol heck I'm, giving money the guy running against miss McConnell. Why we need a Senate that is democratic, led which might help us get some money in the city. So I worry about these things. I'm loving the young people protesting what I've been telling all the adults is their land, their bodies online they're, putting all their energy out there. What are we doing? What are we doing in terms of strategy in terms of donating, because they're taking risk not just from Kovach of being arrested, being abused so doing in other strategic arenas? But the big worry for me is: if we don't get this bill out, it's not gonna be about some youth employment right. It's gonna, be somebody complaining after school and everything else you can. Think of so those are my worries. Thank you so much for being so detailed yeah. Thank you for really highlighting the interconnectivity of all these systems. Very, oh! It's not one singular thing. Mr. Tomita, as Miss Williams mentioned right, where we know that there will be budget comes, come budget cuts coming our way. So what I want to ask is how will the proposed budget cuts affect our school? Why should I begin? Let's get started my thing. We all are reading a newspaper about the city financial crisis right now, which is between seven to nine billion dollars so either hole. Then we're looking at a department of education, budget crisis of two billion-dollar deficit that may already have announced the possibility of reducing fractional funding to schools. As you probably know, first to mean funding has been increasing. Fractional funding has been all the major goals since years ago. Every year we got a to 3% increase in fractional funding and we were able to create problem start with progress. Our program taking the kids to trips, we being able to increase our technology presence in the classroom. We be able to hire guidance counselors a social worker to watch Assoc emotional needs. If this, if we wish, if we recede on now and our budget cut, then we had to look at last and last of the gains that we have made the last couple years to actually operate in the matter of a year. I would say our main concern would be our staff. If this crisis hold, there is no federal stimulus or stayed better we're looking at losing a lot of teachers which will add to the already delicate emotional stage of our children, seeing their beloved teachers call, but we will have to think about cutting our started programs summer problems after school problems. We have to look at now: a reduction of the counseling services, the whole pollution right now we have to let go of school aides and school staff that gives the peace of mind to have the achievement to go to the cafeteria in an orderly fashion, to with greet students that will dismiss students at the end. I help create a safe environment for all students, we're gonna have to actually drag. We got professional development for teachers and means. Pitino was mentioning that one of the issues that we face right now with this new structure for teaching or learning is actually teachers saying that they need to increase their technologies savviness and now with less money to find organizations or consultant and can help you do that. Then we are the most left where we are left with no code in the cold water. Thank you. So much I'm hearing teacher cuts, I'm hearing cuts, this after-school programming and special Saturday program cut to AIDS, and you heating cuts across the board. Okay, assuming that we don't get extra funding. Assuming that thing is staying the way they are right. Now you have to be think about cut to teaching counseling trips technology after schools, Saturdays everything that you could think of that I to enhance the school life that the school experience for children will have the decline and increase in class size really big deal yes huge deal as I said, listen to people talking about what is needed now, I'm thinking, precisely what we need. Now we have together with money that we're gonna have less off mm-hmm. It's gonna become a closed vicious cycle of lack of money versus needs in the community. For sure I mean it's like waste. My question to miss Blanca so outside of funding. Well, what are other recommendations? Do you have to address the specific needs of students? I know you're a you're, an expert in social, emotional learning. So we will to hear your new perception. I. Also love teaching I mean that's my crime, love of life, but social-emotional learning just goes with it. I think. One of the things that has to happen is a creative look, but how we can get monies I know that there will be cuts. I mean I had cuts when I was in my school, but there are ways in which there are opportunities through grants. There are opportunities to foundations, they're opportunities by cold partnering, I had 22 partners in my building to provide for the needs of those children in the school. My kids had Alvin Ailey, my kids had art, my kids had an architectural program, but I have two. We the way the leadership has to look at, and principles in school, is to begin to say, I'm not going to stand for this. If the cuts are happening, then we still have to work on policies and practices to make changes, but there are monies in testing monies that are being billions of dollars. Getting to testing that is sometimes and considered through research really not effective. There are monies that is in school construction capital that is given more to certain communities and it's given to other communities. There are monies I'm, not saying that we do not need the resources and I'm not saying in the long run. There are, but I never can say. Never I. Just can't do that. I feel that there's something has to be done. If I agree with, there has to be changes in how our schools are run. There has to be a community looking at community as a partner. There has to be a way of increasing parents engagement, those parents are powerful, and now we are saying that we're communicating more with parents and parents are communicating with us. The whole teacher role has changed. So our formation of what school is like has to change as well and to get our resources has to change, and the teaching that takes place in the classroom must deal with the issues of justice equality even at first grade level in a minimal since, but we have to also empower our children to become active in our communities to go out and help with the census or with the pandemic. It becomes initiative with the older children that might be a possibility. I said to go out and do something to make yourself feel that you are actively changing what is being held to you, I'm from a mold, so I'm from the era where we fought for certain rights and civil rights, as well as Vietnam War, as well as other things and I. Believe that these, what the problem of policing has been there forever and our children feel trapped, that they can't express what it is that is happening and will continue to happen in our communities for brown and black people. You know I'm Puerto Rican, my sister is black. My brother looks like an Indian. We are mixed. That is who we are. We have to accept this, and we have to also try to seek ways of fighting the system, and, although it is maybe sounds a little out of sorts, I really believe that we have ways of helping our children feel better about themselves achieve help. Those special at kids feel better about themselves, and parents are complaining that if schools do reopen, they feel unsafe, they don't know how our children are going to be safe in school. So some of them said to me: I'm not sending my child to school. I, don't know if the school is being cleaned, so we have to look at. How is the school going to be clean? All these questions, how our custodians, who have contracts of that state that they only can service x y&z, are not going to change to be able to deal with Klan cleaning a school that the community that there's kovat 19. What are the disinfectants that are going to be used that may cause allergies to some of our children? These are questions that we have to provide for our community. There has to be ongoing and I have to thank there for having this the first side of thinking of how important it is for a Unity's to get together and to talk and to unite as a group in helping the education and our youth I said, because if we can't do it, who's gonna do it for them, I mean our parents are in need. I couldn't speak English, so someone said the 8th grade I said, but that doesn't mean we can't do it and I agree with something that the younger lady had said. Our community is resilient. I believe that this is going to make a stronger that we're going to find energies within ourselves that are going to make us even be better that we're going to change and we're going to make change and I and I pray that everyone who is part of the community feels the same way and does the same thing. One of the benefits that I've seen is how teachers and parents are now for the first time, actually sensitizing themselves to each other bonding in ways which they didn't know. They could teachers really began to see how our parents are feeling and what are the issues in our community? It's different when you say it at a workshop, but when you actually hear a parents say to you, I can't help them, but this is what's happening in my house. This is a totally different way that the teachers role has changed so teachers role has changed, leadership has changed, our schools have to change and we have to be able to provide and look for resources beyond what is given to us. We have to go out and get we have to get those resources for our children and I am I, mean I, wrote, brands I am willing to support anyone. Who's writing grants. I, didn't I, had partnerships, it's very easy to create partnerships that can work with schools to provide the mental health that we cannot provide, because we don't have enough social workers or help or assistance or psychologists or guidance. We have to relook at how we can do it and we have to design it. We can't wait and I know that we get we just I just want to know your times been up for a bit. Sorry about that. I know it's hard to keep track, passionate, but yeah I know I, appreciate that, and just so you know we are going to have a last opportunity for last stop so please hold onto that thought because it is important. I just want to make sure that we're holding space for everyone he's done so much. No listen, I appreciate the fashion. I just want to make sure we're untimely, because I know everyone has well--that's place to go because I'm sure you all quarantine, but you know we do so miss Senate here. I wanted to ask you. So in the beginning of this panel, we, you talked about some of the initiatives that you and your organization have taken to provide community predominantly around helping with food insecurity. Do you see these initiatives continuing the next year? And if so, what are the resources that you will need? I, don't see an end to food insecurity for some time, I think if anything, it's going to get bigger, I think when we look at unemployment is not going to go away anytime soon. The little stimulus check that people received is gone. Oats are using their rent money right now to be able to purchase food as long as their children are home, they will need to feed them. So I, don't see insecurity, food insecurity going away anytime soon, I think I can see our food pantries going to be up and running for a long time. What are we gonna need we're going to need more food, better coordinated. Some of these food programs rolled out like it was crazy, with no structure with no ability and accountability. I think a lot more accountability and a lot more streamlining of how food comes to communities needs to happen. I know that food is available. The issue was transportation and coordination, so I think that's got to get better, but that's not going to go away. You know I as I, listen to everyone I'm concerned about economic development, around businesses that are better gone under or don't see a way of coming back, I'm worried about education, not just for young people, but adults. Education, I'm, worried about the english-as-a-second-language programs that we're going on and worried about the workforce, development programs that took money to make it happen and those monies are gone. I'm worried about the existence of community-based organizations who are the pillars of our community and, what's going to happen to them when all the funding goes away and I think for a long time, community-based organizations were just oh there. They exist during times like this. We find out how much they weave the communities together and the need that they actually have. Some I'm stressed about that. I am overly worried about the gap that is being created. The academic gap that's being created with our young people. They were at a disadvantage before our children of color have always been at a disadvantage and they will be at an even greater disadvantage so that there's a lot to do. Yes, there's partnerships, yes, there's grant, but let me tell you: it is competitive as hell to get those grants right now, so I think we're gonna have to rethink about a lot of partnerships, a lot of scaling back of some of the things we do and get more strategic and focus on the basic needs of human beings, as opposed to trying to do certain things, but there's a lot to have to think through and a lot to kind of, look at and I think we need to figure out how to get a better administration, because I'm gonna tell you point-blank under the leadership we got now we are screwed. Sorry I'm done! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you and well said. Even the last part, what you appreciate it up: okay, so Sharon. So it's kind of gonna question this in the twofold way. So what are what resources are necessary to assist the community now and in the future as a result, Cole bid? And what steps are you taking to open it up safely for your sensor, safety right? Excuse it sure yeah so I mean we are obviously talking a lot about the resources that are needed in our community and first I would like to mention- and this has been I think talked about throughout the night. In light of our current events and seeing how people, and especially our young people, have been rallying together to promote racial justice to promote systemic change, I'd like to just share just how important it really is that all of this work be rooted in an anti racism framework and as we're talking about resources to really think of it through that lens. You know, as many of us are saying you know, our members are also mostly young people of color and if I can just get on a soapbox for just a second I. Do think that many of the issues that we're currently facing in our society is because of the lack of investment and the lack of care and attention that have been paid to our youth of color. And you know it's been interesting to have been starting a hub which is funded by the DA's office, and there is this perception that these are young people who are not as smart or not as capable, and that has really prevented many of our youth from getting that extra push to pursue an interest or be exposed to different opportunities that are out there instead they're being categorized as delinquents or that they're up to no good, and you know that really, you know gets to me and I definitely think it's really up to the adults and the institutions to do that. Deep anti-racism work within themselves within ourselves, so that those perceptions can begin to change and I can attest I'm sure many of you can attest that our young people do. You have so much potential that is just waiting to be unleashed into the world if only the world would receive them, and so you know that is something that really committed to you at the hub and it's something that we're really committed with our hub partners. You know we're talking about partnerships and it's something that we're constantly trying to strategize together about. You know collective impact applying to grants together. You know that has actually been something that we've been doing. The last like couple of months, which has been really amazing. More practically and, to put it bluntly, we need capital and we need people as far as resources are concerned, and so as we're thinking about our young people getting opportunities and being involved in activities throughout the summer. Even they should be incentivized right. There should be some financial, stipend or something that quite honestly is a stimulus to the economy and so giving our young people that purchasing power I think will go a long way and then, finally, you know the people part. We need caring adults who are willing to build relationships with our young people. You know to serve as mentors to teach them skills to offer advice. I think we can all agree that networks are so incredibly important for anyone's career trajectory and really make a difference, and so I think you know, for adults, you invite our young people into their worlds and invest in genuine relationships could really make a huge difference. Thank you. So much miss Kim I appreciate everyone's thoughts. I think one thing that's sticking out for me, as I've heard, all of you speak is really just the fact that, like all these inequities that we've experienced in the community are just highlighted by the pandemic right, it's nothing that we didn't know before and yes, some of them have been exacerbated, but these are things that, as you all said, are rooted in systemic issues. So with that in mind and for times sake, I, just wanna, we just want to give every panelist. First of all, thank you for being here. We want to give you all one last chance to just give us some final stuff, and then we are going to switch it over to our parents and students. That will be speaking and then we'll have a Q&A, and then we will wrap it up. Sound good, yeah, hey so Miss willing. You can go ahead. I would say that you know, though I was being custom. Mistake, that's the Virgo and I will say: there's been. There is some reason for hope: Yvonne alluded to the nonprofit community-based organization infrastructure, it's where I spent most of my career prior to this, and you know even the fact that the mayor and Office of Management and Budget allowed nonprofits, who couldn't work, had determined that the 40,000 folks who worked with nonprofits were essential right and good. Many of them who weren't offering services right and because wanted to keep them hold, who paid full quality learning how to figure out telework happens. You know, whatever you think of his other decision-making issues, I've worked under Mayor Bloomberg, he would have never identified the nonprofit and it's such a valued partner, so keeping the sector whole. Our Commissioner is looking at money that we might get from the service, Block Grant, and really investing in supporting nonprofits from financial management to get a getting better at teaching distance teaching and really transforming curricula to support adults and young people. So there'll be investments there. We have an election coming up and that gives me hope we are encouraging all young people, but we've been engaging them in census, work and in fact, some of them outside of sy PR Workforce Investment at portfolio has partnered with the census so that young people are doing the work to encourage families and communities to me to the census. So there's things happening, you know like what the young people and all this activism has shown us. Take the people who stay on the sidelines. You got to get in the game right, gotta get in the game, because money doesn't just happen. Somebody makes the decision we have to make them make the right decision, so I'm excited about the activism and energy that they've bought because I think they're gonna continue to lead us, but I'm also excited about the network of nonprofit. This one thing New York City, has over all out of places, including Oakland in other cities that compete with us. So you know be proud of that. We can rely on that and we have to make sure they're sufficiently funded Thanks. Thank you. Thank you so much, but when I'm ADA is any math thoughts, you have in our last hopes as well for the future. If you care to share that- and if you care to say this in a minute, spend I'd be great. Thank you. I'm gonna follow up on April what miss wheeler just said about money and I. Remember the former British prime minister, not attaching one say their poverty is a lack of character but I disagree. Poverty is a lack of cash and as a former worker in grocery stores and former taxi drivers, I am I know what poverty is. I know what is to leave without the necessary means key to her child's and to the school. We are facing a financial crisis now, but we have been seeing years of financial gains, but when we have financial gains, the money comes to a few hands and few people capitalism's apply when it comes down to crisis and financial losses that we need to socialize it and everybody now need to needs to suffer for especially community of color and community that I already a disadvantaged. My final thought to use this: you need to get your letter officials on board, they need to work together and they need to raise their voices. They do have a big microphone, much bigger than mine, and they could promote it necessary changes for our schools. They can promote early changes for our community if we face. If we get to the point in which we do get the budget car that we expect now, the damage is gonna be felt for years to come. Our communities are gonna, be suffering from that for years to come. Our students, I'm gonna, be suffering there for years to come, but I do have hope. I see this guy go of course well I'm in the business of building hope, because we never community come together. Changes happen only years ago, all community came together and we shape the organization called Mothers, Against, Drunk right and that law was changed and then there was a conversation promoted tougher punishment for domestic violence, and that was changed. 1964 C means why, whenever the community come together, change happen and that's why I'm hopeful, because what I see now industry is a coalition of people who actually are realizing that things cannot continue to be. The way they are, is not only the party to tell you that you see that's only a symptom of a bigger, larger issue. Look at the corona virus itself. How exposed the huge inequalities in half for people living below poverty level on people who are doing it really? Well, they have undercut not that line. Is this big now, so my final thought is: if we continue to raise our voices, an advocate for spark not only a federal level but I look a little to then hope would be alive, ICS a fair, but it's ended to you. Yeah our community was that maybe not your final, but I just want to thank everyone that was on the panel and I feel very honored to be with such distinguished people, who are doing great things in our community. I do believe that schools are really the instrument for change and I see that my hope is that the future of our children will be better than what it is today and I feel that this is an opportunity to make change. I still, I know that there are many ways to do that, but I feel that there is hope, because I've seen our community before our parents make it, regardless of some of the issues that they have, they survived they're survivors. So in that sense, yes, the community can get together. One thing that we learned that all of the groups within our community, whether it be the Latinos, the blacks, the Asians, whatever the groups were in our community, they did join together during this pandemic and food is a big crisis within our community. But I do believe something that everyone has mostly alluded to. Is that if we join together, if we advocate for our children, I always said if all the principals in the city of New York and all the stoop and tendons and all the educators got together and began to protest over what is happening in the schools? Maybe change would take place. Of course, that has yeah, but change can take pace. Voices together do help and our children are you are you can be that voice for our schools as well, so I do have hope in the future. I, unfortunately, I have two grandsons who have no immune system, so I cannot actually even go out at this point, but I am constantly in contact with many members of the community and Evon I always know what you do and other people within, and it was a pleasure to meet Denise and everyone else who is here representing the communities and all the work that you're doing you know because of people like you, our community is better, so there will always be good people in that community always and that's my hope that we continue to join together and to advocate and to push our representatives but more to also rethink creatively, new ways of finding materials and resources. We cannot think the old way anymore. We have to reach ange what how we think and thank you for allowing me to come and be part of your group and for having the foresight to have us discussing this. Thank you again. Thank you, brother. So much you bought any last words sure. First of all, thanks everybody on this call, and this soon this evening, everything we do each and every one of us is important. You know in talking to our young people, I keep telling them and I really mean it. The change starts inside of each of us and if we're willing to make a change and we're willing to commit ourselves to doing some work to advocate for equity in all of the areas, whether it be housing, economic development, food equity, it should be spread across our world. So I'm. Many thank you for saying how hopeful you are I am an eternal optimist. I always think that there's good in everything. If we just put our heads together if we unite and if we're doing it for righteous and just cause, we can make change people whether it was doing slavery or doing any of the depression or whatever people took a little and they got up. They did a lot and they were able to change lives we're going through something. Now that is testing our character. It's testing our very being I. Don't think that we will succumb to it. I think that we will go through it and we will go through it strongly if we believe in unity, if we believe in respect for one another, if we look out for our elders bring our young people along, encourage them, love them through. It demand the human rights insofar as our basic needs from those people that we have put in office. Many yes, they we need to get our elected officials and hold them accountable mm-hmm. We need to hold ourselves accountable, but there is hope there is a way forward. We just need to make sure that we are talking to the right people at the right time and making sure that we are getting the right information to arm ourselves. Information and education is our greatest weapons so that we can make change. It is not impossible. God did not give us more than we could handle if, in fact, we come together as a human race and as a community to make it happen, amen, mm-hmm, amen to that I'm, gonna, say Amen to me to Sharon sure, yes, Amen, Yvonne I am so with you. Thank you for those words and for everybody. I am just feeling really inspired and pumped up right now. I love, Washington Heights in would I love our young people and I love every person that I've been able to work with. You may not think it. By looking at me, I am korean-american. My parents immigrated to the States back in the 70s. My dad eventually joined the US Army, so I grew up moving every couple of years and quite honestly, never really felt like I belonged anywhere and I first moved to Washington Heights in 2009 and lived on 173rd and Audubon, and it was since then I just for whatever reason God has been bringing me back to Washington Heights, and you know I've just been more and more disenthrall with the community and how much I have been embraced and something I learned recently is that Washington Heights in Inwood holds the second highest number of youths in Manhattan. We have about 25 thousand youth, second, only to West, Harlem and right now, we're hoping to reach maybe at least 250 youth this summer and so I. Think of that number and I think wow. We have a long way to go, but I have been really encouraged these days by something that many of you probably have heard from Martin Luther King jr., who once said that the moral arc of the universe, bends toward justice- that's right and I have been just so honored and privileged to be able to work with fellow CBO's, who are just as passionate as I am and I really believe that we have been bending and quite honestly, pulling that are closer toward justice, doing everything in our power and strength to reach as a young person that we can who doesn't feel like they belong anywhere, so that they have a safe place, that they have people that care about them. And that is exactly what you know. I think my calling has been, and it's been such an amazing privilege to be able to work alongside people who have that same calling and so yeah, let's not be in our silos lets. You know exactly you night and you know really tap into that. Collective impact. I really believe that there's something to that and that this is sort of the moment in history, where we truly care to come together in a way that we never had before, and so you know with all of that said, you know if anyone I don't think the laughter we lost her the question. Hopefully she choice is a good okay. Well, if she joins again we'll give her a chance to finish her final thought, I'm being mindful of the time we have two parents and a student that are up to speak, and then we will open up. I, don't see many questions, I think some folks would be very diligent and actually answering them along the way. So we might not have that many questions, but we'll check out the box. I'm sorry I have to go. I feel that there are questions in the chat, so by all means feel free to collect them. Email them to me, I'll be more than happy to reply to you, but I have to have to go now, not a problem. We appreciate your time. Thank you so much for joining us today, but I. In fact, thank you all. So much did you want to I mean the last thing I'll say is. If anyone wants to partner and be in this work with us at the hub and with our partners, please do reach out. You can just email, uptown hub and whitey org and yeah. Let's connect I look forward to hopefully working with you all. Thank you so much Sharon. Thank you. So now we have our first parent up. Is you vodka? No, let's go. Are you in new vodka? No, she! But well! That's not! You know, I do mmmm! Oh, it's a kitty. Cat rattle couple says no circle, multiple area and Jonasson Procopio trellis constant says they were also gonna work, click Add, so very quick, I'm gonna be translating for you. Welcome so I'm just gonna be asking her what her experience every speaker, that's 2 minutes and we just want to hear from their perspective as parents or involve active working in the system. So we want to hear from the other side of things what has been their experience while she was experiencing the power loop and mei-hua later apparently lookbook, sporadic women, I experience, a pseudo public I think ok, cometo missus in trauma, hi Jochen Tracy, the okapi own Acosta, yes es Tito, don't say la veo que yo encontrado en trabajo tambi√©n y tambien o que tenga que pagar in tight odo, a no puede yummy siendo medical Aparri in tow, say para: la escuela que ahora on opening Oregon local town, a million dollars over on Avenida 400 I would hope, inaudible man with a daughter in intercessor interface, hello, no from enter personal, silicone amapola, no reduce economical service. Yes, la renta, serbia, trabajo el. In Indianapolis, we have practical support. Man, kimono trabajando young fellow, no, crying out for our kimono fabricator maintain full operational service. In our item we move along to travel. They sold me out. Yeah affect our emotional economic Amanda comes into some sea, muchas, gracias, Boyet I, don't feel okay Michael at parties, so you BEC I, just shared that she she's a mother of three and she said that for her, the biggest challenges all been on the economic side. So she works in a salon and other salons are not open at this moment. So it's the loss of wage, the stress of paying rent right and the stress of having a landlord demanding, rent, the stress of having your internet cut off and that being such a vital need for your child to continue their education. So she's really highlighting the impact that this has all had financially on her and the stress enough to really put on her and her family, which I have a very good I, just want to interject very quickly here, just to make sure that we encourage all the panelists to stay. It's on the end of the meeting, because the parents and students do have questions for you and questions for you. So just keeping that in mind our next parent clozapine ideas when I noticed when I know Josefina come on. Viene said, let me tell Olivia - okay, you gotta pull opposite ear up, maybe and only put in misciagna, okay, a single so now so what obedience is a cousin of IO and with something else now see? Single-Dose problematic is honesty, Hans's, a term of the cylinder in catalyst, grassy, meadow Kay, pasta, no more -.

A yes, a la da la moneda, intelligente estudiante, genome Oh dato, complete action. Kaleo came up a stance on being okay. Tenemos que tenemos que para less in that name in told us. Pero SML photo Manola una respuesta, c√≥mo SE dabangg are aware. Our immediate economic, immense, politically Oh que la queja loose Madero unemployment, Holly Fernando preempted. They could ask anything. It's a momento, no point in forty enemy. Other lawmakers, you know check it, except for comida, muchas, gracias, a la cama, a compact in which I support for particular sources. Here's a case algo muy importantly, it can versus in the composite also so ho subpoena just shared. You know again back to the economic impact and she is actually a survivor of Cove is ninety and she actually underwent it and came through, and even then the impact is again back to the financial, highlighting that for her family, specifically, she was able to get unemployment, but then there's also the stress of having that free internet service that was provided for two months and now it's going to be taken away or you have to pay a monthly fee that she's really not that they're not really able to make and then the other problem that she highlighted within her community is that for folks who are undocumented, seeing a pattern of folks being afraid to sign the paper, the form for the laptops from the D, the do e ver fear of any sort of backlash, and so what is going to hurt? She actually has a question. Will she have two questions and maybe lose interested at the end? But the first question is: what sort of initiative a support? Are we as a community going to do to help those who eat Internet? As we know it's vital, especially for students and especially as mr. Mohammed has mentioned, we don't know if students are going to start the year off remotely again, so that's something that I know it's been thrown around and then the other question is what is going to happen to students who, because of lack of technology, are not going to be able to complete the school year. So those are the two questions. I don't know. If anyone has answers, so we can come back to that Hey so city that almost a continuous fellow CIL inquiries from the boy le where they sit okay and then put come back at I'm, not a hospital. You should pull up a tomar una, Salida family, no caramel apple, manga order. You know that no plan of eunuch eel Apple ownership, cuenta que el rato del internet, yellow Moses, cookies, no llamo in plastic. Ah so Bryce. Oh, not the latter question about internet at the City Council hearing what the do eating so to ask them about continuing the internet as long as kids have to be city negotiated that and my other thought is purple. You know the open society institute put a lot of money, name, funding documented families, so that is those CBO's like make the road others receive that money. They could use some of that paid towards Internet to not just you know, food or housing, but education would be another criteria. It seems to me that they could find so and it sue OSI in the education and the do we justify I. Think the other thing with the with that undocumented piece, as she mentioned was it was more of a fear from minor saints, a fear of not her, but the people that she knows in her community as undocumented folks, having the fear of signing a paper and having the fear of being outed as undocumented, well I'm. Thinking those that if there are immigrant serving organizations, why could they get the computers so I didn't roll? For example, get a hundred or cloth get the computers and they take responsibility for signing them as credible members, my family and they're not going to trust the government another way to do it. Yeah we could. We could, you know, suggest I'm more than willing to say yes, we would do that. So it's a subpoena. My calendar Spooner que la primera cosa.

Manera crappy that forever the fundido for our last record all night again, which only known the Carrera and see her Sevilla became in a school cm. Follicular moisturizer push the tempo, so she's saying. Thank you call you for your suggestions and our last speaker is our student new delhi's. You know these I don't want to butcher your last name. If you want to say it is the deli son yah-tchi is their own. Are you relieved, hello, no he's just probably having some music with Mike, okay, I. Don't know the mic is active right now, but we don't hear hair. We still don't hear us here at least. Did you want to share anything on? Maybe if you put it in the Q&A box and the chatter yeah I'm going to call her. So maybe she can speak from the telephone because she said she said she seems. I mean I think that she might be having some kind of technical problem. Let me go okay, so while that happens, I just want to I just want to know some more people that we wanted to acknowledge. So we just want to do some shout outs while we get utilities on so the point is to acknowledge in your table. You got it yes, I think I have any say you know. Do you hear her carry I heard? Some parts are some parts that were a little muffled. Unfortunately, you know you from you yourself from the can't. You knew yourself with your computer, it's not working. That's a call-in number. She can call in to the number in the link go to the numbers, call the number thank you, I think I didn't and that she speak clearly, since this information is recording and guess for the record, you know I want to make sure that it's how the same in that now what I translate will be for the rest of us. So she's gonna try over the by calling to say she came a sauce. That's let's continue and well she get back to us. So in the meantime, we'll just do this shout out list so I just want to acknowledge. We have our neighborhood advisory board liaison. Okay, maybe fellas is on with us. He is also under my name because I shared my link with everyone, but hockey. If you can just wave, say hi there you go there. He is so just some really quick shout out. Thank you. Thank you to the following people: Rosendo Dominguez is our romance Nadia Ramirez, doctor Yolanda, Panetta Mayra Palacio might accomplish a Hooley about Bautista Oh, Monica clerk, Tatyana Mahoney, and if I miss anyone, please let me know pretty much weight would have well. In the meantime, maybe perhaps we wanted to open up a Q&A for the our attendees. So while you know understanding that once you them is get to get access to us, so we will proceed or we may face or stop the meeting so just to listen to her. But let's proceed, let's open up the Q&A allowing out members to first and then you know attendees, of course, at this point I think. Maybe we can just go. You know with directly with anyone who you know wanted to pose the questions. Thank you. I have a question for the panelists. If we wanted to get in contact with you guys, how could we do that?

I appreciate that I had a question for a group, and this might be for Denise, for you specifically based on something you said earlier, but my name is Krista. Mato I work at Zeta schools and one thing we've been struggling with a lot of our families. Is the spectrum offer specifically and they, when kovat hit, they took advantage of the 60-day free policy, and those are now expiring, since that was in mid-march, and our families are obviously struggling with making decisions on what to spend money on and deciding between, Wi-Fi and their next meal has been, has been really hard. So it's become really hard for our families and it's become to the point that it feels like public education. You know supposed to be free, but at this point it's not feeling free. Once spectrum is charging them $50 a month and often not sharing ahead of time that they're going to do that. They just continue with the service and then they get billed which I feel like, maybe even worse, and it's been really tough financial hit for a lot of families. So yeah I just want to get advice from the group. We've been trying to work in different channels to try to fix this and to change this, knowing that this is definitely an extended to the summer. We need families to be on Wi-Fi to get remote learning and remote access. Is there anything that you'd recommend that we can do to try to try to fight this? Oh, my two thoughts had to do with addressing the deal we mm-hmm finance hearing the mayor holds a press availability every day, no New York one or another. One of the education reporters like at the Daily News to ask this question is a good way to get him on record about certain things and set up my first strategy and as I said you know, there are some funders like Robin, Hood and I have stepped in I'm, always a little too. Do that because you're talking about so many we got a million students. I, don't know how many of you are gonna cover when this should be something the government is covering I. Do think that the OSI initiative in particular that's really been focused on communities not being helped by what the federal government has done or been left behind by what the federal government has done would be a response and they've given money to immigrants serving organizations like me and some others who are very easy to get in touch with and accessible and very community oriented. So those are my three ideas, but I would start with the council. Hearing is public I can do it by zoom and, as I said, the mayor is on TV almost every day you could try Como on TV every day, so they may not even be meeting about this, especially to the point that superintendant me, we may not be back in physical buildings next year. That's a very real possibility. I think it's a probability frankly, because we're can't practice social distancing in the school buildings. We have right, building more school buildings, so I think we're going to be partly in buildings and partly online, and so families are going to need that support. So those are my thoughts. Sorry I think am I jumping on someone? No, you can go Yvonne I'll go after you, I think we all you know. We all have the ability to do advocacy. If you have a constituency. Our students should be writing letters to our elected officials and some mayor and to and to whomever to all the elected officials. They have to feel that this is significant and important to us right so whether it be the calls while they are on TV or the calls while they're doing their council hearings, we've got to send letters. We've got a we've, got a bombard their offices so that they know exactly what it is that we need. We can't be passive about it and I know. If we have again, if we have a clientele from the youth hub, it could be an initiative that the youth hub takes on and have every you can do it virtually have every one of our young people writing to their offices. Have their parents writing to their offices. I think we have to be activated, it has to be grassroots pushed at this point. I agree: I, agree with everything that you said. Even it has to be a mobilization of the community to make it happen by the way there was an extension of the licensing for the internet till June 30th. What is happening, though, is that those companies who know that many of our parents don't really understand what is happening and are afraid are actually staying to parents. We have a bill for you, but this is not what's true because they had already. This has been a complaint that happened like in Maine and has been fabricated by these parents who actually brought this was that then they changed the spectrum and optimum and whatever services were to be extended to June 30th. So if they are actually taking off the internet is because it's an abuse of power, so there as I agree with both. Ladies there's a lot of advocacy that you can do, don't be afraid to be on camera hidden and your children, your students, believe it or not, they're very good speakers, and they actually advocate for themselves and you give them a sense of power and also a sense of hope. So I do agree. Letter-Writing is one of my big things in the in elementary school I believe that children should be letter-writing and complaining that they live in shelters that they do. This I think you have to begin the citizenship attitude very early on. So, if you I would just answer that we have letter writing in this day, almost like Twitter accounts, I, agree, social media no way they would not do that and if it started trending and think so weather it's the chair of the Education Committee I to the council and that negotiating with the mayor about the one I would definitely be all absolutely even I'm talking to mr. Ramirez, who is directly involved with downtown. So there are avenues that you can take and we have to give our parents and our kids hope you know we have to say no. We can do something about this, just to UM, throw out a thought. I am 100% onboard with advocacy and Yvonne I hear you and I think that is true. We have sort of at our fingertips the contingency of young people, that you know a lot of what I've been thinking about for the summer and thinking about what activities or what kind of internship or what-have-you I have been thinking more and more about really using it. With all of this advocacy work- and you know our young people are in it, but I think that what we can do, as providers is better, prepare them safety plan with them. Let them know hey, okay, if you're going to a protest like here are some things to think about. So you know a lot of those. Are our ideas and conversations we're having definitely on board with the advocacy piece, something though to throw out just in terms of the internet, question and I'm, going to be the first to admit that I'm not as well-versed but I am be married to a tech consultant, and we talked a lot about these things and I do think that there's something about like talking to these or reaching out or figuring out if there are companies that are a little bit more socially minded and really mobilizing the private sector, mobilizing these professionals who are really being activated as well these days, you know a lot of a lot of these companies, because you're, probably seeing and that I'm talking to you who have never really thought about social justice before are now having these conversations, and it's kind of been amazing, because I'm sort of like welcome to my world and so I think that there's also some something there and I don't know exactly the specific answer, but I do think we're living in a moment where I don't have to be doing all of this alone in the nonprofit sector. I think we can really leverage the power and the resources that our colleagues, our family members, our friends, may have in the private sector. So that's something that I kind of want to throw out there, because yeah I really feel like there's something to that. But I don't quite know what the answer is yet, but definitely if anyone is interested in exploring that with me I'm down for that so I think it's big, and so you know if you're going to give. The reason got this deal in the first place is that the city negotiated so I do think we have to go back and put the pressure absolutely. This is an issue, especially we're gonna, be online for another year and bringing the power of the city and the community to bear on whatever the spectrum Verizon, whatever so I think it's both it's worried about being able to mobilize corporations in time for something that's happening at the end of this month, and so, but we have to get money or bring this thing to bear on this negotiation and in longer term, it's you know: Community Reinvestment, Act kind of thing. Where spectrum get some credits boom, you know continuing to do so, I mean I, think it's both mm-hmm. So thank you all so much for all those thoughts and ER answers to that. I know that a lot of folks are really concerned about the internet access, especially that guys. We said we don't know if schools are gonna be remote next year we do have utilities back online and I would love to give her the platform so that she could share her experience as a student as we're talking about that as a student. What has been her experience? So utility says you can go ahead and just tell us a little bit about what it's been like for you on your end as a student to go through this time with remote learning with Kovac. With everything that's happening, you know you can hear me, do you need to old user shows yeah, you know you. Can you meet yourself or come or tend someone whoever the admin is unmute hurt, please I, don't see Jonathan on yeah I! Think he's not only oh they're here, you know Lee hello, I! Do you here, oh hi Jenny. Why not well I would like to share my experience with remote learning advocate great amount of stress and anxiety. The current situation that our country is facing when the school staff has provided resources and help and they've been patient with me, and my schoolwork I would like to with my many time to promote awareness to the current racial issues happening in their country. Actually, a few weeks ago, a mother, by grown adult moratorium with rifle screaming and spitting up police, saying nasty, smack and forcefully tried to get into different buildings and they've been left on. Our now kids at those and teens are making out against injustice and they're being created, the necessary vironment they're being shot at with a bullet and being gaseous type of spray and are facing a lot for a predominantly black neighborhood. I braid over police, and I black and black individuals by being overcharged by the court in the video to the lighter complexion, are being under charge. Now, let me give you a brief history of history lesson. The first police it had for the first police department was actually created to chase runaway slaves back to the masters and after they were freed now. Actually the club core system would overcharge them and try to find ways. Okay, yeah you gotta move away from your computer yeah. What I'm hearing the law from you is really I'm hearing the frustration of the underlying systemic issues at hand and just how those are so wrapped in your experience with covert, especially with the stress that you said, has been really highlighted during the pandemic, with remote learning. So I wanted to thank you so much for sharing that, because I think that is very important for us to hear and I I'm sorry I said no problem, so thank you for coming and I know. That's not easy and I want to get up to the youth for speaking up and I. Do want to address that. We do have some questions on the chat for my understanding, but while these are saving those so that maybe we can actually we can send those off to the folks who can better answer them, because I know that I want to keep track of time and we are really over time. So how does that sound? -? Everyone say well these. What do you? What do you think it's absolutely and thank you guys. You know you have done a wonderful job and in our ward you know panelists I can't and then enough I would act in this as well. I think our team has done fantastic tonight, I'm very proud and I. Don't think. I can actually come up with a word that can measure you know the level of performance. You know an outstanding job that you all have put together, I'm very proud of you and I'm very proud to be. You know your Callie so and with that said, I just would like to add it off that. Maybe we may have we already and sit at a time that we are supposed to use, but I guess maybe we can use in a few minutes three or four five minutes and gets to properly find everyone personally I want to guess. Ria stay the think. You know that you share with our work. You know how is that they are for some reason and all that I know they have kept silent, but I want it basically to mention mr. Julio Batista, who is a dear friend and in Community College from the previous student hospital I, also like to mention the GW folks like Elsa Romans Rosendo, the parents, of course that they they've been vocal, I, know somewhere and some corner of this meeting today they are watching us. I really wanted to. Thank and I also wanted to highlight my appreciation for our deputy director, divided city, for here I mean this about. He also somewhere, okay, thank you so very much for all your support and if I probably forget someone else, but just know that I deeply and dearly and sincerely appreciate all the work that you guys, you know have done not only today in this meeting but throughout you know our interaction in the work that we know how to do best for our community and deeply proud of you and I. Thank you all the panelists for such outstanding job and for being, you know, always willing to embrace our community. So thank you deeply. So much so moving I wanted to add it out moving to another face so this agenda, but before I do that I wanted to conceal back the floor to you, Wow D and carry and carry to see, if you want to add it a few more words, so any thoughts that you perhaps have you know come up with so I can guess, show some discuss something briefly after what is next with our comedian. Where are we going to move from this conversation? So I wanted to allow you to say anything and any member who want to eat to get, and you know and say anything and by the way, I wanted to add it up which I forget, but this is also very important. My Connie Jolanda dr. Jolanda Panetta. You know she's, aware you'll and I. Thank you for joining us. So go ahead. Well, the end in entertain, for you know anything that you wanted to share before we move to then to the closure. I mean to the closing of the agenda. Sure I think everyone spoken so well. I, I'm, just gonna, say snaps to everyone, because you, a lot of you, said that I've been thinking and I feel like the rest is up to another day of conversation. Yeah, so I do want to thank everybody for participating. I forget providing such great insight so you're. You know what you guys do from a very micro level. It's a very macro objective perception that you guys have also what I want to say that you know we delis went through right now. Is this an example of what students are going through day to day right and she, you know she's I'm sure she has the technology for topo2 to do this, but still there's still. This there's still a lag there right, and this is all part of the adaptation that we need to that. Work may see the transitions that we're facing changes, and you know we just have to be very patient with ourselves, but with others, and also just a kind of like think about what. How can we improve everything of where it is today? I love hearing that you know the conversations of what of what was of what is and what and how you know what the future will look like, because I think that that's ultimately, what we're tasked with as advocates for the community and as a system of support for times, would identify what needs are and try to make an argument for you know for access to resources to prove these needs right, and so with that being said, I know that, if a mention yesterday in our kinda ad-hoc beautiful about this panel of a button- and it was brought up with this panel discussion today about the internet, Wi-Fi being a issue- I had a very big concern for a family. So I do know that, and maybe we'll speak about this with a few minutes after you know, this panel discussion is close, but we will be discussing a resolution on the table that God willing, if everybody agrees of the committee AB regarding the us advocating for funding to last until elearning is, you know ceasing this per se right. So we want to advocate for Wi-Fi for folks that need access to these funds to ensure that Wi-Fi connectivity is still there for the summer, and so you know alerta' is a superb actor to global per se right. So that's where we're going a nice bird today and we're regards next week and we're recording tomorrow. You know it still is up at the air but I'm grateful that you know today was the you know: phase 1, reopening so I'm hopeful that you know people are taking care of themselves and that's as much as we could do so. I just want to say everybody protect themselves that it be mindful of your space II get at each other and know that you know we're here as a committee we're here for the youth of education, but as a Florida as a whole were here for the community, and we were to just continue to relay that support. Thank you all. Thank you, daddy! You wanted it up any final words before I now, I think we're good to move ahead. Thank you so I. That is a few quick note that I think are very important. You probably want to hear about this from all these conversation and other conversations that I had with some of my college interviewing people and getting to know exactly about their experiences. We're gonna have a some sort of we don't know, be writing like some strong, like a policy recommendation for the city and the involving some agency, especially the do en probably may heat to the make your office we're going to present this to the to the community board, so the community board made father walk within they rightfully so, and that's important for you to know so your conversation, your thoughts tonight, some of them are going to be included.

Seven o'clock we've been sitting here listening to a presentation by people such as Blanca Bettina. You understand it and all the people I have to focus on those two people, this perience their record in our communities for over 40 years. It's really something that all of you, everyone that is on this link, should research and take a look at because their experience is going to be loved. The future of our community I am a little concerned fair. We thought. Do you respect to you, as a member of the community board Use Committee, that members of this committee did not have an opportunity to ask questions. I know that you wanted to focus in a different way and get participation by everybody into the zone, which is some time we cannot do. But there are members of this committee, a Maya seed names around here also Naima. I am glad that you are part of this listening. You know two hours record I think it's being two hours. There is a lot of people who could have contributed a lot also to the participation to the discussion and the experiences that we have all share in our community, but I as I said before. I am sorry that the superintendent left, because I have specific questions to him very seriously, because he is the superintendent of district 6 I needed to be here to answer question by everybody. Okay, so does that's my focus fair. You know me. I have I, say what I have to say. I respect you but I think that this lengthy conversation and listening that we have didn't give us the opportunity in order for us to prioritize in our community war insect or what is important, how the members are community boards are going to be ranking specific needs of our community, especially in education on probably safety. We needed to have a dialogue, a big part of the dialogue and that's I. You know, I wish everybody a happy summer and I also have to remind you coronavirus and code igniting is not the end of our life. It's an experience and we have to learn from that. We have to share pains and also joys, because we need to have a better future for our people, for our young people to show them. That is a better because of this. We can give them a better future for them to take over where all of us, the older adults, have put a letter energy in building in our community. So thank you so much to all of you, Blanka I love you, people and I. Don't have to tell you this rest have a nice summer and let's take two Tylenol big go out with a mask use: glow, don't talk to anybody that doesn't have that protection because we have to protect them as we have to protect ourselves right, Thank, You Maria! Your point is well taking, but I don't know if my college said, but in case that any question that people may have they can send. They can send me those questions to my email, so I can send all I can forward a ghost question to the panel and they would have an answer. I thought yes here they go movie have to have some structures in order for us to put together resolutions and both on those resolution and by you know the way that you were explaining I. Don't think we're going to have the opportunity to do that. I'm talking about the committee I'm, not talking about the rest of the people who are you know watching us and by having a YouTube and the other tube and the extra tube is not going to come. We need. We are part of a community planning board. There's hard structure and we have to go by the laws, get you familiar. They got you pointing a thing that I mean I'm, no fight the other way.
