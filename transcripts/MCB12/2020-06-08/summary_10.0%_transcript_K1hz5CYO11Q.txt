She unfortunate can't get her audio or visual to work, but noting that all right anybody else, all right being at the case, so I guess, let's proceed so, as you know, as you may know, part of our committee mission, is to keep the community informed and in concert with our mission.
A focus of my team Fed from the invitation and I am extremely grateful for the work that you guys do for the community America for the Hmong years ago, when she was a proceeding of the CEC for this receipts, and we had the opportunity to engage in with initial is a problem for Digital school I am the district six school superintendent, and just a little bit about myself.
No I've been an educator for 48, years, 40 of which are in district 6, not only as a director bilingual programs as assistant director, as Ap as a teacher, and also as a principal for 17 years and an RTI specialist as well as now that I work for ethical, schools, Network, providing social, emotional learning to train staff that work in shelters.
My knowledge has run from bilingual education to administration, as well as lending my needs for social, emotional learning and basically I hold a great heart for the community.
We have since our inception, provided after- school programs in yes, twenty, Hi, To be part of this conversation with everyone, and thank you so much for the invitation, and my name is Sharon Kim You know we launched back in 2017 with the support from the Manhattan district attorney's office.
You go first, so we wanted to know and ask what are some specific dy programs that will continue to address the needs of the community third, this pandemic and what programs will not be available.
A lot of people do not know that we fund all those programs, but we've also been sharing that information with a lot of our families.
That's why you see schools now receiving resources, including food to family training, to staff out to support families, and another big challenge has been also the expectation regarding teachers providing instruction.
The community has expressed many times that they see that there is a big difference when teachers provide life instruction over non- life instruction, and this remote learning is something that had never been done on this scale ever so we needed to create climate roles and support for innovation on pacing young, sun, our missteps, but that has been one challenge: finding that balance between life instruction and not life instruction the devices on the connectivity right now right now.
I think, based on what I know that has been happening over States, because I know, people who teach in Washington DC, I Massachusetts, for example, I, think what has happened in your city has been remarkable to switch three more learning that happened in a matter of a week and to the scale of this of this initiative, actually created a huge challenge for and given those challenges, We have minimize it with the type of work that has been happening.
We know that you have been in communication with teachers, principals and parents in our district to learn first head what they have been experiencing.
I think Mr. Ramirez had mentioned some of the critical issues, but in talking to teachers and looking at how it was affecting children, one of the things that the teachers expressed over and over again was the need of improvement of their own technical skills, especially when you consider that many of the staff are over 40 years old and are not as tech savvy as some of our younger teachers.
They also asked for other support, because what happens in district 6, as you know, eighty, four percent of our community is second language learners and the Nine percent of them are new immigrants or people who have been in our communities for a short period of time, and the language issue became critical in terms of the activities and the lessons that the teachers were providing.
You know the summer and the summer that's coming up, and how do we continue to support our young people?
A set of policy recommendations that put in it to the children's cabinet, which you know as part of its made up of commissioners, of all agencies who in some way touched a lot of young people through Wayne, homeless, youth, initiative.
So, that's one, but if the young people, young person, has symptoms, we do not want them having to stay in a group setting and so Isolation, hotel rooms where they get supported, organization, food and care, but they can be away from the shelter like settings so that they can recover from if they have cold like symptoms.
You know that in the past couple years we've served 75,000 young people I do not know that we'll get size and scale again, but July is almost here, and so we do need a decision fairly soon if to be able to mobilize providers the thing that I will say that we were really focused on safety and a lot of job sites that we would usually go to, whether it was corporate or others, were either teleworking.
We are in constant communication with school leadership teams school principal to ensure that not only the academic part of Education is at rest, also social, emotional need of our students on some families.
You said that I just want to know that numbers you said, that about 2100 students last year were summer, school.
When we look at the problems that our community is having, as was mentioned by vine and Denise, and everyone who has spoken and Mr. Ramirez I said it's a time to begin to look at activities when we begin to work with children that actually decrease stress, because, as you know, executive functioning brain does not work.
Kids can not learn if they have stress or trauma in their lives, and we know that our community, as Mr. Ramirez had mentioned, had prior to the pandemic.
They have this issue with what is happening in terms of justice, especially for our high school students, where parents continually say I do not know what to do with them.
One of the other things that was mentioned before We have an opportunity to deal with the answer: the questions of justice and race discrimination through videos, activities available in the internet, promoting discussions providing factual information and in order to build a student's self- awareness, build relationships, because if we do not do that- So happy that you have the summer program that is working on this, because we need to have it not only in summer programs.
I want to address it through the work that we've been doing in our school I can not magnify how much the social and emotional piece is affecting our young people.
We've had to create a feeding program just to have meals prepared for these families to come up because the idea of coming home for those who could work and then having to do homework and deal with the stress of what was going on.
We had to create a platform we had about 90 of parents, teachers and support people come together to talk about what was that racial impact and internalized racism that now they're taking one in order to deal with that.
So the multiple pressures that are happening to our young people right now, to think that they can comprehend academics on the level that we want them to is just it's not possible right, now, without putting in a lot of antidotes without putting in a lot of mechanisms.
You know, we most of our work really is centered directly working with our young people, and so they have been expressing directly to us a lot of what those concerns are- The remote learning that has Pershore been an issue access to you appropriate technology.
Another thing that you're realizing and has sort of been mentioned is just that the living space not being so conducive, not only because it might be cramped- You, know so many family members, but we're also finding that for some of our young people they're in some, you know possibly dangerous or unresolved situations at home.
You know physical space, and it has been something I see for myself and for my staff Every week we get like one or two or three or five more young people that are tuning in Just the fact again that we have been able to work with all of our hub partners.
And you know, but with all that said, I do want to just mention that we're also very blown away by our young people's resilience.
This is not going to be about the NYPD and DYC Is going to be about hundreds of people being laid off that will further decimate communities from first responders to teachers, You know other folks in city agencies and a lot of government jobs that provided a ladder to you know the middle class with folks.
There is no federal stimulus or stayed better we're looking at losing a lot of teachers which will add to the already delicate emotional stage of our children, seeing their beloved teachers call, but we will have to think about cutting our started programs summer problems after school problems.
Pitino was mentioning that one of the issues that we face right now with this new structure for teaching or learning is actually teachers saying that they need to increase their technologies savviness and now with less money to find organizations or consultant and can help you do that.
How our custodians, who have contracts of that state that they only can service X Y&Z, are not going to change to be able to deal with Klan cleaning a school that the community that there's Covid-19.
There has to be ongoing and I have to thank there for having this the first side of thinking of how important it is for a Unity's to get together and to talk and to unite as a group in helping the education and our youth Our community is resilient.
I think a lot more accountability and a lot more streamlining of how food comes to communities needs to happen.
What's going to happen to them when all the funding goes away, The academic gap, that's being created with our young people.
So I mean we are obviously talking a lot about the resources that are needed in our community and first I would like to mention- In light of our current events and seeing how people, and especially our young people, have been rallying together to promote racial justice to promote systemic change, I'd like to just share just how important it really is that all of this work be rooted in an anti racism framework and as we're talking about resources to really think of it through that lens.
You know it's been interesting to have been starting a hub which is funded by the DA's office, and there is this perception that these are young people who are not as smart or not as capable, and that has really prevented many of our youth from getting that extra push to pursue an interest or be exposed to different opportunities that are out there.
You know like what the young people and all this activism has shown.
Whenever the community come together, change happen, And. That's why I'm hopeful, because what I see now industry is a coalition of people who actually are realizing that things can not continue to be the way they are, is not only the party to tell you that you see that's only a symptom of a bigger, larger issue.
I still, I know that there are many ways to do that, but I feel that there is hope, because I've seen our community before our parents make it, regardless of some of the issues that they have, they survived.
Is that if we join together, if we advocate for our children, I, always said if all the principals in the city of New York and all the stoop and tendons and all the educators got together and began to protest over what is happening in the schools.
I, unfortunately, I have two grandsons who have no immune system, so I can not actually even go out at this point, but I am constantly in contact with many members of the community and Evon I, always know what you do and other people within, and it was a pleasure to meet Denise and everyone else.
You know because of people like you, our community is better, so there will always be good people in that community always and that's my hope that we continue to join together and to advocate and to push our representatives but more to also rethink creatively, new ways of finding materials and resources.
This summer And And I have been just so honored and privileged to be able to work with fellow CBO's, who are just as passionate as I am I really believe that we have been bending and quite honestly, pulling that are closer toward justice, doing everything in our power and strength to reach as a young person that we can, who does not feel like they belong anywhere, so that they have a safe place, that they have people that care about.
I really believe that there's something to that and that this is sort of the moment in history, where we truly care to come together in a way that we never had before, and So you know, I'm being mindful of the time we have two parents and a student that are up to speak, and then we will open up.
One of the education reporters like at the Daily News to ask this question is a good way to get him on record about certain things and set up my first strategy and, as I said you know.
We have right, building more school, buildings, so I think we're going to be partly in buildings and partly online, and so families are going to need that support.
These days, you know a lot of a lot of these companies, because you're, probably seeing and that I'm talking to you who have never really thought about social justice before are now having these conversations, and it's kind of been amazing, because I'm sort of like welcome to my world I, think we can really leverage the power and the resources that our colleagues, our family, members, our friends, may have in the private sector.
It's worried about being able to mobilize corporations in time for something that's happening at the end of this month, and so, but we have to get money or bring this thing to bear on this negotiation We said we do not know if schools are going to be remote next year.
Work may see the transitions that we're facing changes, and you know we just have to be very patient with ourselves, but with others, and also just a kind of like think about what.
You know what the future will look like, because I think that that's ultimately, what we're tasked with as advocates for the community and as a system of support for times, would identify what needs are and try to make an argument for you know for access to resources to prove these needs right, and so with that being said.
I just want to say everybody protect themselves that it be mindful of your space II get at each other and know that you know we're here as a committee, we're here for the youth of education, but as a Florida as a whole were here for the community, and we were to just continue to relay that support.
I wanted, also to mention that this perhaps is going to be the last meeting of the youth and education committee until September.
