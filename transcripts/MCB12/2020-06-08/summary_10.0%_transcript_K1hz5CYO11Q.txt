I would like to ask you kindly and respectfully that we take a moment of silence in memory of the unfortunately tragedy I mean tragedy of mr Floyd, his family Let's proceed now with our agenda and thank you for you know, join me in this important moment of silent For. That I would like to introduce our moderator, while this huge, who is the assistant chief for the youth and education committees, and also I, would like to introduce his calls on our co-moderator Harris.
The people in sub talking right , no I've been an educator for 48 years, 40 of which are in district 6, not only as a director bilingual programs as assistant director, as ap as a teacher, and also as a principal for 17 years and an RTI specialist as well as now that I work for ethical schools, Network, providing social, emotional learning to train staff that work in shelters, My knowledge has run from bilingual education to administration, as well as lending my needs for social-emotional learning and basically I hold a great heart for the community and I, provide whatever service Programs in the community, The executive director of community lead at the Heights However I've been with the organization since July, 16 1997, and the majority of the work that we do is in affordable housing.
But we also provide a plethora of other services, including the creation of Community Health Academy of the heights in 2006, which is a middle through high school We have since our inception provided after-school programs in yes, twenty-eight been in four, so we are a long time providers of educational services, hi I'm, so very honored to be part of this conversation with everyone, and thank you so much for the invitation and my name You know we launched back in 2017 with the support from the Manhattan district attorney's office They.
And you know a large part of our model, as our name hub would suggest, is to provide these opportunities through a network of community organizations Dominican women's Development, Center, northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation people's theater project, Police, Athletic League and the Y up in Inwood All right so welcome all, and thank you guys for participating in for joining us in this very important discussion.
You know that many students and families had emotional health and learning challenges even before coronavirus, and now this copy, Many families were stable before community now facing financial - Insecurities family now need additional support, grief inside in isolation All this requires the recognizing teams and creating it and putting emphasis on providing support and resources for now social, emotional well-being, including mental health services.
The community has expressed many times that they see that there is a big difference when teachers provide life instruction over non-life instruction, and this remote learning is something that had never been done on this scale ever so we needed to create climate roles and support for innovation on pacing young-sun, our missteps, but that has been one challenge: finding that balance between life instruction and not life instruction the devices on the connectivity right now right now, these receipts have four hundred twelve devices listed as outstanding sixteen or been happy no reading ship, but we hope we have 255 devices now in process.
I think mr Ramirez had mentioned some of the critical issues, but in talking to teachers and looking at how it was affecting children, one of the things that the teachers expressed over and over again was the need of improvement of their own technical skills, especially when you consider that many of the staff are over 40 years old and are not as tech savvy as some of our younger teachers One of the things that the teachers asked over and over again in the different schools was that they would like ongoing professional development in this area.
They also asked for other support, because what happens in district 6, as you know, eighty-four percent of our community is second language learners and the Nine percent of them are new immigrants or people who have been in our communities for a short period of time, and the language issue became critical in terms of the activities and the lessons that the teachers were providing Although.
They feel very frustrated with the work at times and, as mr Ramirez had pointed out, there have been many issues and in the community, in terms of economics, the pandemic rode up a lot of survival needs, Our children need to have that support and they need to be ongoing.
We know you've been actively involved in Covid-19 19 response efforts, So, if you can give us a little bit of information as far as like how you have personally been involved, what that looks like what those duties look like and what are some of the initiatives that you and your organization I've taken to support the community We took a serious look at what services we were already providing and what services we could enhance to meet the needs of the community, and one of the things that we have done for decades now is to provide a food pantry.
They are immediately assigned to what we call a hub advocate, and so that is their one-on-one mentor, their champion that person that's connect to resources, provide emotional support, and so, as soon as we had to close our physical space, our main priority was making sure that every one of our members was reached out to you and to determine if they had any immediate needs So since then, we have been able to stay connected with almost 200 young people and we've even had some new members join our program via our enrollment virtual enrollment process.
, I, can't say just the last couple of months as a black woman in this country, but the trauma we've all experienced with the murders we've all had to witness Over and over again we are launching youth town halls, which will be starting in August for led by young people is both an opportunity for them to express how they're feeling about what's happening, but also, we hope, develop a Youth agenda that they want to present not just to this man but to the candidates who will be running for mayor We are working on designing that we are partnering with an organization called amplify which is part of CUNY to do youth, participatory action, research It would be some young people, partnering grad students and CUNY, to conduct research on how Colvin has affected their communities, particularly people in their communities, and have them develop a set of policy recommendations that put in it to the children's cabinet, which you know as part of its made up of commissioners of all agencies who in some way touched a lot of young people through Wayne homeless youth initiative.
You know that in the past couple years we've served 75,000 young people, I, don't know that we'll get size and scale again, but July is almost here, and so we do need a decision fairly soon if to be able to mobilize providers the thing that I will say that we were really focused on safety and a lot of job sites that we would usually go to, whether it was corporate or others were either teleworking.
Our schools are all promoting at least two workshops on parents to talk about how to handle crisis, and the type of conversation need to engage students, so they can understand what's going on around them, so they can face a and teaching parents, also certain skills, or they can learn how to teach the children as well.
This is a time in which, when we look at the problems that our community is having, as was mentioned by vine and Denise, and everyone who has spoken and mr Ramirez Kids cannot learn if they have stress or trauma in their lives, and we know that our community, as mr Ramirez had mentioned, had prior to the pandemic, stresses There has to be a comprehensive plan and practices put in place in every school in the city that requires social, emotionally emotional strategies to use on a daily basis and to integrate that into the child's learning In order.
As people have mentioned parents, our kids are disengaged, as Yvonne had mentioned, they're, disinterested unmotivated and now, on top of it all, they have this issue with what is happening in terms of justice, especially for our high school students, where parents continually say I, don't know what to do with them.
One of the other things that was mentioned before We have an opportunity to deal with the answer, the questions of justice and race discrimination through videos, activities available in the internet, promoting discussions providing factual information and in order to build a student's, self-awareness, build relationships, because if we do not do that- So happy that you have the summer program that is working on this, because we need to have it not only in summer programs , all right, listen, I'm, a social worker I focus on social, emotional learning, right Students are disengaged and how have they been addressed by your organization?
Now we prepare meals for them every day, but one of the other things we had to do was to make sure our guidance, counselor, our social worker and a support team was checking in with these families on a daily basis to ask them questions about how not just the academics, of course, we're checking on that Our things happening in your home, Our students got another pandemic on top of another pandemic, so they're dealing with multiple pandemics within their hearts, their minds and their homes We had to create a platform we had about 90 of parents, teachers and support people come together to talk about what was that racial impact and internalized racism that now they're taking one in order to deal with that The multiple pressures that are happening to our young people right now to think that they can comprehend academics on the level that we want them to is just it's not possible right now, without putting in a lot of antidotes without putting in a lot of mechanisms That's going to help the entire family During this pandemic?
I worry about us not getting the money We as a state from the federal government, because New York City alone is looking at 7 billion dollar cut, and at that point it won't matter be like this is going to be about hundreds of people being laid off that will further decimate communities from first responders to teachers, to you know other folks in city agencies and a lot of government jobs that provided a ladder to you know the middle class with folks.
Pitino was mentioning that one of the issues that we face right now with this new structure for teaching or learning is actually teachers saying that they need to increase their technologies savviness and now with less money to find organizations or consultant and can help you do that.
So much I'm hearing teacher cuts, I'm hearing cuts, this after-school programming and special Saturday program cut to AIDS, and you heating cuts across the board Assuming that we don't get extra funding Now, you have to be think about cut to teaching counseling trips technology after schools, Saturdays everything that you could think of that I to enhance the school life that the school experience for children will have the decline and increase in class size really big deal yes huge deal as I said, listen to people talking about what is needed now, I'm thinking precisely what we need Now. We have together with money that we're gonna, have less off mm It's gonna become a closed vicious cycle of lack of money versus needs in the community.
I had 22 partners in my building to provide for the needs of those children in the school The way the leadership has to look at and principles in school is to begin to say, I'm not going to stand for this Then we still have to work on policies and practices to make changes, but there are monies in testing monies that are being billions of dollars.
There has to be ongoing and I have to thank there for having this the first side of thinking of how important it is for a Unity's to get together and to talk and to unite as a group in helping the education and our youth Our community is resilient and I pray that everyone who is part of the community feels the same way and does the same thing.
What steps are you taking to open it up safely for your sensor, safety, so I mean we are obviously talking a lot about the resources that are needed in our community and first I would like to mention- In light of our current events and seeing how people, and especially our young people, have been rallying together to promote racial justice to promote systemic change.
We need families to be on Wi-Fi to get remote learning and remote access My two thoughts had to do with addressing the deal we mm-hmm finance hearing the mayor, One of the education reporters like at the Daily News to ask this question is a good way to get him on record about certain things and set up my first strategy and as I said you know, there are some funders like Robin, Hood and I have stepped in I'm, always a little too I.
Absolutely This is an issue, especially we're gonna, be online for another year and bringing the power of the city and the community to bear on whatever the spectrum Verizon, whatever so I think it's both it's worried about being able to mobilize corporations in time for something that's happening at the end of this month, and so, but we have to get money or bring this thing to bear on this negotiation and I know that a lot of folks are really concerned about the internet access, especially that guys.
Work may see the transitions that we're facing changes, and you know we just have to be very patient with ourselves, but with others, and also just a kind of like think about what how you know what the future will look like, because I think that that's ultimately, what we're tasked with as advocates for the community and as a system of support for times, would identify what needs are and try to make an argument for you know for access to resources to prove these needs right, and so with that being said, I know that, if a mention yesterday in our kinda ad-hoc beautiful about this panel of a button- I, had a very big concern for a family.
