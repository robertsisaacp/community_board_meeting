I wanted to thank Community Board 12 for hosting us tonight to share our plans to expand CitiBike into northern Manhattan.
All, okay- and one thing I want to note-- is that while this is getting set, up, the presentation and the draft map are both available online at our website at Nyc. Thank you again for joining us to talk about bike share in Washington, Heights and first I'll, just start off by going over the basics of bike share and the CitiBike program in New, York City, so bike share is a network of shared bicycles.
It includes the Bronx for the first time and goes deeper into Queens and Brooklyn to neighborhoods, like Elmhurst and Sunset park, and the program has seen incredible growth in the year since its launch in members and rides per day.
As the city grapples, you know, with the spread of Covid-19, D.O.T, is working closely with CitiBike to ensure that new yorkers have a safe way to get around town and Lyft, and the DOT are working together to ensure that there is an increase in cleaning efforts at depots and operation vehicles, as well as near high use, medical facilities and understanding that access to transportation.
As with our other expansions, we wanted to know where residents of Washington Heights wanted CitiBike stations, so we held a community board workshop to gather feedback on location preferences into and then.
We have the map that was presented at the CB12 workshop Is, where there was higher community preference for CitiBike stations, and we also in creating the draft plan, tried to eliminate sites that were unpopular or might be an issue for lyft operationally and those are shown in the in red on this map.
First I just wanted to reiterate some of the things that Jennifer mentioned at the beginning, that we will be installing in this community board in two phases, and so this summer we will be installing from 155Th Street to 184Th Street 30 stations and That's, really to create a contiguous service, area, acrosss upper Manhattan and the Bronx.
Sorry to 184Th, Street, and I also wanted to note that the draft plan presentation is available online at our website at New, York City, DOT, Gov, Slash bike share under the maps and plans tab for easier viewing.
Have, a station plan for the east side of Amsterdam Avenue, south of West 156Th Street, also on the sidewalk, but along the building line there moving west.
We have a station on the south side of West 157Th Street West of Edward Morgan Place, and that is a road bed station And then, as I'm sure, you're familiar there's a street improvement project along much of this area along Riverside, and so we will be coordinating two stations in this area following further coordination with community board and residents and other stakeholders for that project, and so moving north to Broadway.
We have a sidewalk station planned along the curb line: moving east to the south side of West 159Th Street West of Edgecombe Avenue.
This slide, a sidewalk stationed along the fence line planned for the north side of West 163Rd east of Riverside drive all right.
We have a station planned for the road bed on the east side of Amsterdam Avenue south of West, one second 172Nd street, and then final station on this map.
Is a sidewalk station planned for the curb line on the East side of Fort, Washington, Avenue, south of West 173Rd Street, and then now we're at the northern portion of the area.
Have a sidewalk station planned along the fence line on the east side of Amsterdam south of West 175Th Street moving West Road Bed station, planned for the east side of Wadsworth Avenue North of West.
Another sidewalk station planned on the east side of Audubon south of West 179Th. Moving to the park again.
Actually, the last one is on the east side of Cabrini Boulevard North of West 181St Street, So that's what those are the draft plan sites and so now we're available to take any questions on the CitiBike program or any sites in particular that you may want a little bit more elaboration.
Bikes at a higher rate up here, because of the disparity in the in the neighborhood in terms of height difference in elevation gain Then the question about the parking who's going to take that So the squares are the roadbed locations and the triangles are the sidewalk locations for the map.
The two stations for the area under you know with the street Riverside street improvement project there right and mobile.
There, are three bike stations that will be you know in the street or whatever you want to call them, and I presume they will remove parking spaces and there will be much anger about that.
That's then, a one- way street with all the changes that were approved so that station is planned to be along the bike lane on Saint Nicholas Avenue on the West side there, so it may be a little bit.
What mobile had mentioned is that the station would be installed in the road bed in the parking lane adjacent to the bike lane closer to 166Th Street, but our field staff did find, and we all know that.
And then, and what were the circumstances, because I think sometimes people feel like well If there was an issue like what's an example of what that's looked like and what were the circumstances So, as you know, mentioned in the presentation, any construction projects that come up that might impact the footprint of the station, whether it be on the sidewalk or the road bed.
The average station size would be approximately 25 docks acrosss this area of CB12 and that pretty much equates to, I think, approximately 65 to 70 feet, and that depends on whether or not there are utilities in the road to bridge or what not I do also want to say that Jim and Debbie and Omar we hear you that parking take is definitely a very serious issue.
, okay, I, do not know if I had some and then, as the system grows some stations, but the patterns for ridership changes, and so some things that might be at the northern portion of the service area.
If I can trust going back into a train system, anytime, soon, like literally anytime soon and as soon as we get called back into the office, CitiBike, is probably going to be the primary way that I actually come from home to work and back.
What's worked best absolutely this moment, because some people are going to then hear about the meeting and could not be you know, look at this, and so we will have Thank you very great.
Research and you know, folks- have really taken to creating and doing creative projects with the data that's available on the citibike website and in terms of the exact parking take acrosss the board when we do come to transportation committees to present on our draft plans.
Our final, you know, surveys are not yet complete, that's particularly the case now because of Covid-19, and we do not have you know our field staff out, completing those formal surveys just yet, You know we start this outreach process with our draft plan presentation to the board, and then we have lift our partners move forward with you know confirming if all of these sites you know work , I, think it was 18 feet per parking.
You know mature people who might not have credit cards, and they might be left out so little bit concerned about how you might be addressing that issue for stability purposes, where some of the members of our residents might not have access to a credit.
This is something that comes up constantly, so I'll make sure to make a point that you know: again: Community, board 12 in Manhattan had an issue or had a concern with unbanked access to Citibank for those who are not unbanked.
I. Think I'm just concerned that, if you have this issue all times that we're going to be adding up to be one of those I want to make sure that my people have full access to this price, because you know what we're going to suffer.
First thing: is: there are only four stations around the hospital, which means that there's a hundred bikes for the hospital- All you have to do is to walk to the corner of 165Th Street and Fort Washington, where the people who work at the hospital leave their bikes and they leave almost 60 bikes there right now You need to actually put it on Fort, Washington Avenue and on Haven Avenue, where the people are that's.
I think you really need to reassess the parking going to the center of the street, so they can do the CitiBikes along the sidewalk, as I suggested, and the final one is the 166Th Street and St Nicholas Station, that's in a landmark block, it's by the library, put it in front of the library which is on the street, and I.
My question is the selection of the plant CitiBike station locations going to be complemented with a decisional bicycle infrastructure upgrades such as protected bike lanes, because I feel, like infrastructure, also comes in hand with the expansion of the system, because you're basically going to make it safer for so many other people to use bicycles as a form of transportation and actually achieve better utilization of your system as well.
But when we come back to the community board with the northern half we're going to have another we're going to have another presentation, just like this and another period that people can comment on those northern half stations.
Can you know we can take a look at that because they, the bikes, will go against the little park between, but it's called in, Catania Payan, where the boss number six comes through from Broadway, make a left.
We have to consider elderly people in our community that can not afford not, for they can not use bikes to you know as a means: transportation.
Thank, you all for the time and an update, really appreciated very concerned about some of the bosses in the Washington Heights area, particularly the 181St, Street, San, Nicolas and Rowan, where on the bus stops, it's actually not accessible for any riders because of the back door as you use.
That's going to go through our response back to DOT on that presentation, and then third, I should actually, I should say, Just the Riverside drive end of edward Morgan was There was work that this committee was part of for that sort of concluded that area Then it sort of relates to what we'll talk about in the September meeting.
You come back to us for like a little sub moment of considering the CitiBike stations that we did not get to see that are in the Riverside area?
