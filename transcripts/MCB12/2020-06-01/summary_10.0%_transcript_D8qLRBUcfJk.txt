Community uprising and community togetherness I wanted to thank community board 12 for hosting us tonight to share our plans to expand city bike into northern Manhattan Thank you to all of our elected officials, the bro president's office, councilmember rodriguez's office, senator jackson and all of your elected staff for your continued support and partnership and feedback on all of the DOT projects.
So, that's very exciting and my colleagues at DOT have also been hard at work with remote setups at home As. Many of you are also teleworking to come up with a network plan that will provide residents in cv12 with access to this safe, healthy and affordable option of bike share and we're focusing our presentation tonight on the southern portion of the board from 155th street to 184th street.
Lyft also has community grant program that distributes grant money to non-profits and other community-based organizations that can be used to fund programming or events or activities that help spread awareness and encourage ridership As the city grapples, you know, with the spread of covert 19 dot is working closely with city bike to ensure that new yorkers have a safe way to get around town and lyft, and the DOT are working together to ensure that there is an increase in cleaning efforts at depots and operation vehicles, as well as near high use, medical facilities and understanding that access to transportation.
We aim to have a station approximately every three to four north and south blocks and every major crosstown blocks with larger stations, near transit hubs or key destinations, so public outreach and along with our technical siding criteria and the network considerations, help determine where stations can be placed and some of the siting criteria we take into consideration: hydrants utilities, ada accessibility, among other factors, So. As with our other expansions, we wanted to know where residents of washington heights wanted city bike stations, so we held a community board workshop to gather feedback on location preferences into and then, if presidents weren't able to make that we also held three pop-up outreach workshops throughout the neighborhood at various community facilities, and there was also an online feedback map where people could drop pins.
We also engaged with major stakeholders like hospitals and other city agencies, to receive additional input so shown here is where there was higher community preference for city bike stations, and we also in creating the draft plan, tried to eliminate sites that were unpopular or might be an issue for lyft operationally and those are shown in the in red on this map.
But first I just wanted to reiterate some of the things that jennifer mentioned at the beginning, that we will be installing in this community board in two phases, and so this summer we will be installing from 155th street to 184th street 30 stations and that's really to create a contiguous service area across upper Manhattan and the Bronx We will be moving to the Bronx after washington heights and then coming back to fill out the rest of the community board next spring and then we'll create and release the final plan and from and that at that point, lyft will conduct door-to-door notifications to adjacent property owners to inform them, inform them of station installations and record any concerns that might come up and even after stations are installed, we will continue to monitor and take feedback Now we will move on to the last portion of the presentation and we will review the draft plan sites and, as mentioned previously, this first phase of installation will be from 155th street.
Sorry to 184th street and I also wanted to note that the draft plan presentation is available online at our website at new york city, DOT, gov, slash bike share under the maps and plans tab for easier viewing.
We have a sidewalk station Have a station plan for the east side of amsterdam, avenue south of west 156th street also on the sidewalk, but along the building line there moving west, we have a station on the south side of west 157th street west of edward morgan place, and that is a road bed station there's a street improvement project along much of this area along riverside, and so we will be coordinating two stations in this area following further coordination with community board and residents and other stakeholders for that project, and so moving north to broadway On. The east side of broadway south of west 160th street We have a sidewalk station planned along the curb line: moving east to the south side of west 159th street west of edgecombe avenue.
We have a station planned for the road bed on the east side of amsterdam, avenue south of west one second 172nd street and then final station on this map is a sidewalk station planned for the curb line on the east side of fort washington, avenue south of west 173rd street and then now we're at the northern portion of the area.
Actually, the last one is on the east side of cabrini boulevard north of west 181st street, and so that's what those are the draft plan sites and so now we're available to take any questions on the city bike program or any sites in particular that you may want a little bit more elaboration.
The majority of them are planned for the sidewalk and in spaces that do not remove parking, because that was absolutely something that you know : It's a priority and very important to the community board, and so we just wanted to make sure that we balanced your needs as well as the needs to create you know a meaningful network of bike share stations , We have two or two people that need to be promoted, kiana diaz promoted to panelists, as well as one of the phone numbers.
People furious In that section around mitchell park You know what I'm saying like that station is presuming that that's then a one-way street with all the changes that were approved so that station is planned to be along the bike lane on saint nicholas avenue on the west side, there So it may be a little bit unfamiliar I, know, I, think debbie.
No, and on that block, there's Actually So it's adding like 20 parking spot, whatever So this is contemplated for the new world of that block right, not the old world and then we'll open it up to the other board and then and what were the circumstances, because I think sometimes people feel like well So, as you know mentioned in the presentation, any construction projects that come up that might impact the footprint of the station, whether it be on the sidewalk or the road bed, We coordinate to relocate the station for that construction and in most cases the station does go back to the plant or sorry to the permanent location location of where it started.
How many parking spaces is 25, docks?, as mobile said right, the average station size would be approximately 25 docks across this area of cb12 and that pretty much equates to I think approximately 65 to 70 feet, and that depends on whether or not there are utilities in the road to bridge or what not You know if there aren't any utilities on the ground that we need to quote-unquote bridge I do also want to say that jim and debbie and omar, we hear you that parking take is definitely a very serious issue across the district and we tried very hard to balance parking take and you know utilize the available and feasible sidewalk spaces that we did identify but parking removal here for city bike expansion into cb12 It, you know, can't be avoided, and so we really tried where we could to find feasible sites that didn't remove parking and where we can, we can look to So. Let's say you described a situation where something didn't work out and you needed to move it.
I've been actually a city bike member since 2013, since this thing first launched and If I can trust going back into a train system anytime, soon, like literally anytime soon and as soon as we get called back into the office city bike is probably going to be the primary way that I actually come from home to work and back So. This is coming at a good time, considering that all the issues that we're having with the mta the unknown, recovered and kind of trying to avoid being put into a situation where we're constantly being established into an environment and being shepherd downtown, You, know outside and not have to do public transportation in a different way.
You, know already started a lot of these efforts to sanitize the bikes more frequently and clean high contact areas more frequently, So. Let's take the health issue because I think that applies to that applies to everything and then, when we might be able to get more specificity on the parking spot, loss and deb?, and you can, you know, feel free to add a little bit more color afterwards to respond to data and usage statistics.
I also noticed in 162nd street and broadway You need to be a little more specific when that comes out to the people in that area and lyle I think you really need to reassess the parking going to the center of the street, so they can do the city bikes along the sidewalk, as I suggested, and the final one is the 166th street and st nicholas station That's in a landmark block.
It's by the library, put it in front of the library which is on the street My question is the selection of the plant city bike station locations gonna be complemented with a decisional bicycle infrastructure upgrades such as protected bike lanes, because I feel like infrastructure, also comes in hand with the expansion of the system, because you're basically going to make it safer for so many other people to use bicycles as a form of transportation and actually achieve better utilization of your system as well.
But when we come back to the community board with the northern half we're going to have another we're going to have another presentation, just like this and another period that people can comment on those northern half stations, how's the demand for city bikes.
Where all that comes out, then we'll have to have like a separate process to understand what your proposal is for that area, because we don't know what your proposal is That's going to go through our response back to DOT on that presentation, and then third I should actually I should say Just the riverside drive end of edward morgan was, There was work that this committee was part of for that sort of concluded.
and I will consolidate it if they have comments related to the middle drive issue Will, you come back to us for like a little sub moment of considering the city bike stations that we didn't get to see that are in the riverside area?
