I wanted to thank community board 12 for hosting us tonight to share our plans to expand city bike into northern Manhattan.
As the city grapples, you know, with the spread of covert 19, D.O.T is working closely with city bike to ensure that new yorkers have a safe way to get around town and lyft, and the DOT are working together to ensure that there is an increase in cleaning efforts at depots and operation vehicles, as well as near high use, medical facilities and understanding that access to transportation.
We wanted to know where residents of washington heights wanted city bike stations, so we held a community board workshop to gather feedback on location preferences into and then.
We, also engaged with major stakeholders, like hospitals and other city agencies, to receive additional input so shown here, Is where there was higher community preference for city bike stations, and we also in creating the draft plan, tried to eliminate sites that were unpopular or might be an issue for lyft operationally and those are shown in the in red on this map.
First I just wanted to reiterate some of the things that jennifer mentioned at the beginning, that we will be installing in this community board in two phases, and so this summer we will be installing from 155th street to 184th street 30 stations And That's really to create a contiguous service area across upper Manhattan and the Bronx.
This first phase of installation will be from 155th street sorry to 184th, street, and I also wanted to note that the draft plan presentation is available online at our website at new york, city, DOT, gov, slash bike share under the maps and plans tab for easier viewing.
So we have a station plan for the west side of saint nicholas avenue, south of 157th street, and then in that it will be a sidewalk station along the curb line.
Have, a station plan for the east side of amsterdam, avenue south of west 156th street, also on the sidewalk, but along the building line there moving west.
We have a station on the south side of west 157th street west of edward morgan place and that is a road bed station And then, as I'm sure, you're familiar there's a street improvement project along much of this area along riverside, So we will be coordinating two stations in this area following further coordination with community board and residents and other stakeholders for that project, and so moving north to broadway.
We, have a sidewalk station planned along the curb line: moving east to the south side of west 159th street west of edgecombe avenue.
This slide, a sidewalk stationed along the fence line planned for the north side of west 163rd east of riverside drive all right.
We have a station planned for the road bed on the east side of amsterdam, avenue south of west one second 172nd street and then final station on this map.
Is a sidewalk station planned for the curb line on the east side of fort washington, avenue south of west 173rd street and then now we're at the northern portion of the area.
South of west 175th street moving west road bed station planned for the east side of wadsworth avenue north of west.
Actually, the last one is on the east side of cabrini boulevard north of west 181st, street, So that's what those are the draft plan sites and so now we're available to take any questions on the city bike program or any sites in particular that you may want a little bit more elaboration.
That'd be one of the high priorities that they continue to replenish e-bikes at a higher rate up here, because of the disparity in the in the neighborhood in terms of height difference in elevation gain Then the question about the parking who's going to take that So the squares are the roadbed locations and the triangles are the sidewalk locations for the map.
The two stations for the area under you know, with the street riverside street improvement project there right and mobile.
The majority of them are planned for the sidewalk and in spaces that do not remove parking, because that was absolutely something that you know.
You know in the street or whatever you want to call them, and I presume they will remove parking spaces, and there will be much anger about that.
Do, you know what I'm saying like that station is presuming that that's then a one-way street with all the changes that were approved so that station is planned to be along the bike lane on saint nicholas avenue on the west side, there.
What mobile had mentioned is that the station would be installed in the road bed in the parking lane adjacent to the bike lane closer to 166th street, but our field staff did find, and we all know that.
So if there was an issue like what's an example of what that's looked like and what were the circumstances So, as you know, mentioned in the presentation, any construction projects that come up that might impact the footprint of the station, whether it be on the sidewalk or the road bed.
The average station size would be approximately 25 docks across this area of cb12 and that pretty much equates to, I think, approximately 65 to 70 feet, and that depends on whether or not there are utilities in the road to bridge or what not I do also want to say that jim and debbie and omar, we hear you that parking take is definitely a very serious issue across the district and we tried very hard to balance parking.
You know utilize the available and feasible sidewalk spaces that we did identify but parking removal here for city bike expansion into cb12.
,, okay, I, don't know if I had some and then as the system grows some stations, but the patterns for ridership changes, and so some things that might be at the northern portion of the service area.
City, bike is probably going to be the primary way that I actually come from home to work and back.
Research and you know, folks- have really taken to creating and doing creative projects with the data that's available on the citibike website and in terms of the exact parking take across the board when we do come to transportation committees to present on our draft plans.
That's, particularly the case now because of Covid-19, and In a typical case you know we start this outreach process with our draft plan presentation to the board, and then we have lift our partners move forward with you know confirming if all of these sites you know work, I, think it was 18 feet per parking.
This is something that comes up constantly, so I'll make sure to make a point that you know: again: community board 12 in Manhattan had an issue or had a concern with unbanked access to citibank, for those who aren't unbanked.
I. Think I'm just concerned that, if you have this issue all times that we're going to be adding up to be one of those I want to make sure that my people have full access to this price, because you know what we're going to suffer.
I think you really need to reassess the parking going to the center of the street, so they can do the city bikes along the sidewalk, as I suggested, and the final one is the 166th street and st nicholas station.
My question is the selection of the plant city bike station locations gonna be complemented with a decisional bicycle infrastructure upgrades such as protected bike lanes, because I feel, like infrastructure, also comes in hand with the expansion of the system, because you're basically going to make it safer for so many other people to use bicycles as a form of transportation and actually achieve better utilization of your system as well.
Approximately 75 of the households in cp 12, don't own a car and as one of those households, I would really like to see city bike stations located on the road bed actually, as opposed to on our already crowded sidewalks, where possible.
Commenting on both the southern and northern half, but when we come back to the community board with the northern half we're going to have another we're going to have another presentation, just like this and another period that people can comment on those northern half stations.
Can you know we can take a look at that because they, the bikes, will go against the little park between, but it's called in catania payan, where the boss number six comes through from broadway, make a left.
Thank, you all for the time and an update, really appreciated very concerned about some of the bosses in the washington heights area, particularly the 181st street san nicolas and rowan, where on the bus stops, it's actually not accessible for any riders because of the back door as you use.
You come back to us for like a little sub moment of considering the city bike stations that we didn't get to see that are in the riverside area?
You know for that last project that we had, but we can take a closer look if need be at that western portion by edward morgan, broadway 157, depending on how things go between now and September Maybe, our community will get together during the summer and hash this all out, and then we can have better more focused input to you all because, for instance, the city bikes could go across from next to pay and park.
