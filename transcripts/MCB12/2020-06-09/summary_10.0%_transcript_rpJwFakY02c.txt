And I believe we will be circulating petitions over the summer and having an update on that in the fall and moving that to a resolution and a recommendation to the City Council in time for their December Street Co naming bill I'm going to put a footnote to here to just ask Jennifer when she gives her report to give any updates on parks, usages, prohibition, suggestions, dog, runs, playgrounds, anticipated openings, any additional closings that kind of stuff You address that in your report, I was going to talk about parks, usage during curfew.
That curfew is over I, think that so far in terms of protests, demonstrations and rallies, I want to thank Chris and all of his colleagues at the 34th precinct who have done in the in the protests in which I've been a part in this community have done an extremely good job of working with the community And I other people may have had other experiences, but from what I have seen and heard the three four has done.
A good job working with the people of the three four That's the difference between being policed by a precinct where you know the officers They know you versus having a force of officers from other precincts who do not know the community just sort of come in and not really know who they're dealing with hold on a second sorry about that.
Gov, Slash, LGBTQ, Covid-19, I'm, sorry, Nyc. Gov, slash, LD, LGBTQ, DOT, COBIT, No Just, Covid-19 Someone, said I would love to hear Park speak, but please note that the amplified music without permit is so loud in Inwood, Hill Park at the moment that it is actually hard to hear you so not going to talk about this at this moment in the agenda.
I know that some person posted extensively in and around Inwood Hill Park a flyer about this committees plan to expand barbecuing in into one of two areas in Inwood, Hill Park, either the Indian Road lawn or one of the soccer fields which soccer field was not stipulated in the anonymous flyer.
We've got 74 participants, which is fantastic, but I do want to let people know that there is a zero point: That's not on the table.
If you could just very quickly I wanted to know, we want to know if there's going to be any park monitoring or forcement at Fort Tryon, the last few days, besides myself, seeing it, many people have seen mopeds, including the what is it called the rebel?
Sorry and then wanted to know about the dog rent opening, because people were curious and then, lastly, in case you have not realized all the downpours.
We get 12 to 15 thousand visitors, a year, which is not an insignificant number of people coming in to pray and or you know, figure out what they're doing so Just whenever there's something where there's an opportunity for us to collaborate with other organizations, we'd be glad to talk to people fantastic.
We've been also doing some workshop for kids and we are actually very proud to be participating at Uptown arts and culture group collaboration among with 14 other organizations uptown to create a summer camp, and it's going to feature music, dance , The words is very happy to be offering some drawing workshops, as well as Dad's music workshops in kachunk.
You know the issues that had so era, there's like 15 organizations and we're all taking like an hour to during the week to do something that people could sign up for espera, sign up their kids, and so The registration, I, hopefully, will be made available to your to the community Board to help us express that Noma has been taking the lead on that, so we all have the site.
I believe Jennifer has a couple of cultural announcements, so she's going to put those out Fantastic, okay, MS hapa, so on behalf of the New York City Parks Department and Lotus music and dance I wanted to.
Everybody know that this year's drums along the Hudson, our annual Native American and drumming and dancing from around the World festival that usually happens in Inwood Hill Park, is going to be virtual.
It's not happening in the Sacred Lands of Inwood Hill Park, but we're delighted to have connected with joy and so everybody tune in June, 20th We'll ask the community board to send out that link to everyone outstanding You can send the flyer and paola, if you can just be ready for that and to send it up, it's a wonderful event and But, not least, I'm, going to turn it over to Martin Collins to give the Noma report and just while he's speaking in addition to listening to his every word.
The Elizabeth loris Twitter, yes, Liz, we'll be in the house for our June 25th open studio, and you won't want to miss that a couple of programming notes about events coming up in the next couple of weeks, and you can see our website Noma NYC org , that's n, Om, a NYC org First is the uptown arts and culture summer.
First Street I just want to give you guys a few quick updates our summer on the Hudson programming series which operates throughout the park is working on bringing virtual programming to our audience right.
You, know a strange year for that, but we have gotten an outpouring of people who have been writing to us looking to help us take care of the park, like actually hundreds of people.
It's been challenging for the volunteer program staff like myself to kind of figure out how to get people started in the park safely and all of that.
You know we're working really hard to make sure that the city does not cut funding for the parks, as it's slated to do.
I. Believe it's looking at 60 million, plus of cuts right now, which would directly impact like more than 300 parks employees around the city who could lose their jobs.
Oh, great, okay, nutrition, and, of course, food, justice, okay Our mission is really to focus on food justice, and we've outlined these long term goals to increase the public land designated for food gardening in our community, which is one of the reasons this committee is so relevant.
We want to increase the amount of affordable and healthy food available in Washington- in wood, and also increase residents, awareness, knowledge and self- efficacy related to topics like urban gardening, nutrition, healthy eating and food justice issues affecting our community.
So, instead of following the months, we followed the seasons and during the harvesting season, of course, our primary focus is on gardening and on the garden space, and this is the space where we can meet with people from the neighborhood from the community through having these weekly open garden hours, where community members can join us and when they do, we would help them, show them, Basics, gardening skills and also.
I believe these are from last summer, and the next pictures I think the is also children, obviously with in the beds- Initial event here is on the side and the numbers of people who are joining or participating are increasing.
The idea behind this at the beginning of this year was to create some sort of a coalition of groups from the both neighborhoods who are seeking the same goal of trying to establish more community gardening, spaces, acrosss, the neighborhood, whether tied to organizations or open to the public.
In order to weather this crisis, And I think we have one more slide if we can move on to that, and what do we ask from community Ward 12, and we would appreciate any support to help us find space that could be suited for egg Garden could be associated with an institution or free unused public areas.
We are also seeking partnership with interested organizations who work with families in the Washington, Heights and Inwood area, and, of course, if Community Board, 12 can put us in touch with them or to help us to get in touch with people.
We would ask help in advocating for the usage of the funds that were allocated for creating a community garden in the Highbridge Park.
We are aware that this is not going to happen in the height built Highbridge Park, but we would like the community boards help for advocating for us or for organizations acrosss.
The neighborhood, to use these funds allocated for community gardening for in Highbridge Park to be used elsewhere for a similar purpose to create community gardening spaces, and that would be, of course, greatly appreciated in any sort of help that might come in that way.
Well right now everything has moved online, unfortunately, because all of our events require people to be in close proximity, because the garden beds are not that large and, as you have seen from the pictures that was not going to be an option given the circumstances, so everything until further notice until we'll see what happens, is online right.
Were we so actually, I would like to pause on emotion, Moving on sorry, so sure I, think parks through our green thumb program is very supportive and scaffolds organizations that are looking to do this on existing green thumb, garden, sites.
When we were looking at sites, you know first, we had to look at what was it Mapped park lands because of the restricted hours aspect of a community garden and people having to be members to participate, except when there's a public program, so we have one site in the entire sector: It has a fence.
One of the spots mentioned by Jennifer was somewhere on the George Washington campus You know there is a community group that has gotten access from the do- E for that gated area If something were to happen in a green thumb, way, we'd want to make sure that both groups collaborated, Get to this dispatch with this item of business, so that we can move the agenda.
Yes, okay, I just wanted to know if any thought had been given to the possibility of using vertical farms that could be either outdoor or indoor I've seen some really good work being done with that, like, for instance, in the Microsoft facility on 42Nd Street.
It sounds like there's broad consensus for supporting urban gardening for putting forward a motion calling on you know the board and the Parks Department, and the relevant community based organizations specifically washing eighths in wood, food Council on possibly Maybe Anastacio and her and the Riverside parks Conservancy.
All the various parks based organizations working together to identify possible areas for urban gardening looping in Board of Education, the possible school site.
Looking at you, know, whatever the sites may be to try and do more of this and including you know , So- does that kind of hit all the did all the things in the Manhattan borough president's office, because she's, clear Well, it would be going among other people to her.
And I would say, especially considering the fact that the two areas that the food transfer identified are not usable, right, daddy, need soil, mitigation, there's a whole bunch that goes into this, but Now, but I think passing a resolution saying you know we really support this in theory.
That totally goes I'm, sorry that that's totally baked into the conversation we're always when we say that we support something Further RESOLVED is, and we call on the people with money in this to like London , I will be drafting a resolution and sending it around So I always forget something and everybody helps me do even better work.
We are coming back into permitting public art again, but Noma, and the Fort Tryon Park trust, assisted in sharing the open call with uptown artists.
It will go on just because we have not had a site visit yet due to social distancing, but we will meet there to find a location that won't impede regular news of that area of the park and in a place that you know gives both the park and the artwork justice.
The plan is to feature it as part, the Battle of Fort Washington, and you know we hire a woman channel or to be Margaret Corbin at that reenacting festival each year, and this will happily be incorporated to work, and we want the four train trust we'll invite Zach, along with the parks Creme, to give a artists, talk and try to have some sort of reception.
We move to Jennifer's Parks report and I know that a lot of people had questions that they were throwing up into the chat and just know that all of the panelists are able to monitor that including Jennifer.
We have a budget cuts, allowing we've already programmed some state of good repair capital funding for pathways and Inlet$ 800,000, so that will advance that will help some of our more problematic pathway areas where we need to do more plantings, where we have drainage issues and surface issues, because the water scours the paths and as Jennifer Bristol mentioned earlier.
We purchased fencing, we're working with the stewardship division and Inwood sprouts, a community group, as well as with our Natural Area volunteers in the parks, Departments natural areas group to come up with a comprehensive way to restore that Marsh regeneration, area.
Here's the thing I do not think that a resolution calling on the parks Department to reopen the dog runs and to figure out how to do that safely is actually the best way to go, because that's a little too slow a resolution would be.
That's a reason for the increase in the police officers in the park, but we've also had an increase in who want fog and, as you all know, she's, seen in the news.
It was regarding potential because my concern is, if somebody who works with about five hundred kids in the summer, right, what it like the Parks Department, has to Steve is here, like you have to take ownership of what are these kids going to do check outside in a block you know, Like, there has to be something that work together with the nonprofit's figure, something out, but these parts have to be open to be able to provide services to these kids, Like.
I just want to point out there's a lot of chat going on about a current condition, as we speak with respect to a lot of amplified sound up in Inwood Hill Park.
Steve, if Steve, if you could take over well I, just want to add that there is an area in Fort, Washington Park, which is not under Jennifer's jurisdiction, where we allow barbecuing north of 150 history going up towards the soccer and baseball fields going up towards the Discovery playground.
Look like I have seen a huge increase in the number of people using the park, People, who bring full backpacks thinking.
It's, really important that we find some answers regarding reopening the parks, a lot of people cook, things that are actually deadly to dogs, not just dangerous or annoying, but deadly.
We wanted open, but there needs to be something because people will Just I mean the park is Just.
I'm, a dog owner I'm, the only dog owner like I'm I, I live by Inwood, Hill Park It's the first Community board meeting I've been to in years: there's an impact on quality of life.
When there's a lot of people barbecuing in the park, but I just think there are things we should keep in mind.
The part belongs to all of us a lot of people, love barbecuing in the park with their friends and family, and we have to support one another and if it were on the table, I would support an expansion, BBQ area and that's all I wanted to say.
There's garbage live charcoal, but the loud music, and what happens is that it invites people come in with their cars and they double Park and they block traffic.
You know for early Monday morning or things like that, even though we're not supposed to gather what have you because I think as a community in word is very special and we want to be our nature.
It's I live in Inwood around Columbia City area, And, I'm, working from home right now, And I've been working from home for past three months , I love going to the parks and lately what I've seen is, unfortunately, a situation where every Monday, when I am actually going to park, I, see a lot of garbage strewn around I, see the garbage being flown into the river into the peninsula.
As I said, people want to clean the park.
We have a 24/7 communications, a number which may actually provide a more rapid response in certain situations depending upon the hour of the day, and people may want to make note of that.
So I think that if there's a community need, especially given that we're in a time of Kovac when we should be social, distancing and granted, the barbecuing areas are not yet open, but we're going to be moving in that direction, and so I guess.
Can you know, help collect trash like the park?
Guess my hope was to bring this up to add it to the agenda and then have us all as a community kind of come together and discuss what our feelings are, so that people can enjoy the barbecuing areas because it tends to be very crowded and I apologize.
A year ago, we have people who are just going about their daily lives, they're, trying to social distance they're, trying to work from home They're trying to make maintain their lives through this crisis.
We work from home and we love this community, but we have our parks system and we need New York City to invest in the people who actually stayed in New York, City, And, it's not just about the trash pickups.
The part we had an overwhelming amount of people come to our basketball games, so we bought extra receptacles during the summer to be able to create a system where we thought the park is not trash stuff that we're done right.
I would like to see some signage in the lawn like little lawn signs temporarily to let people know that might be more visible to where the noise is coming from And then I would love to see something organized like community service hours to students that might be able to volunteer in the parks to pick up trash on and volunteer that way, something for their resume.
I live in this community for 54 years in Washington, Heights in English, so I know all these people, I know.
We can all use the park, then 20,000 people can you support a year or 10,000, because people do not know I , Some places them want to change to the park.
I mean like barbecues that people held in the park.
We going to put forth a reso in support of things related to budget and also potentially barbecue areas or The. So the reason why I really wanted to have this conversation and thank you for reminding that I think what's helpful, is to have these really robust conversations that feel in some way do not really go anywhere because there's no reso on it, but because we've had this very long, very detailed, very representative of multiple perspectives, conversation.
You know, as it relates to the budget, that we're going to do Jennifer's, even their staff and it'll help us with that and look into you know how much things cost Liz I, do not think some people know who Rod Serling, I.
Think I can also say that I think I can also say that once our new budget is in place and once we know what the guidelines are going to be for social distancing and allowing gatherings and Parks, the Parks Department will review the barbecue situation.
