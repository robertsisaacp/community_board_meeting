Second, I just want to change my background view to one of our beautiful parks instead of Fenway, because Fenway is not within community board, I'd like to begin with a moment of silence, not only you know, just to honor the upheaval and oppressed that has been happening in our community in our city, all over our country and, frankly, all over the world and for many reasons, they're sad, although I personally am optimistic, Well, that's another conversation, but I would like to remember George Floyd, who was laid to rest today on an Audrey Brianna, Taylor Maurice, Gordon, It's, particularly important in this month of pride, to recall that homophobia and transphobia overwhelmingly affects people of color and I.
Thank the business owners who have graciously allowed and encouraged their boarded up business windows to be used in this way and I believe we will be circulating petitions over the summer and having an update on that in the fall and moving that to a resolution and a recommendation to the City Council in time for their December Street Co naming bill I'm going to put a footnote to here to just ask Jennifer when she gives her report to give any updates on parks, usages prohibition, suggestions, dog, runs, playgrounds, anticipated openings, any additional closings that kind of stuff You address that in your report, I was going to talk about parks, usage during curfew.
Don't have to talk about that, because that curfew is over I, think that so far in terms of protests, demonstrations and rallies I want to thank Chris and all of his colleagues at the 34th precinct who have done in the in the protests in which I've been a part in this community have done an extremely good job of working with the community and I other people may have had other experiences, but from what I have seen and heard, the three four has done: A good job working with the people of the three four, and they know you versus having a force of officers from other precincts who do not know the community just sort of come in and not really know who they're dealing with hold on a second sorry about that.
So that's all of that actually show of hands up body language smiles thumbs up, does July 14th work for you, committee, members, okay, so we'll assume it'll be scheduled again, we don't need a quorum because we can't conduct business but I think it's a good opportunity to check in with each other about all things, parks and arts.
Many different city agencies in the mayor's office put together a website specifically for the response to Covid-19 in the LGBTQ community just Covid-19 : Someone said I would love to hear Park speak, but please note that the amplified music without permit is so loud in Inwood, Hill Park at the moment that it is actually hard to hear you so not going to talk about this at this moment in the agenda.
The non-park The people in the park that do not use, masks or social distance are usually in the late afternoon to the evening, may be handing out mass later on in the day, I'm sorry and then wanted to know about the dog rent opening, because people were curious and then lastly This is the part of the agenda where different organizations, cultural and Parks organizations give a report on what their organizations are doing.
I would hate for people to be like fuming about a misimpression, so I want to just be really clear, and then we will have the discussion in its time in the agenda, but thank you so with that Shilo Europe hi Schuyler from the morris-jumel mansion here We are continuing our virtual programming this summer and we are launching virtual con Edison family day, starting on Saturday We have a bilingual educator that is going to be instructing families on how to make summer planters for their garden or windows Additionally.
Today, nice I'm, gonna, unmute, you and just ask you: Are you speaking on behalf of arts, of a cultural institution in the neighborhood, or are you asking a general question, perhaps related to barbecuing no Yeah, so we have registration going for our summer workshops This summer, one is about like dopey, kids will be drawing creating little fairy houses and working on poetry as well called poetry in miniature Also, a songwriting class called your song and our last new class is called express yourself and in it kids will be kind of exploring different facets of identity, which we feel is very much needed.
Barge She was elected Chancellor to the Academy of American poets, and then last year she became the first Native American to hold the honor, the United States poet laureate and we'll ask the community board to send out that link to everyone outstanding but not least, I'm gonna turn it over to Martin Collins to give the noma report and just while he's speaking in addition to listening to his every word, if there's anybody from a parks or cultural organization that I missed and who would like to give a one or two minute presentation.
Good evening, everybody, northern Manhattan, Arts Alliance, the 2020 uptown arts stroll is a virtual online art stroll this year and each Thursday evening at 7:30 We feature a different uptown artist and that will continue through July 30th This Thursday at 7:30 for artist, illustrator, Jose, Tina Hernandez, who will show us her artwork on zoom and Facebook live Twitter, yes, Liz we'll be in the house for our June 25th open studio, and you won't want to miss that a couple of programming notes about events coming up in the next couple of weeks, and you can see our website Noma NYC org , that's n, om, a NYC org first is the uptown arts and culture summer.
He also is very passionate around altars between the involvement, in addition to his role on the steering committee, he volunteers as a mentor for students at PS 204 and a science communicator for the Greater New York City chapter of Society for Neuroscience, some sort of outranked in terms of degrees We're really grateful for this opportunity to present our work and talk about the support that we're looking for from the committee It says the host disabled attendee screen sharing We have to give you that give me one second if I, let her give her report on Washington on Fort Washington, Park it'll just be a minute I just want to give you guys a few quick updates our summer on the Hudson programming series which operates throughout the park is working on bringing virtual programming to our audience right now.
We really only have health and wellness classes, some yoga and Pilates, and things like that happening on zoom' for June That does operate a little bit further south, that's at one O third, but we do have kids coming from all across the city, so it may apply to some families in the neighborhood Our volunteer program also, it's been You, know a strange year for that, but we have gotten an outpouring of people who have been writing to us looking to help us take care of the park, like actually hundreds of people It's been challenging for the volunteer program staff like myself to kind of figure out how to get people started in the park safely, and all of that, so that's in the works.
Right now you know we're working really hard to make sure that the city doesn't cut funding for the parks, as it's slated to do, I believe it's looking at 60 million plus of cuts right now, which would directly impact like more than 300 parks employees around the city who could lose their jobs We have a petition that we're circulating, Justino organization, email, I'm, sorry, Liz I was writing an organization in the email one more time Do. You want to start just within our mission, while I open that up?
Expanding our presence in the garden Now our year is divided into two, which is the harvesting season and the winter season So. Instead of following the months we followed the seasons and during the harvesting season, of course, our primary focus is on gardening and on the garden space, and this is the space where we can meet with people from the neighborhood from the community through having these weekly open garden hours, where community members can join us and when they do, we would help them show them, basics, gardening skills and also, if there is anything to be harvested, they can obviously harvest with us and take home some of the fresh produce to their homes.
Of course we had one primary goal in mind and that was to expand gardening space or at least take steps to expand gardening space in Washington Heights and inward neighborhoods Now. To this end, we have reached out to other neighborhood groups and other community organizations throughout the neighborhoods We reached out to Isabella Center for elderly in order to create a gardening space, and they were very positive and we started working together , We reached out to other people seeking in gardening space, small group or small community organizations such as papaya garden, We, have connections to ring garden, obviously to Sally and Friends of Inwood Hill Park The idea behind this at the beginning of this year was to create some sort of a coalition of groups from the both neighborhoods who are seeking the same goal of trying to establish more community gardening spaces across the neighborhood, whether tied to organizations or open to the public We. All of these organizations have something in common but of course, as with everything else, decor with 19 crises have put things to hold and has forced us to somewhat changed our project for the 2020.
Care of us would be ready for the community to enjoy and to harvest and to learn about The reason that we are trying to, of course, and more focus on this is that many grant funding review process have been paused or been delayed due to covert 19 That, of course, makes our fundraising campaign even more vital and more important for us in order to weather this crisis and I think we have one more slide if we can move on to that, and what do we ask from community Ward 12, and we would appreciate any support to help us find space that could be suited for egg garden could be associated with an institution or free unused public areas.
We are also seeking partnership with interested organizations who work with families in the Washington, Heights and Inwood area, and, of course, if Community Board 12 can put us in touch with them or to help us to get in touch with people Connecting to funding opportunities is would also be greatly appreciated, given especially the times that, due to covert crisis, that a lot of funding opportunities are quite limited and they are on hold Finally, we would ask help in advocating for the usage of the funds that were allocated for creating a community garden in the Highbridge Park This was a part of the approach participatory budget project in 2015 We are aware that this is not going to happen in the height built Highbridge Park, but we would like the community boards help for advocating for us or for organizations across the neighborhood to use these funds allocated for community gardening for in Highbridge Park to be used elsewhere for a similar purpose to create community gardening spaces, and that would be, of course, greatly appreciated in any sort of help that might come in that way.
So it's not really open to the public but of course related with the organization The big sloping open area that is a cross that is on Dyckman Street, that is across from the across from the Manhattan storage There, is a big sloping area there Everything has moved online, unfortunately, because all of our events require people to be in close proximity, because the garden beds are not that large and, as you have seen from the pictures that was not going to be an option given the circumstances, so everything until further notice until we'll see what happens, is online right now, Unfortunately, yes, the New, York restoration project sets the rules for that garden where we have right now, So. Even if we wanted to implement social distancing guidelines and implement some sort of activity there we're not permitted to access the garden right.
I would like to pause on emotion, Moving on sorry, so sure I, think parks through our green thumb program is very supportive and scaffolds organizations that are looking to do this on existing green thumb, garden sites.
You also have the issue of being able to control that soil contamination right now, Parks doesn't allow any edibles to be grown on open, You, know completely unrestricted access areas, cuz of the soil When, the Department of Health, looked at the community gardens Unfortunately each day of construction dumping.
We have people disposing of their pets frequently, and we don't in many areas we don't have gates, so the risk We can't protect people against that risk of guarantee and clean soil mapped park lands because of the restricted hours aspect of a community garden and people having to be members to participate, except when there's a public program, so we have one site in the entire sector : It has a fence We felt like that, could be the side that the green thumb program could issue a request for proposals for someone to operate.
Let's take some of an active marina where we might need to bring boats onto the land or repairing a boat and put a community garden no provision with major community at a marina Back to your resolution As, you know you know there is a community group that has gotten access from the do-e for that gated area and they have been doing a lot of the stewardship and the cleaning there so that, if something were to happen in a green thumb way, we'd want to make sure that both groups collaborated With this item of business, so that we can move the agenda.
It sounds like there's broad consensus for supporting urban gardening for putting forward a motion calling on you know the board and the parks department and the relevant community based organizations, specifically washing eighths in wood, All the various parks based organizations working together to identify possible areas for urban gardening looping in Board of Education, the possible school site Looking at you know, whatever the sites may be to try and do more of this and including you know, All the things in the Manhattan borough president's office because she's clear well, it would be going among other people to her So, yes, obviously AGA access and I would say, especially considering the fact that the two areas that the food transfer identified are not usable right, daddy need soil mitigation, there's a whole bunch that goes into this, but I think the next step and again I Don't think we need to solve all the problems now, but I think passing a resolution saying you know.
He would be not voting due to conflict anyway, good point, so all right with With that we've got presentation on proposed temporary art installation in Fort, Tryon Park, I Elizabeth, here I can share my actually says: I need screen, sharing ability, Also I, don't know you can see if the artist is here.
It will go on just because we haven't had a site visit yet due to social distancing, but we will meet there to find a location that won't impede regular news of that area of the park and in a place that you know gives both the park and the artwork justice and I don't know if zach wants to just share some information about the artwork and the inspiration or about his work as an artist but there's another like additional detail that in the 1920s, the League of Women, Voters or the daughters of the revolution, sorry push to have Margaret Corbin recognize that she was the first woman to fight for the US military.
In the back for the conversation about the urban gardening Okay, then I will not record your vote on that, but Richard almond actually was here for that discussion and he votes yes, If you could just note that nobles not Jennifer, do you need you don't need a resolution and I hope that we're able to I don't know have public gatherings at that point and that we're able to incorporate this wonderful piece of art into whatever is the observance of the Battle of Fort Washington, It is site-specific in the best possible way.
Here's the thing: I, don't think that a resolution calling on the parks department to reopen the dog runs and to figure out how to do that safely is actually the best way to go, because that's a little too slow a resolution would be I'm begging you to express to the borough, commissioner and the Commissioner that there is strong community feedback in support of reopening the dog runs and coming up with You know some kind of parameter, and you know that may involve some kind of self policing component some kind of honor system, some kind of admin that you know and it's becoming a problem in the non dog run areas for people who don't have dogs, because people who do have dogs are kind of at their wit's end on what to do with their dogs.
We have coverage in the borough from around 7:00 am to 11:30 pm on any given day, but that's full borough coverage It was regarding potential, because my concern is, if somebody who works with about five hundred kids in the summer right, what it like the parks department has to, What are these kids gonna do check outside in a block you know like there has to be something that work together with the nonprofit's figure something out, but these parts have to be open to be able to provide services to these kids, like you, can't just automatically assume that they're just gonna stay home, You know and to Sally's point in the protect people gain the ship better beat out of them by cops, and then we really have to move the agenda because we've got a whole other agenda item.
It's an area that stretches for gosh, maybe seven or eight blocks along the river, see us on this night, north of 158 Okay, all right class of 138 I see several of the committee members, but I'm actually going to jump in and allow some of the public members to ask questions first, since they haven't really had the opportunity to do that, and she said the budget cutbacks I wasn't quite clear on what that meant for the spring summer and fall I walk my dog three times a day in that Park, because I live a block away and on Mondays it's basically a it's a trash pit and there's they're congregated around the limited small trash cans.
and I'm like it's not that deep people , The decision called on Steve I just want it for people who do not know this In addition to being a member of community board 12 Steve is also works for the Manhattan borough commissioners, so he is quite competent to answer these questions.
We wanted open, but there needs to be something because people will just I mean the park is just there are no rules in the park anymore and it's I just right and where I'm really trying to focus this conversation on barbecuing That's , pretty strong conversation about the dog runs, speak less and it's the first community board meeting I've been to in years, : there's an impact on quality of life when there's a lot of people barbecuing in the park, but I just think there are things we should keep in mind.
We want to see the forest and the and the wetlands preserved and that's part of our mission, so anything that we can do to improve this Glorious wildlife is important to us and I'm willing to work with all kinds of people and helping that so I mean BBQing is not really on the forefront of that, but I understand people's needs for it, but if we can help contain it clean it up, keep it My this important Look, it's I live in Inwood around Columbia City area and I'm working from home right now and I've been working from home for past three months , I love going to the parks and lately what I've seen is, unfortunately, a situation where every Monday, when I am actually going to park, I see a lot of garbage strewn around I, see the garbage being flown into the river into the peninsula So. What I would like to do is I would like to have more resources in the park to be able to actually clean up the park so that we don't have garbage ending up in Birds bellies.
I certainly didn't mean to suggest to people that I knew something that they didn't or to doubt the veracity of what people who live on Indian Road were asserting So. If you could just make sure that the site it's supposed to be there is there so we've got on the committee Danielle and then Domingo and Sally The first thing I want to say is because we didn't really address why this discussion or how it was born, why we decided to add it to the agenda, and so I had proposed it at the last meeting, because I observed over several years that the barbecue area is tend to become very crowded and that there's a need right.
So I think that if there's a community need, especially given that we're in a time of Kovac when we should be social, distancing and granted, the barbecuing areas aren't yet open, but we're gonna be moving in that direction, and so I guess my thought process was okay There are a lot of people bar barbecuing and when we return to barbecuing and the parks being you know, usable we're gonna want to have the opportunity or people you know we're gonna need the opportunity to social distance while they barbecue.
So, yes, so I feel like we have support, needs, correct, Chris What I would like to ask Jennifer is understanding that there's a need for resources in certain particular areas to be able to accommodate and thank God, the chief of staff for Manhattan this year , In the part we had an overwhelming amount of people come to our basketball games, so we bought extra receptacles during the summer to be able to create a system where we thought the park isn't trash stuff that we're done right.
Big dumpsters with the noise I would like to see some signage in the lawn like little lawn signs temporarily to let people know that might be more visible to where the noise is coming from and then I would love to see something organized like community service hours to students that might be able to volunteer in the parks to pick up trash on and volunteer that way, something for their resume.
You know as it relates to the budget that we're going to do Jennifer's, even their staff and it'll help us with that and look into you know how much things cost Liz I, don't think some people know who Rod Serling, I Think I can also say that I think I can also say that once our new budget is in place and once we know what the guidelines are going to be for social distancing and allowing gatherings and Parks, the Parks Department will review the barbecue situation and maybe we'll be able to report back to you in the at a future meeting.
