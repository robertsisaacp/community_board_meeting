A. Second I just want to change my background view to one of our beautiful parks instead of Fenway, because Fenway is not within community board.
We owe all of those people whose names I mentioned and whose names I also want to us to hold in our hearts the gentleman who, for reasons that I cannot fathom decided this morning to take his own life in Fort, Tryon Park.
Petitions over the summer and having an update on that in the fall and moving that to a resolution and a recommendation to the City Council in time for their December Street Co naming bill I'm going to put a footnote to here to just ask Jennifer when she gives her report to give any updates on parks, usages, prohibition, suggestions, dog, runs, playgrounds, anticipated openings, any additional closings that kind of stuff You address that in your report, I was going to talk about parks, usage during curfew.
Don't have to talk about that, because that curfew is over I, think that so far in terms of protests, demonstrations and rallies, I want to thank Chris and all of his colleagues at the 34th precinct who have done in the in the protests in which I've been a part in this community have done an extremely good job of working with the community And I other people may have had other experiences, but from what I have seen and heard the three four has done.
A good job working with the people of the three four They know you versus having a force of officers from other precincts who do not know the community just sort of come in and not really know who they're dealing with hold on a second sorry about that.
And I look forward to hearing her answers when she gives her report later in the meeting next I have been on the job for three weeks now and you guys were one of the first people groups of people that I wanted to talk to and introduce myself.
We've been also doing some workshop for kids and we are actually very proud to be participating at Uptown arts and culture group collaboration among with 14 other organizations uptown to create a summer camp They're, free and they're open only to residents, Upper, Manhattan, and They are initially for our donor base.
We're all taking like an hour to during the week to do something that people could sign up for espera, sign up their kids, and so the registration I, hopefully, will be made available to your to the community board.
Once again, I would like to welcome you all to the meeting of the parks and cultural affairs committee of community board.
, I'm, gonna unmute, you and just ask you: Are you speaking on behalf of arts, of a cultural institution in the neighborhood, or are you asking a general question, perhaps related to barbecuing, So we have registration going for our summer workshops.
Twitter, yes, Liz we'll be in the house for our June 25th open studio, and you won't want to miss that a couple of programming notes about events coming up in the next couple of weeks, and you can see our website Noma NYC, org , that's n, om, a NYC org first is the uptown arts and culture summer.
It's been in lived in Washington Heights for over 12 years spending her life as an educators and as well as a not for profit program, manager, focusing most recently on food equity and community engagement, currently she's a senior manager of Network capacity at City Harvest, where she's been for four years before that she was at Harlem, Children's Zone and an elementary school teacher in the public schools.
First Street I just want to give you guys a few quick updates our summer on the Hudson programming series which operates throughout the park is working on bringing virtual programming to our audience right.
You, know a strange year for that, but we have gotten an outpouring of people who have been writing to us looking to help us take care of the park, like actually hundreds of people.
It's been challenging for the volunteer program staff like myself to kind of figure out how to get people started in the park safely and all of that.
You know we're working really hard to make sure that the city doesn't cut funding for the parks, as it's slated to do.
We are here for, in behalf of Washington Heights, in wood, food Council, and we are a community organization that was founded four years ago and our primary goal is to I'm.
We want to increase the amount of affordable and healthy food available in Washington - in wood, and also increase residents, awareness, knowledge and self-efficacy related to topics like urban gardening, nutrition, healthy eating and food justice issues affecting our community.
Instead of following the months, we followed the seasons and, during the harvesting season, of course, our primary focus is on gardening and on the garden space, and this is the space where we can meet with people from the neighborhood from the community through having these weekly open garden hours, where community members can join us and when they do, we would help them, show them, Basics, gardening skills and also.
Anyone who would like to join from the community together and last year we have had our first holiday gift, making workshop - a workshop where members or participants would be able to make gifts that from sustainable materials related to some of them related to food, some of them not to be able to give to their loved ones, and that was a big success and participants expressed great interest to have us do this in the coming years.
The idea behind this at the beginning of this year was to create some sort of a coalition of groups from the both neighborhoods who are seeking the same goal of trying to establish more community gardening spaces across the neighborhood, whether tied to organizations or open to the public.
In order to weather this crisis, And I think we have one more slide if we can move on to that, and what do we ask from community Ward 12, and we would appreciate any support to help us find space that could be suited for egg garden could be associated with an institution or free unused public areas.
We are also seeking partnership with interested organizations who work with families in the Washington, Heights and Inwood area, and, of course, if Community Board, 12 can put us in touch with them or to help us to get in touch with people.
We would ask help in advocating for the usage of the funds that were allocated for creating a community garden in the Highbridge Park.
We are aware that this is not going to happen in the height built Highbridge Park, but we would like the community boards help for advocating for us or for organizations across the neighborhood to use these funds allocated for community gardening, for in Highbridge Park to be used elsewhere for a similar purpose to create community gardening spaces, and that would be, of course, greatly appreciated in any sort of help that might come in that way.
Well right now everything has moved online, unfortunately, because all of our events require people to be in close proximity, because the garden beds are not that large and, as you have seen from the pictures that was not going to be an option given the circumstances, so everything until further notice until we'll see what happens, is online right.
Emotion, Moving on sorry, so sure I, think parks through our green thumb program is very supportive and scaffolds organizations that are looking to do this on existing green thumb, garden, sites.
It has 10 feet, high steel, picket, fencing and it does those early so that the level of control you know modulates And, it's staffed all the time so also started out as sort of a children's garden that particular use so going into another area, fencing it off, taking away what it's been used for and then restricting access creates sort of legal issues.
When we were looking at sites, you know first, we had to look at what was it Mapped park lands because of the restricted hours aspect of a community garden and people having to be members to participate, except when there's a public program, so we have one site in the entire sector: It has a fence.
You know there is a community group that has gotten access from the do-e for that gated area If something were to happen in a green thumb, way, we'd want to make sure that both groups collaborated, With.
It sounds like there's broad consensus for supporting urban gardening for putting forward a motion calling on you know the board and the parks department and the relevant community based organizations, specifically washing eighths in wood, food Council on possibly All the various parks based organizations working together to identify possible areas for urban gardening looping in Board of Education, the possible school site.
Whatever the sites may be to try and do more of this and including you know, All the things in the Manhattan borough president's office because she's, clear Well, it would be going among other people to her.
And I would say, especially considering the fact that the two areas that the food transfer identified are not usable, right, daddy, need soil, mitigation, there's a whole bunch that goes into this, but Now, but I think passing a resolution saying you know we really support this in theory.
That totally goes I'm, sorry that that's totally baked into the conversation we're always when we say that we support something Further RESOLVED is, and we call on the people with money in this to like London , I will be drafting a resolution and sending it around So I always forget something and everybody helps me do even better work.
We are coming back into permitting public art again, but Noma, and the Fort Tryon Park trust, assisted in sharing the open call with uptown artists.
It will go on just because we haven't had a site visit yet due to social distancing, but we will meet there to find a location that won't impede regular news of that area of the park and in a place that you know gives both the park and the artwork justice.
The plan is to feature it as part, the Battle of Fort Washington, and you know we hire a woman channel or to be Margaret Corbin at that reenacting festival each year, and this will happily be incorporated to work, and we want the four train trust we'll invite Zach, along with the parks creme, to give a artists, talk and try to have some sort of reception.
We move to Jennifer's Parks report and I know that a lot of people had questions that they were throwing up into the chat and just know that all of the panelists are able to monitor that including Jennifer.
We purchased fencing, we're working with the stewardship division and Inwood sprouts, a community group, as well as with our Natural Area volunteers in the parks, departments, natural areas group to come up with a comprehensive way to restore that Marsh regeneration, area.
Here's the thing I, don't think that a resolution calling on the parks department to reopen the dog runs and to figure out how to do that safely is actually the best way to go, because that's a little too slow a resolution would be.
Even though it's not a complex question and subject this pertains to Jennifer what you said about enforcement I'm noticing a lot of police in the park, namely Inwood Hill Park and the Dyckman fields, but we maybe have inspector Harris speak to that Yes, okay, first I'd, like just for you guys not on being able to see me As, we know.
That's a reason for the increase in the police officers in the park, but we've also had an increase in who want fog and, as you all know, she's, seen in the news.
It was regarding potential because my concern is: if somebody who works with about five hundred kids in the summer, right, what it like, the parks department has to Steve is here, like you have to take ownership of what are these kids gonna do check outside in a block you know, Like.
Look like I have seen a huge increase in the number of people using the park, People, who bring full backpacks thinking.
It's, really important that we find some answers regarding reopening the parks, a lot of people cook, things that are actually deadly to dogs, not just dangerous or annoying, but deadly.
We wanted open, but there needs to be something because people will Just I mean the park is Just.
When there's a lot of people barbecuing in the park, but I just think there are things we should keep in mind.
As, someone who lives near the park on the park with a view of the park and say that, from my perspective, the part belongs to all of us a lot of people, love barbecuing in the park with their friends and family, and we have to support one another and if it were on the table, I would support an expansion, BBQ area and that's all I wanted to say.
You know for early Monday morning or things like that, even though we're not supposed to gather what have you because I think as a community in word is very special and we want to be our nature.
As I said, people want to clean the park.
We have a 24/7 communications, a number which may actually provide a more rapid response in certain situations depending upon the hour of the day, and people may want to make note of that.
The first thing I want to say is because we didn't really address why this discussion or how it was born, why we decided to add it to the agenda, So I had proposed it at the last meeting, because I observed over several years that the barbecue area is tend to become very crowded and that there's a need.
So I think that if there's a community need, especially given that we're in a time of Kovac when we should be social, distancing and granted, the barbecuing areas aren't yet open, but we're gonna be moving in that direction, and so I guess.
If it's efficiently designated, so I understand that people are very concerned about trash, and perhaps we can talk about ways to address that, like you know the receptacles.
Can you know, help collect trash like the park?
Guess my hope was to bring this up to add it to the agenda and then have us all as a community kind of come together and discuss what our feelings are, so that people can enjoy the barbecuing areas because it tends to be very crowded and I apologize.
We have more people who are using the park because they cannot go to work, there.
We work from home and we love this community, but we have our parks system and we need New York City to invest in the people who actually stayed in New York, City, It's not just about the trash pickups.
The part we had an overwhelming amount of people come to our basketball games, so we bought extra receptacles during the summer to be able to create a system where we thought the park isn't trash stuff that we're done right.
I would like to see some signage in the lawn like little lawn signs temporarily to let people know that might be more visible to where the noise is coming from And then I would love to see something organized like community service hours to students that might be able to volunteer in the parks to pick up trash on and volunteer that way, something for their resume.
I live in this community for 54 years in Washington, Heights in English, so I know all these people, I know.
We can all use the park, then 20,000 people can you support a year or 10,000, because people don't know I, Some places them want to change to the park.
I mean like barbecues that people held in the park.
You know, as it relates to the budget that we're going to do Jennifer's, even their staff and it'll help us with that and look into you know how much things cost Liz I, don't think some people know Who Rod Serling, I.
Think I can also say that I think I can also say that once our new budget is in place and once we know what the guidelines are going to be for social distancing and allowing gatherings and Parks, the Parks Department will review the barbecue situation.
