That's who you can hear and see in the Hollywood Squares gallery view boxes if you are not a panelist you're listed as an attendee, there are at the moment. 45 of you are every bit as welcome as the panelists you're, just not visible. So it's not that there's a technical problem. It's not that we do not love you! It's not that we are trying to shun or stifle your voice in any way. It's just the way it's set up and we will be monitoring the QA. We encourage you to use the raise hand feature when we get to public Q&A so that we can have an orderly discussion that includes everybody and I hope. That's clear why people are not appearing in the Q&A, so I'm going to dismiss those questions that relate to that and then I will begin with a little bit of welcome. Also, okay, Thank You Katerina I hear that you're ready and when we get to that part of the agenda, we will bump you up to a panelist so that you can share your screen with your presentation as well as okay. So it's 6:35 which, by my measure, only running five minutes late, not so terrible I'm calling this meeting to order I want to welcome everybody again, I think we've got the administrative and announcement piece out of the way. Oh wait. A second I just want to change my background view to one of our beautiful parks instead of Fenway, because Fenway is not within community Board. Twelve, let's go with this one. Shall we that's a classic all right, I'd like to begin with a moment of silence, not only you know, just to honor the upheaval and oppressed that has been happening in our community in our city, all over our country and, frankly, all over the world and for many reasons, they're sad, although I personally am optimistic. Well, that's another conversation, but I would like to remember George Floyd, who was laid to rest today on an Audrey Brianna, Taylor, Maurice, Gordon, Tamir, rice, there's just the list is incredibly long who have been killed in acts of racist and homophobic and transphobic aggression. It's particularly important in this month of pride to recall that Homophobia and Transphobia overwhelmingly affects people of color and I. Just think we need to hold all of that in our hearts and in this month of Pride I think it's also really vital to recall that there would not have been a Stonewall uprising had it not been for trans people of color. So we owe all of those people whose names I mentioned and whose names I did not a debt of gratitude. I also want to us to hold in our hearts the gentleman who, for reasons that I can not fathom decided this morning to take his own life in Fort, Tryon Park. So with that, thank you for folks who have taken the opportunity to leave their apartments and I hope. That's many of you at this point, albeit while wearing masks and washing your hands and using Purell. There are many murals up and down Dyckman Street on 181St Street in many places throughout this community honoring George, Floyd and honoring. Many people who have died in acts of racially motivated violence and I think that they are really a moving tribute to the power of art to tap into what we're, thinking and feeling and as an act of healing so I applaud the artists I. Thank them. I thank the business owners who have graciously allowed and encouraged their boarded up business windows to be used in this way. I think it's I think it's healing I think it brings communities together and I encourage you to check out some of these murals I want to give an update on the Lenape Street Co naming, which is to say there is no update. We are just continuing to be mindful of it and I believe we will be circulating petitions over the summer and having an update on that in the fall and moving that to a resolution and a recommendation to the City Council in time for their December Street Co naming bill I'm going to put a footnote to here to just ask Jennifer when she gives her report to give any updates on parks, usages prohibition, suggestions, dog, runs, playgrounds, anticipated openings, any additional closings that kind of stuff I think it's probably easier. If you address that in your report, I was going to talk about parks, usage during curfew. Thank God I do not have to talk about that, because that curfew is over I, think that so far in terms of protests, demonstrations and rallies I want to thank Chris and all of his colleagues at the 34th precinct who have done in the in the protests in which I've been a part in this community have done an extremely good job of working with the community and I other people may have had other experiences, but from what I have seen and heard the three four has done. A good job working with the people of the three four and I think that's the difference between being policed by a precinct where you know the officers and they know you versus having a force of officers from other precincts who do not know the community just sort of come in and not really know who they're dealing with hold on a second sorry about that. My husband's, not quite as adorable as a two year old busting into a meeting but I think he's cute. So I think two other short things, one, the Rezo that we had in our last meeting about the Inwood Hill Park ball fields, one two and four that passed overwhelmingly 41 in favor. None opposed one abstaining and one not voting due to conflict by virtue of working for the agency involved. So I feel good about the work that we did there and lastly, and we'll actually come back to this at the end of the meeting. But I just want to put a bug in the ear of the commute of the committee members that we are not required to meet over the summer. But there's so much going on that I think having a meeting over the summer. It will be optional. You're encouraged to attend you're not required to attend. Your lack of attendance will not be any kind of a mark against you in terms of attendance requirements or other board's service, but I think it would be great if we can think in terms of having a meeting in July, certainly in July and possibly in August. At our usual time. Second Tuesday 6:30 July 14th happens to be my husband's birthday and he was okay with scheduling a meeting at that time. So if y' all can just kind of think about that, and at the end of the meeting we can check in and make sure that works for everybody and then I by Bastille Day. It is couturier hello, so that's all of that actually show of hands up body language smiles thumbs up, does July 14th work for you, committee members. Yes, okay, let's see, okay, so we'll assume it'll be scheduled again. We do not need a quorum because we can't conduct business but I think it's a good opportunity to check in with each other about all things, parks and arts. So with that, it's 644 I want to invite Darryl and Danielle, who both reached out to me separately to just take a moment and give a heads- up about pride events, that of which they are aware of which they may be aware in the community. Unfortunately, a lot of the usual pride events are not happening because of Kovin Darryl, which guy sure I will just say a happy Pride Month. Everyone, it's been an interesting ones: far I dunno, coming from the City Commission on Human Rights, there's actually a forum tomorrow evening on the parallels between HIV, AIDS and COBIT, looking primarily at discrimination cases as well as the government response to the pandemic. I know: Cleen's pride had a virtual pride. This past Sunday and I'm still waiting to hear. Maybe someone else knows what the New York City pride will be doing, but I'm sure they'll be doing something on the last Sunday of June and I also know that the again the Commission on Human Rights is having to Netflix watch parties. One is this Thursday a secret love, beautiful story about a couple lesbian couple who were I believe in their 90's and then also later this month on the 24th I believe the death and life of Marsha P Johnson, so stay tuned for that as well. Thank you. I think Richard said that he would make any announcements he's on the CB twelve LGBT Task Force. The only thing if I may I would like to read the message that callen- lorde has posted callen- lorde is an LGBT health and third, where the leaders, in my opinion, in New, York, City, LGBT health and they posted something on their website. May I read it please, okay, you can also email it to Noble so that he can more easily drop it into the minutes. Sure so, yeah again I do not know of any events. I just thought it would be great if there were any events for us to talk about it, but I looked at Callan Lloyd's website to see what they were advertising, and this is what they've said. We have decided to postpone tonight's Pride 2.0 event to stand in solidarity with those putting their bodies on the line, our city in our country, to combat systemic racist violence. The Stonewall riots that sparked the modern- day, LGBT Lgbtq+ rights movement, were a rebellion against police and police brutality. There would be no pride if not if it were not for the black and brown Trans woman who stood up and fought back more than fifty years ago. Each day we recommit ourselves to caring for those who have been oppressed while advocating for health, justice and Health equity. Health equity will not be achieved until six emic racism and health care is addressed. We mourn the murders that forge void. Hammad are Bree, Toni, McDade, Brianna, Taylor, and so many others. While we do our part to heal ourselves in our communities, and so they will have more information available. But I just wanted to leave that statement or thought it was pretty beautiful. Richard Hallman are you on the call? No okay, he may join us later. Daryl I just want to say one more thing that the city government did put together. Many different city agencies in the mayor's office put together a website specifically for the response to Covid-19 in the LGBTQ community. It's Nyc.Gov, Slash, LGBTQ, Covid-19, I'm, sorry, Nyc.Gov, slash, LD, LGBTQ, DOT COBIT, no just Covid-19, LGBTQ Cove in one word: okay, Super! Thank you. Okay, I just want to catch up a little bit on the chat. Someone said I would love to hear Park speak, but please note that the amplified music without permit is so loud in Inwood, Hill Park at the moment that it is actually hard to hear you so not going to talk about this at this moment in the agenda, but if you can also Jennifer just roll in some information about what to do about that. Also tennis courts is the only other question that I'm seeing at the moment all right brief programming updates. So one of my favorite parts of the meeting is hearing from our many friends and partners in the arts and friends of parks communities. So I will call on folks who raised their hands to give short reports from their organizations. Sally I see your hand I'm actually going to call on you last because, as a panelist, you have lots of opportunities to speak and I want to make sure that everybody else gets a turn. I do also want to say I know, I meant to mention this at the beginning. I know that many of you have joined this meeting because of an interest in the last item on the agenda, which is barbecuing rules and facilities in northern Manhattan parks. I know that some person posted extensively in and around Inwood Hill Park a flyer about this committees plan to expand barbecuing in into one of two areas in Inwood, Hill Park, either the Indian Road lawn or one of the soccer fields which soccer field was not stipulated in the anonymous flyer. I want to make very clear that there's a public body and the way we met and it's an advisory body and the way that we make our recommendations is. We have public discussions, including this one, so we will be circling back to barbecuing and talking about that and I really glad that there are so many people on this call. We've got 74 participants, which is fantastic, but I do want to let people know that there is a zero point: zero percent likelihood of expanding barbecuing onto the Indian Road lawn for any number of reasons, most importantly of which is there, is a complete violation of FDNY regulations and it's a terrible idea. So that's not on the table. That's never been on the table and everyone is welcome and encouraged to stay, but if the only reason why you were on this call was to strenuously object to that. You are also welcome to go. Do something else with your evening, because that's just not happening. That was never happening. It's not on the agenda. I can not state it strongly enough. So with that just want to make sure everybody is takes a deep breath. The nose that we're not doing that. So do not worry, bye, so I see Jen Bristol. Are you talking on behalf of the dog owners Group or asking a general question about parks, usage, I thought it was just me, but I guess I could ask on behalf of the dog owners group, since most of my questions affect the dog owners in the park. Okay. So if you could just very quickly I wanted to know, we want to know if there's going to be any park monitoring or forcement at Fort Tryon, the last few days, besides myself, seeing it, many people have seen mopeds, including the what is it called the rebel? Is it rebels, or whatever the rental ones in the park socially casually riding around as if they're allowed, in addition to the bikes, which are extremely it's always dangerous? But now that we have so many lovely people in the park and so much of a community in the park? It's really hard to share with humans alone, and then you have to share with bikes coming down, and then it was really nice to see the other day parks, employees or volunteers or staff handing out masks along Broadway on the park, but they were doing it in the a.m. and I. Just my personal experience, I feel like most people in the morning have masks, wear masks the non- park. The people in the park that do not use, masks or social distance are usually in the late afternoon to the evening. So maybe you can put that into motion may be handing out mass later on in the day, I'm sorry and then wanted to know about the dog rent opening, because people were curious and then, lastly, in case you have not realized all the downpours. The other day affected the path. On top of the dog in lon, so now the path is dangerous. One of the reasons I'm talking about the bikes is I got out of the way. So I want to get hit and I rolled my ankle because now there's less but the path is broken because of the downpours it just broke. The side of the path and I would look down Sadang, it's a Broadway and I think. That's it great. Okay, thank you and I'm. Actually I kind of did this in the wrong order. What I was looking for was this is the part of the agenda where different organizations, cultural and Parks organizations give a report on what their organizations are doing. So those were all fantastic questions. That's more a part of Jennifer's report, so I saw her writing notes and I look forward to hearing her answers when she gives her report later in the meeting next, we've got Julia Attaway the newly appointed executive director of the Cabrini shrine welcome I just wanted to pop in and introduce myself. I have been on the job for three weeks now and you guys were one of the first people groups of people that I wanted to talk to and introduce myself. As you may or may not know, mother Cabrini is the patron saint of and we are, as we look forward, we're looking to collaborate with other. You know, organizations that are doing things with immigrants so that we can bring people into the shrine and also participate in other ways, even without a whole. Lot of programming we've been getting as best I can make out. We get 12 to 15 thousand visitors a year, which is not an insignificant number of people coming in to pray and or you know, figure out what they're doing so. We're really looking I wanted to just whenever there's something where there's an opportunity for us to collaborate with other organizations we'd be glad to talk to people fantastic. Thank you so much welcome and feel free to attend our meetings. Whenever you're able next we've got Alex compost from the Hispanic society. Welcome, Alexander I can hear me. Yes, great hi everyone. Thank you very much for having this again. First of all, it's one to say: that's been very interesting period in our lives and we've been addressing and responding as quickly as we can to all the needs of the community and our audiences acrosss, the country and nationwide. So I'm very happy that we able to do that, because the determined staff, but also because support of community board we are, we had a wonderful concert in May, which was first time. We ever did a livestream concert. I hope many of you participated in that or attended that virtually oh, it's online in our websites, Vanek side, T, DOT, Ford, we're doing a second life concert where we have like I, think we had like 15 musicians and five singers was really a montage of music and next one would be on June, 24, June, 25th and it'll be, of course, will be, have posted in our website and say now to be blessed so you're not on our eblasts list. Please subscribe just going to our website. Hispanic studies or and sign up we've been also doing some workshop for kids and we are actually very proud to be participating at Uptown arts and culture group collaboration among with 14 other organizations uptown to create a summer camp, and it's going to feature music, dance, literary I'm sure somebody from NOAA might be speaking on this in detail. The words is very happy to be offering some drawing workshops, as well as Dad's music workshops in kachunk. Our will be definitely drawing I think where Elena's danced the dance professionals, but we definitely have some drawing workshops and we're very happy to do that. They're, free and they're open only to residents, Upper, Manhattan, and so every that starts in July registrations due the 15th of June. Now we're also doing more virtual program, as everybody is a response and we had a wonderful series called a Juliet which are these of conversations with the curators we had when in May we had one in June. We have one in July. They are initially for our donor base, but we are making them to the public and will be on our website as well soon. So if you look at our website, we have lots of virtual program going on and we hope that people enjoy it and Parata tan or listen and respond to my program. Thank you. This is just a point of clarification. Really quick, Alex the summer camp is that, like a virtual summer, campers that physical, those could be a virtual summer camp, so it's bill dealing that the fact that's going to be. You know the issues that had so era, there's like 15 organizations and we're all taking like an hour to during the week to do something that people could sign up for espera, sign up their kids, and so the registration I, hopefully, will be made available to your to the community Board to help us express that Noma has been taking the lead on that, so we all have the site, so we do not have it I'm happy to share it. Thank you. Okay. Next we have Shiloh Holly from the Morris- Jumel mansion, but before we get to Shiloh, I just want to respond to something in the chat someone asked: what is the motivation for enlarging the BBQ area in Inwood? Hill Park, once again, I would like to welcome you all to the meeting of the parks and Cultural Affairs Committee of Community Board 12 Manhattan, Community, Board 12 Manhattan covers the area of Manhattan from West 155Th Street to the northern tip of Manhattan-, the little southeast corner of that area, I just described, which is the Polo Grounds, which is part of another community board. When we said we wanted to discuss barbecuing in community board, 12 Manhattan, what we meant by that was, we want to discuss barbecuing in community board, 12 Manhattan in all of community board. 12 Manhattan, not at no point was Inwood Hill Park specifically mentioned I. Hope that addresses that and alleviates that concern Liz. Did you want me to jump in and add to that? Just since it was my moment no I would be. I would happily welcome the comment when we're actually discussing it. I, just as things are popping up in the chat, I would hate. Since it's the last item on the agenda, I would hate for people to be like fuming about a misimpression. So I want to just be really clear and then we will have the discussion in its time in the agenda, but thank you so with that Shilo Europe hi Schuyler from the Morris- Jumel mansion here. So we are continuing our virtual programming this summer and we are launching virtual con Edison family day, starting on Saturday. We have a bilingual educator that is going to be instructing families on how to make summer planters for their garden or windows. Registration for that is on our website. Additionally, we are starting to begin a new series called lunch break lectures which is going to run throughout the summer, possibly longer where mansion staff, educators, volunteers are going to do. A quick lunchtime chat about a topic of their choice, so these programs will are listed on our website. Additionally, the last program that I want to highlight is our next virtual parlor chat, which is funny beyond the census 1792 today. That is next Wednesday evening, and this is one of the many programs that we are starting to execute related to community engagement. So all of these programs are listed on our website. That's Morris-, Jumel org. Tell me again the data on that census, conversation next, Wednesday I, believe that's June, 16:17 yeah. That's actually kind of genius that you're bringing in that historical perspective. I really appreciate that yeah. So the George Washington's inaugural year, as president, was when the census was enacted so pertinent to us and community conversations today. Nice. Thank you. So much quick question for Dirk East, Ramos I'm, going to unmute you and just ask you: are you speaking on behalf of arts, of a cultural institution in the neighborhood, or are you asking a general question, perhaps related to barbecuing, no I'm deputy director for up clown stories, so I was not sure if my name was showing up properly since I use someone else's Lane got it, but well, in that case, uptown stories tell us what you got yeah. So we have registration going for our summer workshops and we're also going to continue hosting them virtually, and we have you know, put workshops and poetry and fiction how to comics and how to pair words with illustrations. We also have three new workshops. This summer, one is about like dopey, kids will be drawing creating little fairy houses and working on poetry as well called poetry in miniature. There's also, a songwriting class called your song and our last new class is called express yourself and in it, kids will be kind of exploring different facets of identity, which we feel is very much needed. These days and classes will start July, 6 and they'll run Monday through Friday for two weeks at a time, and there will be two hours long each day and all information is on uptown stories org, and we also have some free new pop in workshops that will be twice a week or an hour. Each and anyone can register new or returning students between ages, 7 and 17. That is super cool, she'll Montez. Are you representing organization, arts parks Group? Or did you have a general question about another young item? So I am representing an arts organization here in town. Thank you. So much I can barely hear me now. Yes, I'm actually representing an arts organization named into recreations and I'm. Actually, two also here to introduce myself to you all. First off, thank you for having us here and for these lovely meetings. You know very informative. Internal creations is just a small arts organization for a cash- flow guitar. Our mission is to develop leadership, self- sufficiency and life skills through learning the classical guitar and as of late we've been having our classes virtually and we've been having or watching tonight's program classes virtually as well. So we would like to just put that out there that you can always send this info if you are interested, you always email us at info at internal creations, org or visit a site, WWN ternal Croatia's org. If you want to register and be a part of our musical family as we call it okay, thank you. Welcome I'm pleased you could join us. Thank you all right, Sally wait! A Sec hold on I got on me and you know. Well, we can hear you so you do not need to unmute and you do not need to give any announcements for the Food Council because they have their own agenda. Yes, okay, first for ring garden. As you know, community gardens are closed, except for essential maintenance. By order of the parks Department, we have extended our membership six months. We do have four working groups going on to do the essential maintenance and we sit down email calling from members. The four working groups are the Gardening committee that plants waters weeds most prunes fertilizers and does other gardening activities they meet about once a week. Second, is the compost committee. As you might be aware, the city of New York has paused composting, but we are still continuing our small composting operation we have established rather than members being able to come in at any time for non volunteer members. We have established drop- off hours on Saturday mornings from 9:00 to noon. The third group is upon solar committee that works on maintaining the health or upon the solar system and plumbing and carpentry, and the fourth group, which is my favorite, of course, is the ring monarch project. As many of you all know, and you can probably see from my picture I'm quite a fan of racing. The migration of monarchs we've been working since 2017, starting with a project in conjunction with PS 98, the Scirocco Park school, to build a monarch Waystation in the park. We've been building them all over the city, so this year we will be turning the ring garden into way station. So we're soliciting volunteers for that, and then second, representing friends, Van with a park, we have been doing some work Solo in the parks, but until we get the go- ahead for group events, we have not held group events. We will be kicking off. Myself is not seeing Broadway beautify Broadway initiative to help take care of street free beds. You'll be hearing more about that and then obviously, we've been working with the Super Street Stuart's in forestry on invasive species removal, hopefully getting them back the parks as soon as we can do that, but just stay tuned. We have websites for Facebook pages for both of those groups and that's about it and also just one note on the Food Council in addition to Caterina here to present. Also, there are two other members that will be presenting, yes, I know and I will be unmuting them and Ursa and Tyreke I do not know Catarina put Tyreke and her question the best told when he's listed on participants. Yeah got it good thanks and last round it out. I believe Jennifer has a couple of cultural announcements, so she's going to put those out and then we will move on to good Food Council and just before you do that Paola. If you're still here can you need me to share screen with Jennifer know if you can promote if you can promote Tyreke and also can earth soy, two panelists, okay, and if you can make me a host, so you already host I already am and then that way, I think I can I missed the other name. You gave me to the other, so it's can earth soy and the other name is Tyreke thank fantastic, okay, MS hapa, so on behalf of the New York City Parks Department and Lotus music and dance I wanted to. Let everybody know that this year's drums along the Hudson, our annual Native American and drumming and dancing from around the World festival that usually happens in Inwood Hill Park, is going to be virtual. June 20th is the date I can send around the zoom link. Everyone and what's particularly exciting, is this year. Our honoree is joy, barge oh she's, a poet musician playwright and author with a distinguished career and helping audiences realize the wrongs of the past not just to Native Americans but to oppressed communities in general, twenty nineteen. She was elected Chancellor to the Academy of American poets, and then last year she became the first Native American to hold the honor, the United States poet laureate. We're definitely sad. It's not happening in the Sacred Lands of Inwood Hill Park, but we're delighted to have connected with joy and so everybody tune in June 20th and we'll ask the community board to send out that link to everyone outstanding yeah. If you can send the flyer and paola, if you can just be ready for that and to send it up, it's a wonderful event and I'm delighted that it's happening virtually and last but not least, I'm going to turn it over to Martin Collins to give the Noma report and just while he's speaking in addition to listening to his every word.

It stopped your doctor and Caterina who's, our queen and I, will let them take over thanks. Thank you. Thank you. So much for having us tonight. We're really grateful for this opportunity to present our work and talk about the support that we're looking for from the committee. So I'm going to share my screen. Okay, the host it says the host disabled attendee screen sharing yeah. We have to give you that give me one second Thank You Bella you're welcome, while you're doing that. I'm just I see anise dust. Oh, my goodness and Anastasia actually emailed me separately to let me know that she was going to be giving a presentation. So while we're figuring out that, do you mind if I let her give her report on Washington on Fort Washington, Park it'll just be a minute. Okay. Thank you, hello. Oh sorry, Anastasia I am the North Park outreach coordinator at Riverside, Park Conservancy, so we help the Parks Department, take care of Riverside Park and also a portion of Fort Washington Park. So we work from 59th Street up to 180. First Street I just want to give you guys a few quick updates our summer on the Hudson programming series which operates throughout the park is working on bringing virtual programming to our audience right now. We really only have health and wellness classes, some yoga and Pilates, and things like that happening on zoom' for June. Our programming director is working actively to try to get some music in the scene so coming soon. Hopefully, we I can share that link with you guys. Another programming thing our Sports Kim is cancelled for 2020, unfortunately, because of a the parks. Department is not as far as I know, submitting permits for four fields and athletic courts, and things of that sort so cancelled. That does operate a little bit further south, that's at one O third, but we do have kids coming from all acrosss the city, so it may apply to some families in the neighborhood. Let's see here our volunteer program also, it's been. You know a strange year for that, but we have gotten an outpouring of people who have been writing to us looking to help us take care of the park like actually hundreds of people. So it's been challenging for the volunteer program staff like myself to kind of figure out how to get people started in the park safely and all of that, so that's in the works. I can share my email if anyone themselves would like to get involved, helping, take care of the park or know someone or, if you're affiliated with an organization that would like to arrange for a group project in the park. Please reach out yeah, please reach out I'm here. For that sorry go ahead! That is your email! Oh sorry, okay, one last thing on a citywide scale on the Conservancy, we're really involved with the Playfair coalition, which is a multi- year campaign looking to get the city to allocate adequate and equitable funding to its parks and that's a citywide thing. The parks Department gets less than one percent of the city's budget and, as all eyes are kind of on that process. Right now, you know we're working really hard to make sure that the city does not cut funding for the parks, as it's slated to do. I believe it's looking at 60 million, plus of cuts right now, which would directly impact like more than 300 parks employees around the city who could lose their jobs. So we have a petition that we're circulating and I'll send that around-. Sorry, fantastic! Thank you very much! Justino organization, email, I'm, sorry, Liz I was writing an organization in the email one more time. Please yeah Riverside Park Conservancy! Thank you and email Anastacia, a na Sta Si a at Riverside Park, NY C.Org. Thank you very much fantastic. Thank you very much, I'm, sorry for overlooking you and I'm sorry for messing with your flow Catarina and can't take it away. Okay, thank you! So I just want to let everybody know it's pronounced balance. Thank you guys. So sorry, it's alright! Okay, so I'm going to share my screens, we can get the presentation going. Hopefully it works well in Buffalo in a very flat AIDS. Well, it's a Turkish name, so I'm used to it. Okay, I, okay, I have to change my zoom preferences. I'm John. Do you want to start just within our mission, while I open that up? Yes? Well, we are here for, in behalf of Washington Heights, in wood, food Council, and we are a community organization that was founded four years ago and our primary goal is to I'm. Looking at the presentation on the side here is to encourage sustainable food systems and healthy food consumption in Washington, Heights and inwards. Neighborhoods, and what does this mean, of course, is to for us to reach out to the community, to the members of the community and to help them with? First of all, to have access to healthy food options. That is one thing, and the second is that to help them, maybe potentially grow their own food and to be able to do it for themselves and for this goal. For the last four years we have been growing our organization as we are going to detail in a second in the presentation, and we are trying to reach as many people within the neighborhoods and also as many other organizations with similar goals within the neighborhood as well. Okay, let me continue from here. We also another goal that we are trying to seek, of course, is to help people in the neighborhood to be able to take food justice and their food needs and healthy nutrition into their own hands and to be able to demand and to act upon their needs, and for this aim we are trying to create places where we can educate and provide education on nutrition. Oh great, okay, nutrition and, of course, food justice, okay, I think you're. Looking for the slide, we were right. It tried upon your arm underneath Win Food Council, see B12 presentation under view. Okay or slide, whichever is easier for you, that was, like my River look, she said under slide or a view. She said something it looks like a box. Let me see I'm, sorry, okay, now you, okay, my partner is helping me because I rendering it so, which one are we I think we are on our goals. Our mission is really to focus on food justice and we've outlined these long term goals to increase the public land designated for food gardening in our community, which is one of the reasons this committee is so relevant. We want to increase the amount of affordable and healthy food available in Washington- in wood and also increase residents, awareness, knowledge and self- efficacy related to topics like urban gardening, nutrition, healthy eating and food justice issues affecting our community. Our organizational history. Very briefly, we were founded four years ago I'm, a really proud of everything that we've been able to accomplish. We were founded in March 2016 that year of Founders, Committee was established, and Sally has been part of that. Since the beginning developing the mission, the vision and everything how we will operate, we have received grants from citizens Committee and in 2017 we started a garden work at the ride, 11 children's garden in swindlers Cove, and this is a garden that is maintained by Newark restoration project. But we have a garden bed and every year we've been able to increase our presence with them in a number of different events: expanding our programming over the years we started with inviting youth into the garden and hosting family garden days, then, into that we received a double of our funding from citizens Committee and we added another garden bed with New York restoration project, and we started our annual fermentation workshop, which has been really wonderful: a nutrition workshop series and weekly Guardian hours. So in the first year of gardening, we just hosted events about once a month or but now, with the weekly garden hours, we invited community members to come in and harvest with us on a regular basis and be able to take free, fresh produce home with them. And then last year we received again funding renewal with from citizens Committee. We were able to adopt a third garden bed in the garden we our website and bring on our first page staff. Member- and it's very you know we're focused on expanding our capacity when we were invited by a New, York restoration project as a partner to apply for a federal grant. They were submitting an applications that we've signed on as a partner with them, and we have obtained formal fiscal sponsorship through a social good fun which, if you're in the nonprofit world, you know that's a very big step for an organization that year we were featured in the Manhattan Times and also in a video that's up on YouTube that was produced by tastemade for REI and it features when they're cove and why our piece work in US as well. So where our structure, our group, is really grassroots and community, led everyone beyond our paid staff members volunteer. All of our events are held bilingually, English and spanish. At the same time, we do not use headsets. We translate having the speech set in English, translated into spanish right after and kind of trying to have the language equity, and that way our committee has eight seats currently to meets on a monthly basis, and these are some of the areas that cover and a diminutive coordinator. Well, our accomplishments. As I mentioned with our history, we've seen consistent progressive growth, we're celebrating a four year anniversary. We received three years of funding from Citizens Committee every year, expanding our presence in the garden. It also increased our membership in our attendance and we've been really working on, especially during this time to share resources on social media and expand our reach in our audience. There are our website link is listed, there win Food, Council Org, and these are some of our notable accomplishment. Damn right, I would think you Katerina I would like to talk a little bit about what we do in a regular year, at least in the last three years, and this is going forward what we plan to do for the coming years, as well, of course, expanding with new activities. Now our year is divided into two, which is the harvesting season and the winter season. So, instead of following the months, we followed the seasons and during the harvesting season, of course, our primary focus is on gardening and on the garden space, and this is the space where we can meet with people from the neighborhood from the community through having these weekly open garden hours, where community members can join us and when they do, we would help them show them: basics, gardening skills and also, if there is anything to be harvested, they can obviously harvest with us and take home some of the fresh produce to their homes. We also try to provide gardening education, not only to do gardening in our bed, but, of course, to be able to do gardening in any other, given context, especially if possible, at homes in windowsills any little spot that is available. We also organize family garden days. These are larger events, where we invite families acrosss the neighborhoods, especially with younger kids, and our goal is to try to educate the children about agriculture, about food about vegetables and the way we do it is. We give them some basic skills. We allow them to dig into our beds and pick up carrots and harvest food with us and they usually, of course, have a blast, while the kids are doing this in this family garden days, the adults and their parents, of course, are they also participate by usually having some sort of workshop. It's either about nutrition or about food and during all of these gardening events, of course, whatever is produced. Whatever is harvestable at the time in our beds, which is plenty during summer weeks that the attending members attending community members can take share and take some of it with themselves at home now in winter season. Of course, there is no gardening, so instead we try to focus on activities that are indoors and more about education. We have been doing fermentation workshop yearly for the last three years and every year the people who are attending numbers of people attending have increased and the interests have increased and we have got great feedback from the community. We also have documentary screenings and discussions. Of course, the topic is always around food and nutrition. We do organize potlucks, usually around holidays and Thanksgiving, so to bring our members and, of course, anyone who would like to join from the community together and last year we have had our first holiday gift, making workshop- a workshop where members or participants would be able to make gifts that from sustainable materials related to some of them related to food, some of them not to be able to give to their loved ones, and that was a big success and participants expressed great interest to have us do this in the coming years and we anticipate to turn this into a tradition. Finally, we also have regular nutrition and healthy eating workshop series. We have done some of these at the garden during summer months and some of these in outside during winter months in other spaces, and they have been ongoing for the last three years. We have partnered with different groups and different organizations in these workshops, and we plan to continue doing more of these in the coming years. So we have some pictures to show you to give you a sense of what it looks like our activities. So if Katerina can go to the couple of slides, these pictures are from the Riley Levin children's garden, and you can see, of course, children are enjoying themselves. These are from our family garden days. I believe these are from last summer and the next pictures I think the is also children, obviously with in the beds- and these are pictures from our fermentation workshops over three years. They do not they're not from the same events from three different events, and you can see. The initial event here is on the side and the numbers of people who are joining or participating are increasing. Okay, nextslide Catina. Oh thank you, so 2020 activities well starting in 2020. Of course, we had one primary goal in mind and that was to expand gardening space or at least take steps to expand gardening space in Washington, Heights and inward neighborhoods. Now, to this end, we have reached out to other neighborhood groups and other community organizations throughout the neighborhoods. Some of them here that we're mentioning connect Amano's run by Dr. Yolanda Rosa. We reached out to Isabella Center for elderly in order to create a gardening space and they were very positive and we started working together. We reached out to other people seeking in gardening space, small group or small community organizations such as Papaya garden. We have connections to ring garden, obviously to Sally and Friends of Inwood Hill Park. Now the idea behind this at the beginning of this year was to create some sort of a coalition of groups from the both neighborhoods who are seeking the same goal of trying to establish more community gardening spaces, acrosss the neighborhood, whether tied to organizations or open to the public. We all of these organizations have something in common but of course, as with everything else, decor with 19 crises have put things to hold and has forced us to somewhat changed our project for the 2020. So what we have been doing since the beginning of the crisis. Of course, we moved our activities to online, so we have some Facebook live activities with involving some of our members with yoga and self- care topics. We had a plant- based nutrition workshop with partnering with plant powered Metro NY, talking about the benefits of plant- based diet and the particular health quest answering questions about health. We are going to have a home gardening workshop that is also online home gardening, meaning of course, giving people or teaching people the skills of growing their own herbs or doing their own planting in their window since at home, and of course, we have been still as we have been in the last several years. We have been partnering with the New York restoration project in the Riley 11 children's garden and for this, and that they were graciously helped us to plant the seeds that we have raised in our homes into the garden beds. So if, in the future, in the coming months that the Riley Levin children's garden is open to the public again, so we can pick up where they left and the plants that they have been taking. Care of us would be ready for the community to enjoy and to harvest and to learn about. So can we go to the Katrina? Also, this being our fourth year anniversary, we decided to do a fundraising campaign and for this and we started an online donations campaign, the donation button is live on our website, which is www.hyken.com. So our goal is to raise four hundred forty four hundred dollars in honor of our fourth year anniversary. Now. The reason that we are trying to, of course, and more focus on this is that many grant funding review process have been paused or been delayed due to Covid-19. So many of the sources that we have relied on in the years previously is either delayed, or we are not sure what is going to happen with them. That, of course, makes our fundraising campaign even more vital and more important for us in order to weather this crisis and I think we have one more slide if we can move on to that, and what do we ask from community Ward 12, and we would appreciate any support to help us find space that could be suited for egg Garden could be associated with an institution or free unused public areas. The demand for community gardening in the areas of Washington, Heights and in wood is tremendous everybody who participates in our activities and all of the organizations that we have reached out this goal. This part of Manhattan is particularly lacking in any community gardening or any urban food growing opportunities. So, of course, any help with us finding space or creating space would be very appreciated. We are also seeking partnership with interested organizations who work with families in the Washington, Heights and Inwood area, and, of course, if Community Board 12 can put us in touch with them or to help us to get in touch with people. Similar organizations that is also would be greatly appreciated. Connecting to funding opportunities is would also be greatly appreciated, given especially the times that, due to Covid-19 crisis, that a lot of funding opportunities are quite limited and they are on hold. And finally, we would ask help in advocating for the usage of the funds that were allocated for creating a community garden in the Highbridge Park. This was a part of the approach participatory budget project in 2015. We know we are aware that this is not going to happen in the height built Highbridge Park, but we would like the community boards help for advocating for us or for organizations acrosss the neighborhood, to use these funds allocated for community gardening for in Highbridge Park to be used elsewhere for a similar purpose to create community gardening spaces, and that would be, of course, greatly appreciated in any sort of help that might come in that way. Great, yes, I think that is it and we have. If anyone has questions, we would be happy to answer them. Ok, can we kill the share screen so that I can see the faces of the people in the committee? I will say that if we did not have an important but short presentation about art in Fort, Tryon Park a robust report from the Parks Department about the many questions that you heard burbling up and then a fairly extensive discussion about barbecuing or not, and the rules and regs around that throughout the board. I would happily spend the next hour talking about this, because it's hugely important- and you know hats off to the Food Council for all the incredible work that you do and to Sally for her continued advocacy and always highlighting your work. We've had as a Capitol item for a while wanting to identify places in the board for additional community gardening I understand there are some issues with regard to lead in the soil and protection by fencing and I. Think Jennifer had some points about that, but I saw first up Danielle's hand and Omar's hand, so I'm going to take questions from them first and then from Jen, then yeah. Thank you. I was just going to say my apologies if I miss this, but I was actually going to ask them if they've identified any particular areas that we could potentially advocate for. I know that you said it's been an item of ours for a while. Perhaps that preceded me, since I'm newish to the board, but I was wondering for the presenters. Have you identified any areas that are suitable potentially for a plot? Yes, we have identified some places actually with our partnerships or at connect Amano's. There is one large space that belongs to the Department of Education, on tenth Avenue and 186th. That is one potential place. We also have again a partnership with the Isabella center, but that is a gardening that is tied to the institution, so it's not really open to the public but of course, related with the organization. We also have seeked out to learn from Parks Department. If the big sloping open area that is a cross, that is on Dyckman Street, that is acrosss from the acrosss from the Manhattan storage. There is a big sloping area there. It is right next to the playground, and that is an underutilized place. That is, takes great sunlight, but that is another location that is large enough in the neighborhood that we have identified so far. There are smaller spaces, and some members have pointed them out, but we do not know about their status of who owns them or who we can go for them. So those are a couple of places that we have in mind to pursue Thank You, Omar yeah. Just a quick question for the panelists I'll: have all events been due to Kovac been moved online or is there anything that is occurring? That is not online. Well right now everything has moved online, unfortunately, because all of our events require people to be in close proximity, because the garden beds are not that large and, as you have seen from the pictures that was not going to be an option given the circumstances, so everything until further notice until we'll see what happens is online right now. Unfortunately, yes, the New, York restoration project sets the rules for that garden where we have right now. So, even if we wanted to implement social distancing guidelines and implement some sort of activity there we're not permitted to access the garden right, okay, yeah, it's there are many things that we can do online, including this online gardening kind of hard. So Jennifer, can you talk a little bit about some of the particular parks guidelines, issues within parks that I mean areas within parks? Can I make a motion. I was like motions for resolution in support of exploring those two areas that I did. Where were we so actually, I would like to pause on emotion, because I think in considering so courting a particular use, I think it's helpful to have not only the programming needs, but also the operational parameters. So what exactly the motion is that we might want to make would I think be materially affected by what it is. Jennifer is about to say since I do not know what that is. I would very much like for her to be able to say it before we entertain a motion generally about we're. Moving on sorry, so sure I think parks through our green thumb program is very supportive and scaffolds organizations that are looking to do this on existing green thumb garden sites. The challenge becomes green thumb and community gardening sites have a more restricted public access than public parks for green thumb or gardening. It's generally administered I believe it's something like 20 hours a week, and so from a legal standpoint. People could argue that it's privatization right, it's no longer open to the public. It's no longer people can't have their picnic there or people can't. You know throw their ball there, or so that is a bit of a challenge and then sort of another aspect. Besides the legal what's mapped properly and what's not mapped parkland and public access and rights to equitable access is the safety of the soils. So your restoration project is on mapped Parkland, but they have a management agreement with the Parks Department. So something to keep in mind about that site. It has 10 feet, high steel, picket, fencing and it does those early so that the level of control you know modulates and it's staffed all the time so also started out as sort of a children's garden that particular use so going into another area, fencing it off, taking away what it's been used for and then restricting access creates sort of legal issues. Health- wise. You also have the issue of being able to control that soil contamination right now. Parks does not allow any edibles to be grown on open. You know completely unrestricted access areas, cuz of the soil. When the Department of Health looked at the community gardens, there was an issue that led in the soil there in parkland. We find an incredible amount, unfortunately, each day of construction dumping. We have certain religious practices with animal carcasses. We have people disposing of their pets frequently and we do not in many areas we do not have gates so the risk. We can't protect people against that risk of guarantee and clean soil. So when we were looking at sites, you know first, we had to look at what was it mapped park lands because of the restricted hours aspect of a community garden and people having to be members to participate, except when there's a public program, so we have one site in the entire sector: that's unmatched! It's contained. It has a fence. We felt like that could be the side that the green thumb program could issue a request for proposals for someone to operate. A community farm that had extensive community outreach public programming. The challenge was, we would be taking away what the community advocates for that site wanted contained to Community Board 12 to ask for so that sort of took that site off the table. So then we had been exploring with the councilmembers office since he allocated the funding and the participatory budget are there. Doa properties and one site that came up was on the George Washington campus, where there is some restricted controls who gets to access. It had not really had a designated use, so no one could say that they were being displaced but I'm, not sure that that's something that the do- E has embraced the area next to piece and Park House, believe it or not, has wells in it when we had the drought wells we're put in there. So that's not necessarily something that we want disrupted. It's also part of the forest sort of buffer area of the map forever wild forest and again you'd be displacing people use it for picnicking and gathering you'd be displacing that and having restricted hours in an area that have always been, you know, open and available, but it's not Park Lane. So it's tricky, you know rooftops are something that we've looked at, because then you can control the soil and who has access to it, but then obviously they're issues with a DA. You want to have venting beds that everyone can get you. So it's not there's no easy answer. I think you know the council is smart to go to a site. That's maybe like currently not used for anything other than say you know it's a vacant lot because then you're not just placing an existing use- and you can, you know, put in fencing start with clean soil raised beds, okay, I'm, sorry, who's, that Sally yeah very quickly, and then I really need to move the agenda. Yep, I'm thinking of another area that has a gate, that's restricted access. What about I'm donating some of the land, it's behind the gates at La Marina, so the gate behind La Marina right now is an active, marina right now, Hudson River community sailing has their open sails and you know last summer they had their summer camps. It's also an active marina where boaters come in. So it's not and it's open. You know for waterfront access, it's not necessarily a let's take some of an active marina where we might need to bring boats onto the land or repairing a boat and put a community garden. Okay or stipulations for the bankruptcy proceedings, no provision with major community at a marina, okay and then quick question is Danielle, actually I'm going to let Natalie come in and he should come in because they have not had a chance to speak yet and then I'm going to circle back to your resolution, Natalie I just wanted to kind of put out. Okay now, I just wanted to kind of put out there. One of the spots mentioned by Jennifer was somewhere on the George Washington campus and I just wanted to do. As you know, you know there is a community group that has gotten access from the do- e for that gated area and they have been doing a lot of the stewardship and the cleaning there so that, if something were to happen in a green thumb way, we'd want to make sure that both groups collaborated, turn I, think the challenge is we'll. Do e allow it? Yes, okay, no I, think and I'm getting a little ahead of myself, but when we get back to Danielle's reso, we can include that in there I really want to get to Ayesha. Get to this dispatch with this item of business so that we can move the agenda. So if I sound a prop, that's because I'm trying to get us out of here before you know 9:30 Ayesha! Do you hear me? Yes, okay, I just wanted to know if any thought had been given to the possibility of using vertical farms that could be either outdoor or indoor I've seen some really good work being done with that, like, for instance, in the Microsoft facility on 42Nd Street. They have vertical farms on various floors throughout the facility that I honestly love going there to look at how things are moving along growing and how they're, using those the things that they, the food, that's actually produced there on site. So I just wanted to put that out there as an option. Yeah Natalie we're connected to the group that is working on the space behind George Washington High School campus we've been part of their Community Coalition, and so we definitely advocate for that space. We would be very involved and we did try to work with Good Shepherd on the rooftop, but unfortunately the church rented, the building this space, and so that we've chopped access with no longer going to be possible for the public, and so that was very disheartening. But we were at the point of having a good contractor up to evaluate it. So yes, we're just really hoping that the$ 200,000 that a community voted through in this project. That was hoping. You know there was a community desire for five years ago. Okay, all right so in the interests of moving things along I. Think that, based not only on this conversation but also the conversations that have burbled up for years, around urban gardening there's clearly an interest in urban gardening. There are any number of challenges to it, such as what Jennifer raised I do not think we actually have to solve all of those or, frankly, even any of those right now. Anybody who's ever been to a meeting that I chair has heard me say that I think that group writing exercises are boring and tedious and I do not like them and I do not engage in them, but I'd like to try and get just by peoples show of hands and of course, half the board. Members have picture smiling pictures of them on the screen, so you look like you're smiling, but I need to see your faces, so it sounds like there's broad consensus for supporting urban gardening for putting forward a motion calling on you know the board and the Parks Department and the relevant community based organizations specifically washing eighths in wood, food Council on possibly NY RP other, you know maybe Anastacio and her and the Riverside parks Conservancy, all the various parks based organizations working together to identify possible areas for urban gardening looping in Board of Education the possible school site. Looking at you know, whatever the sites may be to try and do more of this and including you know if there are any buildings to vertical gardening. So does that kind of hit all the did all the things in the Manhattan borough president's office, because she's clear well, it would be going among other people to her. So, yes, obviously AGA access. Yes, those about saying and I would say, especially considering the fact that the two areas that the food transfer identified are not usable right, daddy need soil mitigation, there's a whole bunch that goes into this, but I think the next step and again I do not think we need to solve all the problems now, but I think passing a resolution saying you know we really support this in theory. What do we do to have more of the conversation so show of hands? So that was a show of hands of the committee? We've got Nobles me Sally Danielle count me Liz who's that Ayesha you were I was just ask, is Alexis still on the call. I know she had to hop off for something. So no is there anybody else on the committee tenure yeah I already got you I would be willing to include an item just because they mentioned the issues with funding. Would it be wrong to also advocate for funding? Oh yeah, that totally goes I'm, sorry that that's totally baked into the conversation we're always when we say that we support something and there's a there's, a price tag to it. There's a there's either part of the resolved or of be it. Further RESOLVED is, and we call on the people with money in this to like London, so yeah I mean a hundred percent. Thank you, then we've got Sally I will be drafting a resolution and sending it around I will do my level best to give you more notice than the 12 hours. I gave you on the last one so that y' all can put in whatever are the things that I forgot, because I'm good but I'm, not that good. So I always forget something and everybody helps me do even better work. I just want to get one thing: Jeremy, sorry, I'm, sorry to Interrupt. Did you say it was five people or six people, because I Daryl's on the call, Oh, Daryl I, think also had to go Oh Carol going once going twice: yeah, Daryl and Alexis. Both. Let me know that they had conflicting zooms and could not be on more than one of the time, so I think we still have Quorum. So next, we've got Omar, Etta Mariela I think are the only other board members who are not committee members. How do you vote I? Will? Yes, anything that lessens our food desert I'm all for it great Mariela, a vote in favor fantastic. Thank you, everybody all right! Thank you! I'm! Sorry! Oh my bad, sorry, Leo. How do you vote? Yes, one more for outstanding I also see a Steve I. Do not know if that's Steve Simon, no, okay, thanks! It is not. He would be not voting due to conflict anyway, good point, so all right with that it is 8:07. I would like to bring in Elizabeth Michelle. Oh I'm, sorry, this is we're running a little bit behind and I just want to ask a Spector Harris to bear with us. We will be getting to you soon and thank you so much for your patience and your continued presence and to officer Paris as well. So with that, we've got presentation on proposed temporary art installation in Fort, Tryon Park, I Elizabeth, here I can share my actually says: I need screen, sharing ability. All right. Are you still on the call? Did I get off the call the webinar ends? Oh all right, can you cue up Elizabeth to screen share? Yes, let me find her also I do not know you can see if the artist is here. His name is Zach Landsberg Wow, if he's able to, if you can, if he's here, and you can enable him yeah, let's well I'm, going to there, we go Zach asked on there. We go so straight rice, yeah great should be able to share screen. I got it here, so I'm Elizabeth miss Ella I'm, the senior public art coordinator at NYC, Parks, we've done quite a few projects and district 12, most recent of which is the birds on Broadway, which got a little bit of an extended stay due to New York pause. So they'll, be there a little bit longer. There's one a yoga plan Park, but the project I'm here I'm here tonight to share with you is the winning proposal from the Claire Weiss emerging artist award, which I believe Jennifer hop has shared with you in our open call, went out so the committee met and we selected Zach Lambert Landsberg proposal, which I'll share with you in a moment, but first just to share some background with you on the award. It's named for Claire Weiss, who was formerly a public art coordinator for NYC Parks, who sadly passed away in 2010 in her honor, her family and friends founded this award. We previously awarded it in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 15 one project in each borough, each of those artists, got$ 10,000, to create the proposed artwork. We did the same. We brought it back again, five years later, so the open call, you may recall, was at the end of last year. We reviewed proposals earlier this year shortly before everything changed in the world. Luckily, we are coming back into permitting public art again, but Noma and the Fort Tryon Park trust, assisted in sharing the open call with uptown artists. At that time the award was available to artists and emerging artists. That's not a student, an artist who's. You know I had some experience, but they're not too extensive, not really having gallery representations. We want to give our we're kind of starting out or in early stages of their career, an opportunity to show their work outdoors. The location that was selected was in Fort Tryon, Park, Linden Plaza. The park was selected because it was Claire's favorite park, she's lived uptown. This is very important to her and we're honoring her legacy by having the artwork there for this round. Here's a rendering I'll get into some more details. It might look familiar to those of you who have been to the cloisters. The artwork is called the to message. A of Margaret Corbin and we're looking at installing in October it'll, be on view for one year, everything's very tentative right now, hopefully we'll be permanent public art. Then, of course we do not really can't really won't know, but we would never force an artist to grow and install it was unsafe. So right now, that's our tentative plans. We're happy to let you know when it will actually be going into the park, so it may look like it's made out of stone, but it's actually made out of plywood plaster, resin and Exterior paint. I have the size here on the screen, as well as the weight. So basically it honors several different aspects of Fort Tryon Park, one being it's Revolutionary War history, specifically the historical figure of Margaret Corbin, who also has quite a few namesakes in the park as well as The Cloisters Museum. It's based on examples of French and Spanish, two messages which are on display in the cloisters, but instead of using medieval motifs Zak has put in kind of American motifs on coats of arms that Stars and Stripes instead of family Heraldry ego instead of dogs or lions, giving her a shield and armor, but also a tri- corner hat and Revolutionary War Aragon rituals. In addition to honoring kind of the local aspects. It also is taking a female historical figure I'm, giving her some representation in the park and just to give you some installation details, the sculpture will be cast up, say and brought to the site and several pieces for assembly. It can be anchored to the asphalt or it can be weighted interior, so it does not mean to be bolted down. As with other projects, the artists are required to restore the site to its original condition. Once it's done so any holes in the pavement would be patched up. We have not yet determined where exactly in Lindon Terrace. It will go on just because we have not had a site visit yet due to social distancing, but we will meet there to find a location that won't impede regular news of that area of the park and in a place that you know gives both the park and the artwork justice and I do not know if zach wants to just share some information about the artwork and the inspiration or about his work as an artist yeah I can do that. I mean I. Think it's pretty summed up by the presentation, but there's another like additional detail, that in the 1920s, the League of Women, Voters or the daughters of the revolution, sorry push to have Margaret Corbin recognize that she was the first woman to fight for the US military and they located what they thought were her remains and they interred them in the West Point. The military kind of setup turns out, they tested those bones and it's not her. That was a couple years ago. I think it 2017. So this will kind of serve as like a kind of pseudo like serious memorial for that. Well, yeah I am an emerging artist. Public art is my focus and I specialize in site, specific installation work and yeah I particularly make pains to tailor my work to the site that it's in so yeah I'm happy to answer any questions. If you have them I love this piece and I'm blown away to learn that her remains, which were interred at West. Point are not her remains. That's a stunning bit of information. Do people have I think if we can pull it up yet? No bows! Oh yeah, this is so awesome, I'm extremely excited. So my question was you know this is going to be open to the public. I saw plaster is a piece of it. Will it be able to handle a load sitting on it, yeah 100%, so the material is like a plaster resin, so the specialty product gets plaster with like a kind of specialized resin to hold it really tight. So if you recast a gargoyle on the side of a building, that's what the stuff is made of. So it's very sturdy and it's not yeah. It's specifically exterior outdoor plaster. The box itself is going to be really heavily like over built and reinforced, and so yeah the finish is going to be paint and I think there people will touch it. People will sit on it and I think the wear and tear might actually help it because yeah it'll make it look more authentic I think that's super cool I love that I just love that okay, we've got Darrell, who is back I, think I did I successfully promoted. You I think all you did was unmute me. Okay! Well, we'll take it. I think you can turn on your video. If you want, did you have a question or you just need it to be? Unmuted me yeah, oh noes, just to be promoted-. Okay, excellent! Were you by chance in the back for the conversation about the urban gardening No? Okay, then I will not record your vote on that, but Richard almond actually was here for that discussion and he votes yes. So if you could just note that nobles not Jennifer, do you need you do not need a resolution. Elizabeth for this is just you know, it's just informational, since it is temporary okay. Well, this is super. Exciting I can't wait for it to be installed. I certainly hope that when we get to the commemorative Battle of Fort Washington in November, this is fully and I hope that we're able to I do not know have public gatherings at that point and that we're able to incorporate this wonderful piece of art into whatever is the observance of the Battle of Fort Washington, whether it's real or virtual and Zach I love this piece. It is site- specific in the best possible way. I've never seen a lion in Fort, Tryon Park, but I've seen Eagles in the area. So this is great. This is just great. Unless the plan is yes I, the plan can not being hurt yeah. The plan is to feature it as part, the Battle of Fort Washington, and you know we hire a woman channel or to be Margaret Corbin at that reenacting festival each year, and this will happily be incorporated to work and we want the four train trust we'll invite Zach, along with the parks Creme, to give a artists, talk and try to have some sort of reception, so people more people can hear sort of the backstory. The inspiration also learn more about Claire, a pretty powerful woman in the arts world who this award is named, for it was a Washington Heights president, fantastic, just fantastic. Thank you all so much for this just marvelous presentation can you post it on installation and if and when we're able to have a gathering in the park that as well super? Thank you yeah. All right, you all, are you're welcome to stay on for the call or to continue on with whatever else you might have had planned for a Tuesday evening, and with that at 8:21 we move to Jennifer's 8:22. We move to Jennifer's Parks report and I know that a lot of people had questions that they were throwing up into the chat and just know that all of the panelists are able to monitor that including Jennifer. So your questions have been read and hopefully we will have some answers. Sure is haha. Okay, thank you. So much Liz and the committee for having me I just want to say that we're glad that for tryin and Inwood Hill Park have served as safe havens for peaceful and productive protests. These past few weeks, I do not know if everybody on this call knows that local youth had a peaceful protest on Sunday in Fort, Tryon, Park, she's, really wonderful and lots of families in fits game and the police were there, as well as the parks enforcement patrol, as they had been last Sunday when the protests happened. So thank you. Everyone for making sure that that's data, safe Orange, express all of our mom, said about the injustice--is and I'm glad everyone felt safe and, like those places were for everyone, you know sorry, it's our second home on some coab. It updates I just want to make sure that everyone on this call knows that the Parks Department has partnered. With the Health and Hospitals corporation. We have a testing center in the Highbridge pool, which is pretty phenomenal. It almost looks like an Arctic Science Center, it's worth going to look at just because of its you know physical traits. More importantly, though, it can test up 2,000 people a day, it's ours or 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 8:00 p.m. and there's no out-, of- pocket cost, no appointments needed and that's a to 301 Amsterdam Avenue I also wanted to give a shout out to the park staff. I'm, not sure everybody on this ball knows, but the Parks Department has been a part of eleven ongoing food distribution sites and we've given out twenty- seven million meals during this pandemic. So we're not we're not only meeting people's spiritual needs. You know and gathering needs in the parks we're providing for their for their well- being social distance updates. This may touch on one of Jennifer Bristol's comments from there our park ambassadors, their Parks Department ambassadors. The NYPD is that ambassadors Department of Environmental Protection, has that had ambassadors they're, also a new round of ambassadors that their main task is educating on social distancing and handing out masks and their hours will be up until later. In the evening, Jennifer had said: you'd seen people given out masses in the morning the ambassadors I've worked with, who had been assigned in with then they're up, til 6:00 p.m. we're hoping to have longer hours and now with this new round. If you do see people not practicing same social distancing, you can call 3- 1- 1, there's also a new app. The city has, if you're concerned or just moved to another area of the park. If that's feasible, facility closures, I know there was lots of expectation. Since the governor's phase, one included tennis courts that the cities would the city stays, one does not include tennis courts and as of right now, sports field permits have been rescinded through August 31st special event permits have been put on hold through June I expect, with all of the recent mass gatherings, there's a desire to sort of wait and see if there's going to be another spike in cases. But the city is monitoring and you know it's numbers and staffing. There is no season old staff, this upcoming budget cycle and what can actually be sustained in terms of public safety. So the no barbecuing rule stays in effect at dog runs playgrounds, tennis, courts, basketball and handball are still are still closed. Again, like I said, more will probably become clear in the next two weeks host the number of large- scale gatherings. Are we holding questions for the end chair? Sorry for asking? Are we holding questions for the end, we're holding questions for the end unless they're quick, clarifying questions to repeat something? She's just said, like you said that you rescinded ballfields permits through July or August 31st, okay, but yeah other general questions. Let's wait till the end of her okay, coyote update the wildlife unit wants to make sure and I made an announcement about this. A few meetings ago we have got Eastern coyotes they're living within Inwood Hill Park two coyotes been confirmed to be residing in that area and the Wildlife Division, when the Parks Department has no reason to believe they're unhealthy or pose a threat. That said, many people do get excited the first time they see a coyote most coyotes are not dangerous and they actively try to avoid people. There are some simple coexistence guidelines. I can send those Flyers out to the Community Board and ask that they get circulated. Do not try to befriend the coyote or feed it because then you sort of confuse it. It's become sort of habituated to people, but then there may be a trigger and sort of reverts back to its. You know other instincts, and then it might harm a person so best to observe from a distance. Do not feed them. Protect your pets always keep your pets on leash and do not allow your pet to approach or play with the coyote and keep coyotes wary. If you're approached by a coyote make yourself look bigger than you are waving your arms and making loud noises, and then you know you can continue on your way once the coyote retreats so I'll send around this coyote smart in English, Phoenix I got Donnie in, but we wanted to make sure. Everyone was aware that it's happening some of the questions that came up in the feed about erosion on the pathways in Inwood Hill. We do currently have a stock truck for cleaning out dreams sounds horrendous, but it's helpful. We also are the parks, departments, trails and stewardship vision is leading plantings, closing desire lines to help with arrocha. They also have had for 16 weeks a gap, training program, a young adult training program, helping us in the natural areas of Inwood Hill Park they've been digging out the drainage sails along 2 miles of our 4 miles of March hiking trail to help with that. Do not build up, make it more navigable and then clear out drains for preventing erosion. The MTA also has a current contract to clean out our fields. You see lots of MTA work in the in the in the would help arc right now. There are four different projects. One of them is cleaning out. The out falls, you may know we get, unfortunately, runoff from the Henry Hudson Parkway bridge, we okay, we have a budget cuts, allowing we've already programmed some state of good repair capital funding for pathways and Inlet$ 800,000, so that will advance that will help some of our more problematic pathway areas where we need to do more plantings, where we have drainage issues and surface issues, because the water scours the paths and as Jennifer Bristol mentioned earlier. What happen if we're trying to get turned big potholes? Somebody mentioned the Martian generation area. In the fencing we're aware, we've purchased fencing, we've W, we purchased fencing, we're working with the stewardship division and Inwood sprouts, a community group, as well as with our Natural Area volunteers in the parks, Departments natural areas group to come up with a comprehensive way to restore that Marsh regeneration area. That's the Marsh moving acrosss the path because formerly as Allegra points out formally, that was all water by gaelic field was water and they changed the shipping. Now we're working on a plan for that and it got put on hold for Covid-19, but it includes planting new and interpretive signage. So more people understand if that's an asset and it's not an afterthought. I saw Simon and a few other people's comments about unfortunate noise in Whitwell Park I know: we've got the inspector from the parks Enforcement Division on this call, Asha Harris who's. Hearing, oh, and seeing all these comments, I will take them back as well and I know we have Christian Perez from the 34th precinct. Nypd gets all of your 3- 1- 1 calls, and that can help with when police deployment should happen. We can't be everywhere all once we have six hundred and sixty acres, but having more pinpointed information helps us identify what the patterns are. So then we can deploy. According the scooters are a much more difficult issue, because they're motorized they're hard to catch up to so Chris wants to answer that question later I'm aware of the pathway condition at Da, Iman I just walked it yesterday or Sunday night, we'll put in work request for those to be filled as well as the new potholes that formed from the storm behind em Loftus somebody by its own issues, it was determined that quiet zone does not hold up legal to legal challenge, not a real official designation. So what we can do is have enforcement speak to people you're allowed to have low- level music you're not allowed to have high- level music that affects everyone around you and the apartment buildings acrosss the street, so that it's certainly a problem. We need to continue to work on. Let's see the level of enforcement yeah, like I, said six hundred and sixty acres, so it is a challenge and Memphis city's fiscal plate right now. The seasonal plan is not advancing, so we will not be getting that inch likes of staffing we usually get to handle sort of spring summer. Early fall, so I think that addressed most of the questions in the chat. I do see sort of two lingering questions. One is regarding the green, the new green signs, the big signs that are mounted on wood. Can you just clarify is no amplified sound. One of the things that's on that new signage. That's a yes/, no question! Yes, excellent and correct me. If I'm wrong, there are new green signs at Ocean, Park items the Isham Street entrance to Indian to Inwood Hill Park at the to 18th and Indian Road entrance to the park, they're kind of all over the place, so that regulation is in there I'm going to consider that question asked and answered, and there there's just multiple questions. Some in the chat somewhere, my phone is exploding and some from emails. Earlier myself do not have a dog I have a stuffed dog. He does not need to go into a dog run, but I understand that a lot of people would like to see dog runs open and are not quite understanding. What's the issue with social distancing, and is there not some way to have imposed some kind of social distancing requirements or maximum capacity, whatever I'm kind of mystified as to what's the problem with reopening the dog runs and I would love for you to explain it to me understanding that this is not your personal decision and even if you possibly disagree with the city policy, we may not be able to say that so I well to be truthful. I have not been part of the discussions as to why they're closed I know: we've taken it to high levels. City hall, I can find out what the rationale was behind them, not nod reopening, but I. Think a big you know question mark is what can we? How much can we actually monitor right if the goal is to protect lots of bunching up and close proximity, the closeness issue, how many different facilities do we have the capacity to do that act? So my expectation is that's one of the driving forces. Okay, I'd have to I'd, have to go back and ask for sort of. Is there like a policy paper on that, because I have not seen all right so in the interests of wanting to have a robust conversation about barbecuing and understanding that it's already 837? Can all the committee members turn on your video? So here's the thing I do not think that a resolution calling on the parks Department to reopen the dog runs and to figure out how to do that safely is actually the best way to go, because that's a little too slow a resolution would be. You know we would have to wait until the full board and then the full board would pass it. Then it takes a couple of days to get it to in front of the Commissioner. I am begging you in the strongest possible terms and I think if I unmuted everybody there would be raucous screaming and yelling in agreement show of hands thumbs up agreement, not agreement. I'm begging you to express to the borough, commissioner and the Commissioner that there is strong community feedback in support of reopening the dog runs and coming up with. You know some kind of parameter, and you know that may involve some kind of self policing component some kind of honor system, some kind of admin that you know. This is why we can or can not have nice things like you got to make sure you're, not overcrowding, or else we're going to have to shut down. The dog runs again something because it's a problem and it's becoming a problem in the non dog run areas for people who do not have dogs, because people who do have dogs are kind of at their wit's end on what to do with their dogs. Sure and people are taking their dog off leash and then that's you know, then we got Amy Cooper and then we just like wait. Can we please open up? The dog runs, please I'll, happily take that back. Yeah I know yeah there we go. I know I, know okay. So unless there are super burning question, my hands raised: okay, quick 30. Second, questions I'm going to try to make this as concise as possible. Even though it's not a complex question and subject this pertains to Jennifer what you said about enforcement I. Guess there's not a lot of time to explain all of the nuances of this but I'm just trying to understand, given the fact that there has been an increased presence of NYPD and Parks Police in the parks and just everything that's happening in the world right now, I'm, just really trying to understand like how it decided when parks and forces something versus when NYPD enforces something and if there's been like a decision made to increase it to a by a certain percentage right now, because I'm just I'm noticing a lot of police in the park, namely Inwood Hill Park and the Dyckman fields. But we maybe have inspector Harris speak to that and Amy. Can you hear me I'm sorry little louder inspector yeah? Can you hear me yes, okay, first I'd like just for you guys not on being able to see me I was having problems with my video earlier, so I just wanted to apologize to you all and hopefully on the next call. I will, or you guys will get to see me and meet me in person. In regards to your question in regards to NYPD, presents I can't necessarily speak to why my PD would put additional officers. As we know, there are protests that have been occurring, so that could be one reason for the increase of NYPD at the locations that you mentioned in regards to parks enforcement patrol. Our peace officers have been put in areas where we may have received 301 complaints, or we may have gotten calls in regards to social distancing violations, so that would be a reason why you would see an increase in kept officers at a particular location. Thank you. Thank you. Chris. You got anything to add to that. Well, as we all know, you know, we've had a few pop- up protests that have taken place in the park or vended in the park. So that's a reason for the increase in the police officers in the park, but we've also had an increase in who want fog and, as you all know, she's seen in the news. The department wants us to respond to those throwing calls in a you know within 45 minutes of the call. So a lot of the officers that we've had on hand have been dispatched to attend to those calls. Thank you well I see you Nobles, but I next Sally, then Domingo and then Nobles. Although up to din this question, what are the Pepa hours and how many police officers are out there and what and at what times ii, just note that there are baseball games going on and with hip hop and third, just a question following up some last meeting, Steve had said that, with the in would help our nature center, that y' all were trying to get back, declared essential construction and I wonder what the status of that was. I guess I could just add construction on many of our projects began yesterday and we're expecting in the very near future to have her many of them back in construction with the inward Nature Center. The issue there is when it will actually start, will check into that and get back to you. Thank you. Thank you. Steve. Next, we've got oh I'm, sorry, yes, how many officers do we have inspectors in the north? We have a contingent. I do not have an exact number at this time. We have a few employees that have been out due to Colvin, but we do have a contingency in the North base command with a sergeant and officers assigned. So I can get you the up- to- date numbers in regards to staffing, but again I've had a few employees that have been out to Dakota and they're ours. We have coverage in the borough from around 7:00 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. on any given day, but that's full borough coverage. So if let's say you did place in at all and we had a unit available, we could send that unit to the sector. Even if the sector did not have coverage great, thank you yeah Domingo, oh yeah. My question was for Jennifer. It was regarding potential because my concern is if somebody who works with about five hundred kids in the summer right, what it like the Parks Department, has to and then I thank God Steve is here, like you have to take ownership of what are these kids going to do check outside in a block you know like there has to be something that work together with the nonprofit's figure something out, but these parts have to be open to be able to provide services to these kids, like you can't just automatically assume that they're just going to stay home, it's not going to happen. You know and to Sally's point in the protect people gain the ship better beat out of them by cops. So okay, I'm going to get let nobles have the last word and then we really have to move the agenda because we've got a whole other agenda item. I can save you time. I will try. Okay, if I could speak that because I do not know if I heard the answer to the question, I texted you was that address. I did not hear that I'm. Sorry. What was your in relation to our permits back in effect, so that people can have events in the park is: are there minimum or a maximum gathering size? If people wanted to have like small children's birthday or some type of sports activities, are they able to do that gather a mess? Okay. Thank you. Inspector Harris I just want to point out there's a lot of chat going on about a current condition, as we speak with respect to a lot of amplified sound up in Inwood Hill Park. So if you have the ability to communicate with some of your other officers, some of your officers who may be on the ground, it would be fantastic if you could pay some attention to that particular situation. I can't speak to it myself, because that's a mile away that would be. We have an unusual opportunity that there are people complaining, and here you are so we can make you directly aware of that to possibly deal with that. Thank you excellent. Thank you very much. Okay, it is now 849 and I do apologize that we are not going to have nearly as much time to talk. Barbecuing which I have to say is technically grilling. It's not barbecuing. We can have a culinary discussion at some other time, but regarding the regulations and the placement of barbecuing or grilling facilities, where it is an is not allowed what the regs are and some issues around. You know: noise, sanitation, trash, pickup, there's a whole fire safety component, I will say: there's a sound argument, I think a basement. This is based I'm, giving this preamble not based, on my opinion, I'm trying to concisely summarize some of the feedback that I've gotten in the time period. Since we threw this out as an agenda item, there are people who really like grilling, because it's an opportunity to get together with friends and family. There are people who really do not like it, because it attracts large crowds. Some people are sometimes people do a really good job cleaning up after themselves. Sometimes they do not oftentimes people clean up after themselves and raccoons come and totally destroy trash. So, even though people did a good job of cleaning up, you would not know that, because animals have come and had a field day, there are a number of environmental concerns, given that we do not allow smoking of cigarettes or cigars in parks. Why would we allow fuel barbecuing? That's arguably much dirtier than either cigarette or cigar smoke? There are a number of issues around equity and who's, afraid of whom that has nothing to do with grilling and everything to do with why people are demonstrating in the streets and there's also, this whole issue of permitting not happening because of Covid-19. But clearly people are gathering together in large groups anyway, and what are sort of the desired or not desired enforcement issues around that as it relates to both noise, sanitation and social equity. So it would be helpful if we could just get a quick clarification from Jennifer as to where are the areas where barbecuing is actually permissible. There have been some specific questions in the chat and through email about why there is barbecuing on the peninsula and what Hill Park as opposed to the Dyckman fields, which is also part of Inwood Hill Park, and then, when you can clarify what the permissible areas are I'm going to open it up for Q&A and I'll, be taking stacks writing down the raised hands in the order that I see it also helped protect forests. Can you lean it to your we're having some weird it's hard to tell now it's a little. It's a little choppy my internet connection, I think so terrible idea. I guess yeah Steve, if Steve, if you could take over well I, just want to add that there is an area in Fort, Washington Park, which is not under Jennifer's jurisdiction, where we allow barbecuing north of 150 history going up towards the soccer and baseball fields going up towards the Discovery playground. So it's a it's an area that stretches for gosh, maybe seven or eight blocks along the river see us on this night north of 158. Excuse me, it says on your website, north of 158 right. Okay, all right class of 138. Is there anything in hybrids, but there's also barbecuing a south of 150 history? Okay, is there? Is there anything in hybrids, I I'm, not sure, let's wait for Jennifer to get back. Oh I'm, not sure that there is okay, I'd like to start going through some of the raised hands. I see several of the committee members, but I'm actually going to jump in and allow some of the public members to ask questions first, since they have not really had the opportunity to do that. So we've got Lauren. Elmore, hey I am an in wit member I'm, the president of in Wolf for a 1c3 that runs the homers dog, run Hill Park, I guess. My question is connected to something Jennifer said. Unfortunately, right now with the barbecuing and she said, the budget cutbacks I was not quite clear on what that meant for the spring summer and fall I walk my dog three times a day in that Park, because I live a block away and on Mondays it's basically a it's a it's a trash pit and there's they're congregated around the limited small trash cans. But it's a trash pit, every Monday, and so if what I was hearing Jennifer's say is true, is she saying that there won't be people to clean that up in a timely fashion through the summer of 2020, and what that will what the park will look like I have seen a huge increase in the number of people using the park, people who bring full backpacks thinking the woods is literally a full was and I'm like it's not that deep people I did not understand her comments to be that my understood or comments that the seasonal staff, which is like the playground associates, but those are the ones that have been cut. Not only you can address that now. The decision called on Steve I just want it for people who do not know this. In addition to being a member of Community, Board, 12 Steve is also works for the Manhattan borough commissioners, so he is quite competent to answer these questions. Well, my title has been had in chief of staff and by the way at hybrids. Park. We have a barbecue area at a hundred. Seventy seventh Street, the seasonal staff, to a great extent, does include maintenance staff that we rely upon to take care of many of our parks during the summer. So the loss of our seasonal staff will definitely have impact on our ability to maintain parks. I mean that's where we stand at the moment, so, okay, so I was so I'm connecting the increase in the use of the parks, the increase in people barbecuing I know it says you're not supposed to Barbecue, but people are and the fact that there won't be people I'm used to saying hello to all the people on Monday mornings who come and pick up the trash that sort of gets scattered. We're not going to see that this summer. Is that what you all are saying, no I'm saying we're not going to see as many people as we've had in past summers: we're not going to be completely bereft of staff, but we are going to be it at a significantly reduced level. Okay, so with that said, all of these things are completed. I think you all realize this. It's really important that we find some answers regarding reopening the parks, a lot of people cook, things that are actually deadly to dogs, not just dangerous or annoying, but deadly. So right now all we have are the general areas where everyone else is and the woods and if we're not, if we do not have the Run, which is a sacred space for the dogs, I'm really scared, especially if there's going to be a decrease in the amount of people. Cleaning I'm really scared that there is going to be real, that our that our home, that our pets that our family members are going to are going to suffer the consequences of this no point extremely well made and thank you and thank you for your patience, because it's been a long meeting. Okay, Jen Bristol I. Do you have just faculty to have yeah just the only thing with the dog run is and I'm sure Lauren can I mean we have a bigger dog run, obviously we're lucky, but my concern, or what really needs to be addressed, is that dog runs for the last 20-something years. Our self policed that you have to use peer pressure. You have to speak up because I know I'm. You know there needs to be some monitoring stuff. We wanted open, but there needs to be something because people will just I mean the park is just there are no rules in the park anymore and no one's going to listen. Unless there's really monitoring and it's I just right and where I'm really trying to focus this conversation on barbecuing, that's pretty strong conversation about the dog runs speak less. During that I kept saying, can I speak and I speak I'm a dog owner I'm, the only dog owner like I'm I, kept saying that in the chat? That's why I got frustrated. You know one calls on me yeah. So that's why I? Thank you very much! I, okay, Joseph Kleeman! Are you still on the call I'm looking Joseph cleamen going once? Ah there we go! No yeah. Can you hear me? Sorry, yeah, sorry, Ed. My thing, muted thanks. My name is Joe I live by Inwood, Hill Park and it's the first Community board meeting I've been to in years and I came to me because I saw that flyer and my heart really sank. When I saw the flyer, because I thought it was pretty unwelcoming I know, III see the peninsula from my window and there's lots to you know: there's an impact on quality of life when there's a lot of people barbecuing in the park, but I just think there are things we should keep in mind. Those of us who are lucky enough to live on or near the parks, it's a public park and the people who own it and the people have a right to enjoy it and I. Think right now, one with Coronavirus a lot of people are cooped up in the city with nowhere to go for fresh air relaxation. Some of those people love barbecuing and we should make sure there's room for them in the park too. I think at this exact moment. All of us really need to understand that the public spaces in this country belong to everyone in this country, and everyone should feel welcome in them. I want you to be able to enjoy the public spaces without fear of getting a cold shoulder or harassment or worse, so I understand that their quality of life issues, but I wanted to come here tonight as a member of the community. As someone who lives near the park on the park with a view of the park and say that, from my perspective, the part belongs to all of us a lot of people, love barbecuing in the park with their friends and family, and we have to support one another and if it were on the table, I would support an expansion, BBQ area and that's all I wanted to say. Thank you. I appreciate your comments. Next up, we've got Hilda, yes, hi good evening, everyone, my name is Hilda and I am a resident of Inwood and I'm. Half a block from Inwood Hill, Park I've lived in this community 40 years and I am extremely concerned and against extending the barbecuing in Inwood Hill Park. Primarily because they are using the peninsula now for barbecuing and that area during the summer months is left in shambles. There's garbage live charcoal, but the loud music, and what happens is that it invites people come in with their cars and they double Park and they block traffic. Just this evening, I walked my dog and they were blocking traffic and the police were out there. Handing out tickets and the garbage truck could not get through some years ago. This situation happened and an ambulance could not get through coming for a man who had suffered a heart attack. They had to get out of the ambulance and run down the hill to treat him. So this is a really big concern of mine, and this goes on every summer. I dread it because the park is for the most part, people do respect the park and we love the park and it is. It is a public park for everyone to enjoy. However, there are part those who do not have the same sentiment and could care less about that part and they are destroying it every summer we go through this and I am completely against extending any barbecue. In that part, that's a match. I hear that and I just want to make extremely clear that at which you may have missed at the beginning of the meeting. At no point at no point at no point was there ever a plan specifically to expand barbecuing in Inwood Hill Park, the farm bill you key man I just want to be really clear about that. This is the board. This is not the community board of Inwood Hill Park. This is the Community Board of Community Board 12, which goes from 155Th Street all the way up through and past, in wood, Hill Park. So I hear you loud and clear, I'm going to move to the next speaker, which is Katherine Levin. Can you hear me? Yes, ma'am hi, I'm, Cathy and I'm, a co- founder of the Inwood Hill Park Conservancy, with Adam mark Nick and I think that the community is because of Covid-19. It's really important that I mean people have brought up about barbecuing about having things to do and I think that part of the culture of our lives is changing, and so much of it is an opportunity for us to make changes in a positive way. So if it is possible to bring plantings in, if it is possible, I mean I certainly will help organize trash collections. You know for early Monday morning or things like that, even though we're not supposed to gather what have you because I think as a community in word is very special and we want to be our nature. We want to see the forest and the and the wetlands preserved and that's part of our mission, so anything that we can do to improve this. You know glorious wildlife is important to us and I'm willing to work with all kinds of people and helping that so I mean BBQing is not really on the forefront of that, but I understand people's needs for it, but if we can help contain it clean it up, keep it. You know away from the animals. Oh my this important. Thank you. Peter Schoen ski Peter Peters go in ski, going once going twice: yes, excellence. Look, it's I live in Inwood around Columbia City area and I'm working from home right now and I've been working from home for past three months: I love going to the parks and lately what I've seen is, unfortunately, a situation where every Monday, when I am actually going to park, I see a lot of garbage strewn around I, see the garbage being flown into the river into the peninsula and there's actually one parks person that manually collects all that stuff into a garbage bag, which is great. But then that's on a Monday morning that I'm actually seeing on a Tuesday morning. The garbage mostly has been collected, but then there's holes because there was no garbage pickup right. So it's we're back to square one where the garbage that has been collected is now strewn around because of the rodents, the squirrels, the rats whatever it is, and you know I, you know, look barbecuing grilling I love it, but you know at the same time, I do find that there's not enough resources to accommodate that. So what I would like to do is I would like to have more resources in the park to be able to actually clean up the park so that we do not have garbage ending up in Birds bellies. We do not see garbage being thrown to the river because of the wind. Most people are trying to actually clean up after themselves. There's just not enough garbage cans right can't. We have like several containers, perhaps that people can actually physically put their garbage in. As I said, people want to clean the park. There is not enough resources for them to do so. Yes, if you could respond to that. Yes, great there's also been a question for inspector Harris to just give some information about the names of who, where the personnel assigned up here and if she can provide her contact. Information here would be great and also to the 34th precinct. Can you so just on the trash issue? We did just put out several more trash cans, because people had wrote about the prior weekend where people do try to put their trash away, but there are not enough cans to contain it. All so they're putting it next to it and then, as you mentioned, the aunt the raccoons got abundant wildlife. You know skunks get into it and spread it, so we have added more cans to that end and we're working on a trash management plan, because we only have so many people who are qualified to drive the garbage truck and takes time once it's full to drop it off for the Sanitation dump. We're trying to see. Where can we sort of save time so the garbage can operate with higher level of frequency, okay, Thank, You inspector Harris, I'm done you and me yes, I'm! Sorry, can you repeat the question? The question is, or can you provide your? Can you provide the names of the staff, the pep staff, who are up here, who are assigned up here, and can you provide your contact information and also make sure to provide your contact information to the precinct if they do not already have it? One of our public members is also an officer in the 34th Precinct Community Council and would like your contact information. Okay. So we have sergeant barreto and sergeant move air. Oh that's in Manhattan north my name is Asha Harris, Aasha Harris and my contact number is two one. Two, three six zero one: four three that's the office number and then my work cell phone number is six four: six: zero, five, seven, zero! Four excellent! Thank you very much I. These could I just mention yeah! You have a. We have a if people think that they should just reach out directly to the inspector. Whenever there's a problem, we have a 24/7 communications, a number which may actually provide a more rapid response in certain situations depending upon the hour of the day, and people may want to make note of that ten number, which is six four six one, three one two zero and that's a 24-hour number for pet. That's a 24-hour number to reach anybody in the parks Department, including pet. Okay. If you could do me a favor, nobles and I think it's really appropriate to include that number. I just did yeah, but maybe not necessarily inspector Harris's work, so nothing I did that before I go to the next speaker when there's an emergency, you do not want to necessarily call pet if it's an emergency, if there's a crime, if you're feeling threatened. If there's someone who seems emotionally disturbed or there's a fire, you call 911 he's life issues, so this entire conversation has been pretty much around like noise and trash I feel comfortable moving on I do before I. Take the next speaker, though, there's been a lot of back- and- forth in the chat. I just want to have not as a discussion point but as a statement followed by a request. I had recently seen the new green signage at Indian Road and to 18th Street. There are a number of people in the chat who are saying it's not there. So if I know that part of the advantage of the new signage is it can be fabricated, in- house and easily replaced if it needs to be replaced. So, if you can, you know, have a maintenance detail, just check the perimeter of the park and make sure that the signage that's supposed to be there is there I can tell you. There is no signage in my den and that's the only thing that I can say for sure. I certainly did not mean to suggest to people that I knew something that they did not or to doubt the veracity of what people who live on Indian Road were asserting. So if you could just make sure that the site it's supposed to be there is there. That would be fantastic. Absolutely. That I would really like to conclude the discussion with respect to signage, so we've got on the committee Danielle and then Domingo and Sally. Yes, okay, so I have a bunch of points that I want to make so bear with me. The first thing I want to say is because we did not really address why this discussion or how it was born, why we decided to add it to the agenda, and so I had proposed it at the last meeting, because I observed over several years that the Barbecue area is tend to become very crowded and that there's a need right. So I think that if there's a community need, especially given that we're in a time of Kovac when we should be social, distancing and granted, the barbecuing areas are not yet open, but we're going to be moving in that direction, and so I guess my thought process was okay. So there are a lot of people bar barbecuing and when we return to barbecuing and the parks being you know usable we're going to want to have the opportunity or people you know we're going to need the opportunity to social distance while they barbecue so I. Think that's the first thing that I want to say. The next thing I want to say is somebody made the point about quality of life and I. Think it's important to understand that parks are multi- purpose. Multi- use somebody made a point about the forefront of people's needs and how barbecuing is not at the forefront of people's needs. I think that's sort of subjective, I think some folks like to enjoy the marshes some folks like to walk their dogs. Some folks like to use the dog run, and some folks like to Barbecue- and perhaps you know the folks that Barbecue are not the folks that own their dogs and that you that observe that enjoy the Marsh and I think it's just important to be mindful of that, and so my I do not necessarily support expanding any one particular area. I do think it would be nice to expand to the along the Hudson, where or sorry along the Harlem River Drive like where that sort of enters there's like a portion. I do not know what that is called, but I think I've observed people barbecuing there and I think that going back to what people have said about resources in trash I. Think that my like another thought that I had in raising this is that if we do officially expand these areas, then it would allow us to argue for additional resources, part staff and trash receptacles and things of that nature. If it's efficiently designated so I understand that people are very concerned about trash, and perhaps we can talk about ways to address that the receptacles. Maybe we would want to shut it down for a portion of the day and you know volunteers, can you know, help collect trash like the park staff? Can you know pick it up on a Monday morning? Maybe it will be closed for a certain. You know certain time frame. I do not know I guess my hope was to bring this up to add it to the agenda and then have us all as a community kind of come together and discuss what our feelings are, so that people can enjoy the barbecuing areas because it tends to be very crowded and yeah. That's all I have to say thanks. Thank you. I apologize I would like to ask I know that I identified a number of committee members to speak, but I forgot I overlooked, Allegra Legrand, who was in the queue and so I'm, going to unmute her and then we'll circle back to the rest of the committee members and then I would like to bring this meeting to a close by 9:30 Allegra. So if you could just be brief, thank you. This I appreciate the opportunity to voice my opinion in the park is a respite and a community asset for an uptown community that has very little community assets available to it. We do not have the adequate parks, facilities to, and the infrastructure to police and to maintain the level of usage that are between usage and fails. We do not have the facilities or parks person to maintain a clean parks place for people who live in the community to enjoy their park. When there are others who use the park to do barbecuing, they use a park to do scootering. They use a part to do broedcasting. They use a part to do partying and we do not have the level of infrastructure to not only control for policing be and by policing I do not mean enforcement I just mean cleaning up and maintaining facilities for the level of usage. We have more people using the park today than we had a year ago. Today we have more people who are using the park because they can not go to work there. They are, they employed the rest of their life, they are unable to go to other places and we actually have increased demand for parks, maintenance, but parks maintenance has stayed pretty much the same as what it was. A year ago we have people who are just going about their daily lives, they're trying to social distance they're, trying to work from home they're trying to make maintain their lives through this crisis. And yet you have an increased amount, the parks usage. We do not have increased trash pickups. We have solitary parks person who has the patience of Job that she goes out into the parks each morning. With this positive attitude, picking up this monumental amount of trash I meet in the interest of man, I really need you to get to the point. Until parks designates additional dollars for standard maintenance of trash pickups of additional track, not just trash cans. Trash cans have a finite volume, 50 gallons, which is insufficient to deal with the amount of trash which generated daily I. Think the trash that's generated daily, based on my observation of four to five black 50 gallon trash bags. Next to each parks, Trash Bin is only twenty two to twenty. Five percent of the actual usage required for parks has to provide additional dumpster pickups. It needs to provide additional personnel. These people, who will not just a single person who has this monumental job. We need more people who are available in the parks to maintain the parks to clean up the parks, because our community, our community, we may not be the wealthiest community who lives in zip code 124 who can afford, have a Central Park Conservancy, who has the number of garbage pickups their trash pickups to maintain our community, but people in Inwood and people in Washington Heights. We did not leave New York City because of Kabat. We stayed here. We may not have been able to go to work, but we stayed in our community. We work from home and we love this community, but we have our parks system and we need New York City to invest in the people who actually stayed in New York City, and it's not just about the trash pickups. There are other capital improvement projects which are not generally maintained in parks which, because of the enhanced usage of parks, I've become more apparent. There are potholes this that are four to five feet deep, but exist. Regular, open pasture areas, green areas in Allegra, I'm. Sorry to do this, you've had you've had now six minutes, and so we really need to move on to other speakers. What but Inwood Hill Park. We need to have a base level of maintenance for the enhanced usage that we are experiencing during this have seen how remote Allegra I need move on to other speakers Domingo. So yes, so I feel like we have support, needs, correct, Chris, yes, I know, I, understand that one of the main issues that I see here is that we actually come to a collective understanding that there is a need for resources. So what I would like to ask Jennifer is understanding that there's a need for resources in certain particular areas to be able to accommodate and thank God, the chief of staff for Manhattan this year. What could be done to because I know it's about like, for instance, for us? In the part we had an overwhelming amount of people come to our basketball games, so we bought extra receptacles during the summer to be able to create a system where we thought the park is not trash stuff that we're done right. But how is it possible? How can ordinary people come together to if we purchase the garbage, can is parks going to be able to pick up the garbage? That's my question for the for the for Steve and for Jennifer and I think what this also raises. The question around resources is: if you are so, if it's a calling for you to bring more resources, uptown then I encourage everybody here who goes that way to join the defund NYPD movement and, let's use some of those resources, be reallocated to the park, and we could use that because it seems like there's a need and no for the neighborhood Karen's right. It is now illegal to falsely called the cops on individuals. So that's one thing and the other thing is. Hopefully it will also be extended to three one call so I encourage people to be very to take it into consideration, because now you can actually face criminal charges and falsity calling the police on individuals. Thank you. So something to keep in mind. Budget cuts due to coated background, does not set its own budget. I just want everybody to understand that the City Council and the mayor negotiate for the budgets for each city agency. So pretty clear. There advocate for more funding for Parks Mm- Hmm, and someone mentioned earlier. The New York Mr. Parks is working with a lot of park. Friends groups calling on the council to ensure that at least 47 million of the 60 plus million that's being cut from the Parks Department's budget gets reinstated. So we can bring back 340 Park workers, that's New, Yorkers for parks, okay, so it's now 929 we're 30 minutes over I do not want to tell people who have their hands raised, that they can't speak so I'm going to call on the next half a dozen speakers. We're going to have everybody's going to have one minute, not more I'm, going to change up the order, because there are some people who have not had the opportunity to speak yet that I will call on before people who have had the opportunity to speak so Darrell. Thank you. I was not expecting that right now, but thanks just actually a couple questions and I'm not Steve. Still on the call, but you know obviously there's a problem crash after grilling, you know in the weekends, our other part having the same issue and if so, what's being done there. Well, we have a barbecuing issues in a number of box. I would not say that it's unique to Inwood Hill Park. We have we've had similar issues in the past it at Morningside Park for instance. So you know where we get. You know heavy BBQ usage, so you know what we've tried to do is to put on to put on later shifts in order to try to clean the park and to try to get people to leave at an earlier hour. So they do not linger into the evening to the night. But again it's a staffing issue and until we see how this new a budget shapes out shakes out, I do not know you know. I do not know that we're going to really have a good sense of where we stand and, as Jennifer pointed out, you know we did in the FY 2008, with the help of New Yorkers for parks and the City Council. We did get us a significant increase in staffing through what was called the fair play campaign, and we are hoping that the positions that were added in FY 2010 we could those are permanent to year- round positions that not the seasonal ones, we're hoping that we could at least hold on to those. So to the extent that people may want to lobby council members in support of a really fun day, our fair play is aligned. So that might be a step that you could take the last part of my question. Sorry I, just people have been talking about, you know noise and then the issues you know grilling and whatnot I'm curious. What is being said, I know you're getting signage, a lot of people say: that's not enough. Well, what can be done? How can we help people interact with other people to express their concerns? Say that's bothersome, that's too loud and you know something. Okay, the Intergroup relations in this is not as not good part of it, especially I will say that you know between the chat, the texts and the emails. One of the messages I've gotten from a member of the public is the message from all over the city, particularly in parks, needs to be that users have to do their part, because Covid-19 has totally destroyed the overall budget, so you know yeah, so I'm just going to leave that one there Jenny boom. Yes, hello. Can you hear me? Yes, thank you for calling on me I'm going to keep it brief. Basically, it seems to me the issues are trash and noise. What solutions that I have to offer and I do not know if it's possible I would love to see large dumpsters with tops that close, because I think what's happening. The smaller bins are getting overloaded trash flows out and animals in the night, get it and move it. So I would like to see that by the athletic field, the baseball field, the peninsula and the Indian Road entrance I mean that can also decrease. How often parks need to empty. Rather than going to a ton of little trash cans, they can go to a couple. Big dumpsters with the noise I would like to see some signage in the lawn like little lawn signs temporarily to let people know that might be more visible to where the noise is coming from and then I would love to see something organized like community service hours to students that might be able to volunteer in the parks to pick up trash on and volunteer that way, something for their resume something I'm sure lots of schools require hours, something that can be organized to help alleviate some of the effort on the Parks Department from picking up the trash. That's all thank you. Jennifer can you address I know that earlier it was stated that volunteer days are curtailed because of Covid-19 I can say that the Parks Department has a very robust volunteer program. I would like to suggest that, given that we've just heard that SYEP has been back to being funded, perhaps it's I have no idea how parks can possibly incorporate that and if you could address the issue of trash dumpsters. If that's a possibility-, it's one thing about trash dumpsters is you have to have a certain type of vehicle that can then go into the dumpster and lift it? It's not a vehicle that we necessarily have in our district. So in terms of operations, it does complicate things. It is something that we were able to do in the past, but now, given certain availability of like heavy duty vehicles, it's not something that we can currently do. So we can revisit that for sure. Containers you have a big volunteer program will happily expand. That I saw a grenade Cuenca from partnerships for parks on the phone earlier. If you have a project, a discrete project, view of a group that you want to bring together and go to your outreach coordinator, we can line up the tools and we can get. You started on a regular basis, volunteering in the park and we can look into SYEP. But that's also budget issue got it not to put you on the spot Rene. But if you could do me a favor and just shout out your contact information so that people who do want to form volunteer groups can do the preparatory work with you so that once that's a permissible activity, people can be primed. For that, can you hear me? Yes, I'm Renee I'm an outreach coordinator with the parks Department. Our organization is called partnerships for parks, so you're all welcome to go online and look it up, but you're welcome to email me like Jennifer, said anybody who would like to volunteer once it all goes back to normal a little bit. I'm happy always to help community members come out and support their local park, so not only through cleanups but any type of activity to bring community together. That's kind of like our goal, so email me, my email is Renee. Our e and E DOT cuenca, see you en see a parts nyc.gov and I can help you connect with any type of activity happening. So thank you very much. Ok! Next, one a volunteer in the stewardship in the forest. We have said days for that. We have training. For that. You can contact me. Thank you, artists, Dunham I, see them Thank, You, Jenny, Boone, I'm yeah, you already Colton. Alright, yes, I was going to say I. Think I already called you Sixto Medina Sixto. Can you unmute yourself? Yes, can you hear me? Can you speak up a little yes hi much better, okay right, so this is a very enriching discussion now. My problem is that most of the things that has been discussed tonight has been being discussed for the last 23:22 years that I live and working in your role. I see I patrol Indian, Road Avenue from end to end every day, I walk in the park. I walk on my dog I see everything that's going on and the same thing that is going on today. It's exactly what's been going on for 20 years for the time that I live here. I know that Homer Kennedy who live in my building and upstairs he was engaged in this battle to deal with the park situation and I know all the protagonists or the individual involved. In this thing. This is his problem. That's been going on for years, and so we use your skills or budget cuts. When we have the money we did not do the job, and so now we do not have the money because of comet. So we have a very good excuse not to do what we're supposed to do. Originally. Some buy point is this: is nothing near? What's going along this? We have a clash of culture over here. That's the other thing that some of you do not understand. You got people who come from Jersey from Connecticut. They are invited for our neighbor from our neighbors to come here, and you have all kinds of people merging into this point, because this is a beautiful part. I know that, because I am Dominica, I live in this community for 54 years in Washington, Heights in English, so I know all these people I know. What's going on. Some of you do not understand. What's going on, Mingo I have friends, I have families in this community, so the issue here is Asylum was already being said that wood is a very good point about the garbage and about the creating system. If you create a corporation I work for General Motors for 30 years, there was a system to build cars for a minute. Every minute we build one car in General Motors up in Tarrytown, so there was a system in place that would they have no failure. There was no space or time for failure. We did not lose a minute, so my point is: if we really want the part to be part of this all of us and in maintaining, if we really want everybody to enjoy the park, then we need to do a strategic planning according to the population, according to the needs, according to the resources that are available, and then we can say, okay, you can use it. We can all use the park, then 20,000 people can you support a year or 10,000, because people do not know I, know I thought of just in there. Some places them want to change to the park. Less questions I hear you. Thank you very much. Ayesha hi to begin with, I just wanted a second. What Domingo said as far as both the comments that he made about people targeting people within the park, but also different NYPD, that being said, my son is allergic to pollen and various trees, and so the park has not been a place that we have visited on a normal basis. So for me, going to the park has mostly been about events and parties. I mean like barbecues that people held in the park, so that's like for me to just go sit in the park on a regular basis. That's not been a part of my existence here in northern Manhattan, but I do appreciate being able to engage when I. Do that being said, I'm one of the things that I have seen is that there is no like not enough garbage cans, but something that I see. That's disturbing to me is people will have grilled like the what are not really disposable grills but because they're not sturdy, they do not. They do not stand up for more than one or two uses. People I've seen throw the grills into the river as well as just leave them behind, and there really is nothing in the park to say: do not do that. Put it here on knowing that I mean there's institutions that pave their walkways according to people's normal path, because they can't control how people are actually going to walk in. So why not just build the pathways that, like that, so I think that that's something that we should be doing in our parks as well. You know we'd love for people to behave a certain kind of way, but you know some things happen. The way that they do. So. Why not accommodate for that? So I think that that's just having a place where you can participate in keeping things in the fashion that we would like them to be. Would we make it easier for people to do so because I personally have been in barbecues, where it's a really long walk to get it to where it needs to be sometimes or that there's just not nothing to accommodate for whatever it is. That needs to be happening, so thank you. Sally yeah, I. Just it's not just so people understand it's not just noise and it's not just trash, there's a huge environmental risk with people destroying the salt Marsh with the trash and all these other Barbeque grills and everything else ending up in the river. So that's one of our concerns. I just wanted to check with parks. A few years ago we actually did have a group that was distributing bags and helping with the cleanup I just wanted to ask parks once the barbecue areas are reopened, especially on the peninsula. Will we be able to have pep officers there during open hours, and will you still be planning on closing the peninsula at 10 o'clock? So we're looking to partner with social Distance ambassadors to hand bags out and hand masks out at barbecue areas and I believe the peninsula is 10 p.m. but I? Can I can verify that and I know that Jackman fields is 10 p.m. okay thanks nobles and thank you I'll just keep this quick. This is more of a comment for folks on the on the line, so I just want to bring to everyone's attention that New York City parks in 2019 and correct me if I'm wrong here, chief of staff but or Jennifer, but New York, City Parks got about five hundred thirty four million dollars in 2019. Our Police Department gets six billion dollars for their budgets right when we're talking about community policing, community services, more trash special vehicles that pick up trash more Rangers. Why do not we just take a little bit of that money and put it into our parks? So really. The friction here is not between us and our culture's. The friction here, like Domingo said, is with getting more resources for our parks. So if that is the case, I would highly recommend. Take Jennifer hafez advice, mail call, tweet, Facebook your City Councilman, the mayor, anybody in city government outside of our good folks here from the parks, Department cuz. They know all too well about divesting defunding the NYPD, even just a little bit to bring more dollars to our parks. That is where the problem is. That's where your focus should be. Thank you. Thank you. You're here. I do not think anybody disagrees with needing more funding for parks. I think the last raise hand is Anastasia. Yeah speak up. Can you hear me now? Yes, okay, so I'm just going to follow up on what Nobles just said to give you guys a super easy way to do all those things you can literally sign a petition and a letter to the mayor and set a letter to your city council person, telling them to support parks and invest in our parks a great time to do so with all of the eyes on the budget. So I can share that link, I'm, just technologically challenged and can't figure out how to do so. Just cause email it to me and if you can also just say what the link is and people can write it down and we can put it in the minutes unless it's like one of those crazy long ones. Let me sorry literally give me just one second, it would be good to N. Y4P spelled like with the number four DOT org slash. What we do. It's kind of long I kind of want to send it to you, I'm, sorry, okay, it's a lot to spell out right now, I'm taking a man's time I'm in the Q&A section, Q&A or college. Oh yeah, if you could just put it in the comments or email it to me and I'll forward it to Nobles awesome. Thank you so much. This would be in support of the Fairplay campaign. That I was referring to yeah New York supports website. All you have to do is look up in white people. If you go to NY 4p NY for the number four P DOT o- r- g, you can find it pretty much on the website. It takes. A couple of clicks. Can I have a question? You know it's ten minutes to ten, and so I really need to wrap it up. So I'm going to let Daryl have the last word and then I'm going to wrap this up. I did not have anything okay, so this is you know. Sixto is right. This is. He said that it's been going on for twenty odd years. I've been living in this community for 38 years. This was not a new conversation when I first moved here as a young woman. So you know this is there's a huge problem that in some ways keeps playing out in the same way and in many ways has been dramatically exacerbated by Coban. I. Think that it's you know, part of it is we need to be kinder to each other and we need to make room for each other in public spaces and I think we also really need to be firm, not yelling, at the Parks Department. Why are not you doing your jobs but firm with the mayor and the City Council about? Why are not you giving more money to things like trash, pickups you're here you know: why do not they have an available vehicle that can pick up strategically place dumpsters. You know why do not? We have a whole bunch of these sorts of things. So in part, it's a it's a financial issue. In any event, it's ten minutes to ten. This has been an incredibly long meeting and although in some ways it felt a little bit chaotic and I apologize for not getting to people as quickly as I might have in the queue I do think that we heard a lot and we were able to share a lot and although we do not all agree with oh there, it was respectful and I appreciate that inspector Harris, if you're able to share your email since sometimes it's easier to you know, email, you conditions or photos of conditions. That would be great we're going to take you off a mute, hello hi. So my email is my first name DOT last name at Parks, nyc.gov and I. Just want to add. If there are any complaints or conditions, you can also fall 3-, 1-, 1 and those would get routed to us as well. Super thanks very much, and the petition is on the NY for P org, look for the Playfair petition and send letters to your local electeds that would be councilmember rodriguez, not so much Assemblymember. It's not really the Assemblymember. It's not really the state senator! It's not really the congressman. This is a local issue, so the focus really has to be on councilmember Rodriguez, who I will say, has been a huge friend to parks and has diverted as devoted I'm. Sorry, I almost have diverted, has devoted millions of dollars in capital, resources to our 660 acres of parks and I think that he is sympathetic to the needs of parks and I. Think that working with him in partnership and demanding that more budget be used in this way, I think he would be in favor of that. So with that I would love to accept a motion to have a cold beer. I mean a motion to adjourn all right Liz. Are we going to put forth a reso in support of things related to budget and also potentially barbecue areas or whatever you think you know, because the budgeting I think the so the reason why I really wanted to have this conversation and thank you for reminding that so I do not think it's helpful to have a reso on this I think what's helpful, is to have these really robust conversations that feel in some way do not really go anywhere because there's no reso on it, but because we've had this very long, very detailed, very representative of multiple perspectives, conversation we can much more comfortably when we do our budgeting exercise in the fall say yeah. You know, we know what that is, and we know based on these long and ongoing conversations that we've had about this. We feel comfortable in prioritizing these things when we do the budgets, so we're not going to do a reso thus evening, yeah and now is not it's not really the time for that. We would do that when we do the budgeting exercise in the fall. That think it makes sense. I guess I was just worried about like losing some of the content and also I loved, like Jenny Boone dumpsters, and you know a couple of you guys with like signage and I just thought like if we could perhaps capture that, but maybe like I got the minutes for that's what we have minutes for and just as a reminder, mental people, one of the things that I do when we as the run up. So we do the budget exercise in October and we have a preliminary conversation in September. And so one of the things that I do in advance of the September meeting is I. Go through all of the minutes of the prior year and I say these are the conversations that we had that had budgetary implications. So you know, and some of them are programmatic in nature like we need more trash, pickup people and some of them are capital in nature like we need one of those forklift e pickup, dumpster things I'm sure, there's a technical name for it. But you know we need that. That's clearly a capital thing, so there's capital pieces and there's budget expense pieces part of what all of the Community board committees do. Is we have these ongoing conversations and they are iterative, meaning you know we have them and when we have them again we're building. On the prior conversation, new information, new facts, new resources, new whatever so there is, you know sometimes there's a little bit of a rod, serling quality to the conversations because we've been there before, but a lot of times. It's having these conversations repeatedly over time. That allows us to notice trends in our thinking that allows us to realize that some problems have gone away, that other problems have gotten worse and that some, by virtue of being persistent, need to be resolved in new ways. But with that it's four minutes to ten I would just add you know in the meantime, if committee members, you know, have concerns questions, you know about pricing. You know, as it relates to the budget, that we're going to do Jennifer's, even their staff and it'll help us with that and look into you know how much things cost and you know what's reasonable. Once we get to the budgeting piece thanks, Anna Liz I do not think some people know who Rod Serling I. Think I can also say that I think I can also say that once our new budget is in place and once we know what the guidelines are going to be for social distancing and allowing gatherings and Parks, the Parks Department will review the barbecue situation and maybe we'll be able to report back to you in the at a future meeting. Thank you. It would also be really helpful in the same way that we came up with some areas that might be appropriate for urban gardening. It would be helpful if we had some in put from you about what our areas that might be appropriate for additional barbecuing, otherwise known as grilling, by virtue of being you know, safe from a fire perspective away from residential properties, etc, and with that I would happily accept a motion to adjourn motion to adjourn second, every time you need all right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Paola I totally owe you a beer. This was long. Thank you. Everybody stay safe, I'll, see you in the parks and I'll, see you on zoom on July 14th, all right. Take it easy, bye Steve, who was that me paella good night, Oh, take care thanks a lot pal. You.
