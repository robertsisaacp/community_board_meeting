34 calls street and sidewalk being 32 of them illegal parking, one, a noise emanating from the vehicle one post avenue, again: 31, calls well from a vehicle three from a residence, eight illegal parking and eight per street and sidewalk noise Could you just share what has been your response to those sort of three-on-one calls on noise, and imagine mentioned that came up several times as obviously a big issue in the community.
My question is more for you: curtis I'm, just wondering what the concern is around having the report mention specific addresses I actually was interested to know whether we could even could be even more specific so as to identify the number of calls that were coming from the individuals like number full sample like if it correlated with like if it was a one to one like one person making one complaint or if there were like multiple people, making multiple complaints, I guess I'm, just interested in understanding what the concern might be.
So I just find it to be a level of information that I think is helpful for the community, but I'm not sure if it's completely helpful for like the public- and we've never had that level of data Why it stood out to me as well that we've never had addresses being shared with us on work through when calls were coming from what the micro data I think is extremely helpful, and we know that it's, like probably just one person who's who is concerned about an issue that the other 60 people in the building may not even be aware of So. Is that possible officer to have that level of data to know if these three one calls that are recurring, particularly for noise and some of the other issues that you mentioned, that are larger issues if they're coming from the same person or not?
He was issued a summons for the double parking and we also spoke further about about his noise and his need to be more caring and the understanding of neighbors not wanting to hear the music coming emanating from his vehicle, and if we have to take further police action, Okay curtis can I jump in for a second, yes, but who's that danielle?
Everything, that's in progress, so I'd have to look into that to see if that would be possible to get like a timeline of how long it takes for officers to respond to a specific or the 3-1-1 complaints in general So it seems like we have a lot of a lot of conversations surrounding 30311 calls and complaints that we need to kind of flesh out and advance in the next meeting to have more data and more information shared with our committee and the public.
So cynthia you want to go first, You know we had a sector d, build the block and there were over 50 people that came to this meeting and last week, and this was a common complaint of many people, and most of it was for noise street noise, where they literally were closed out within minutes and said people were there watching and they did not see police respond, and this is you know, I think we have a few people here that can fight the specific ones, but a number on over on dikeman and through you know, throughout sector six sector date.
Public lewdness double parked cars parked in front of the fire hydrant directly outside the driveway to my building and I would like to know from the police officer from the 34th precinct Are you under orders to stand down on quality of life issues, because I have seen a qualitative and quantitative inc lee bad situation in inwood hill park over the summer?
What's gone on in inwood hill park over the summer is just it can't be described in any other way, but to say that it's a complete zoo, young men, blasting their music It's, something once again that we've heard all summer from a variety of people and sources We did have a public hearing and I'm going to follow through with follow up with nancy, about moving forward with 301 data and getting to the bottom of why the response has appearing to be slowing down from our from some of our people, and we cover a little bit into the Bronx Twos on mta workers that have happened up in the three four precinct to report on.
In time the stations are so close from one am to five am, and in the morning to the end stations we have police officers at every end station when the stations do close or people that are getting off the trains that don't have any where to go So. We can offer them services as far as we normally work with brc in regards to trying to help people homeless, people with services or anybody that just doesn't have a place to stay with services Normally, we also do separate joint operations with them as well, to try to hit particular stations that we keep getting complaints about for homelessness or people that we just see an uptick in homelessness 168Th street?
Like I said we encompass 96th street all the way up to 242 in the Bronx, so they have a lot of a lot of area to cover, but we're working on trying to hit the stations where the station managers, the general manager station managers pretty much where we're getting feedback from were the worst worst hit areas to try to try to help people offer them services and to get them at least out of the subway station out of the cold and then eventually out of the cold weather for the winter A few months ago, we had someone from the community come to our meeting and propose having a booth at 169 that could possibly help with this sort of issue.
Oh, a police booth, I said I'll talk to the midnight platoon commander as I have and then, when the ncos are working, we always make sure we hit that station and specifically stand in that area for multiple times of the day to make sure that people are moving.
Their sergeant is currently trying to contact the schools to see exactly how they're going to be I know that was pretty new, so we're trying to right now get in contact with the schools to see how their models are going to be If. or I know the schools around the area are going on more like an av schedule or only half the kids go to school for a time, but we will We always have our school teams out in the stations in the past, where schools are the exit stations and the entrance stations to make sure that students are safe, that there's a police presence there and they're still trying to work on the issue about how many kids are going to be moving on the train at that time and then getting them on the train in social distance as best as possible.
34Th precinct police officers openly planted evidence and violently intimidated our community, though this neighborhood has become one of the safest in the city So not only have the precincts antagonize, our local community, the 33rd and 34th preference have long histories of ignoring and disregarding the demands and needs of our community in the cases involving off-workers canalian reynolds Most recently on june 9 2020 dominique alexander, a black man from the Bronx, was found, hung in fort trying park in the middle of national protest over racism, as well as racist, counter-protests, Despite, significant community uproar, weekly protests and the national black lives matter movement, not to mention the recent history of white nationalists and neo-nazis marching in for trying the detective assigned to the case, ruled it a suicide within 66 minutes into viewing the crime scene and instead of investigating it further carolyn kenji losi who's Instead.
These are the kinds of programs that our community could be advocating for instead Please also remember this as you vote for the next city, council representative, local officials and district attorney That being said, if you have any questions, thoughts, ideas or would like to join us in any way to help hold the police accountable in our neighborhood and I'll, just open it up to any questions or comments that anyone may have Obviously.
You know it's important for our community to work with the precincts to in, to hold them accountable and also help them do a better job.
There are a lot of people working on different issues, and sometimes the family feels more comfortable sharing information with you know the congress member senator or the assembly person- So, but I do I.
We definitely want to create a platform for create the space for any community members or groups to be able to vent during this time , We feel it's important to have all voices to have a space where we're all voices We want to continue to have the police officers report on the statistics, but we also want community members to be able to discuss and to voice these concerns and with the ultimate goal of being able to work with the police and try to find solutions to a lot of our issues and then I guess.
So I'm just going to leave it at continuing to call the cops on black and brown communities It's going to get in summonses, because people were talking about two thousand and three thousand dollar fines on communities where the majority of people are making under 35k a year on working class families that can barely pay rent and you want to give them summonses so that we can create further displacement and increase gentrification in our neighborhood It's really important, as we begin to think about how to reimagine public safety.
Think one of the things that I really would like to happen from this committee or from the community in general, is to find a way to have those conversations.
So I know people had concerns about the sidewalk space, but we're getting a new, secure, offense that was budgeted over two years ago and they're finally doing the project.
I just want to share our numbers from last year with the public, and then we can be prepared to make our rankings for the october meeting So. What I did was I read through our district needs report requests from last year, just to kind of see where we were and what we were thinking.
You know requesting additional funding for police officers, This section talks about crime prevention programs and the really only example they give is to increase officers which I don't think.
