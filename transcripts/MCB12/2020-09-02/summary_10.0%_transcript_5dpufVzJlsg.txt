They would like to share their findings, and then we have a few new business items, including discussing our committee priorities for the fall, as well as starting to our conversation on capital and budget rankings for the month of October.
If we haven't generally received the addresses for the 311 complaints, and my concern is that it may be too public too much information about people's personal.
Could you just share what has been your response to those sort of three-on-one calls on noise, and imagine mentioned that came up several times as obviously a big issue in the community?
Why it stood out to me as well that we've never had addresses being shared with us on work through when calls were coming from what the micro data, I think, is extremely helpful.
We know that it's, like probably just one person who's who is concerned about an issue that the other 60 people in the building may not even be aware of So. Is that possible officer to have that level of data to know if these three one calls that are recurring, particularly for noise and some of the other issues that you mentioned, that are larger issues if they're coming from the same person or not?
People, who make frequent 3-1 calls to try to come to some resolution by working with the neighborhood coordination.
This has been going on for several months where a 3-1-1 is made and it is closed out within minutes, sometimes with a comment saying unfounded or police, were there no action needed when clearly nothing happened and nobody came, and so I'm curious as like who's taking the three one ones?
He was issued a summons for the double parking, and we also spoke further about about his noise and his need to be more caring and the understanding of neighbors not wanting to hear the music coming emanating from his vehicle.
It was summons, was issued or not, or if the individual left the scene or if the complaint no longer exists, because there's no music at the location, is it possible to report that data in your monthly reports average time from like the three one call to the response?
So it seems like we have a lot of a lot of conversations surrounding 30311 calls and complaints that we need to kind of flesh out and advance in the next meeting to have more data and more information shared with our committee and the public.
It is really important for us to also be aware that some people call 31 anonymously, so having addresses shared is an effort to protect someone's privacy and not necessarily to publicly share individuals from what their addresses and what they're, who what they're calling about so curtis I'm trying to read the comments.
You know we had a sector d, build the block There were over 50 people that came to this meeting and last week, and this was a common complaint of many people, and most of it was for noise street noise, where they literally were closed out within minutes and said.
And, they did not see police respond, and this is you know, Has happened so frequently which which one specifically, I think we have a few people here.
To my building, and I would like to know from the police officer from the 34th precinct.
It's, something once again that we've heard all summer from a variety of people and sources We did have a public hearing And there's a lot of work happening outside the board, with kind of moving this forward and making some actionable items that can be followed through on as well as working inside the board.
It's, an issue that is ongoing, And I'm, going to follow through with follow up with nancy, about moving forward with 301 data and getting to the bottom of why the response has appearing to be slowing down from our from some of our people.
We encompass 96th street all the way up to 242 in the Bronx, so they have a lot of a lot of area to cover, but we're working on trying to hit the stations where the station managers, the general manager station managers pretty much where we're getting feedback from were the worst worst hit areas to try to try to help people offer them services and to get them at least out of the subway station out of the cold and then eventually out of the cold weather for the winter.
A few months ago, we had someone from the community come to our meeting and propose having a booth at 169 that could possibly help with this sort of issue.
They could possibly maybe have people mta personnel, be at the that end station or that section just to kind of monitor the situation and call police as needed.
I said I'll talk to the midnight platoon commander as I have, and then, when the ncos are working, we always make sure we hit that station and specifically stand in that area for multiple times of the day to make sure that people are moving.
They will be trying doing their best to monitor to monitor social distancing as well, but until we get a more concrete plan, that's been on our schools, team, And they're still trying to work on the issue about how many kids are going to be moving on the train at that time and then getting them on the train in social distance as best as possible.
They have not been meeting, so it's been really difficult to build those individual relationships, but I do encourage you all to go to them to meet people, because it's always We have to make sure that we're also trying to work with our officers as they hear our concerns.
There was community member paloma laura who reached out to me and had been working on some data and some research on policing in the community, his historical patterns and trends, and also came up with some recommendations on how to move forward with improving these relationships.
The 33rd and 34th precincts have a long history of treating our community as the enemy systematically antagonizing and over policing us, while repeatedly turning a deaf ear to our people's demands.
Today, I'll be talking to you all about these two precincts histories and patterns of misconduct and about the deep bribes they have left in their wake, as well as a call to action in developing ways of caring for and protecting our community beyond the police.
The 33rd and 34th precincts have the second highest number of summons for Covid-19 related issues in all of Manhattan, especially when it comes to black and brown people.
Washington heights, and especially in wood, were overwhelmingly white working class irish neighborhoods for a long time the police reflected their community and were too mostly white and irish.
34Th precinct police officers openly planted evidence and violently intimidated our community, though this neighborhood has become one of the safest in the city.
They have received thousands of fine which are still likely compounding where these complaints get ignored by the 33rd precinct, and many feel the fear that whenever the police are present, they could be arrested, have evidence planted on them and be charged and indicted without any way to fight back.
If you have any questions, thoughts, ideas or would like to join us in any way to help hold the police accountable in our neighborhood.
You know it's important for our community to work with the precincts to in, to hold them accountable and also help them do a better job.
There are a lot of people working on different issues and sometimes the family feels more comfortable sharing information with you know the congress, member senator or the assembly person- So, but I do, I, do appreciate you braving it up, because it's obviously a concern to me as a man.
We want to continue to have the police officers report on the statistics, but we also want community members to be able to discuss and to voice these concerns and with the ultimate goal of being able to work with the police and try to find solutions to a lot of our issues, and then I, guess one more thing.
And I know that the senator's office as well senator jackson's office, has been also paying attention to that And they're like we're working, not together on the issue, And, then we've we sent a letter to the da's office about it to further investigate There's a lot of problems with the police and relationship with the community now and historically also.
We just want to hold the police accountable on the misconduct that, like a lot of people.
It's going to get in summonses, because people were talking about two thousand and three thousand dollar fines on communities where the majority of people are making under 35k a year on working class families that can barely pay rent and you want to give them summonses so that we can create further displacement and increase gentrification in our neighborhood.
Think one of the things that I really would like to happen from this committee or from the community in general is to find a way to have those conversations.
So I know people had concerns about the sidewalk space, but we're getting a new, secure, offense that was budgeted over two years ago, And they're.
