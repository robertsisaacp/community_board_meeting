Right before we went on break and yeah looking forward to another great year. Thank you Ashley. So we will now take this opportunity to introduce our distinguished personnel from the 33rd reason. Do we have any representative from the territories? Yes, I as a lieutenant concepcion from the 33rd precinct, I'm joined with officer Brown who's going to be taking over detective Valentine's duties for the SLA meetings, detective Valentine, just retired back in August wow. What's the office's name, I'm sorry Officer Brown Kenneth, Brown officer, Brown Welcome to the neighborhood. Thank you very much pleasure. Thank you. So much do we have a representative now from 34th Precinct. I received a note from detective martinucci that they might be joining us later on, so we'll make sure that that they'll be recognized once they come in. So now that we have come back from our summer hiatus. I know that many of you have visited many restaurants and lounges. As I said earlier, there are some issues affecting our dining industry and I can tell you that oftentimes some of our lock operators, they need to be a better sense of education. I'm sorry! Let me pick up. Let's go this quickly. You wanted to operate hello, aha officer. How are you so yeah? So let me put you on speaker and let me and now you can introduce yourself, so we have on the line, as I indicated officer Matt, so that I do not have to be on speakerphone with a cjo's personal phone. Is there is that possible that we can unmute? Because I'm on the call on my job phone we just do not have a video camera here is Israel. Please ask him: what is his telephone number? Can you please share your number with eventually he's asking for your phone number? My number is 917.. Now, what's up three? Yes, I listen, but I do not see any number here displaying as it's called in use, but does not display any number, but probably it will be him. I'm going to try one number that I have here, because I do not have any okay try that let's see how it works just one minute. Obviously, can everybody hear me now? Yes, we can. Yes, we can hear you all right. Awesome, sorry about that. It's a little confusion. I'm officer, Mark Smith from the three four and with me is lieutenant people. Three things recently. I found here very happy to be here with all of us. Thank you so much officer and once again welcome. We really appreciate all the work that NYPD does for the community. We respect the work that you do and I'm sure that we can work together as a community, I'm looking forward to sharing information to make sure that we are cohesive unit being the community board residents and also obviously the NYPD. I was saying earlier Muchi that, as I visited many restaurants throughout the area, there are issues that perhaps can be addressed with information by sharing information with some of the local operators. I noticed some social distancing issues, many face Mac, covering issues are very concerning, but the majority of the operators were in compliance based on what I've seen and what I know about regulations. So, as always, we have areas that we can work with, and I hope that you know this will be learning occur, as you know that governor Cuomo introduced, I just today the 25% capacity that would have some limits. Obviously there are some questions about certain issues and there has to be a process to educate our restaurants owners. Based on what I see here, it's mostly about the digital information that gets distributed, and some restaurants might have might not have access to this. So there has to be a campaign. I believe to make sure that our restaurants owners are properly informed about the new regulations, because I know that with this opening of 25, there will be enforcement and we understand that, but at least we would like for our restaurant operators to be fully informed, as a committee we're here to facilitate the process for licenses. The committee members have put in time to make sure that the cases of which applicant gets heard in a respected and dignified way. So I'm very happy with the composition of the committee that we have now we will facilitate the process and we will not hinder the process. That's what we're here for for the new members. Let me just go quickly to let you know how we function as the committee. First, we listen to all the applicants. Then we listen to the NYPD about their opinion on the particular matter that's being presented. Then we hear from the residents to see if there are any concerns. Once we listen to all the all the stakeholders, then, as a committee we will meet and chat and discuss how we're going to approach one particular application, and then we vote. We would like for residents to have a two- minute presentation in case they have questions or concerns, and then the representative we'll have two minutes to answer the questions. If there any questions or concerns from the residents and on that, I'm going to need some help, so I will need I need someone to time. Gerard. Can you be of help on that matter or cindy sure I can do it so cindy will take care of the questions from the residents. If you have any questions, please raise your hand and cindy would write down your name and your turn, and then you have two minutes. Besides that, I will also need to have someone to write the minutes. Do I have any volunteer from the committee members? If I see no volunteers, then I might be able to assign someone wants to be done with a meeting, but we can take care of that later on. Are there any questions from committee members? How we're going to proceed? Hi, I'm lily, I'm the interpreter, and I have a question for you. Yes, please, because I've never been. I've never done anything like this before. So I want to know how you are how you're going to be using my services. You know so for those that do not speak English then I'll, translate this or you can translate for those that do not speak English, then they can raise their hands and if they need translation, they can write out if they need translation or not. Would that be something that will work? Okay, that works. Translate that many thanks lily. If you have any questions, you're not sure, just feel free to interrupt something that might not be properly translated. Any other questions from any member that any participants all right, saying: none. It will have 18 applications that we're going to review. There are some that are incomplete Chanel. I might need some guidance if I need some documents, because I kind of received in a four o'clock and it's not able to print them, but you know we're going to work on it. Okay, very well so for new members we're going to review matters one through seven. All of these are renewals in basic terms. If the applicant does not have any issues be from the you know: 34th prison, the 33rd and or residents, even if they do not show up, we tend to pass a positive resolutions on those applicants. However, if there are issues affecting applicants who terms have come for renewal, then we can have an open discussion and even if they do not show up, we can always provide a recommendation for a negative fold. Any questions from new members. You say that what was that last piece, if they do not show up, we provide what kind of recommendation. So you can go two ways right. If there are issues affecting one license, the NYPD would give us the info and or the residents or even yourselves. As a committee member, you can tell us about some issues affecting one particular applicant, and then we can vote one way or the other or another. If there are no issues, we tend to vote in a positive manner. If there are issues we'll discuss the matter and then we'll take a vote on it all right, so we're going to entertain one through seven first, those are all renewals. So the first item agenda is number one Hudson Heights Button grill, and this is located at 180 street near Broadway, based on what I have from documents here, this license expired, August, 31st. All right do I have a representative here from from bar 1a80. Yes, this is Miguel Acosta this weekend, I'm representing Elvis Batista. Okay, thank you miguel. You have you your turn. Okay, so we're off for renewal. The license expired. We actually was able to renew it. This is in the private 34th prison. Are there any issues with bar 180, located 180, 180th and broadway? As far as noise complaints? There are not too many going back to 2018. There were two three one ones in the entire year for loud music coming from the location in 2019, there were two 3- 1- 1 calls for loud music and then in 2020. Asijo to your point, there were two three on one calls for speakers for the outdoor dining and the social distancing problems. Now there only were two calls, but those are concerned residents for exactly what you spoke about before in terms of the outdoor dining, not socially distancing, and those calls were on June, 7th and July 27th. The latest incident that was there, was on December 6th of 2019, where somebody was assaulted inside the location with a glass cuff and that required stitches. So that was a serious incident that is the only one over the last three years so not to downplay it, but there's that one incident on December 6th of 2019 very well so Miguel. Now this is your turn. Can you please identify yourself and association to this establishment? My name is Miguel Acosta, I'm the representative and accountant for Hudson high school bar 180, located at 4241 broadway. Unfortunately, I do not see Mr Bautista on the call. I do not know some people are letting me know via text and they're having some sort of connection problems and not exactly sure what's happening, but on their behalf. Basically, I've been representing these this account for you know, since they started business a few years back and like every other business, you know in our area in wood and Washington Heights. You know you get certain incidents that sometimes are out of the control of the ownership they every business out here is trying to do their best to maintain the proper operations, the proper security measures and to be risk- free. As you see these three one calls are from concerned neighbors and the distance between these calls are from July June, 7th and July 27th, which is almost you know a month and a half apart. So like I said, every business out here, they're trying to do their best. Sometimes it's very hard, as business owners to control people that are walking by or standing or waiting on, a table. Security guard does their best as well to try to avoid any conflict with patrons, as you guys know, telling a patron that is waiting for a table to put on their man or to move from the front sometimes could be very risky for business owners, and you know, management and security guards. So these problems have been addressed. They have been cited by SLA who found no violations. They have nothing pending at the moment, and I do not think this business is a problem for our community very well niko. This is alliance has expired. The license actually was renewed because we had you know during the summer we are notified, but by the time they give you the 30 days to submit the renewal application. So basically, this is courtesy presentations. You know to our community that we are in compliance. You know, with the request for the Vicar authority and for the Community Board to present ourselves and identify any issue that may be occurring at the establishment, so the owners can definitely work on everything very well, quick question you had. I do not know if you can answer this question, but on your health grade as inspected by the New York City of the family health, you had it be great any issues that are going on establishment. Well, the thing is that the point calculation with the health department- it's a little bit tricky. You know sometimes they'll find one thing that can be ten points and then find another thing that could be four points and automatically that'll give you a b. So in order for you to get below you know a b, then you have to get below 13 points, so that means sometimes it could be a rag that could be laying on top of the counter that the employee just finished using so the grade evaluation, it's a little bit difficult. In order for us to address and say you know, everything is spotless, because every business owner is trying to be spotless, but it all depends at the time the inspector comes in and you know, and whatever they find. That may be an issue at that time. You know sometimes the owners out acrosss the street, getting a vegetable and they walk in and right away. You know that's a violation because you're supposed to be president of this time, so I believe that all matters have been addressed when it comes to health Department, a c would be concerning which that means. You know it's past 20:28 points which is a failing grade. So a b should be, I guess, corrected and next inspection. This should be change. 20. very well. Any idea we're going to do without those two speakers that are placed outside as it was stated by 34 precinct. Perhaps can the volume be lowered down, maybe after nine or ten a night? Well, I actually recommended that you know any concerns from any neighbors. You know to be addressed immediately and that the speakers having them outside is actually illegal. You know so I recommended that they have all music equipment inside the establishment and let whatever sound you know, light sound, go out to the outside during the times of operation, so I'll address that with Mr Batista and make sure that is correct. Thank you so much. This has not been a trouble spot, but I want we just want to show that you know the issues that we can correct and rectify from our business, that we are there to help very well. Do you have any questions or concerns from our residents, and for that cindy you manage that. Yes, so I do see a hand up from Jose Coronado. It's been up for a little bit, so I'm not sure if it pertains directly to this license, but if you could unmute yourself jose Ronaldo, you have your hands up, we'll move on. Do we have any concerns from our committee members any issues before we go to a vote. Leo no issues in regards to the noise complaints. Is there any way that the owner or the manager can put the good neighbor sign just to filter the calls there's only two calls it seems a year. Maybe that would deter it. So is there any way yeah? I could definitely address that to the to the owner and have that done. Thank you so much miguel. If you need a copy of other good news, sign, please contact the office and they'll be sure to provide you with a copy. Yes I'll, definitely contact. You, though, thank you with that. I recommend that I go to a straight vote. Give them all positions seniors. You already call the voter. I'm sorry! You want me to call the vote out. Yes, so how do you vote? I can't vote on this mother because it's within the victory station and therefore a conflict. Okay, no vote! Okay! I vote yes cindy! Yes, for me, okay, Ashley! Yes, for me, Leo! Yes, for me, angel! Yes! Maria! Yes did! I leave any other committee meeting member out okay, so this passes unanimously, one no vote and one two three, four: five: six! Yes, six in favor, several against syrup, saying one can't vote and that'll. Be me pretty. Well, this application passes. We will recommend the Community Board Fastest service solution in support of this establishment. You right, you do not happen to have access well, do call the next one. Please then sure you're ready sure so next on the agenda. If this is again on- premise liquor license item two: it is cafe Sahara located at 4:40, 26, 10th avenue it's between West 214Th and West 215Th Street, so Cafe saharas. Are they present item two? Yes, I'm also representing cafe Sahara I have Luis Carrela the owner on call as well, so we're both present Isidro. One thing I would like to mention this is also in for a corporate office to change. Mr Carella is looking to sell the business. Unfortunately, Mr Leonel Tejada who's the purchaser he had to work this evening, so maybe we can address both matters together if possible. I do not have any problems with that. Thank you. Would the rest of the community have any problems addressing those both of these ask at the same time, so we can save some time as well. No all right answer that so officer martinucci. This is the preview 34 precinct. What's the opinion on the renewal for this applicant, so in 2018 I know it's going back, but I'm just going to give 18:19 20. in 2018. There were 14,311 calls for loud music, the precinct combated that by issuing a summons for unreasonable noise to the manager. This is all the way back, April 26 of 2018. They, it seemed to have changed the the way they operate, because in 2019 there were four 3- 1- 1 calls in the entire year for loud music, and there has not been any in 2020. I know it's the middle of the pandemic, but step in the right direction from 2018 until present day. So that's all the 34th precinct has to say very well. Thank you so much officer so Miguel. This is every new for cafes. You are heard from under 34 freezing are no major issues. It seems like they are working on getting the noise down. That's really good! The last time that your client came for a documentary report. There was no objection that was October, 2nd, 2018. Correct. I and I see that the license has expired well. This is the same issue as the previous licensee we submitted during the summer. License has been renewed, so right now, they're in compliance with their operation and license is active and renewed. Okay, do I have any consents from our residents? I do not see any scene if I'm not mistaken, right correct. There are no answers. Okay, any issues from our committee members saying none. I recommend that we go to straight vote on this applicant. Yes cindy. Yes, right, Ashley, yes, Leo! Yes, Angel, yes, Maria! Yes, this passes unanimously; seven, yes, no abstentions or no rejections. Thank you, hey Gerard is Waldis sorry for the interruption. Oh I just I I jumped on right before this. This was this. I guess it was discussed, but I want to vote yes for it. Yeah, okay! So give me a second one. Second, sorry about that. How are you doing good yourself, good mothers, so you're going to vote? Yeah? Yes, on this right? Well, these yeah seven, two three, four, five, six, seven! So that's eight yeses, no votes, zero! No! Zero! All right! Thank you! So much you're actually stuck on the next one. So we're going to are we going to pop down to nine yes again for cafe Sahara? Let's do it right away, because I think it's easier sure that way we save some time and introduction, and all of that so now I want to jump to agenda item number nine, and the idea is that there is a corporate change for the new members that came into to the committee every time that there is a corporate change, meaning like shares have been shifted, one side or another or the ssl. The client is recommended that they come to the Community Board and tell us about new changes. Who will be the president who's sharing? What so? This is the place at the right time to entertain this application, and the idea is that from what I understand that is a cell is that correct, amigo yeah, basically Mr Carella who's been working together with Mr Tejada for the last year and a half. That's why you see these changes in the operations. Tahara has previous experience in a westchester restaurant that he also owns and basically he's been assisting Mr, Carella and hands down they've been doing a pretty good job very well. So at this point I'm sorry Miguel. Let me go back to the precinct. Obviously we have the same operator. We're going to have a cell a new owner will be the consent of 34 prism. If any honestly, I know every complaint matters so for the four calls that were in 2019, I mean as long as it's as long as we keep the music down think about the residents and we, you know, as long as the new owner is going to keep the residents in mind. That's all we care about. We do not want violence and we do not want too many complaints sounds very simple. Thank you officer. Any complaints concerns from residents Cindy. Anyone thank you, so Miguel who's buying, leonel, right, yeah and who's selling Louise Corella does have any experience in restaurant and alcohol selling. What has yes, as I pre, as I previously mentioned- I'm sorry one second, first his experience his knowledge of this community and what is he going to bring to this new establishment and how is he going to address some noise complaints? Well, Mr Tejada has a current ownership in a restaurant in yonkers, where he gains his experience, manages alcohol food sales been doing a pretty good job prior to him. Opening that restaurant he was also assisting Mr Carella in the operations of this establishment. So, basically, what's another restaurant, I'm sorry the name of the right, it's the same name actually but yonkers. You know so he's been working with Mr Carella for over a year and a half in the location and assisting him. You know bringing in new clientele and creating a method of operation. That'll, be you know beneficial for the neighborhood has been working with keeping the noise down and avoiding issues. Officer. Martinucci says we're trying to keep everybody happy business owners being profitable, neighbors quality of life being addressed. Music has been pretty much reduced in comparison to the beginning of these operations, so I believe Mr Tahada will continue the same type of operations, that's currently in the business, since he has already been assisting Mr Carrell in these operations for the last year and a half, I do not foresee any issues or any changes that are currently in the establishment at this moment. The last time that you came to the community board that was October, 2nd 2018. There were no objections by the community report. Do you have any security personnel right now at the establishment? I believe Mr Corella, that can you jump in on that. Is there a security guard yeah we have. We have two two security personnel on mostly on weekends and one on the weekdays. Are they licensed by New York state? Yes, so the capacity that you have today is 74. Yes, all right. Any issues from our committee members are seeing none. I recommend that we go to street vote on this matter. G right, yes, cindy, yes, Ashley! Yes, sorry! I thought I was unmuted, no worries, Leo, yes, angel, yes, Marielle, yes and waldiz. Yes, so this passes unanimously by a vote of seven yeses and zero knows, I think the eight of us here, eight rba, sorry, hey! I forgot about. While this is sorry all right. There we go so this application passes. Congratulations to Mr Tejada. We hope that he can engage our community and that he pro prosper as well. Thank you very much. You still one thing. Yes, I'm sorry, I'm jumping in to number 10 because that's going to be seen later, but I'm going to have to withdraw that one, because there's still an issue with the address at the moment. Okay, so are you saying that you are withdrawing number 10 right yeah, because the thing is we were required to notify the community Board, because the landlord changed the addresses to every location on that in that building. So when he notified us, we went from 227 to 225 and then we now realize that it's actually 229 so we're going to have to do another notification, so I will draw that one. Thank you so much! Thank you all right. So I'm going to perfect right. So next thing item three well: let's see: Palmas Restaurant, Inc, 3891, Broadway, again, item three Las Palmas Restaurant, Inc, 3891 broadway between 162Nd and 1663.. That's for renewal! Are you here? Anybody from Las Palmas once twice. This is within the preview of the 3rd present officer brown, any feedback that you can give us on this location. Please! Yes, this location year to date, we've had no issues. We've had no 911 calls related to the anything occurring inside or outside the restaurant, and no 301 calls as well. So we've had no issues with this restaurant. Thank you so much for your input officer we're now going to move on to our westminster third season. That was here. Do we have any complaints from our residents any concerns from residents no hands raised at the moment. Thank you. So much cindy are now entertaining some discussion from the committee. Any issues from committee members saying none. I recommend that word was revoked you're right. Yes, gerard! Yes, cindy! Yes, Ashley! Yes, Leo, yes, angel! Yes, Marielle, yes, waldees! Yes, this passes unanimously, eight yeses. Thank you. So much gerard will be sure to send a recommendation for this establishment to get the license by the committee, while you're getting the paperwork item. Four Broadway and 166Th Street Llc Dba, Dallas Barbecue, again Broadway and 166Th Street Llc Dba, Dallas Bbq, it's located at 3956 broadway. Are you here once twice officer brown? This is when the preview, the 33rd precinct, I'm not sure that there will be many issues here, but can you please give us some feedback? Yes, Sir. So I'll start with, we had a couple issues before the coronavirus restrictions went into effect. We had a multiple calls on February 28th for a disorderly, intox mail inside the location, and then we also had a call for a large disorderly group on March 21st inside the location. Those are the only two number one calls year to date that we had that caused any police related issues. We also had three through a one calls year to date, when we were in back in phase one on April, 6th and April 18th. We had two anonymous calls for people that were not social distancing and were not wearing masks, and then we had a another 301 call. This was June 12th, and this was this was a photo that was sent in to 311 of people not socially distancing and not wearing a mask in front of the location of Dallas Barbecue, and then we have not had any through one calls: July, August and so far this month, and we have not had any 9- 1- 1 related issues since pretty much the issue on March 21st all right. Well, let's see do we have any hands up no hands raised at the moment. Thank you committee members. Any concerns no concerns. I just wanted to ask the police precinct I'm assuming that the reduction in incidents over July and August could somehow be connected to you all interacting with the ownership or, I guess the administration of the establishment after the 311 calls right. Well, I mean I know everything has has changed with the outdoor seating and not having people eating inside the location throughout the summer, but we have not had really aside from those complaints. We have not really had any other problems here to date at that location. Okay, so you have no major issues in this licensee. Getting an approval from the committee correct: we have no, no major issues, dislocation all right! Apologies for item four esidro; yes, rod! Yes, cindy! Yes, Ashley! Yes, Leo! Yes, Angel! Yes, Mario, yes, Waldis! Okay, this passage unanimously, eight yeses and no zero, no votes! Congratulations! You're! Right! Let's move on to the next one!

Again, it's located at 4946 broadway, it's between 207th and iceland streets, and this again is for renewal of an on- premise. License. Are you here? Yes, welcome hello, very well! This is within that the jurisdiction of 34 present officer matamucci. Yes, in 2018 there was only one 311 call for loud noise. There is a report on file from July 21 2018, where an employee stated that her phone was removed from her bag 2019. There were no complaints, 3- 1- 1 and noise wise on March 6th of 2019. There was an incident around 3:30 4 a.m. A big fight bar souls were used as weapons. There were arrests made that was March 6th of 2019 and then on October, 2nd of 2019. We did, we do have a report for Grand. Larceny purse was removed from inside the establishment, and I know so. We had two larcenies in 2018 and 19, and I know that's not it's tough to pin that on the business, but there are preventative measures that can be taken to prevent crimes like that from happening and then, as far as 2020 is concerned, two three one calls one on April 30th and one on June, 24th social, distancing, related patrons, not wearing masks being served, alcoholic beverages standing on the sidewalk and drinking and not socially distancing, and that's what we have for the last three years. Very well can someone from who please identify yourself. Yes, this is Niall henry from Telugu Tavern Niall, Henry. Okay, our license is set to expire on October 31st 2020., we've been in business four years at that location, there's been a restaurant bar neighborhood tavern type place at this location for at least 65:70 years prior to us, it was called Piper's coat and prior to that was called something else, but that's about it. You know we operate a neighborhood restaurant bar and you know that's about it. Seeing that do we have any hands out from residents, not at the moment all right. So this thing about the grand larson was reported by the 34th president. What preventative measures have you taken to prevent this in the future? Well, we have signs everywhere, saying you know, do not leave your purse on unattended, etc. I believe what happened on this thing was somebody left their purse on a bar stool or table, and then they left and they came back two hours later for it and was gone, so it was not like a forceful mugging or something or just like a purse was left behind and someone took to their advantage. You know: do you have surveillance cameras in your place? We do yes, we do all right and the fight that went on June 2019 was all about the fight that went on there was a gentleman came in around 3:15 in the morning, ordered a drink and then just picked a fight with an another gentleman at the bar and the person working could not control it and we called the police. That's what happened. It was the only fight we had in. We do not generally get big crowds there, so we do not really hire security or anything. It's just like a neighborhood type place. You know, there's no promoters, there's no dj! There's! No! You know it's just kind of a you know. I've been there many times, it's a very nice place and take into account that you only got two three one calls this year speaks volumes. So I take that into consideration. As Well committee members, any issues before Piper's kilter was big cherries, yes, wow you're right, oh great, some recommend that we go to straight vote.

There was only one three one call on May 14th for loud music, nothing in 2019 and nothing in 2020. So that's all we have to say about this place. Thank you!

Thank you so much officer. I really are the representative.

It was a pleasure seeing you all have a great night good, seeing you man. Thank you so much. I just I just received a note some minutes ago. Ernesto can you please promote Natalie Espino from Galbraith's office as a finalist, please the staff already did it. Thank you. My apologies natalie. I just saw this text now that I like four seconds off and my apologies, but I'm glad that you on board. Can you please introduce yourself to the rest of the committee now that you're here Natalie? Yes, hello, Committee? This is Natalie Espino from the Manhattan borough president's Office, Community, Board, 12, Planning, board coordinator and liaison to the wonderful neighborhoods of Washington Heights Inwood. Welcome to the new members. I'm excited to see everybody on board and, of course, always our best to the small business owners who are struggling in this new reality, but adapting and looking forward to seeing as we support a safe reopening of your businesses. As always, we are at your service. Thank you so much natalie for your assistance as well in providing great information to our small businesses here in Omaha and now once again, welcome to the committee very well, your let's move forward now with the next item, which will be a change of class right. This is item C, State, Liquor, Authority class change, item eight, it's Jack, Restaurant, cork, Dba, Park, View, Cafe restaurant, it's located at 219, Dikeman, Street, again, Jack restaurant co-, Op, Dva, Park, View Cafe! Are you here, Jack, Restaurant or parkview? Yes, Jack restaurant clothes? Well, thank you. So much welcome. So they asked here is: do I change the class from a winemaker from wine and beer to a full liquor license for the new members? You know we have different classes as well as like for alcohol licenses. The current client has a beer and wine and they would like us to approve to change a class with which will upgrade themselves to a full liquor license, and you know we're going to discuss the matter now with 34 prison, the residence, and then we have discussion almost ourselves so obviously to ask- is to call for full eco license on agenda number eight parking. This is on the famous thailand corridor at the very corner of Eichmann, very close to starbucks, if I'm not mistaken. So what is the other opinion? So we have nothing in 2018 and nothing in 2019. I've been at the precinct for seven years. I do not know how long that business has been there, but it's never been a problem at all. The only thing is, I will caution the owner with the full liquor license it does. It is an added responsibility. We do get a lot of complaints on Dyson Street. When I was running the numbers earlier, there were 47 total three one calls for that location for 219, Dychmen Street. After reading them all they used the address, but it's not to your establishment at all. So do not worry about that. Most of the calls are for loud. Music from 1 am to 5 A.M. I just you know how congested is it really is just a caution that it is an added responsibility for the full liquor license, but there's no reason that we should hold you back at all, so we do wish you good luck. Thank you. So much. Let me just cover some specifics of the questionnaire, so the members will have some understanding what this establishment is all about. The ask once again is to get a follicle license with the understanding that about 10 licensees in the area in the near vicinity. This establishment has a capacity of 74., 12 employees and the hours of operations. That is you know, point is from 7:30 A.M to 11:00 P.M mondays through thursdays, then on thursdays, sorry from my fridays and saturdays, it's from 7:30 to about 12 midnight and then on Sun Saturday, I'm sorry until 1 pm, 1 A.M and sundays, from 7:30 to 12 midnight. So the hours are not complicated, they're, not they do not reach to four o'clock in the morning, which has been some problematic in some areas. So this is manageable. I see that what type of music do you play right now? There is no karaoke. There's no live music. There is sound limiter, so that's great, no jukebox, no djs! That sounds great but I'll. Let you the representative to please identify yourself about this establishment. Yes, my name is Gus Anton. I'm here to represent Parkview Cafe for a full liquor license. Upgrade we've been in the neighborhood for about 19 years now, and this is something there I need now Constantinos Anton. Okay, I got it. Please continue. Yeah we're a cafe restaurant! It's been something we've been wanting to upgrade to for a long time, but we feel as if now we've covered and things that have been happening with the big drops and the sales that it's been, something that has been become a necessity, so your sales have dropped out significantly. You say yeah I mean in general for every restaurant, but our we've been struggling to catch up on the back. You know rent months and it's been a something that we've been wanting to upgrade to for a long time now, but with colvit it's been almost it's been a complete necessity to upgrade to full liquor now very well. Do I have any comments from our residents? We do not at the moment. Thank you so much cindy, so your place is sound proof that, based on what I see here correct. Yes, it is questions from concerns from our committee members. None move to go to street vote then on this matter. Okay. Yes, the rod! Yes cindy! Yes, Ashley! Yes, Leo! Yes, Angel! Yes, Mario! Yes, Waldis, yes, Robin! Yes, okay! This passes unanimously, nine yeses! Congratulations! Do I need to save the call? I'm sorry do I have to stay on the remainder? No, you do not, but to understand that the final decision will be made by the General Board, we're going to recommend that the General Board that they approve your resolution and if and if so then the board will send a recommendation to SLA to approve a change of classes right. So next, up on this okay next step is oh great. Congratulations. Next up is under state Liquor authority method of operation change license so item 12 on the agenda is Eskenia 214 Corp Dba cafe tobacco ron. It's located at 501, West 214Th street. That's at the corner of West 214Th Street yeah. Before we open up discussion on the matter agenda item number 10 and 11 have been withdrawn. This is Robert Romano, I'm appearing on behalf of Eskina 214 Corp and I just want to first say hello to everyone and let you know that I was born and raised till I was 11 at 775 Riverside ride at 156Th street, and then we moved to 25 indian road, where I lived until I graduated college and I played on the mccherry's little league team. So I my roots go back to this committee to this board and it's nice to be back home right. What's that you are the representative, I am the representative correct and all they are seeking to do and they've been around for years, and I guess the officers will hopefully confirm this. They have a clear, clean history that they're looking simply to add a dj which they do have recorded music. Now and every time I hear someone asking to go to a dj, I find it odd when people, if there's any objection to it, because really all it is a person deciding the next piece of recorded music. Let me stop you for a minute, because we have to follow an order here. So they ask here is to what a dj and live music to the license for tobacco. We do not have any noise complaints in 2020, not in 2019 and none in 2018 the latest. The last thing that occurred there was on October 13 2018. So this is going back to October 13th 2018.. There was a precinct inspection. There were 12 summonses issued to the manager there. There has been zero police enforcement involvement or anything since then. That's all the precinct has to say about it. Is it's at the bottom of a of a residential building? So that's all we would say is just think about the residents when it comes to what you're, adding and that that's our biggest concern but, like I said nothing in 2019 and nothing in 2020 for us to say that we do not approve all right and we received a letter from one of our restaurants, mayan collins, who's very active in our community, and one of the questions that he asked me was to make sure that we check the hours that the dj is going to be performing. So we're going to ask for the hours for dj and live music. I see which are recommended by one of our residents collins. I sent a letter to all the committee members from Ryan collins, a few minutes before we joined the meeting about you know issues that some residents will have so many times we have concerns from residents. I will share that information with other committee members, so you know feel free also to send me a concerns that you might have on particular establishments. Having said that, so the idea is to add a dj and live music to the chrome right, Mr Romano. Yes, the it is, but you're not going to hear any increase in the volume of the music currently because a number of reasons, one they're not going to play the music any louder than they currently do. Number two: the live music that they're seeking to do is acoustic only and number three. There is a sufficient amount of sound proofing already installed in the in the ceilings and in the in the perimeters of the premise. This is a responsible operator. I could state that the subway at its lowest level is louder than this rat. Then this place will be at its loudest the or the elevated train. I should say not the subway there and they're looking to continue to be a good neighbor and just offer what people have been asking them to add. That's all right, so taking into account the prison has not had any major complaints on noise complaints now they're going to add dj and left music. What specific days are you going to be having djs in live music, which days well they're, looking to have they're looking for the approval to have it in seven days? You know all open hours, as I said, the sound level will not increase one decibel from the current sound levels. It's just the form of the music. When I ask when I say seven days all seven days, they are not going to have live music seven days. They are not going to have a dj seven days. They just want to have the flexibility if I had to- and this is a guesstimation, they would be having live music one or two days a week and maybe the similar thing with the dj. I would like for you to consider that while I would allow the residents to hear their consensus, complaints and also from the committee members, the concern that I have is that you know the meth operation that you have as far as like the hours you open up until four o'clock in the morning, so we should come to some consensus agreement to see when you're going to request the live, music and dj, but just think about that yeah. But I'd like to hear in the meantime, some comments are from our residents are seeing. Do you have anyone up? No hands raised all right committee members, so the Ascii is to add music and dj. The hours of operations are on a daily basis, from A.M to four A.M and sundays, with exceptional Sunday, which is 12 noon to 4 A.M, a big concern that you know. If we're going to have music, we need to have some ideas as to when the dj and the live music is going to be performed and from there you know we got some ideas that Lisa enables will not be providing any complaints or giving compensator committee members any issues. I have a question, you know the outdoor dining going on. Will the dj be playing the music outside or within I'll? Stop you right there. No, they are looking. They have. I believe, they've been a good neighbor they're, looking to continue to be a good neighbor. The residents that live above them are their patrons as well and they're, not looking to intimidate they're, not looking to aggravate they're, not looking to passivate any issues, they're looking to be a good neighbor. If they see that somebody's complaining that at 11:30 on a Tuesday night there, if they were to get that notice, they would immediately rectify it. They they've shown to be that type of operator and given everything that's going on and the amount of enforcement that the governor even admitted to not admitted but professed today, that will continue to go on with the task force. I see clearly that this will self- regulate. Well, they will self- regulate because they'll have no choice, it'll be shut down. I had a question based on the questionnaire I've been to the location. I I've enjoyed my time the times that I've spent there, but on here where it says how many SLA violations has the sustain previously been charged with. It says all charges are unrelated to sound, but there's one notice of pleading. Can you just elaborate on that and I'll be very frank that I personally wrote that in there, because I asked them and they did not remember, and I tried to look it up and it was extremely difficult. I even spoke to enforcement from the council's office. It spoke to mark Ferran. I was trying to get the past history and I could not. I did not see anything pop up when I did on the lamp program, the SLA lamp. You can do a search of past offenses. Nothing came up, but they told me that they did have offenses. So that was my poor attempt at trying to at least answer the question partially. So I yeah, but as far as they knew it was not sound related. It was things such as that building violation code violations. So, as far as I can answer that, thank you any other committee members. What time do they want to? They want to have live dj and music. It sounds like seven days a week. No well. No, they just they're not going to have like no well, I'm not asking I'm not asking what they may have. I'm saying: what are they asking for we're asking for an open and open calendar because if they want to have it, so can you my question: is this that live music and a dj? Is that seven days a week? Is the ask for to be able to have that seven days? A week, the ask is that credibility? If you want to limit you know no more than I do not want to get legal, I mean like yeah, it's the ask to have live music in a dj right, seven days a week and so to what time, every day, every day. Well again right now they, I will explain why I'm I have to answer it. This way. Excuse me right now they have the ability to have recorded music till four A.M seven days a week. They have that that's in their method of operation. They do not want to they're not going to go back a few steps, they're looking to have music playing at a level that it would be that they're allowed to play now no louder than they're allowed to play now the ability to, instead of having it being just going through a serious radio having somebody there to choose the music is the dj and that's what they're looking to do all over. You know the open hours seven days a week, the ability to do it and again they would probably only do it three or four days a week at most, but from my end, having open hours up to four o'clock in the morning. It's not something that I'm willing to approve, but I'm willing to discuss this with within Committee Sure committee members. Do you have any recommendations as to when we can have this request be made and to what time, and which days? I recommend that perhaps on weekends, which includes I'll say even since they've been a great neighbors, I'm willing to go Thursday, Fridays and saturdays up to four A.M. The rest of the day is perhaps 2 A.M, with the conditions that you post a good naval sign and that you also post a telephone number where the manager can be reached anytime. If there are any issues for the residents and Isidro, we just have a hand raised from Jacob. I'm not sure if he's the owner, but he's saying owner is here and if we would like to if we have some questions directly for the owner. Okay, before we entertain the motion that I just put on the floor, let's allow Jacob to introduce himself if it's related to this particular application. Jacob, please submit yourself jacob hello. Yes, you have two minutes. You probably won't hear me too well, because the train, I'm under the l train, which is the number one 109. I've been here for 11 years, he's almost two minutes so he's under the train for two minutes. That's it for two minutes: no, you are the restaurant. Please are calling when you do not have a such background. The problem is that the train does not you do not it does not. You can't hear me because you're trained and that's the perfect example of how loud it is here, where's the train. You understand. I want you to take that into consideration that the train is more loud than any music I ever put in 11 years. Is this related physical application? Yes, he's saying that the train is far louder than any music that will be invaded from the premise? That's why you can you can not hear me? Okay, if you listen to the train right now. It's going by, you say, look, listen, you see. This is the train. You see, we can't have a conversation if the train passed by. So this is a lot of training and you guys most of you guys, probably know me because I've been here in this place for 11 years. I never had a complaint, probably one summers. There was an official prison that was given something like candy and we never had a sentence from that officer. We always you know we always try to do the right thing in the neighborhood for the customers for the patients or, for my you know my neighbors. So in 11 years I never had an issue. The training is going bad again. Thank you guys, thank you so much. So the idea is that from one another that the train itself make makes more noise than the establishment. So it's I got the message now committee members, what I had requested as a consideration, which was thursdays, Fridays and saturdays until allowed dj and live music to replay until 4 am and the rest of the days at 2 am. Would that be something that you think will be fair committee members? So my question is, I guess, in the surrounding area, we do not have to go the entire neighborhood, but I guess we can do maybe a five block radius, because I know there are other establishments that are similar to that in that area. Is that the norm in terms of other locations that are allowed to have djs and live music? Those hours that you're proposing it's not a case- by- case scenario? We do not have a strict guideline. It all depends about the background information that we get from 34 prisons, Intel previous summonses residence complaints. Now we do not have any wrestlers complaints so far the prisons seem to have not many issues with this establishment. I believe that they have fired the manager that received the tough summonses simply they rectify the problem. I, but you know, having an open like 4 A.M straight out would not give up perhaps issue we'll have some issues with the residents like not being able to sleep, even though there is the train that passing by right now and then I just want to be a little bit. Cautious. May I just say one thing: no we're in committee. Okay, I'm saying yes do. They have a sound limiter as well attached there and, secondly, how about I mean, I guess the concern with a dj is a little different, because we all know djs and club land can have followings. Okay can get into promotions. What do we do about? You know no promotions, that type of stuff, so there is soundproof, the space has been soundly effectively soundproofed and there is a sound limit installed and what about the promoting you know? Sometimes we show you not to see they changed. This order for the questionnaire no promoting there'll be no promoting no promoting, not promoting nothing right. I also have a question. You said that we'll be playing live acoustic music. When will it be performing? When will the live music roll? I would presume at some point in the evenings- and you know I'd have to check with my client if 2 A.M limit, you know the four days a week would be acceptable. I I would think it would be, but I can't speak for my client. We need to come to some understanding because to have an open like country of four I on a daily basis, is something that we'll not feel comfortable with. Well, it's currently, it's open at 4 am, and there is it's open, but there's no live music, no dj, but there is music. This exact same level. It would be with dj. It's not changing. It's just who's programming, the music. That's all! That's the only difference and live music is all acoustic which will be lower than the recorded music is now. Let me open it up at the rest of the committee and committee members. What feedback? I agree with you seizure. I think it's fair that Thursday through Saturday, you can play music all night, not a lot of people work on weekends. You know kids are at home because of Covid-19, but eventually they will be going back to school. I think it's unfair for families, so I think Thursday through Saturday at 4, A.M and then Sunday through Wednesday 2 A.M. It's pretty fair, any other committee members. I mean from charge. It's reasonable, you know, live music and dj are a little different than recorded music and it can. It can bring other issues that people that want to sleep may not get sleep there. It's more out of concern, so just to note the owner. I believe this is the owner. Jacob just wrote in the Q&A that they're only open until 2 A.M every day those are their hours of operation. So to your suggestion you see Joe, then, if they're only open based on what on the application of the file, they wrote down that they are closed at 4. Am that's not the license that was you're breaking up? Romano, I'm sorry yeah, I'm breaking you guys are breaking up the license currently is a 4 am license. Sorry. I was zoom put on me unexpectedly, so yeah in the Q&A section, the owner stated that their hours of operation, I'm assuming that they're closing earlier than their license, allows them to so, if they're only open until two yen to your suggestion, I think limiting the dj in live music until 2 am, while the days of the week should not be a problem all right. So it seems like we have a consensus: Mr Romano. Yes, the idea. Yes, the idea is to have a live music allowed thursdays through saturdays and then there's a days nights at 2 A.M. That's something that your client will be amenable to given the hours that my client is informing everyone that he has been shutting early. That absolutely had no objection to that very well. So the idea is to have thursdays through Saturday until four A.M, and then there are days until 2 A.M, with understanding of two stipulations that you're going to have a good neighbor sign posted and it's romano. You can get that from the office staff. You can send a note and get that template just post it, and also we need a phone number of the money in place to make sure that if there are any issues that someone can receive the call to rectify the problems, if there are any okay very well so, based on those two sets of steps, I recommend if there are no questions, objections that will go through vote. Yes, this is again for everybody. This is item 12, Eskina Assiso, yes, Gerard! Yes, Cindy Ashley; yes, Leo! Yes, Angel! Yes, mario, yes, waldees! Yes, robin yes, so this passes unanimously. Nine yeses! Congratulations! Thank you! Everybody! I appreciate the time and I see Jacob chip ps192 Class of fourth fifth sixth grade. I went there so that was pretty good to see. Thank you, everybody! So much so next on the agenda state Lego, Authority, New licenses. This is new. License section we're going to be doing item 13. item 13 is Miss Delicious Colombianos, 588, West, 207Th Street, it's at the corner of Amelia Avenue, again, Miss Delicious! Are you here miss Delicious Columbianas? Anybody representing miguel? If it's you you're on you, nobody, okay! So also chanel, this this applicant, I sorry, is either I was on Mute, I'm representing this application. Okay, so Miguel Chanel. Are you on the line? Yes, I am so we have not did we receive anything from Mr Lisa's columbianas. As far as I got the floorplan questionnaire, many because I do not have that. I just received a menu. I just I just emailed other menu because that we had submitted earlier with all my other paperwork and I just realized my secretary did not submit the menu, but there is a floor plan and an application that was submitted at four o'clock. Would you like me to forward you the menu? Can you upload the floor plan and the questionnaire please like share my screen? Yes, please, okay, for new members, when we entertain a full liquor license or any new license in order for an application to be considered complete, they have to have a complete questionnaire. If the question is not completed, they'll be incomplete, it will be considered as a incomplete application. They also have to have a menu a copy of the menu. It does not have to be fancy, but it is required that they provide a copy of other menu and also a copy of the flow plan. If those items are in place, we would consider the application because will be considered completed. Okay, so the diagram is here: okay and now the menu is there as well right. The menu is here very well, so we do see the menu that's really important, but now, if you're so kind, can you please then go back to the questionnaire all right? So let me I'm going to read actually now from the questionnaire for I guess everyone is able to see the questionnaire correct. So this is a full liquid license scroll down a little bit. As you know, please. So this on the question how many rpl are in the area? There are six, so this will go to a hearing for the 500 feet, hearing that will be a special hearing and that will be completely separate which we will not have jurisdiction over. Can you please scroll down, so the method operation will be no jukebox. No dj music will be recorded through recorded means, there'll be no karaoke, there'll be no live. Music. Sound limit will be installed. The space will be sufficient professionally efficiently. Soundproofed there'll be nother party promotion. No security person will be required if you scroll down please in essence, I'm running for cafe all right, so that was operation which is important is from 10 A.M to 10 P.M on a daily basis. The capacities are 45 w2 employees, so it seems like a very small place. I'm just wondering the need about a full equal license, but let's have that discussion with the representative Sofi Sapena Matanuchi. This is the primary 34 prison. This establishment is where, as a salon used to be at elite as a Soyuz mistaken, would that be correct again, all right? Okay, it's on the same block as it's not actually on the corner it's in between, but the establishment that was there before was salon. If I'm not mistaken right, I believe so yeah very well so officer. This is with the February 34 of our precinct. Can you please tell us a bit more about your concern, so I I'm only on the phone, so I do not have any of the arrangements that you guys have up. I just want to confirm. You said open am to 10 pm, and you said the occupancy is five yeah all right yeah that does sound like a small place. The biggest concern that we have is West. 207Th Street is congested even in the middle of like the pandemic, at its height seventh Street had if there's one lane going one lane going west we're going to ask, definitely no valet parking. I do not know if that was something that you were going to look for or whatever, but the parking is our biggest concern, because cars can not get through that block, but the buses need to get through the block. It would definitely be our our biggest concern very well. I've been around the area and you're right I see. Sometimes I even though Boston I even passed by very worrisome to see this this problem, so traffic congestion is an issue miguel. Yes, please tell us a bit more about the owners. Experience where they're coming from how well they know the community how well they know the issues affecting that particular area. We already heard about traffic congestions noise pollution is also a problem. So can you please share a bit about the new owners? Well, in this case, Miss Rojas came to me. Miss Rojas is also a business owner. She owns a beauty salon, Spa, 207 and Nagel Avenue, so she's very familiar with the neighborhood. This is a small family. Business came in with her two sons, who's going to be assisting her and operating the business is currently open and operating without an actual license. So the reason that she is applying for a full liquor license is, as many of you know, in our neighborhood, the majority of the consumers. Maybe 95 consume a variety of alcoholic beverages. Wine and beer basically limits your establishment in sales. So, as you can see, there's many businesses in this past year or two that have decided to change class. As you can see part, you know vui for 30 years in that location, and you know now have decided to change it in order for them to compete with the diaper strip, because if I'm, the only person, selling wine and beer- but I have great food, people would prefer to go to an establishment that has a type of alcohol that I'm looking for and basically having a full liquor license, will give you the opportunity to offer to complement your food different types of alcoholic beverages, you're not limited to just wine and beer. In many cases, even a sangria that you would like to offer contains some sort of alcoholic beverages. You know liquor in order for you to prepare it. She's been operating. As you can see, her hours of operations are very conservative. Just please. Let me know how many prior to her opening this restaurant she's never had experience in the restaurant business. But you know, like I said you as a business owner as entrepreneur. In some cases, you may do your due diligence in order for you to gain the experience outside of the business prior to you. Opening the majority of restaurant owners initiate their establishments without any experience you know, maybe consulting through a consulting firm or operational manager. I feel that an opportunity should be given to her to continue her current operations, in which, like I said, her hours of operations are from 10 to 10, should not exceed that. So this is basically a competitive source in order for her to be able to make ends meet until 7th Street, where you have enjoyed kitchen with full liquor, where you have me where you have like I'm comfortable, I'm comfortable with ours, I'm comfortable with the Meth operations, but the self alcohol is extremely important to our community. You know that sells to minor could be a big problem and that's understood that area is well known for consumption of alcohol. We have about six or seven different licenses there. So my concern about is not alcohol management not experienced handling alcohol could be a problem, however training. Yes, I can truly recommend her to obtain the tips alcohol class prior to her going for 500 foot. As you mentioned at the beginning of the meeting, she is required to go to 500 for hearing and basically, if she does not show that she can manage a business that sells Alcohol, I doubt it very much. You know that the liquor authority will approve a liquor license. You know without a person showing that she has been trained or has tried her best to learn how to manage alcoholic beverages aside from food. Thank you Chanel. Can you please go back to the floor plan if you're so kind can the 3- 4 precinct just say one more thing, sorry to interrupt sure. So the only thing, the only question that I have is regarding staff. I do not want to sound like a broken record, so I hope all the new applicants are listening, but the new indoor seating, that's starting on September 30th, the 25% capacity that does include staff. So we want to stress that right we are going to request strict compliance with that. There also are other things that I hope that you can just go on to the Drc City.Gov website and read everything, including the temperature check at the door. One member provides a number for for tracing purposes, no bar service, so this that we need strict compliance with that until that's lifted and just for all the new businesses to know the SLA has been out. It's no secret they've been making examples of of locations that are not following protocol. We just want you to be aware of that and everybody to follow the guidelines very strictly, because you do not want to be the example that they make all right. That's it yeah! On that note officer Mcdonough when the governor said like no power service. What that means is that there'll be no consumption of alcohol sitting at the bar right. It should be through to the tables. Is that is that correct? That's correct! You can not just sit at the bar and consume alcohol. You can buy alcohol, but you can not sit at the bar and consume the alcohol very well, including food. Sorry, I believe you can consume food and alcohol at the bar when you, when you go in you're, more than welcome to sit down as long as they're at or under the 25% capacity going up to the bar and sitting on a bar, stool and consuming alcohol is not okay. That's what I'm saying, but if you're consuming food and alcohol, it's okay to sit at the bar, not at the bar okay, so basically there's no consumption at the bar. None got it so Miguel. I do not see when I check the floor plan here yeah. There is no bar there. No, I see no bar and only that well where the bar will be placed at where are the restrooms okay, but where would the restroom be at well there's a food prep area in the back where you can walk through it? I'm not sure. Let me see, I do not see the restaurant there I mean the restroom and I do not see the bar listed there. No, because they're not going to have a bar they're, basically just going to be serving alcohol, no sit down Gotcha. So, where are the restaurants? It's I I'm looking at it now and it seems like the floor plan that was provided there was a restroom in the back of the business. Thank you Chanel. Thank you so much all right and they are ADA compliant right, yes, correct! Thank you! So much for the rest of committees, any other questions, I'm recommending some stipulations. Does the cruises have surveillance cameras? Yes, there will be six cameras in place. Oh there is six cameras in place now all right. Remember: first, I'm sorry yeah! I just wanted to ask how many, how much time has she been in operation, how many months or years I know you said that she's already open serving the food, but how long she came. She went into business prior to the pandemic, shut down for a little bit and reopened when we were able to do the outdoor seating so about she's been in business for about four or five months community members, so I recommend four steps, one of which will be just a recommendation. Our first there'll be no ballet parking. That is also illegal from phenomenal Mistaken amiga right, yes correct! So let's even strike that, because that'll be illegal anyway, yeah you have to have an assigned parking area like right. You know driving Miguel. I recommend that a meeting this work a recommendation only that the owner meet with 34th Precinct for them to exchange contact information in case there are some emergencies also that obviously mountainous not only for prison. We have an understanding how the place is going to look like in case of amazing who should they be contacting and any other clear commandos that should be addressed with 34 prison. I'm leaving that up to you, but I'm asking for a gun sign to be posted and again a phone number to be fully displayed in the in case. There are any issues or emergencies for a manager to be responsible for that committee members. So, based on those two stipulations phone numbers, I'm going to sign, I recommend they go to a street vote you're right, yeah, I'm you you're right I'll, meet yourself! Okay, sorry for item 13.. How do you vote? Yes? Cindy? Yes, Ashley! Yes, Leo, yes, angel! Yes, Marielle, yes, weldies, yes, Robin! Oh okay, now Robin I'm going to have state on this one.

Please is crack appeal, representative here, hello, so see. That is the case. You know there's no need to share that screen. There's no one from kraken and crack and peel[ _, _] pillow, so go to vote. We go to straight vote, usually guys. The new members, when there's an applicant that who is new and no one shows up, we recommend a negative vote because obviously we do not have all the details oftentimes. What happens is that they do not show up for whatever reason, but they will come back, so the recommendation will be a negative vote and for the SLA not to take any not to make any decisions, no matter until they meet with the Community Board or at least the license committee. You guys understand that Marielle Angel Leo all right, so erratica yeah. No, I vote no cindy, Abstain, okay, Ashley, no Leo, no angel, no Marielle, no waldis sting abstain. Well, he's abstained.

Are you present going once going twice? You swim in it you're right. Let's check the question. Danny Maranta says he's present. Excuse me, may I say something I got disconnected crack and peel. I'm not sure. If you call the business we called three times and nobody answered. Yes, we I got disconnected. I do not know how that works. Now cathedral someone said we voted. We asked three times. Oh, I do not know what happened. I got disconnected, but we kind of voted. So that's the problem. We already voted that vote can not be under undone. Oh, my goodness, right you'll have to recommend all this time and just got disconnected when you guys called me. It's it's unfortunate. There'll, be agenda. Item number 15:14, crack appeal, yeah, we already considered 15. Now we are into 16 that was 13. is special here this season.

We can not undo the vote. We will have to consider this application next month, but you have to reapply to the community board, so they can push on the calendar all right, you're right, there's, nothing that can be done today. Sorry, so I know sixteen Beijing two or three Inc. I was here all the time and I just got disconnected. I mean my name and everything is in the representative's information and you guys are seeing me sandra connected Sandra. We dealt with agenda item number 13 for a while we called it could not have been a while, because I was looking to connect back to the I was looking to connect back, so it only took what I got connected. So the vote was. Is there somebody for crack and field? No, because I was not on and everybody know, voted to extend that must have been in minutes seconds. I did not say no, we call it three times your name and you will not eating answers. Then we entertain again, so I make a motion that we move along because we we're all doing good work and hard work and we call three times. I understand three times I was here. Otherwise, if we're going to stay on much longer, I've got to go as huge, too yeah Sandra we got it, we get. We have to move on, there's nothing that comes that this community can do to undo the phone very much you're right. Thank you there. So next up on the agenda is item 16 visa. They say they're here, Danny maranto. Are you here? Fantastic, welcome, danny right, that's correct and for the records you are a representative owner all right officer. Matunish's idea is that this license be transferred over to a new ownership. The license is active. They have in essence, ask for transfer of the license name. What is the opinion of 34 prison? This is item number 16 right. Yes, okay, no, we have. We have nothing to say on this place. The place is in compliance very well. I myself have been at this establishment. I, like I, like other, live music that they have there. It's not loud. I can actually have dinner and carry a conversation. It's a really nice place. I'm not going to open up to play the lines for the residents to see any issues seeing the animations. I just want to acknowledge Teddy Gonzalez, I'm not sure. If he's a resident that would like to speak so Teddy. This is about this particular application. Only so please meet yourself and introduce yourself and what is the concern and all comments right, hello, hi, Teddy, okay, Jesus I've been trying to get on. I'm sorry about that yeah, I'm not the. What do you call the resident? I am the representative okay for the restaurant, so you are the representative for Teddy right yeah. Yes, I'm having some very much technical problems almost broke the computer. I do not know so welcome. Thank you. Now do I have any concerns from residents. Cindy, none committee members, none danny! Can you tell us a little bit about yourself? Please damning! Hey sorry about that! Let's see I've been, I was born and raised in this community. I do not know anything else outside of New York City children of four and pretty much just trying to better my life and that's why I want to be a part of the community and be a part of something that I can be respectful of. What's your experience at 30 I mean Danny, I'm sorry in handling alcohol and handling alcohol. I do not have any experience, unfortunately, but I do have experience in customer service management. Hospitality, who are you going to have as a bartending, say that again, I'm sorry who's going to do your bartending I'm going to get a licensed bartender? Well, he should be also using the previous owner's bartenders as well. What was that Teddy then he's going to be also using the previous bartenders they're, currently open with a temporary license? Okay, so they are going to be staying there, the employees that yes, I mean he should basically keep the same operation, and you know he does not want to disrupt the atmosphere or even the members of the community that come there to enjoy their dinner and everything he's going to basically stay the same way make some money. You know maybe some adjustments, if anything, but nothing should be drastic and it's going to be a friend, a good neighbor in the community and everything else. So danny I've been to the place a couple of times and I'm not. I have not seen you. Will you be there consistently now that I need to see you, but you know, take into account that you're going to be your license holders. We want to make sure that there is a supervision on the establishment, making sure that everything's straight so you'll be there consistently. Yes, that is correct. I just I'm usually in the office a lot trying to get the office rearranged from the previous there. We Owners Committee Members Committee members all right very well. If there are no objection, I'd like to move this for straight vote. Okay, item 16 yeshidro: yes, yep, okay, gerard, yes, Cindy, yes, Ashley or come back Leo! Yes angel; yes, weldies!

Thank you very much and thank you for bringing me into conversation before with the people that I have Teddy and danny congratulations to you and I hope that you do prosper. Thank you. Thank you have a good day good evening great. So next, on the agenda's item 17, it's called Pharaoh's Bistro Corp, it's Dba, Pharaoh's, Bistro, 524, West, 207Th Street. It's between post and sherman, again Pharaohs Bistro, Corp Dba Pharaoh's bistro. Are you present Pharaoh's Bistro Corp? Are you President going once going twice straight vote? Yes, okay, so for item 17, Pharaoh's bistro? How do you vote a cesaro? No gerard, no cindy hello, cindy! Absolutely! Oh I'm sorry! Cities! No! I'm abstaining! Oh abstain! Okay! Sorry! Indeed in the Q&A, I'm sorry there's someone in the Q&A, I'm assuming that's the licensee, so you're right, the board has not been finalized. Okay, can we open up to see what Reagan has to say if it's relevant to this conversation, sure I mean: are they? Are they the are they the owner or a representative? Let's find out, oh cool Reagan I'll meet you southeast hello. Do you hear me? Yes, hi? Okay! Yes, we want to know what is your affiliation to this establishment agenda? Item number 17 firearms, visual corporation. Yes, I'm the owner, you're, the owner, yeah, all right very well. Let me go back now to Chanel is still online. Yes, I believe that we have not received a complete application for this applicant, correct yeah. I think we received the questionnaire very well so Regan, so we do not have a complete application on this for this establishment since you're. The owner, okay, we need to have a complete application that includes a full field questionnaire, which office staff will be more than happy to provide you with one okay. We need to have also floor plans for the establishment and a copy of other menu. Okay, now we were going to be voting. We were going to be voting against this establishment, but since you're here and the application is not complete, I recommend that you file an application again with the board to come next month perfect, and I highly recommend that you withdraw the application. That way, you will not be penalized okay. So how can I do that? Just say that you would like to withdraw and you would like to come back for next month, but you still have to follow up with the normal process of getting everything in order which is contact the Community board and getting all the questionnaire filled along with a copy of the floor plan and also a menu. Okay sounds good, so I like to withdraw the application, so the application has been withdrawn by the owner. There is no need to vote on the matter, so this application has been withdrawn. Okay, next on the agenda is eating place beer, it's item 18, it's the final last one and it's seafood: Kingfish Market Inc, it's 3903, dance, 3905, broadway, that's at the corner of West 163Rd, Street, Seafood, King fish market are you present? There's ownership or a rep from Seaford King fish market presents going once going twice going three times. Shall we vote this? Is you I'm one representing a seafood king fish market? Now? No okay! I vote no cindy epstein cindy Abstains Ashley, no okay, Leo no angel! Now marielle, no weldies, no robin okay. So this vote does not pass one abstention and one two three four five: six seven no's and that concludes the agenda. That concludes the agenda. I'd like to check with our new committee members guys how you feel about your new experience with the committee any input any areas that perhaps we can improve. What are your? What are your opinions? Angel Leo, Marielle, hi, everyone? Yes, so thank you. I one suggestion I think would be maybe for those who are joining in whether they be the owners of the establishments or the representatives would be just if they can kind of add the name of the location next to their. You know name on zoom, but you know. I also recognize that in some cases there may be. You know one representative representing several locations and some places that might be tricky just so that we can avoid what happened earlier very well. Thank you. So much Leo angel, that's my point. Maybe if you know we can provide a number in case they do sign up and fall out. They could just reach out to us so that we can and give somebody a chance. I felt bad for the other lady, but you know those are rules yeah. Yes, indeed, you know I was. I will add just to clarify that you know this. You guys are starting to zoom but believe it or not. When you get into actual back on- site meetings, it's not uncommon for people to leave the room and like disappear, and then they come back and what happens is after a couple of times of doing these things until 11 or midnight after the first or second time, you're like listen, if you're, not here, if you, if you can't, invest enough in this to stay here for the meeting and you're going to bug in and then bug out, I think we're going to stay until midnight or 1.. That's kind of what happens. Actually, it's not that we're being not thoughtful or considerate. You'll find that often people just kind of get take advantage of it. I guess my two cents would be. I really enjoyed this first meeting. I think it ran rather smoothly. I like how we got through location after location, and there was a lively discussion, including the police precincts. My one question, I guess, is in regards to the paperwork. So there's a I'm assuming now there's a difference between an application and a questionnaire do: does everyone need to submit a questionnaire and an application? Is that the case? Yes? Okay- and so I know cj- you mentioned this earlier at the onset of the meeting, but trying to get that paperwork to us before 4 P.M or I do not know if it's establishing a deadline for the folks that are applying would be very helpful so that we're not skirmishing at the end of the day, trying to read all this doc other documentation. But I know that you covered that at the beginning of the meeting. Already great point angel great point, so I really like to thank all the new members of the committee members, the NYPD and our residents that are vigilant of our community. They look out for things and issues and we welcome those comments and sometimes even compliments. It's a community we're proud of this community. We've worked really hard, very proud of the work that you have. You guys have put in that many hours. This is a committee that we work very cohesively. We respect people's opinion. We do not disrespect anyone and I'm very proud of the work and the skills that you all have brought to the community and, together with to make a positive things going forward for this community we are not going to give in this community is going to survive. I know that these are very trying times, but we are very dedicated individuals. We love our community, we fight for our community and I'm sure we're going to strive so. Based on that, I would like to get a motion to watch on ocean return. It's either. I did have a question, but sorry, I'm sorry Natalie. I did not see please go on. That's all right. I had my hand raised, and I know that it's hard for you to manage. I just wanted to make a comment about one of the challenges of zoom being that you no longer have a sign- in list, so normally in a physical meeting, you have the sign- in list for the meeting attendees and then also for the board members that are used and that one's used for attendance, but the other sign- in sheet had always been used. As a way to capture who was there and add them to the mailing list for the board, so that's a bit of a loss and maybe one way that you can use a zoom feature so that you can capture who the applicants and the representatives are who are joining the meeting is by providing a registration link and then in that registration link, the meeting hosts will be able to see who has entered the meeting and in what role they are participating in that meeting. Thank you so much not olivia for the for the heads up, I'm new to this like many, but you know a lot of people, but thank you for your recommendation. Perhaps the office can take note on that and execute. Thank you Natalie for always giving us a wonderful recommendations. Anything else comedy members residents. I want you to adjourn Second and a second anyone against it. Watch your passes. Thank you. So much have a good night. Peace be healthy, good night good night.
