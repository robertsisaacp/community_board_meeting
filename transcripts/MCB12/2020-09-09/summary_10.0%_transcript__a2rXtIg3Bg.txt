You do not mind me asking what was I your area of studies in college, political science, nice, so working on behalf of the New York City Department of Very well I lived in this community when I was younger, moved out to Tina New Jersey when I entered high school originally from the Dominican Republic though, but did elementary and part of my secondary studies.
It's not my first time, interacting with the community Board or this committee, as I was the chief of staff to stay Senator Marisol when she was the state senator representing this upper Manhattan, area , I'm, currently at the United Federation of teachers as the deputy political director there, where I help manage and support our legislative and political affairs at the union.
And I'm, happy to be a part of this committee because to Leo's point at the beginning, I'm, looking forward to finding ways to making sure that our local businesses and our enterprises thrive in this community in a safe, way.
Although I did move away for four years for college also went to college near kind of in upstate, western New York area, I'm new to the Community Board I'm, looking forward to working with all of you to continue to support small businesses in our area and support our community.
I believe to make sure that our restaurants owners are properly informed about the new regulations, because I know that, with this opening of 25, there will be enforcement and we understand that.
The committee members have put in time to make sure that the cases of which applicant gets heard in a respected and dignified way.
We will meet and chat and discuss how we're going to approach one particular application, and then we vote.
If there are issues affecting applicants who terms have come for renewal, then we can have an open discussion and even if they do not show up, we can always provide a recommendation for a negative fold.
You can tell us about some issues affecting one particular applicant, and then we can vote one way or the other or another.
You know, with the request for the Vicar authority and for the Community Board to present ourselves and identify any issue that may be occurring at the establishment.
So the owners can definitely work on everything, very well I, do not know if you can answer this question, but on your health grade as inspected by the New York City of the family health, you had it be great any issues that are going on establishment.
The thing is that the point calculation with the health department- So that means sometimes it could be a rag that could be laying on top of the counter that the employee just finished using so the grade evaluation, In order for us to address and say you know, everything is spotless, because every business owner is trying to be spotless, but it all depends at the time the inspector comes in.
Sometimes the owners out acrosss the street, getting a vegetable You know, that's a violation, because you're supposed to be president of this time, so I believe that all matters have been addressed.
So I recommended that they have all music equipment inside the establishment and let whatever sound you know, light sound, go out to the outside during the times of operation.
We just want to show that you know the issues that we can correct and rectify from our business, that we are there to help very well.
Yes, I leave any other committee meeting member out This passes unanimously, one no vote and one two three, four: five: six!
Liquor license item two : It is cafe Sahara located at 4:40, 26, 10th avenue, Yes, I'm, also representing cafe Sahara One thing I would like to mention.
Do it right away, because I think it's easier sure that way we save some time and introduction, and all of that so now I want to jump to agenda item number nine, and the idea is that there is a corporate change for the new members that came into to the committee every time that there is a corporate change, meaning like shares have been shifted, one side or another or the ssl.
This is the place at the right time to entertain this application, and the idea is that, from what I understand that is a cell is that correct, amigo yeah, basically Mr Carella who's been working together with Mr Tejada for the last year and a half.
Any honestly, I know every complaint matters so for the four calls that were in 2019, I mean as long as it's as long as we keep the music down.
First, his experience his knowledge of this community, and what is he going to bring to this new establishment?
What's another restaurant, I'm, sorry, the name of the right, it's the same name actually but So he's been working with Mr Carella for over a year and a half in the location and assisting him.
Music has been pretty much reduced in comparison to the beginning of these operations, so I believe Mr Tahada will continue the same type of operations, that's currently in the business, since he has already been assisting Mr Carrell in these operations for the last year and a half, I do not foresee any issues or any changes that are currently in the establishment at this moment.
So this passes unanimously by a vote of seven yeses and zero knows There we go so this application.
This was June 12th, and this was this was a photo that was sent in to 311 of people not socially distancing and not wearing a mask in front of the location of Dallas Barbecue, and then we have not had any through one calls, July, August and so far this month, and we have not had any 9- 1- 1 related issues since pretty much the issue on March 21st, Thank, you committee, members.
I, just wanted to ask the police precinct I'm, assuming that the reduction in incidents over July and August could somehow be connected to you all interacting with the ownership, or, I guess the administration of the establishment after the 311 calls right.
Well, I mean I know everything has has changed with the outdoor seating and not having people eating inside the location throughout the summer, but we have not had really aside from those complaints.
You know we operate a neighborhood restaurant bar This thing about the grand larson was reported by the 34th president.
As Well committee members, any issues before Piper's kilter was big cherries, yes, Some recommend that we go to straight vote.
Thank you, our committee members, any issues taking that into account anything that you want to tell us ariel on this particular applicant.
You know we have different classes as well as like for alcohol, licenses.
License, and you know we're going to discuss the matter now with 34 prison.
Is, just think about the residents when it comes to what you're, adding and that that's our biggest concern but, like I, said nothing in 2019 and nothing in 2020 for us to say that we do not approve all right.
We received a letter from one of our restaurants, mayan collins, who's very active in our community, and one of the questions that he asked me was to make sure that we check the hours that the dj is going to be performing.
I would like for you to consider that, while I would allow the residents to hear their consensus, complaints and also from the committee members, The concern that I have is that you know the meth operation that you have as far as like the hours you open up until four o'clock in the morning.
So we should come to some consensus agreement to see when you're going to request the live, music and dj, but just think about that No hands raised all right committee members, so the Ascii is to add.
We need to have some ideas as to when the dj and the live music is going to be performed and from there you know we got some ideas that Lisa enables will not be providing any complaints or giving compensator committee members any issues.
You know no more than I do not want to get legal, It's the ask to have live music in a dj right, seven days a week and so to what time, every day, every day.
There was an official prison that was given something like candy We always you know we always try to do the right thing in the neighborhood for the customers for the patients or, for my So in 11 years, I never had an issue.
I, but you know, having an open like 4 A.M Straight out, would not give up perhaps issue May I, just say one thing, no we're in committee.
Experience, where they're coming from how well they know the community how well they know the issues affecting that particular area.
As, you can see part, you know vui for 30 years in that location, and you know now have decided to change it in order for them to compete with the diaper strip, because if I'm, the only person, selling wine and beer- But I have great food, people would prefer to go to an establishment that has a type of alcohol that I'm looking for and basically having a full liquor.
Let me know how many prior to her opening this restaurant She's never had experience in the restaurant business.
But you know, like I, said you as a business owner as entrepreneur.
The majority of restaurant owners initiate their establishments without any experience you know, maybe consulting through a consulting firm or operational manager.
So, based on those two stipulations phone numbers, I'm going to sign, I recommend they go to a street vote.
So the recommendation will be a negative vote and for the SLA not to take any not to make any decisions, no matter until they meet with the Community Board or at least the license.
Please write down your phone number where people can reach you in case They have problems in connecting with a meeting, so Sandra Evan is going to share his contact information so that this will not happen again at the committee took a vote.
I'm, not going to open up to play the lines for the residents to see any issues.
So they are going to be staying there, the employees that yes, I mean he should basically keep the same operation, and you know he does not want to disrupt the atmosphere or even the members of the community that come there to enjoy their dinner and everything he's going to basically stay the same way.
We were going to be voting against this establishment, but since you're here and the application is not complete, I recommend that you file an application again with the board to come next month.
