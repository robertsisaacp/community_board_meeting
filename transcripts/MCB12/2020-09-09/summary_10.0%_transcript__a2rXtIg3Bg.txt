It's not my first time, interacting with the community board or this committee as I, was the chief of staff to stay senator marisol when she was the state senator representing this upper Manhattan area, I'm, currently at the united federation of teachers as the deputy political director there, where I help manage and support our legislative and political affairs at the union.
That is the union that represents the new york city, new york, city's teachers and overall educators inside of our schools, I love washington heights and I'm happy to be a part of this committee because to leo's point at the beginning, I'm looking forward to finding ways to making sure that our local businesses and our enterprises thrive in this community in a safe way.
Everyone cindy matos community board member and happy to be back everyone, I'm, ashley, fernandez, born and raised in washington heights, been on the board for about a year just joined this particular committee.
Based on what I see here, it's mostly about the digital information that gets distributed and some restaurants might have might not have access to this I believe to make sure that our restaurants owners are properly informed about the new regulations, because I know that, with this opening of 25, there will be enforcement, and we understand that, but at least we would like for our restaurant operators to be fully informed, as a committee we're here to facilitate the process for licenses.
You know with the request for the vicar authority and for the community board to present ourselves and identify any issue that may be occurring at the establishment, so the owners can definitely work on everything, Very well, quick question: you had I, don't know if you can answer this question, but on your health grade as inspected by the new york city of the family health, you had it be great any issues that are going on establishment The thing is that the point calculation with the health department- Then you have to get below 13 points, so that means sometimes it could be a rag that could be laying on top of the counter that the employee just finished using so the grade evaluation, In order for us to address and say you know, everything is spotless, because every business owner is trying to be spotless, but it all depends at the time the inspector comes in.
Sometimes the owners out across the street getting a vegetable You know, that's a violation, because you're supposed to be president of this time, so I believe that all matters have been addressed when it comes to health department, a c would be concerning which that means This has not been a trouble spot, but I want.
We just want to show that you know the issues that we can correct and rectify from our business, that we are there to help very well Do. You have any questions or concerns from our residents, and for that cindy you manage that Do. We have any concerns from our committee members.
Do it right away because I think it's easier sure that way we save some time and introduction, and all of that so now I want to jump to agenda item number nine, and the idea is that there is a corporate change for the new members that came into to the committee every time that there is a corporate change, meaning like shares have been shifted one side or another or the ssl The client is recommended that they come to the community board and tell us about new changes.
First, his experience his knowledge of this community and Mr tejada has a current ownership in a restaurant in yonkers, where he gains his experience, manages alcohol food sales been doing a pretty good job prior to him Opening that restaurant he was also assisting mr carella in the operations of this establishment Basically, what's another restaurant Business owners being profitable, neighbors quality of life being addressed That's currently in the business, since he has already been assisting mr carrell in these operations for the last year and a half I , don't foresee any issues or any changes that are currently in the establishment at this moment, The last time that you came to the community board that was october, 2nd There were no objections by the community report.
This was June 12th, and this was this was a photo that was sent in to 311 of people not socially distancing and not wearing a mask in front of the location of dallas barbecue, and then we haven't had any through one calls july august and we haven't had any 9-1-1 related issues since pretty much the issue on march 21st, all right, Thank, you committee members, I just wanted to ask the police precinct I'm, assuming that the reduction in incidents over july and august could somehow be connected to you all, interacting with the ownership Well I mean I know everything has has changed with the outdoor seating and not having people eating inside the location throughout the summer.
You, our committee members, any issues taking that into account anything that you want to tell us ariel on this particular applicant Just the first three one calls were, and it was just educating the business owner, but we rectified all the situations and we don't have any issues after that Ernesto.
The current client has a beer and wine and they would like us to approve to change a class with which will upgrade themselves to a full liquor license, and you know we're going to discuss the matter now with 34 prison.
I mean in general for every restaurant, but our we've been struggling to catch up on the back It is questions from concerns from our committee members None move to go to street vote then on this matter, No you don't, but to understand that the final decision will be made by the general board, we're going to recommend that the general board that they approve your resolution and if and if so then the board will send a recommendation to sla to approve a change of classes.
We open up discussion on the matter agenda item number, 10 and 11 have been withdrawn and I just want to first say hello to everyone and let you know that I was born and raised.
Is, it's at the bottom of a of a residential building, is just think about the residents when it comes to what you're, adding and that that's our biggest concern but, like I, said nothing in 2019 and nothing in 2020 for us to say that we don't approve all right and we received a letter from one of our restaurants, mayan collins, who's very active in our community, and one of the questions that he asked me was to make sure that we check the hours that the dj is going to be performing.
A few minutes before we joined the meeting about you know, issues that some residents will have I will share that information with other committee members.
I would like for you to consider that while I would allow the residents to hear their consensus, complaints and also from the committee members, the concern that I have is that you know the meth operation that you have as far as like the hours you open up until four o'clock in the morning, so we should come to some consensus agreement to see when you're going to request the live, music and dj, but just think about that No hands raised all right committee members, so the ascii is to add music and dj A big concern that you know.
Don't want to get legal You know the open hours seven days a week, the ability to do it and again they would probably only do it three or four days a week at most, but from my end, having open hours up to four o'clock in the morning, It's, not something that I'm willing to approve but I'm willing to discuss this with within committee Sure committee members Let's allow jacob to introduce himself if it's related to this particular application.
If there are no questions, objections that will go through vote and I see jacob chip ps192 class of fourth fifth sixth grade So much so next on the agenda state lego authority, new licenses item 13 is miss delicious colombianos, 588, west 207th street It's at the corner of amelia avenue I'm representing this application My secretary did not submit the menu, but there is a floor plan and an application that was submitted at four o'clock.
Yes, please tell us a bit more about the owners experience where they're coming from how well they know the community how well they know the issues affecting that particular area.
You may do your due diligence in order for you to gain the experience outside of the business prior to you, Opening, the majority of restaurant owners initiate their establishments without any experience you know, maybe consulting through a consulting firm or operational manager This is basically a competitive source in order for her to be able to make ends meet until 7th street, where you have enjoyed kitchen with full liquor, where you have me where you have I'm comfortable with ours, I'm comfortable with the meth operations, but the self alcohol is extremely important to our community.
So this that we need strict compliance with that until that's lifted and just for all the new businesses to know the sla has been out On that note officer mcdonough when the governor said like no power service That means is that there'll be no consumption of alcohol sitting at the bar right.
If you're so kind, Please write down your phone number where people can reach you in case they have problems in connecting with a meeting, so sandra evan is going to share his contact information so that this will not happen again at the committee took a vote.
We fight for our community and I had my hand raised and I know that it's hard for you to manage I'm new to this like many, but you know a lot of people, but thank you for your recommendation.
