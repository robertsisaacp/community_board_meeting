If you don't mind me asking what was I your area of studies in college, political science, nice, so working on behalf of the new york city department of Very well I lived in this community when I was younger, moved out to tina new jersey when I entered high school, originally from the dominican, republic, though, but did elementary and part of my secondary studies.
It's not my first time, interacting with the community board, or this committee, as I, was the chief of staff to stay senator marisol when she was the state senator representing this upper Manhattan, area, I'm, currently at the united federation of teachers as the deputy political director there, where I help manage and support our legislative and political affairs at the union.
And I'm, happy to be a part of this committee because to leo's point at the beginning, I'm, looking forward to finding ways to making sure that our local businesses and our enterprises thrive in this community in a safe, way.
Although I did move away for four years for college also went to college near kind of in upstate, western new york, area, I'm new to the community board I'm, looking forward to working with all of you to continue to support small businesses in our area and support our community.
I believe to make sure that our restaurants owners are properly informed about the new regulations, because I know that, with this opening of 25, there will be enforcement and we understand that.
The committee members have put in time to make sure that the cases of which applicant gets heard in a respected and dignified way.
We will meet and chat and discuss how we're going to approach one particular application, and then we vote.
If there are issues affecting applicants who terms have come for renewal, then we can have an open discussion and even if they don't show up, we can always provide a recommendation for a negative fold.
You can tell us about some issues affecting one particular applicant, and then we can vote one way or the other or another.
You know, with the request for the vicar authority and for the community board to present ourselves and identify any issue that may be occurring at the establishment, so the owners can definitely work on everything.
Very, well, quick question: you had, I, don't know if you can answer this question, but on your health grade as inspected by the new york city of the family health, you had it be great any issues that are going on establishment.
So the grade evaluation, In order for us to address and say you know, everything is spotless, because every business owner is trying to be spotless, but it all depends at the time the inspector comes in.
So I recommended that they have all music equipment inside the establishment and let whatever sound you know, light sound, go out to the outside.
We just want to show that you know the issues that we can correct and rectify from our business, that we are there to help very well.
Yes, I leave any other committee meeting member out This passes unanimously, one no vote and one two three, four: five: six.
Do it right away, because I think it's easier sure that way we save some time and introduction, and all of that so now I want to jump to agenda item number nine, and the idea is that there is a corporate change for the new members that came into to the committee every time that there is a corporate change, meaning like shares have been shifted, one side or another or the ssl.
This is the place at the right time to entertain this application, and the idea is that from what I understand that is a cell is that correct, amigo Basically, mr carella who's been working together with mr tejada for the last year and a half.
What's another restaurant So he's been working with mr carella for over a year and a half in the location and assisting him, you know bringing in new clientele and creating a method of operation.
That's, currently in the business, since he has already been assisting mr carrell in these operations for the last year and a half, I, don't foresee any issues or any changes that are currently in the establishment at this moment.
Eight yeses, thank you, so much gerard will be sure to send a recommendation for this establishment to get the license by the committee, while you're getting the paperwork.
This was June 12th, and this was this was a photo that was sent in to 311 of people not socially distancing and not wearing a mask in front of the location of dallas barbecue, and then we haven't had any through one calls July august, and so far this month, And we haven't had any 9-1-1 related issues since pretty much the issue on March 21st, You committee members.
I, just wanted to ask the police precinct, I'm, assuming that the reduction in incidents over July and august could somehow be connected to you all interacting with the ownership, or, I guess the administration of the establishment after the 311 calls right.
The establishment is 1601 dominican, valley, restaurant corps, it's located at 1601, st nick avenue , That's at the corner of west 190th street.
31St application very well Thank you, our committee members, any issues taking that into account anything that you want to tell us ariel on this particular applicant.
You know we have different classes as well as like for alcohol, licenses.

Next up is under state liquor , authority method of operation change license so item 12 on the agenda is eskenia 214, corp dba, cafe tobacco ron , it's located at 501, west 214th, street.
Is, just think about the residents when it comes to what you're, adding and that that's our biggest concern but, like I, said nothing in 2019 and nothing in 2020 for us to say that we don't approve all right And, we received a letter from one of our restaurants, mayan collins, who's very active in our community, and one of the questions that he asked me was to make sure that we check the hours that the dj is going to be.
I would like for you to consider that while I would allow the residents to hear their consensus, complaints and also from the committee members, the concern that I have is that you know the meth operation that you have as far as like the hours you open up until four o'clock in the morning.
So we should come to some consensus agreement to see when you're going to request the live, music and dj, but just think about that No hands raised all right committee members, so the ascii is to add music and dj.
If we're going to have music, we need to have some ideas as to when the dj and the live music is going to be performed and from there you know we got some ideas that lisa enables will not be providing any complaints or giving compensator committee members.
There was an official prison that was given something like candy We. Always you know we always try to do the right thing in the neighborhood for the customers for the patients or, for my I never had an issue.
I, but you know, having an open like 4 a.m. Straight out would not give up, perhaps issue May I, just say one thing, no we're in committee.
Please tell us a bit more about the owners experience where they're coming from how well they know the community how well they know the issues affecting that particular area.
Let me know how many prior to her opening this restaurant She's never had experience in the restaurant business.
But you know, like I, said you as a business owner as entrepreneur.
Opening, the majority of restaurant owners initiate their establishments without any experience you know, maybe consulting through a consulting firm or operational manager.
So, based on those two stipulations phone numbers, I'm, gonna, sign, I, recommend they go to a street vote Now, robin I'm, going to have state on this one.
So the recommendation will be a negative vote and for the sla not to take any not to make any decisions, no matter until they meet with the community board or at least the license.
Please write down your phone number where people can reach you in case They have problems in connecting with a meeting, so sandra evan is going to share his contact information so that this will not happen again at the committee took a vote.
Okay for the restaurant You now do I have any concerns from residents cindy none committee, Let's, see I've been, I was born and raised in this community.
Okay, so they are going to be staying there, the employees that yes, I mean he should basically keep the same operation, and you know he doesn't want to disrupt the atmosphere or even the members of the community that come there to enjoy their dinner and everything Make.
We were going to be voting against this establishment, but since you're here and the application is not complete, I recommend that you file an application again with the board to come next month.
