You know like we try to provide in from as much information as we can, but now, How can we actually bring in actual resources to small businesses and educate ourselves in these resources in order to be able to provide accurate but also guide, small businesses towards the like directions that could potentially help them.
We're, going to start off the new year's, be with a discussion around partnerships and being able to solidify the work that our partners are doing.
What I would propose is that we actually start bringing in key stakeholders and we build that capacity together, whether it be cloth and their connections with their businesses, but also being able to create a space, a hub where all the community layers, all the key stakeholders that work with small businesses are also involved in a month-to-month basis, meaning, for instance, A lot of the making sure that we create space for them, And. I, think that has to do a lot, with.
What we'll do is some of the welcoming the welcome welcoming opening remarks, the approval of agenda and instead of partnership, meeting roundtable, which will table it for next month, we're going to replace it with a umass presentation on loans for small businesses.
And I want to say thank you to your community board, chair, Eli Bueno, who is also a member of the Umez Board, and our small business lending subsidiary brisk who's.
This is our 25th year of operation, and it was originally designed as a 10-year designation period and the reason we've been able to continue our operations because we've done a lot of prudent lending and those loan funds have come back and been returned to Umez, which really gives us a position to continue to operate.
You know we are three years ago became a community development financial institution which is a treasury designation which allows us to at least pursue alternative funding, and that's something that will be working on going forward.
We do that in a few ways by making small business loans investing in transformative, real estate, construction, projects, funding, workforce initiatives and also making cultural investments.
One of the things that I want to just kind of talk about is a new program that we have, which is a hybrid micro loan program, really targeted at small businesses, And one interesting thing is that yumez is not an SBA lender, but back when the CARES Act came out, there was a lot of interest in providing funding for small businesses.
Small businesses didn't have information about lending opportunities, and we knew that it took really that first round of CARES Act where the funds were exhausted, and then it was that second round.
We provided technical assistance to many small businesses and worked with some of the community banks here, like Carver, Bank and Ponce Bank, to provide funding through the paycheck protection program, and in that process we saw that there were a lot of small businesses that needed help.
You know some of the key features that we think make this lawn attractive is that we call it a hybrid micro loan program because it has the elements of a loan, but also the elements of a grant, and by that what I mean is that if a small business pays the loan for four years, they will be able to and the business stays open.
Just to give you an example of something like that, a small business that say took a ten thousand dollar loan for the first year.
We want them to know that they can then, at the end of that fourth year, apply to have the balance of that loan at really 25 converted from a loan into a grant.
Now, The way we size these loans, If we look at up to 50 dollars the lesser of fifty thousand dollars or ten percent of the top line- growth revenue in 2019, so we're trying to go back to see how are they performing pre-Covid to get some expectation of what they're going to do after we get through this recovery, phase.
Why we have the interest only given that year to ramp up and really pivot to new business, conditions, really look and see how they are going to change the way they do.
We do take a blanket lean on any of the Ucc Lien on assets, and you know these businesses then can use these proceeds for normal working capital.
You know, payday loan businesses, we're not funding.
You, know the normal sin, businesses or gains of chance, we're not funding and things along those lines.
We're, just hopeful that the businesses can make it through the next three months, really, which I think are going to be the most difficult, particularly coming off of you know.
But right now, I'd, say probably realistically four or six weeks, but we can tell you if they're not going to qualify, we can let them know that you know in a matter of a few days and finally, What's the total num, the total number of applications, so we have provided two million dollars for this program.
We are, you know, going to continue to work with the community partners really to try to market this program.
Rent can't use it for refinancing of an existing loan, or you know other things that we would have to on a case by case say: are ineligible Tanya, I appreciate you.
The physical presence, though, Hopefully you know, maybe in another six months nine months who knows we'll be able to have people come back to the office, but until that time we're doing everything online and this application for this program is online.
The reason why I'm saying that is because I think next year we should try our best to focus on that and how businesses are treating.
Yeah, because we, you know, I, bought this up sometime in August, I, think or July, but there's so many other things that we got to work on top of this.
So I just want just to focus that for the next one of the beauties about being able to build relationships with a lot of folks who are putting resources into our community.
Understandably, so you know, but at the same time it's also very important to build in that process as well, because reactions eventually are just going to leave us with.
All right, I'm not going to be taking too much time, but I just wanted to mention.
Some of you guys, know, I, am the financial account manager for the New York City business solutions in 181St, Street and I just want to touch a little basics on this loan.
That's, going on right now with the city of New York, and what's the name of it, one more time.
One of the reasons why I pushed it to start off the new year's with the thought partner, meetings, because I thought of, like I, wouldn't say the disservice, but it would be negligent not to effectively utilize all the resources we have within the board to be able to give all the small businesses all the resources that that's available to them.
I, Think most, you know I wear another hat with working for the city.
We work with bids and other you know, chambers and groups, to inform business, owners.
This committee, as we have a configuration now, is probably an opportunity to start anew with this topic, because I know I've been talking about it for three years that we hate to address these, So, I.
I. Think it's gonna be very important that the business owners are able to.
I think that would be a great thing for us to do, and I also wanted to find out if we are still planning on doing what would you talk about Domingo with the real retailers like having different segments of types of businesses come in, and if that was something that was also that you wanted to still pursue.
To, You, know, reach out to the owner and get information, the extent to which it's available on what's going on, but you can also go to the building department's website and put in the block and lot number.
What's, going on in 187th year, look I mean one of the things that state legislature, win.
Development, I just want to know if we can get on that and help any upcoming small business people that want to need us office space or anything that we can be able.
