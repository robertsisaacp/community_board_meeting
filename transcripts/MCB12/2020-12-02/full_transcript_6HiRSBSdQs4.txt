Hey Paula, you hear me hi everyone, Paola I need the who are the number of panelists. You only have three guests right now: Jasmine Briggs, Jesse, Henshaw and Tony, Shaw, okay, perfect and they're, though they're the ones that will be presenting on have a umass tonight. The Umass person I believe have has a different. Last name is Miss. Banks is a lady, miss banks, okay, so I think these are just guests and she has her own panelist invite. But if I see that they went in the other way, I'll swing them over. Okay, perfect! Thank you. So much you're welcome and you guys have a copy of the agenda right that I emailed you yeah. So, okay, just in case you want to share screen or something okay cool. So what I'll do is I'll, wait till approximately let's say 705,710 and give everybody enough time to start come in all right sounds good. We're live, but I'm not recording. Yet so whenever you're ready, don't mingle, you just let me know and I'll start recording. Okay, you have corn by the way. Ah, the four of us huh yeah. What is our quorum? How many people we got it's four right, four or five? Yes, you have, you guys have quorum already. Oh okay, cool I know. Thank you yeah. We must be a small committee, then yeah, that's what I was saying. Yeah all committees are composed of, like I, believe 11 to 12 members. So quorum is usually anywhere between five and seven yeah. We have public members which are often they count towards Quorum. Well, it I believe so because they're they they're technically I, guess but I know like. Usually the forum is like from actual like board members yeah. There we go yeah. Now we definitely got it all right, yeah, we're still waiting for our presenter Rafael Apollo bring Rafael over he's. He has the Apple bank gotcha, okay and then we're just waiting for a presenter from Umass. There's gonna be a modification to our agenda so before I ask for the approve of the agenda. We're gonna this final meeting. What we're gonna try to focus on is resources. You know like we try to provide in from as much information as we can, but now, how can we actually bring in actual resources to small businesses and educate ourselves in these resources in order to be able to provide accurate but also guide, small businesses towards the like directions that could potentially help them? So we have a guest today when we're thinking about that, and so we're gonna modify the agenda as far as the round table goes. We have a partnership roundtable that I was seeking to do this month, but we're going to table it to next month we're going to start off the new year's, be with a discussion around partnerships and being able to solidify the work that our partners are doing. We had a strategy put in place for what these few months were going to look like, but things are so forever changing at the moment that it didn't really necessarily make sense for now like we don't have the capacity to reach out to a lot of these businesses directly. So what I would propose is that we actually start bringing in key stakeholders and we build that capacity together, whether it be cloth and their connections with their businesses, but also being able to create a space, a hub where all the community layers, all the key stakeholders that work with small businesses are also involved in a month-to-month basis, meaning, for instance, a lot of the making sure that we create space for them. You know and I think that has to do a lot with. How do we do that? Not only as a committee but as a board and develop those bridges of communication so that we can further strengthen that relationship? I think we were just rushing it and trying to react so I thought of it and I was like. We have to take a step back and really see how we're addressing this structurally, as opposed to reacting to what we perceive to be the need. You know, so that's why yeah this yeah so give me one. Second, so I see Lisa banks. Let me see, can you introduce yourself, sir? Oh, you know that's Blair, Duncan and Lisa banks signed in for me. Unfortunately, when it popped into my calendar, but Wayne Benjamin can vouch that yeah, that's actually Blair Duncan. Yes, that is Blair Duncan all right if Wayne vouches that's enough right there. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna modify our agenda. So what we'll do is some of the welcoming the welcome welcoming opening remarks, the approval of agenda and instead of partnership, meeting roundtable, which will table it for next month, we're going to replace it with a umass presentation on loans for small businesses and then we're gonna, keep our old business, new business announcements and adjournment and in that time, if anybody wants to raise anything first of all like and I'll do it during my welcoming this is our last meeting of the year a very turbulent year, but I believe we got through very well. We did the best that we could accomplished as much as we could and I think we are in a pretty good place so that that's gonna be the agenda. So nobles, I'm gonna, be I'm gonna read over it again right. So we got the welcoming you got it right. Oh I'm! Taking minutes, it's not you! No one asked me to, but if I take minutes this time do I get to name who does it next time in next session? Oh no you'll take a year off okay hold on. Let me fire it up. One. Second, to me: girls, yeah all right stocks. One second I can just use the template. I used the time before last yeah, it's going to be a it's going to be a pretty intentionally. This is going to be a very brief, meet no problem and we're recording this right. Paula. Yes, we're already recording yeah! Thank you and I'm a make you a coho, so you can record this session on your own on your side. Thank you all right. Let's see here business development. Ah there we are I'll, just use October 6th version. All right continue, Domingo and I'll just catch what you just said from the recording. So don't worry about it, yeah, it's just a modification of the agenda yeah. So with that being said, as part of the remarks, I personally want to thank Tanya for really stepping in on a short notice. Last month, had a family emergency arise that I had to address with urgency. I wasn't able to necessarily be as helpful, so thank you Tanya for really stepping in and holding it down for the committee. No. Thank you. Thank no thank you, and it's been a very interesting few months. I would say, as you see, there's a lot of uncertainty right now. Whether it comes to is the city going to completely shut down, we hit the three percent threshold. What does that mean? How is that going to impact small businesses? How can we bring in different type of small businesses into the narrative, and not just let restaurants and restaurants dominate that? How can we better utilize or stretch the resources across the board so yeah so I want to personally thank the committee. It's been a hectic year. This pandemic has really pushed us in ways that I personally wouldn't have anticipated and put us in situations that I wouldn't have thought of, but everybody was flexible enough to really adjust and give it their all, and it really demonstrated their commitment to the community and just towards our neighbors. You know we did a great job. We were I believe the first committee in the city to be able to do the virtual meetings, get resources out and I like personally I couldn't have done this without you all so I want to thank you and as a token, this meeting is going to have just one presentation and just spend time with your family and we're going to do a lot of the we're going to keep doing great work. But it's like one thing: we all learned this year is the importance of not only our neighbors but our families. You know and I think it's just a good way to end the year, one presentation and yeah. So with that being said, we have Blair Duncan, he's gonna be presenting around a small business. Oh, no, first of all, I need approval of the agenda motion to approve agenda. I need a second thank you. Anybody opposed any abstentions, all right, so that's unanimous yep. So with that being said and Blair, I'm I'm a ask for you to just be able to provide just a synopsis of Umass. What do you all do and get go right into it? Sure? Thank you. Domingo and I want to say thank you to your community board, chair, Eli Bueno, who is also a member of the Umez Board, and our small business lending subsidiary brisk who's administering this program. Thank you for inviting me, as I mentioned. Thank you to Wayne Benjamin for validating that I am who I say: I am yeah. That was the reason why I didn't ask for I d man and many of you know have heard of the upper Manhattan empowerment zone. I'm the President and CEO Umez is an organization that has been operating now for 25 years. This is our 25th year of operation, and it was originally designed as a 10-year designation period and the reason we've been able to continue our operations because we've done a lot of prudent lending and those loan funds have come back and been returned to Umez, which really gives us a position to continue to operate. You know we are three years ago became a community development financial institution which is a treasury designation which allows us to at least pursue alternative funding, and that's something that will be working on going forward, but it puts us in a group of many other lending institutions that are in the community, like the Washington Wood Development Corporation, like the true fund like Lisk and others in that category. So you know we are really here. Our catchment area is upper Manhattan, so think community board nine Community board 10:11 to community 412. that that's where the focus of our activity is and we're really looking here to see how we can help residents. You know reach their potential. We do that in a few ways by making small business loans investing in transformative, real estate, construction projects, funding, workforce initiatives and also making cultural investments. You know one of the things that I want to just kind of talk about is a new program that we have, which is a hybrid micro loan program really targeted at small businesses, and one interesting thing is that yumez is not an SBA lender, but back when the CARES Act came out, there was a lot of interest in providing funding for small businesses. Just like a lot of people in our communities. Didn't have information about health issues. Small businesses didn't have information about lending opportunities, and we knew that it took really that first round of CARES Act where the funds were exhausted, and then it was that second round and what we did was. We provided technical assistance to many small businesses and worked with some of the community banks here, like Carver Bank and Ponce Bank, to provide funding through the paycheck protection program, and in that process we saw that there were a lot of small businesses that needed help. Traditionally, Umass had not made loans under fifty thousand dollars. We felt that was really the micro loan spot and what we did, though, in talking to small businesses find out. Well, you know what there are a number that really need this type of assistance. So what we did was design a new program targeted at small businesses. I sent a email to you, Domingo that just has a one-page flyer. You feel free to circulate that, but we're working in Washington Heights with the with whitic, and they are really our community partner to do to help do the outreach. Our program is automated. It's online and any applicants can talk with the crew at Washington, Heights, Inward Development corporation, to help them sift through what the process is and then to upload information online and we'll then review it. You know some of the key features that we think make this lawn attractive is that we call it a hybrid micro loan program because it has the elements of a loan, but also the elements of a grant, and by that what I mean is that if a small business pays the loan for four years, they will be able to and the business stays open. They can then apply for a grant really a loan to grant conversion. Now. The way that works is that will be about 25 percent of the loan. Original loan balance will be converted to a will be converted to a loan, so just to kind of rather convert from a loan to a grant. So just to give you an example of something like that, a small business that say took a ten thousand dollar loan for the first year. The payments would be 25 a month second year. Those would go up to about 221 dollars through the end of the fourth year and then they could apply to convert 2500 from a loan to a grant and get that wiped out and would have a very small balance of about a hundred dollars left over to pay now. The way we do this is that we're looking at small businesses that have between 100,000 and seven hundred fifty thousand dollars in top line revenue, and they have to have a physical storefront. There are no virtual businesses, we're looking for employees of 20 people or fewer and of course they have to be located in upper Manhattan. The term of the loan, as I mentioned it's five years, I talked about the interest, only component, the principle and interest, and then that really attractive piece is to incentivize businesses to stay open for four years. We want them to know that they can then, at the end of that fourth year, apply to have the balance of that loan at really 25 converted from a loan into a grant. Now, the way we size these loans, if we look at up to 50 dollars the lesser of fifty thousand dollars or ten percent of the top line- growth revenue in 2019, so we're trying to go back to see how are they performing pre-Covid to get some expectation of what they're going to do after we get through this recovery phase? And so we want to also give them. That's why we have the interest only given that year to ramp up and really pivot to new business conditions, really look and see how they are going to change the way they do business. They have to switch to do more online if they have to buy ppp equipment if they have to do some of the outdoor modifications of ventilation use those proceeds to pivot. The way they do business is really what we want. The source of these funds to be used for, and we do require anyone who has a 20 or more ownership state to sign a personal guarantee. We do take a blanket lean on any of the Ucc Lien on assets, and you know these businesses then can use these proceeds for normal working capital activities. Now there are certain this most businesses are going to be eligible, but franchises, we're not funding. You know, payday loan businesses we're not funding. You know the normal sin, businesses or gains of chance, we're not funding and things along those lines. That's really a overview. I think there may be some questions. I, don't know if Domingo you were able to email. I saw the a brief screenshot of the one page document, but I'm not sure if everyone has seen that, but so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put it in my screen and I'm gonna there. So it folks to see it and we're kind of you know we're excited about I, don't know if others can see it. It's very small to me, but if others can see it, that's great. The you know. I idea here is we're partnering in Washington Heights, with a community organization. Who's familiar has really the boots on the ground, we're in central Harlem, we're partnering with another organization and we're working on working with the organization in east Harlem. We haven't finalized that yet that's union settlement because they are working on the grant program that the city councilwoman has put in place there. So you know we're have had about. We launched the program two weeks ago. It's up and accessible on our website. We have had about five or six applications. So far looks like right now about one to two we'll be going through some of the underwriting process, we're hoping to be able to compress the time of review and funding on these to hopefully, in that, a response, whether it's a go or no go. You know short like a week, but then to do the underwriting and complete the cologne closing. We would hope that, maybe four weeks something like that is what we're aiming towards. So we believe that this is going to be a program we, you know we're aware and sensitive to the changes here we launched this to be concurrent. Sbs just came out with a program the other day to provide called their low, moderate income storefront program to provide really they're gonna pay the interest on certain cdfi borrower loans and so we're part of that program. We have some of our applications in to see if they're going to be able to assume that, but even with these other programs that I and earlier I mentioned Colombia has one true fun has one we have one they're all different, there's more demand than there is supply. Each one has its particulars that businesses need to look at to see which fit, and then we can. You know, through this, find the right source of funds for those businesses. The thing is that we're in the midst of having all of the city regulations changing I mean we know we're now at a 10 o'clock shutdown for restaurants. We don't know what's going to happen over the next 30 days, certainly as we go into the holiday season and into January February very tough months, you know we'll see I mean we're all kind of watching, but we time this- and we have this interest only component for the first 12 months to kind of account for that period of uncertainty. We're just hopeful that the businesses can make it through the next three months, really, which I think are going to be the most difficult, particularly coming off of you know. The last nine months of you know a lot of challenges so that that's probably a good place to pause to see if there any questions again, I'm happy to have this opportunity to speak to you guys directly, and you know we'll continue to do outreach to make this program more aware for small businesses and I think this is a good start in that direction. Thank you so much Duncan. So we're going to open it up to questions. I'm first going to start with committee members. Please use the raise hand, feature and then we'll go to the attendees. If they have any questions, Duncan I have a question regarding non-pro. This is also for non-profits as well. Right nonprofit would be considered a business you're right. Yes, it is, and you know most nonprofits. You know. We know that a lot of non-profits that employ you know, residents in upper Manhattan. It's a vibrant sector. You know there's certain non-profits that are excluded like religious organizations, public or private schools, colleges, universities, social clubs. They would not be eligible, but you know there's a wide group of non-profits outside of that group that are eligible and we look at since nonprofits. Don't have you know, gross income, we look at their operating budget and their for their tax returns that they file in Ni in 19, 2019 yeah, and knowing that at the moment, the vulnerability of a lot of these businesses. What's the turnaround time for approval, so let's say they embark on the processing the underwriters. What how long before you see them being able to be able to get those funds, so we're hoping that by the time that we're looking round four, we want to shorten it. But right now I'd say probably realistically four or six weeks, but we can tell you if they're not going to qualify, we can let them know that you know in a matter of a few days and finally, what's the total num the total number of applications, so we have provided two million dollars for this program. We are in, we launched it two weeks ago. It will be active until the funds are exhausted or August 31st and so far we have about six applications, but of those six, probably two look like they might be viable to go forward. Okay, so we're in the early stages of this- and we are, you know, going to continue to work with the community partners really to try to market this program. You say: August 31st was the deadline. March August, 31st 2021, so it'll be whether the funds are exhausted or August 21st 2021, yes, okay, thank you! So I have Tanya yeah. If you already answered this I apologize, but what can they not use the money for funds for? Are there any restrictions? If you like I, said, if you've mentioned this I apologize, you could just let me know if there are any restrictions in terms of what they can and can not yeah. So, thanks for asking that- and we have you know, allowable uses would be working capital, inventory, marketing, refitting for new social distancing guidelines and I'm rattling these things off, because I'm reading it actually and there's a link that I think I also sent to Domingo that has this but utility supplies committee. If you check your emails, you should have the document he's speaking and payroll and any other calls that you know are kind of. You know working capital related what they can not be used for, though, is business expansion. You know construction costs other than those relate to refitting for new social distancing guidelines that allow them to pivot. You can't use them for legal fees, property taxes can't use them for back. Rent can't use it for refinancing of an existing loan, or you know other things that we would have to on a case by case say are ineligible Tanya. Is that did that answer your question? Oh yes, thank you. That's very helpful. I appreciate you. Thank you up. Next we have Christina Richie's, followed by nobles. How are you doing Blair Nice to meet you? My name is Christina, I'm not sure if you answer this question, but I'm just looking at the interest rate of three percent. Is that a fixed interest rate or would that change throughout the years or after the term and we've tried to make it predictable? It's a fixed rate throughout the five-year term, and also one thing to note is that you know we don't have no application fee, no closing fee on this loan. We want to make it accessible nobles. Thank you. You're. Welcome. Excuse me, hello, thanks, I wasn't able to raise my hand as host so I appreciate it. Thank you for your time Blair. So my question is in regards to tech startups in the area you know I used to have a tech, startup myself and I know. That is a really big outlet for younger business owners. You know coming up in the area. Is there anything? Is there any? Is there anything that will preclude them from applying to your loan as well? Even if it's not brick and mortar but like let's say, like some kind of direct to consumer, you know startup so good question. So this is designed for storefront businesses to kind of promote the activity in on the streets to keep the streets alive. So virtual businesses we we've excluded and I. You know the tech. Businesses are hard to anchor in any one location. So unless there is a physical presence in upper Manhattan that is not a home operated business, we would look to recommend that they try to access other sources of funding. Maybe the Columbia Small Business Development center. They have a loan fund too, and that might be a alternative. But for this program you need a physical, storefront and I. Just have a quick follow-up question. If you would share, can I just jump up for a quick follow-up? So then, when it comes to, you know, Christina's question before, and you know in regards to the one I just asked: what if there is like a storefront like let's say one of the retail store fronts on 181St, for instance, that they do a really good job with e-commerce as well, which has been keeping them afloat, but it's tight. Could they use the funds to increase their e-commerce presence and infrastructure as well, so I think it would be a matter I guess. I'd have to look at that on a case by case basis. I'm not you know. If it's a I, don't know a phone store. You know I'm not sure what you're describing but like a closed door for sneakers, for instance. Let's just say that for easiness, okay so and they also do e-commerce, they sell then I think it's a matter of what you know what the business makes as long as that allows them to stay. Active I. Think that you know we would want to look at that because in the I you know, pandemic environment online cells are really a pivot and understanding how that's going to help. You know the business make sense. So if they're going to maintain the retail presence, but they want to invest these funds to allow them to do a greater online pivot presence and I. Think that's something we would look at awesome thanks, yeah, thanks Duncan and as far as marketing. When you talk about community partners, that's something! Definitely that like we would love to help in understanding the whole trying to bring folks together and how difficult it could be at times, especially during the pandemic. Just consider us one of the top partners as well. We would love to help out with the marketing, as we are also trying to market a lot of the resources that are coming into the community. Absolutely anybody else have any questions before I go over to the public. Francisco did I believe right. He was saying if we heard him that's what he was saying all right, so we have Jesse Henshaw Hey Jesse. Can you hear me yeah I, hear you hear me yeah I, hear you yeah. What's your question? Hey Jesse eras, once twice so I guess he's having some technical difficulty so yeah, so Duncan I guess we'll stay in communication via email. The committee everybody has received some of the flyers, the flyer he sent with some of the requirements. Thank you. It looks very thorough and hopefully it becomes a president when everybody comes to present some resources straight to the point and anybody else I had a quick question. Can you guys hear me yeah it's in regards to do you guys have a physical location? Does Umass has a physical location or a physical office, or is it just on online? So Umass has a physical location. Yes, 55 West 125th street, though, for the last eight months we've been operating remotely like most businesses. You know I happen to be in the office, but my staff is not. If there is any information you know you can reach us by email. If you have a question you can reach me at B, Duncan at umez.org and I can refer you to the right person. The physical presence, though, hopefully you know, maybe in another six months nine months who knows we'll be able to have people come back to the office, but until that time we're doing everything online and this application for this program is online. It is kind of a logical order. You answer a series of questions. If they're affirmative questions, you can kind of move through at any point. Your question is, you know you answered negatively to it. Then that means that there's you didn't meet one of the eligibility criteria and you would be able to stop at that point and it'll. Send you a message to that effect. So this is an automated process during this period of time of Cov, yeah and one another thing is, as have you been in communication with the other chamber of Commerce is up here in so we are in contact with the Washington Heights Chamber of Commerce through Eli and Sandra Harris yeah. So yes, and then the community partner is the Washington Heights Inward Development Corporation, okay, perfect all right! Thank you. So what we'll do is I'll be sending you a follow-up email and, let's strategize, to see how we can get as much businesses as possible, see how we could inject some of these funds in there to try to keep them open and hopefully weather the storm. Absolutely all right. Well, thank you guys for having me and if they're, not any other questions, I'll sign off thanks Blair. Thank you all right team. So, as you can see, I kept my promise. This is our last meeting. I want to thank you all enjoy the holidays. It's been a turbulent year, like I said when I opened up, but we got here. We're still weathering the storm together. Now what we have to try to do is bring more stakeholders. Together, we saw Duncan with the resources. Let's see how we could inject this in some of these resources into our community, so we could maintain the vibrance and help some of these small businesses. If you have any questions, any concerns any thoughts, anything you would like to share this is the time to do so. Francisco you're, muted, is the meeting about to be over. You setting it up for that. Yes, sir wow, that's got to be the shortest meeting of my entire you weren't here for the beginning baby right here, you know I'm always at least I might come in ten minutes, but I'm here three hours you know yeah, it's a good thing. We don't mark down late on the minutes. Brother, hey new ideas, it's all good man! For next year, I've spoken to Tanya about this Domingo and some other folks about how businesses are handling people of color in this community. I actually just got something on Facebook, where famous Famiglia Pizzeria yeah was acting derogatory towards someone that speaks spanish I just want to put that out there, but I. Also. The reason why I'm saying that is because I think next year we should try our best to focus on that and how businesses are treating. You know the citizens of you know Inwood and patrons yeah, because we, you know, I bought this up sometime in August, I, think or July, but there's so many other things that we got to work on top of this. But next year, I really want us to focus on that come up with a plan. So people can report this because you know obviously is word of us. He says she said, but we if we could develop a system where people report there's no same reason same way. They report, you know fireworks and loud noise, all the other things that are plaguing the heights. We should focus on that for next year because something like this shouldn't be tolerated in any way shape or form, and we, as a committee, should be on top of these things because we're world's one of the most diverse communities in New, York, City and everybody needs to be not just tolerated but appreciated, and what's the other word and welcome Apprecia welcome. Yes, exactly so, and that's not the first time we yeah I, know Francisco as well, so I just want just to focus that for the next one of the beauties about being able to build relationships with a lot of folks who are putting resources into our community. Is that maybe there's a series of workshops that might be a pre-requirement to certain resources? You know and I think having these type of conversations are a win-win. I know that and I don't want to say, I'll take personal, like fall for it, but it seems like and that's why I had to take a step back. It seems like we were reacting so much to Covid-19 that a lot of the things we were planning was a reaction and not necessarily putting things in play place that would eventually grow. You know and like we've been reacting a lot to Colby, it's been resources. How can we create and understand? Understandably, so you know, but at the same time it's also very important to build in that process as well, because reactions eventually are just going to leave us with. What's next, as opposed to we bit like be more goal-oriented, you know if you know what I mean, but Mr Chair could I speak to that too one second, because why Daryl Cochran didn't get you on the other members? Yes, all right, Juan Guzman had his hand up and then we're going to get back to I'll go I got you all right. So can everybody hear me? Yes, yeah all right, I'm not going to be taking too much time, but I just wanted to mention. As Blair mentioned a little bit, the city of New York announced on November 25th of the Alibi loan program. As some of you guys know, I am the financial account manager for the New York City business solutions in 181St, Street and I just want to touch a little basics on this loan and how it's going to be targeted itself. So the New York City Lmi store from loan is an interest-free loan up to a hundred thousand dollars to help store from businesses located in low to model income areas, and this is just so. They can continue and to operate like their businesses. With the challenges of Covid-19. The program is being divided in two sections. The first section just opened yesterday, November 30th, so phase one. We are going to target the lowest income, zip codes from November 30th through December, 14th and phase two is for modern income. Zip codes from December 14 until funds get are exhausted. I will be sending an email with all this information for everybody, but someone who can apply and obviously business, who are on the zip codes and employees. You have to have at least anywhere from two to ninety nine employees in all total for all locations. If you have more than one, you must be operated since January, 1st 2018 or before be cash flow, positive in 2019 and be able to demonstrate the availability to repay, have no personal or business tax, liens or legal judgments within the last three years and provide a personal guarantee for all loans. All owners, 20 percent or more of the business, must co-sign the loan and must have an average personal credit score. 625 or higher. The state of New York have partnered with pursue is the lender. They will be doing as well. The underwriting part for the loan itself so to determine the best. The first step is for the applicant to apply through our website, which is the SBS connect. Again I will be giving you guys will be emailing the details of how the client can apply the Washington High, the northern part of Manhattan. They are on phase two, as you will see, when once I send the email and a little bit of the details of this product is again it's up to a hundred thousand dollars. The loan term is 60 months, including no payments for the first six months. The interest rate is zero. There's no pre-penalty by paying the loan before there is a closing fee. If it's a proof of three hundred dollars, so I just wanted to share a little bit of that program. That's going on right now with the city of New York, and what's the name of it one more time. Juan sure is the New York City, Lmi, Storefront, Loan, Lmi, yeah I, believe Juan is also part of this committee. By the way, so he is yeah he is so yes, I'm just very quiet yeah and we have a pending conversation. I've been moving and dealing with some personal stuff so but just know that I'm not even gonna you're one of the reasons why I pushed it to start off the new year's with the thought partner meetings, because I thought of like I, wouldn't say the disservice, but it would be negligent not to effectively utilize all the resources we have within the board to be able to give all the small businesses all the resources that that's available to them. So rushing it was not the answer, so you will be playing a pivotal role next month. I'm just giving you the heads up all right, so we have I've been here, wanted something to say has something to say and followed by Tanya. Thank you. It was a slow night, so I thought I'd peek in and I'm glad I did, because not my normal committee good to see you all just to go back to Francisco's point I. Think most, you know I wear another hat with working for the city Commission on human rights, and you know that's definitely something we deal with on a variety of in a variety of ways. We do provide training, so you know employers can know what their obligations are under the law as it relates not only to interacting with their employees but also interacting with their customers. So you know we do provide a number of workshops on race on gender identity, on a number of different protected classes, so business owners, you know basically know better and then also one of the things that I do I work in the community relations side. So we can one of my favorite parts of my job. Pre-Covid is when things like this happen, we're able to actually go into those businesses say you know, look we heard this happen. This is this would be great if you could do x, Y and z. You know, and sometimes they're receptive, sometimes they're, not if they're not, then maybe we move into the formal complaint with our law enforcement bureau side. But you know those are some of the things we do. We work with bids and other you know, chambers and groups, to inform business owners. You know anywhere. We can so we'd be happy to have them. That's a great addition. Thanks Daryl yeah thanks so much Daryl, so I'll be reaching out to you. So one of the reasons why we're bringing in the stop partner initiative next month is not only to be able to address the need, but also be providing doses of education. If you know what I mean so it's like, if we could hey if we could talk to like, for instance, Duncan and be like hey part of your pre-approval rating, could we do these series of workshops to be able to address concerns that might arise around race identity? You know so I think that's why it was important to do that up. Next we have Tanya, yeah, I, wanna, say yeah. I think that's definitely something we need to address. I. Think this committee, as we have a configuration now, is probably an opportunity to start anew with this topic, because I know I've been talking about it for three years that we hate to address these. You know some of these businesses and how they respond to customers and including myself and others that have walked in so I. Think it's a great idea and opportunity for us to this committee to you know, lead the way and we had Angela Fernandez, who came in and gave a presentation about the commercial about the law and how it applies to on the side of the commercial side as well, that they also must abide by civil rights laws and things like that, and so that in the reverse, as you know so, I thought that was an interesting presentation that she gave last year. I believe it was yeah and so yeah I think. That is definitely something we need to talk about, because you know as this com you know, community goes through it's transitions and things like that I think it's gonna be very important that the business owners are able to. You know accommodate all of their customers, no matter who they are, and it's gonna be really critical. Everybody needs every dollar they can get. Money is green, so yeah I think that would be a great thing for us to do, and I also wanted to find out if we are still planning on doing what would you talk about Domingo with the real retailers like having different segments of types of businesses come in, and if that was something that was also that you wanted to still pursue it's a main priority, but I think would help us expand. Our outreach is the thought partners bringing some of the key stakeholders. I feel like what we've been doing is great, but sharing is caring right. So why make our lives more difficult when there are organizations already working with particular sectors? And it's just a matter of cross-collaboration like one thing that we could take away from Covid-19? Is we weathered the store together, not fragmented? You know so I think that's going to be extremely important for us to move forward and that's why I honestly had to take a step back. It was like it was good intention, but I feel we were running when in reality we should have been building. You know, let's build a stronger relationship with Claude, let's build stronger relationship with the Chamber of Commerce's within the community and let's show the community that we're together. So when the resources go out, it's seamless, not just oh it's. This is coming because a lot of the concerns that a lot of these businesses are raising is this person is telling me this, but by the time you got over here, the conversation is totally different. So it's like how can we streamline a lot of these communications so that we reduce the level of confusion and in confusion? If we understand the criminal element, there's opportunity and people can be taken advantage of just because of that you know. Oh Domingo, one more thing, I'm sorry, yeah I just had something themed. Remember when Jennifer Wilson came gave her presentation. One of the things that I was thinking about is how do we incorporate more of lower ration heights? You know those businesses, because I mean she was expressing that they felt left out and they didn't have a voice. Is there a way to do something specific, maybe targeted for lower man, good intentions right? We were running, we thought we were doing a great job we reached out to 200 plus businesses and one of but guess what we forgot a sector. You get what I'm trying to say. So it's like. We need to really take a step back, reassess it and do it more because if cloth would have been more involved, guess what there might have been more marketing going towards these a lot of these, but then again right they were going through a transition with Jacqueline that maybe but it's like when we streamlined communication, it's like it would have been as simple as sending Yvonne a flyer and she would have made sure that it got to the person you needed to get to you know. So that's why I felt like we were running and when you run usually a lot of these little micro issues pop up. The intention is good, but we're not really addressing the problem and that's what I'm trying to get to you know. So, that's why it's like yeah, Wayne yeah. That's an interesting point. You made about cloth because I worked with them several years ago on a proposal to build a lower Washington Heights Bid, so they probably have lots of contacts with you know. Retail businesses and I think it went from 155th came all the way up to 178th and prior to that effort. They worked on a study where they were looking at both Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, so they probably are a good source of information. For you know, merchants in that lower Washington area. Broadly speaking, oh yeah agreed. The problem was that Jacqueline the grant had finished Tanya. What was it was? There was a grant that they were. They had so Avenue NYC. What was it avenue NYC? So, once that grant finished, there was a transition period where there was a vote not like. We have a pretty good relationship, so it didn't really impact it. It's just that, like Tanya said there has to be more focus on Washington Heights and not just upper Middle Washington heights. As a absolutely that's why, even though it was well intentioned then on the initiatives we were doing, it just felt like we were running and not necessarily addressing the problem as a whole. So sometimes you drop things when you're going fast. So that's why the thought partner meeting is the goal moving forward. Did that answer your questions on you? Oh yeah, I did I, I'm glad to you know we have a plan to do that. So, like I said it's, this I think this committee here there's the configurations opportunity for us to really pursue some of these things. Thank you and really address some of the turbulence within the community. A lot of the like yeah anything else. Going once twice could I hear the motion. Please motion two. Oh we have cloth here. Just so you know, L'oreal is in the oh, it's here so yeah I just didn't want you I know she may have something, let's finish off with her present with any announcements she might have and we're calling it after that, all right, hey, L'oreal, you hear us. Yes, how are you yeah? So are there any announcements? We do have a couple events coming up in respect to the community, so this coming Friday, we have a virtual book club with sisters Uptown, which is the only black woman owned, independent bookstore. It will be at six o'clock and if folks are interested, I'm happy to send the information again. It's the last book club Saturday. We have the deck the malls event, which will we are actually keeping a very close eye on the weather. So at the moment the weather is 80 rain, so we may have to downsize the event with pending the weather and I. I'm not sure. If Tonya wanted to speak on what the additional part of the deck the malls event would be, it will be from 10 to 4 p.m. At the Ilcatanya, Payon, Park and again weather pending, we will also have the tree lighting event from three to four P.M. Yes, L'oreal yeah. Thank you, yeah I was gonna mention that we were Senator. Robert Jackson stepped up actually wanted to do our proclamation that we originally were weren't able to do so yeah, so the Senator Rob Jackson's gonna do that at this event. Hopefully, everything works out, and you know, it's kind of you know has a fast turnaround, yeah, but very fast, but you know so we're really honored that you know someone one of have stepped up to say yeah. We want to honor our businesses and they're going to do that at the event as well so and that came out of our this committee, so you know, and it's a good thing: oh yeah, he did I think I corrected it and I sent it over to the office. Thank you for that all those stuff. All that was excellent. Thank you. Wayne you're welcome yeah, so L'oreal. So, as you heard, we'll stay in communication and next month is where we want to be able to have a good top partner meeting. So anybody you have in mind just email us and we'll make sure that absolutely they're in they get the proper invitation and I'll make sure that everyone has my email. Should any of you ever need to contact me and also, hopefully you know. A couple folks can come out on Saturday would love to see your faces and meet folks rather than on zoom, all right perfect. So thank you very much now, nobles I heard you were saying something sure a motion to return. Wait. We have a comment or a question in our but with Jessie, Henshaw I think as a question, I'm listening and interested in finding out what the status and plan are for the new building above associate grocery at Washington, Fort Washington and when it I'm personally not familiar with. What's going on above the associate in 187 in Fort Washington there's something going on over there. That's on my block, I yeah, I, didn't I, haven't heard of anything personally me. Neither I believe I gave a talking permission to Jesse Henshaw, I'm a try. It again see if it works all right. How are we now you hear us Jesse, hey, Jesse, okay, hey how's, it going so what's going on, oh well, there's a new foundations have been built underneath the supermarket for a tall building on top and there's also there's seven storefronts vacant in the neighborhood. It's a tiny little commercial center. So it's a third of the storefronts are vacant, and so I'm wondering what the hell is going on. You know and I'm partly it's Vicky's diner was a real stalwart place, a real center for the community and she got a sharp rent increase in the middle of the pandemic and she had to close domino. Do you mind if I tackle these because I live on, that block sure go ahead, Noblesville and is Wayne still here, because yeah Wayne's still here yeah, I'm still here, have you heard anything Wayne on any construction on 187 in Fort, Washington, well, I. Think Noble's is first okay, yeah all right thanks, but definitely jump in because I'll tackle that first, hey, Jesse thanks, because I also saw a scaffolding up on the stairway down to Bennett I believe I thought that was routine maintenance on the pillar system for the for associated, not necessarily to strengthen it for any kind of additional levels. Did you see something on that? Well, that's what I I've been told, there's been rumors for a couple years and some of them pretty solid. Then that's Wayne's department thing because that's land use have you heard anything Wayne well, I haven't, but it's not necessarily land use if a project does not require any discretionary actions, but you know there are two things that you know can and should be done. You know Ebenezer or someone in the office can be asked to. You know, reach out to the owner and get information, the extent to which it's available on what's going on, but you can also go to the building department's website and put in the block and lot number yeah, and what does it show nothing right so I mean you know. Sometimes you know the rumors are just that. If there's a building, that's going up, the building would have to have an approved permit, or at least some filed for review right. Well, there should be something somewhere but I, I'd like to because I I'm concerned that the landlords of the neighborhood are shutting down a lot of businesses. So to that second point, I can actually tackle that you're completely correct I mean it's heartbreaking to see. What's going on in 187th year, look I mean one of the things that state legislature win. You probably know a bit more about this than I thought you were coming out for a bit. Oh man, I probably have back, do I have bad connection right now. Wayne. Do you mind talking about some of the loopholes that they're trying to close from a legislative perspective? I'm actually not that familiar yeah, I'm actually not that familiar with what they're doing so what we could do is Jesse. Do you have an email? Could you send it as a question sure yeah just send and Noblezo is having connections, issues right now, he'll make sure he'll be sure to stay and stay. You guys hear me better. I'm moving closer to my wireless hub, the damn chain, though you got to do now. Can you hear me better yeah I like that plant? Okay, so do what I can brother so Jesse? The state legislature is working on some legislation right now, where it makes it more financially taxing to have an empty storefront. What's going on right now is they're jacking up the prices keeping the storefronts open, so they can write off more in a tough year. That's what's going on and that's what it's a freaking shame! It's it honestly breaks there is a tax write-off deal right, and so that was another rumor. Obviously it's a profit loss. It's a profit loss, correct, technically a corporation could write off a loss yeah 20 years. That's what a lot of these so from a non-partisan perspective. Here, one of the things that they're working on the legislature is to close that loophole. Now that there is going to be a super majority of Democrats in the legislature, that was one of their. That was one of their priorities this year. So I wouldn't be surprised if it came back next year because you know how real estate has a lot of ties in, but it's kind of come back and now that we have a super majority, it might be a different dynamic next year, but unfortunately it's not gonna be able to do anything for the businesses that we lost yeah, so Jesse Mobile's his email is in the chat and nobles is he'll, get to the accurate information. Yeah I'll put you in touch with one of the policy directors that are currently writing it. So you can talk to them and see what they're doing yeah I have one last question: I swear to you, I'm done wait. Jesse is that it yeah rose all right. Thank you. There's a commercial building being built on Broadway close to Dikeman over where the library was and the car wash used to be. That's the inward rezoning. That's gonna, be a library and affordable housing, but there's also a commercial building right next to that affordable housing. Does anyone know about that? Yeah you do was that something that was already covered in our committee or not? No I would say that it was last year Wayne right there was this. Oh no. This is next door to that building. This is the car wash site. Yeah and my understanding is it's. You know it's a commercial office building. So two things one. Is it true that they're taking the school's teacher's parking lot to build that I? Don't have the details on the project so once again, that's something where you know Ebenezer can look into and get the details when you say are they taking if the parking lot that was being used was part of the private property that belonged to the gas station, then they're not taking it they're using their own property. So we need to look into who owned what yeah exactly okay? No, because if it's a commercial that kind of falls in line with business development I just want to know if we can get on that and help any upcoming small business people that want to need us office space or anything that we can be able to. You know, send them there. I just wanted to get more information, but okay, all right cool, so we'll reach out to just let's talk offline and reach out to Ebenezer. With your questions all right, there was there's a motion on the floor. Really quick before I bring that motion back up one more time. Domingo I sent you the minutes. Just now. Would you mind just putting in the agenda recommendation that you did because I got everything. I got literally everything else. Yeah I told you, it was gonna, be cool yeah, so I sent you the minutes and with that motion to adjourn second body opposed abstentions, unanimous thank you for your holidays. I'll see you at then well in a week or two I guess: yep all right, y' all take care. Everybody bye. Everybody.
