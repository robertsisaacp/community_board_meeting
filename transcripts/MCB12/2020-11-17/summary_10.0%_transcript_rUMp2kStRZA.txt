So hey, oh you hear me: people, yes, I can hear you, okay, hello, hi, Wayne, hello, I'm, going to kill my video while we're waiting for things to get started.
So we're going to call the maiden to order 6:37, November, Monday, November 16th at 6:37 p.m. I'm sure that we've all we all know that we are pretty much coming in into a second wave of the Covid-19 virus and the positivity rates and so forth.
We also contacted the Office of Dyna Councilman Denis Rodriguez, who had that we did not know of had allocated twenty five thousand dollars for the additions of more basket truck services at the times.
With that finishes, my report and I also like to bring in Mr Jim Berlin and very briefly, make up presentations on two resolutions about the next remote elections that we're going to have thanks.
We've got cultivators trials, it's basically making right now when a community group wants to go out and do work or even like a group.
We want to make that easy by locating those tools centrally and being people being able to access it like having a library of tools in the neighborhood and it can grow.
Am you know, like everyone, we're all very proud of Sally and the work she does.
I, don't know how to do that on my iPad. Basically, yeah real quick, whereas on October 27th, 2020 community board Manhattan held an election for the office's assistant secretary using remote means and whereas the election used voting methods that were transparent and fair and its results were uncontested and whereas the conduct of the election, however, was not consistent with the bylaws of our community board and that they require in-person voting, therefore be it resolved.
The original the beginning, an election by written ballot for board authors new, show be held during the executive session of the regular December general meeting of the board by the chairperson of the nominating committee.
The second thing, because nowhere are you, allowed to vote directly by email, because it's too easy to spoof here, you're, going to send a copy of something signed.
That's what we're going to look at picture and we have board members who, when they're on zoom on their computer, might be able to take a picture of a ballot you know, but to switch to another app on their computer.
That says that makes it very clear that the board members who are voting should pick which of the three allowed methods how about the following.
Considering that people caught not attending could also send in an email or text message, and that is a very good point and that's covered by the you can't vote in general.
You take attendance, only those people and we know who they are, can vote, and they each of them can only vote once and anyone who wasn't present at that moment can not vote.
You know they can't get emails, but they can still take pictures and stuff if they create a paper ballot with the various offices and write the names next to them and sign the bottom and date it and print their name.
You know the fact that the ballot is going to arrive at the right time and actually has your signature on it.
Let me just finish once the nominating committee closes, the nominee you know closes the election, then they will not accept any more ballots.
You know the reason why I'm saying that, because some people will have some issues with the tax doesn't come and there's a delay in the texting and so forth.
You know how we comply with the open meeting law, it's very easy audit, but very precise, because what they want to find from us is if we comply with all the requirements or give a notification to people having an agenda and also having the appropriate recording, etc.
We have been busy doing that the last week and this week, because we need to submit it before Friday this week, the document they requested and also last week we had several meetings regarding Covid-19 return or possible return or numbers going, high.
And I know that Bruce Robertson who's on the traffic transportation committee have been trying to get them to focus on the fact that what they presented is not what they're building and that waiting to study the matter.
Probably, there's something happening between contractors and DOT, and that's what the breakdown of the communication is so we're trying to push it and pushing the envelope until we tell them look we're going to just go in there and just stop it.
This situation is happening in several areas in the district I myself have been discussing this matter, marking and narrowing the street and making you know that almost then nobody can drive and I have that discussion regarding another location.
And I'll, just basically kind of give that obstruct that, since becoming treasurer I created a basic Excel spreadsheet that the district manager would update each month to report fiscally a monthly actual and forecasted expenses, as they related to the budget, which would enable the Treasury to advise the board what funds might be available to be repurposed throughout each fiscal, year.
I sent this request: out, November 2nd, which has basically been the request, since I became treasurer every month a week before I like the information, so I can review with the district manager.
And you know the committee and the community have asked for it, and you well deserve to get that.
Also last month, when Wayne advised at the executive committee meeting of one member that didn't show up, I'm, not sure if he did not show up more than once, or he did not show up just in October.
I mean like I'm waiting for which person specifically do you want, so that I can ask her she's right.
Well, so I need to get back on a regular, basis, and I would like to ask the office to for that information to me all right.
Will you get clarification that obviously, after 10:11 months was not able to get for whatever reasons, but I'm sure that by Thursday you will get all the information that you need all right.
Is, you know, am I going to be able to send you all the information that you request as far as attendance.
Is it's great that you are going to send Lasar that you are going to send or are going to make sure that the office sends to oc the attendance for each of the committee meetings.
But the other thing that's also important to have and without which oc is not going to be able to do the job that the bylaws requires her to do is to know for each month.
Is, this person supposed to be showing up or not, and people would say: Oh I didn't attend blah meeting because I'm not on that committee.
So she's going to need to have not only the attendance but also the committee composition for every month.
According to what you're saying Jim, then actually a member of a board does not have to does not is not required to attend more than one committee meeting.
It pushes people to attend committee meetings, and so those are the rules you have to, but Liz's other point was: You have to make sure that the person is on the committee.
You said you were going to clarify, although I have not seen an email clarifying, it Domingo pointed out that it was his understanding that when he became chair of business development, you know business development and the executive committee were his two required committees and that he was no longer on land use.
You know when he became chair of business development so assuming moving forward from that he was no longer on land use that should be confirmed and an email would be.
When Domingo became chair of business development, so that we'll know moving forward, he shouldn't be marked absent from land use January.
So we're going to actually Domingo you attended land use in January.
I thought I was only supposed to attend two and the general meeting, and that's why I think you know like streamline what, when we were saying if, at that point in the realization that you only have to attend the one committee, you will have to send an email saying that you would not longer be part of that committee, which is what we did not get.
You should just you know in response to my email, confirm that when Domingo became the year that, in which case business development and the executive became his two committees, if he wants to come to land use, that's fine.
Because, as people rose to officers or to chairs and became members of the executive committee, they were I would think no longer obligated.
It's more of a statement that this is why it's so important for you to communicate in writing what the committee composition is and also to let people know that they can't just resign from a committee at their convenience, because that's an authority and a power that's invested.
Who've, been in the community boy board, who exploit the fact that they're chairs of one commit of one committee and don't attend others right.
Then it was juggling to go virtual this and that so I don't want people to make the assumption that I chose not to attend land use right, because that's the same way, I could make the assumption.
I just want to put in a good new member orientation and making sure that we communicate exactly precisely because you know the committees that you're required to attend.
No I was saying Faye that I think at last month's exec committee meeting there was a discussion of whether the youth and Education Committee, which is scheduled for the 14th, should move to the prior week because in December, because of holidays, the general meeting is on the 15th.
It's just the day before exactly well, and you know what I actually already confronted with one of the local school that wanted to present.
You, know, I'm, not sure I can answer that question right.
And I think this is something that I hope that you do more often you know, and yes, it was highly appreciated.
I believe that she also brought up something that I really captivated my attention, where you say that whether the school decide to go in person or not, you know, but they should increase the the personnel the deal so like with you know the mental health to provide more assistance for those students and basically.
You know YouTube video, but one thing that I think is equally important.
That I mentioned is I'm working and and elaborating a report which is going to be part of the con will not well part of the conversation of you know the initial information that some of these analysts brought into this conversation and also many information, that, unfortunately.
And I wish that more committee, you know unify themselves and do things you know like that, because I think it's important.
Following up on your last comment, Fei, that my committee stands open to work with you on the mental health issue at any time.
I look forward to continuing to do this work, addressing these issues that particularly are affecting a lot of our youth, and you know I'm again just thankful to have had this opportunity.
I did listen to that call, but I didn't understand why the health committee wasn't part of I'm just going to hop in.
When my committee did the mental only specifically mental health, that the first time that we discussed that which was at the we had a plan on Isabella the Saturday Meeting Steve graciously attend that meeting and he immediately picked on that subject.
You, know, land use and planning, and zoning issues.
I think the idea of having a c12 tailored platform that allows us to you know pull in data that is readily available, but it's in multiple sources bring it into our platform and allow us to look at what does it mean if we do zoning of X, Y or z.
Does it mean if this project gets built, is something that is, you know, would be an invaluable tool and Sean had to leave the meeting, but we are going to schedule time for him to give us a more detailed presentation of the capability of the platform they created for CB9 to discuss how in fact you know they can, you know, do it for CB12.
The capital budget results and also the fact that the mental health issue on Steve's committee ranked number one from the board, and that, of course, was due to our input into that.
We talked a lot about issues that we want to discuss at upcoming meetings and in December.
You know, as far as the area goes I think we'll be okay, all right.
So I'm, not forwarding the resolution to the General Board meeting and at this November I will be passing it on to Curtis, in the hope that his committee will will jointly support that resolution.
My committee was was given a presentation by the corner project which, as most of you probably know, has not been able to find a permanent space in our community, since it lost its location on 181St street in Saint, Nicholas back in 2018.
We had thought that they could present to the executive committee tonight, but as it turns out, they weren't even available for that, but but they're telling me that sample wants them to come before the full board so that they can.
No only thing that I'm trying to include in a resolution is a coordination on like who makes a decision on which cameras to use and if the legislation currently actually mentions community boards that there needs to be a public hearing on which cameras to use, we don't want to have every camera.
I included that, because I wanted to make sure that they knew that we were advocating not just blankly for the legislation, but particularly for the cameras in certain areas that we know there to be, and one thing to be conscious about also is how ice and a lot of these, like federal agencies, actually do a data grabs that include like a lot of these surveillance cameras, just putting it out there.
Don't think they're not going to be very helpful with identifying people in the event.
So I want to make sure that the resolution we present to you all is very clear and it just it's restricted to that particular issue, because that's what we're trying to solve.
You know it kind of makes it like we're just not going to go down that street, but it's worth giving it a try.
You know what I'm saying like there's people that get paid to be able to look for solutions.
And again, I want to thank my assistant, chair, Tanya, for doing a great job, facilitating the meeting and making sure that we educated ourselves on Covey and not only its impacts but also like its patterns and how it's impacting small businesses.
You know that you can technically go about your business and then De Blasio has identified three percent as the threshold that he's going to be able to justify shutting the city down.
I. Think I, don't know that I've heard that it would be three percent, but.
You know you can have one aspect of the bureaucracy thinking this way, but yet the people feeding you the information, are interpreting it.
Please I was going to ask okay, the the State Health Department report says that.
Well, I, think you know.
