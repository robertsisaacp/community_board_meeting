In the process of getting some funds from city council in order to hire a company that can help us at least beautify the area and make it less a bit less 80s or a bit less Bronx is burning like The. Second note, I, like I, would like to say, based on my experience, that we should engage not just in conversation, but we should also try out our hardest to be part of our committee meetings, especially at the subcommittee level.
I. Think that we should take an extra step to assure that the new members are part of part of the committee and they make them and improve them and make them so much better, and I also, to finish like to acknowledge an email that was sent out to to the majority of the bond members in reference to some allegations of different things, the right around this time.
I, merely wish to point out as a point of information that it is on the agenda It is on the agenda as a resolution of objection per the licensing committee, which you could have watched the meeting on youtube or read the minutes.
Members said that there was a recordings of people of someone saying that wanting to prevent a negro from becoming chair of community board 12.
If somebody is saying that they're trying to prevent black people from you know getting positions, I know that I have gone through that on this board and continue to and so to hear this in this form, Next is to reach out to the person that's making the allegations have them provide.
Myself personally have been a part of some of that, and I know that those of you who are new, as well as people who are old members on this board, have heard me speak to that.
There are outstanding resolutions and actions that were to be taken and, for instance, in regards to a retreat to discuss what these dynamics are, which, ironically, are the same dynamics that were discussed 10 years ago in something very much the same that took place and yet most of the people who have the opportunity to make these changes act as if this is something that's not happening.
I. Think that we know the export member has brought up a lot of allegations without any substance to make sure that we're clear on everything Oh ebenezer, can you please add philip from germaine williams's office.
We're going to miss you, and I hope that the next secretary you know can do the work in be better saying that we are an excellent saying that I just want to start with my report.
I mentioned that in my report, in June, I believe, but the work of radio started, the 207 bridge gonna be refurbished, gonna be painted, and the contractor is looking to have communication with the small businesses with all the business owners on the Manhattan side.
I said that in the general meeting in case you know, board members know a lot of people here and there please let the people having businesses around 207 bridge nearby, the 207 bridge, that there is a reconstruction and the contractor want to get in touch with them.
They are planning to build and a new homeless shelter on 10th avenue by the corner of 213th street They approach us because they want to start the conversation.
And this is time we need to start talking to the people to the provider, because we need to request many services and ensure that they have like an indoor yard or a rooftop yard.
You posted elias, already told me that he wants to have a conversation immediately with the provider and we will keep you informed and when it's time to bring it to one of the committee, we will do that as well.
The estimate of district need is due on October 30th We have our budget consultation, public heating on October 21st, so we're going to be working and sending you the information for the esteemed industry, need, and I would like that each committee chairs help us providing and creating the statement of district needs for fiscal year.
You already know about it- that the community board 12 has a new web page with all the information improve web page, and I want to say thank You. Thank you to paola, chanel and also to eli azad and to jonathan from ita that help us and we work together to bring this new website.
Our shared person is aware about it, we're going to start preliminary conversation and when it's right to bring it to the community board to one of the committees we're going to bring it.
Yeah, because you know we just saw the upper west side, get rid of a temporary shelter and kick a whole bunch of people out, because the community wanted that And I'm just trying to understand why we keep getting shelters to come to inwood in washington, heights.
You know that also brings in a different element to the community that you know, I I just need the shelter thing to be like shared across this entire Manhattan, because it just seems like every time.
And we're gonna be providing you updated executive, committee, general meetings, and when it comes to the committee discussion, you know we will have ample time with to do to have all those questions.
I, put a lot of work into building the audience from our community and engaging people in supporting that facebook page right oc have been maintaining it in regards to uploading all of the data about any calendar, dates or information onto that.
Now that being said, in regards to the shelter situation, in a meeting that I sat in with the department of homeless services before being wrongfully removed as chair of housing and human services, one of the things that was discussed is that the dynamic within the city is that contractors who are providing their buildings for the purpose of being vetted to be a shelter they buy those buildings.
She has just sent them if people feel like multitasking and reading it, we can vote on it later in the agenda.
Our new school dos amigos on 108 cooper street is open just to let everybody know that we do have our kindergartens in school four days a week monday through thursday, starting with breakfast and optional drop off at 7, 30 and after school.
An outdoor learning streets permit from monday to friday, from 7 00 am to 4 pm before we start that we definitely wanted to reach out to the community and work with them.
That's, it open to question I'll, be calling you If. There's anybody who lives specifically in inwood around cooper street and wants to kind of work with us or think with us on how best to start operating the outdoor learning, streets.
Reconfirm that and send the information to the board office to communicate that to you, At 158th street, in fort washington, park Yes in riverside park , you mean at riverside park.
Isn't that what you just read off of At times, resolutions we're going to move on to have our one of the hardest working committee.
You know mindful of the situation that just happened earlier with a public speaker who wanted to say something: It really is helpful in so many ways, but when somebody is having a connectivity issue and they've been in a zoom for the duration of the meeting and then all of a sudden, their computer, craps out or the battery dies or whatever their you know, their spectrum, farts or something, I can vote for them.
You know it's like you- can't control people's crappy technology It's a really unfortunate fluke of timing that right like right before her turn is when her technology decided to give up, but it just it just seems like there are some weird accommodations that we all as chairs and as board members have to make based on You , know this quirk of technology that enables access in so many ways, but offers a whole extra set of problems.
If, you take like a quick attendance to see what are the names, because it might be the name of the person on the application, in which case you know that what they're there for, but if it winds up being like their lawyer or somebody who's different from the name on your paperwork or a phone number where they're dialing in at the beginning, if you just make a quick check of who do, I have for items one through whatever If someone drops off the call, you can have another of your committee, members.
Other committee votes are usually against it and it will come in a formal resolution saying that be resolved, that you know.
They don't want to spend their whole time at the meeting and we had people come in after they left We would vote how we voted.
Let's make us work longer, And, it does look as though we're going to be punishing them by voting on a resolution objecting to their liquor license, even though there appears to be some some question as to whether or not there was a technical, technological glitch or some other reason why they couldn't be at the meeting now, if we're inviting them back next month.
Well, I, you know, I mean if we're going to end up voting on another resolution.
I'll, essentially reiterate what I said: normally, if, when people want a liquor license, they are put on the agenda of the licensing committee and when we get to that part of the agenda, if they don't happen to be there, they walked out or never came or whatever.
The committee continued with its procedure, because that's the way the vote was done thing, but the discussion we had just recently the last 15 minutes or so many board members feel seemed to feel that because it was a technical glitch.
The committee should not have followed that procedure and let the people talk once they, you know, reestablish their connection and therefore it would be unfair to do the automatic thing and reject them because they weren't there because it wasn't their fault What we want to do is we table the motion.
If you feel that what the committee does did, which is consistent with normal meetings, you know That, then you vote not to table the motion.
But people should know it's their business to stay on the meeting and not go mute and go do other things.
What just happened with omar has happened at past meetings with board members trying to vote where you know, for whatever reason, their audio connection is gone, and I will say that the first two community board zoo meetings, the first one I could hear and see.
We're going to now move on to the mary anderson's resolutions to give priority to seniors and disabled intern vices mary: We didn't vote on the licensing committee resolves.
We have actually to resolve the result that seniors and disabled be given priority to enter the necessary businesses, to be able to complete banking mailing and buy items necessary for survival, such as food, medicines and other necessities, and be it further resolved that this resolution be communicated to washington heights bid.
I have my hand first, okay, I, just wanted to like publicly give you a shout out to you and to the committee for the first resolution coming out of the aging committee , The committee of the aging tends to get cast aside as less important, and we know that in this time frame it It's the most important.
That's not reasonable, and that's why the I think the resolution, whereas it should clearly state that it's during all operating hours, to add that I'm, sorry repeat , I'm, just saying that we're gonna take at least four more questions, so we can move on to the next presentations from transportation.
There were people that got in the front of the bus that didn't look like they had anything wrong with them, but obviously they had a disability of some sort, and you know it became evident as you rode, along on the bus with them, but I think it's been great points, marielle, extremely great point on really the difference between disabled and a person with disabilities and everyone else whose contribution made this.
Now we're going to move on to the bernabeu in our transportation chair with her resolution , We had a very long meeting, so I just want to make a few points about that, just mostly just to say, check the minutes, because we did have a long meeting and my update was really long and it included things about summer events, including the 181 bus way and the city bike stations on the agenda.
The rebel, ceo and community affairs person came to the meeting to present sort of their re, their reopening and what changed and how it's been going so far again more information in the minutes or feel free to ask the resolution to get to the resolution.
The, like nine block stretch from you know, going north of 181st It's the they were just highlighting that those intersections have particularly heavy pedestrian traffic because of the presence of the various schools that people are accessing, etc.
I sort of this, but this resolution was tracking the letter that came from again schools, businesses and representatives of the area, and it was done this way, but that's not to preclude the fact that it's sort of we have discussed as a committee that this sort of these issues of safety writ large or things that are clearly going to be on our docket, this year.
It's referred to as fort george avenue up there right, It's, amsterdam, avenue and Might be, I think, probably the best thing to do to make sure that we capture the ball fields, issues you know and all the places that people are trying to cross, because I imagine there's not.
I want to just start off by saying that you know this has been a very challenging year, obviously taking over the public safety committee at such a turbulent time.
So we decided to write a resolution at the executive committee level to request additional time for our board to review the document and to provide a more rational, inclusive way of sharing our feedback.
The purpose of the executive committee passing the resolution asking for more time was for that exec comm meeting met rezo to go out to the 34th and 33rd precinct.
You know asking for more time, not for it to come to the board first to be ratified So Has that exec committee reso, been issued?.
This is sort of the second time that a public safety reso was sort of held until the general board meeting, because we actually drafted a rezzo.
One thing that was important too, to note was that we all agreed upon not rushing a resolution that to some board members when we speak about the NYPD and a lot of it.
Yes to all, except licensing, 15 and 18, on which you vote no If you're going to vote that way, people just say, you know yes to whatever, except whatever on which I vote.
However, it is you're voting, liz, I'm, sorry, I really would never cut in, but I just wanted to make sure that the new people understand that it says objection.
So that changes my vote to yes to all got it thanks richard allman, Thank you and if everybody could do me a favor and if you know that your name is coming up, soon, based on where you are in the alphabet, just go ahead and unmute yourself and try not to make a lot of noise.
I know that there was concerns about what that means and what that looks like or how communities feel about that piece, and also to the fact that small businesses need support from the federal government.
The public, advocate- You know trying to push the city council bill for green card holders to be able to vote in local elections as they pay taxes.
Taking these allegations pretty seriously and we support a thorough investigation and we admire curtis's courage in speaking up We're, aware of the efforts by other electeds, like the public advocates office, to have meaningful conversations around anti-blackness in the community, but those efforts can't possibly get off the ground if these kinds of things are indeed happening.
First of all, I just want to mention just following up to what kiana said that congressman espaiot took the lead in organizing the uptown cleanups and they have been going on and were very grateful both to the other electeds and to the community members who are you know, making taking their time to help beautify or at least help sanitize?
He voted no on the executive committee resolution of about the public safety and the time extension that should actually be recorded as not voting due to conflict because he works for the NYPD.
I'm hoping to work with curtis, so that both of our committees will pass a resolution in October dealing with the issue of controlling the proliferation of the fireworks and the problems that we faced.
Think I would like to see more members also points you know or share their views as well.
So I think that we have to put a lot of pressure on the department of education on being more transparent of the needs of our people in our community, especially the students in our community Well, thank you, maria and although we did not discuss this, but I, think that actually, I just want to say yes to, depending on the new hearing that is going to be in the community that actually is brought all that to our attention, Or. This is not part of our report, but I wanted to say that yes, on the 29th at 5 p.m, we're going to have a success academy.
When you get them and next month we got a bunch of things going on, including some report from domingo about some improvements that his group uplift, new york, are looking to do.
'm gonna, be in communications with the hospital over the concerns over the I would refer you to the minutes, but I think for the first time in 10 or 12 years.
Discussion came out of the email that I think every community board member got from the department of city planning in late June stating you know their support for black lives.
You know things that comes to mind, but we can also think in new york city.
It points to an issue that the community board has passed resolutions in the past 10 or 12 years, that have asked city planning to do things or have asked landmarks to do things and in this particular case it overlaps, because we did a soft side analysis when scott string was born president, that identified areas such as this that are zoned r8 as being potentially vulnerable because r8, you know, zoning density would allow bigger buildings that are currently there, and it's not that it does anything illegal about it.
Historic district, the community board, passed the resolution telling them to study a broader area that would include what we refer to as the upper and lower drives like where maria lives would have been included.
The emails that we've received about courts and things like that doesn't make the new members out of our community.
I think that we need to you know, work together, one of the things that you know actions have consequences recently on we've been talking, about.
You know very sad, situation, and I just want to alert people that you know all these problems, that we have a fire cracker and things like that.
I want to thank them for doing that, because that's really important that we actually that they are vested as well and what's going on within our board.
That's been has happened, though, the work that we put in because a lot of times, the sort of effort and the work that we put into like addressing these social issues, and these don't get recognized, and so you know, I would love to have had that sort of support, a public acknowledgement when we were going through hell last year with because I was the one that filed the eos ceo in case people.
