This oncoming fall, one of them being in partnership with the Manhattan, the bid that presides of Cedro Medina with the graffiti removal of not just the area that encompasses the bait, but also in other areas that are just terribly filled with Graffiti, we're in the process of getting some funds from City Council in order to hire a company that can help us at least beautify the area and make it less a bit less 80s or a bit less Bronx is burning like The. Second note I, like I, would like to say, based on my experience, that we should engage not just in conversation, but we should also try out our hardest to be part of our committee meetings, especially at the subcommittee level.
, I, merely wish to point out as a point of information that it is on the agenda It is on the agenda as a resolution of objection per the licensing committee, which you could have watched the meeting on youtube or read the minutes And You'll see, there's a negative resolution objecting to the application and we can discuss it when we get to that point.
Are you working with the with cloth, which would cover lower heights right I have about 18 pictures, beginning from 157Th street by The. I, do not know the name of the park.
I would like to get some clarification, especially and he's correct that other item that item, that that's being referred, to, Emma, is not was an objection on it, but I had a question about the part where this per the previous board members said that there was a recordings of people of someone saying that wanting to prevent a negro from becoming chair of Community, Board 12.
If somebody is saying that they're trying to prevent black people from you know getting positions, I know that I have gone through that on this board and continue to and so to hear this in this form, it's extremely disturbing, and I just feel like, instead of living.
Myself personally have been a part of some of that, and I know that those of you who are new, as well as people who are old members on this board, have heard me speak to That.
There are outstanding resolutions and actions that were to be taken and, for instance, in regards to a retreat to discuss what these dynamics are, which, ironically, are the same dynamics that were discussed 10 years ago in something very much the same that took place and yet most of the people who have the opportunity to make these changes act as if this is something that's not happening.
I. Think that we know the export member has brought up a lot of allegations without any substance to make sure that we're clear on everything Oh ebenezer, can you please add Philip from Germaine Williams's office.
We're going to miss you, And I, hope that the next secretary you know can do the work in be better saying that we are an excellent saying that I just want to start with my report.
I mentioned that in my report, in June, I believe, but the work of radio started, the 207 bridge going to be refurbished, going to be painted and the contractor is looking to have communication with the small businesses with all the business owners on the Manhattan side.
I said that in the general meeting in case you know, board members know a lot of people here and there please let the people having businesses around 207 bridge nearby, the 207 bridge, that there is a reconstruction and the contractor want to get in touch with them.
They are planning to build and a new homeless shelter on 10th avenue by the corner of 213Th Street They approach us because they want to start the conversation.
This is time we need to start talking to the people to the provider, because we need to request many services and ensure that they have like an indoor yard or a rooftop yard, where people can go outside the residents can go outside and smoke a cigarette And, you know, be an area for them to hang out outside outdoors, but inside the premises.
You posted elias already told me that he wants to have a conversation immediately with the provider and we will keep you informed and when it's time to bring it to one of the committee, we will do that as well.
The estimate of district need is due on October 30th We have our budget consultation, public heating on October 21st, so we're going to be working and sending you the information for the esteemed industry, need, and I would like that each committee chairs help us providing and creating the statement of district needs for fiscal year.
Probably, you already know about it- that the community board 12 has a new web page with all the information improve web page, and I want to say thank We work together to bring this new website.
Our shared person is aware about it, we're going to start preliminary conversation and when it's right to bring it to the community Board to one of the committees we're going to bring it.
Yeah, because you know we just saw the upper West side, get rid of a temporary shelter and kick a whole bunch of people out, because the community wanted that And I'm just trying to understand why we keep getting shelters to come to Inwood in Washington, Heights.
And we're going to be providing you updated, executive, committee, General meetings and When it comes to the committee discussion, That, the process of placement of CitiBike stations in the network is a process that does involve the public, did, involve and certainly involve the committee and and has been presented to the full board as well They will always include a mix of street stations and sidewalk stations.
I, put a lot of work into building the audience from our community and engaging people in supporting that Facebook page Right oc have been maintaining it in regards to uploading all of the data about any calendar, dates or information onto that.
So, just as a point of information when the most recent round of conflicts of interest training hosted by the borough president's office, I raised this very issue, and you know Natalie can help us by going back to that.
The agency needs to make to do it in setting that up and the Community Board did not vote to keep the old one.
Our new school dos Amigos on 108 cooper street is open just to let everybody know that we do have our kindergartens in school four days, a week, Monday through Thursday, starting with breakfast and optional drop off at 7:30 and after school, we're keeping them in small pods.
An outdoor learning streets permit from Monday to Friday from 7:00, am to 4 pm before we start that we definitely wanted to reach out to the community and work with them.
That's it open to question I'll, be calling you If, there's anybody who lives specifically in Inwood around Cooper Street and wants to kind of work with us or think with us on how best to start operating the outdoor learning streets.
And we just did not want to just you know, put up the signs without making sure we talk to the community.
I guess: I'll circle back to Temple, who was able to come back on while Joyce breaks her Mic and if Temple did right, that they were having issues with their mic and if anything, yeah, probably her mic is not working because she's actually admitted she attacks.
A long time friend is not that what you just read off of Working committee, chairs, Cedric Medina, go over the new 18 Thank you, chair for giving an opportunity to a report on the findings of the community.
Do that, I'd like to share some links with you about the New York City, Hospitality and alliance report, saying that you know June, July and August.
Also, I'm, going to share report provided by the business insider what they speculate, that about 90 of all local independent restaurants might not be able to stay open until December.
You know mindful of the situation that just happened earlier with a public speaker who wanted to say something They were having like some technology.
It really is helpful in so many ways, but when somebody is having a connectivity issue and they've been in a zoom for the duration of the meeting and then all of a sudden, their computer, craps out or the battery dies or whatever their you know, their spectrum, farts or something, I can vote for them.
The person had been at the meeting and then because of technology disappeared- Then you know what the committee did is perfectly appropriate, but since they came, back, I think it's, you know far more, just among other things that they be heard.
You know it's like you can't control people's crappy technology It's a really unfortunate fluke of timing that right like right before her turn is when her technology decided to give up, but it just it just seems like there are some weird accommodations that we all as chairs and as board members have to make based on You , know this quirk of technology.
If, you take like a quick attendance to see what are the names, because it might be the name of the person on the application, in which case you know that what they're there for, but if it winds up being like their lawyer or somebody who's different from the name on your paperwork or a phone number where they're dialing in at the beginning, if you just make a quick check of who do, I have for items one through whatever If someone drops off the call, you can have another of your committee, members, call them back and say: hey.
Other committee votes are usually against it and it will come in a formal resolution saying that be resolved, that you know.
I'm, saying that I would like to add that as an amendment okay and are you ready to vote on You figured your mural Mariella about resolution, 16, the hours of operations.
They do not want to spend their whole time at the meeting, and we had people come in after they left We, you know if we had voted and they were gone, we would vote how we voted.
It does look as though we're going to be punishing them by voting on a resolution objecting to their liquor license.
Well, I, you know, I mean if we're going to end up voting on another resolution.
What's going on Jim I'll, essentially reiterate what I said: normally, if, when people want a liquor license, they are put on the agenda of the licensing committee and when we get to that part of the agenda.
The committee continued with its procedure because that's the way the vote was done thing, but the discussion we had just recently the last 15 minutes or so many board members feel seemed to feel that, because it was a technical glitch.
The committee should not have followed that procedure and let the people talk once they, you know, reestablish their connection and therefore it would be unfair to do the automatic thing and reject them, because they were not there because it was not their fault.
If you feel that what the committee does did, which is consistent with normal meetings, you know That, then you vote not to table the motion.
I think if we do not reject them because of a technical glitch at least that's the view of some people If, the SLA is going to look at the thing and say: oh.
But people should know it's their business to stay on the meeting and not go mute and go do other things.
What just happened with Omar has happened at past meetings with board members trying to vote where you know, for whatever reason, their audio connection is gone, and I will say that the first two community board Zoom meetings, the first one I could hear and see.
So we wanted to come up with a resolution thanks to Sidros and Domingo's input after I, you know, spoke at length with them about how we should approach.
We have actually to resolve the result that seniors and disabled be given priority to enter the necessary businesses, to be able to complete banking mailing and buy items necessary for survival, such as food, medicines and other necessities, and be it further resolved that this resolution be communicated to Washington Heights, Bid, Washington, Heights, Chamber of Commerce Washington, Heights and wood merchants, associations, local merchants, restaurant associations, and is there anything else, Mary?
That's not reasonable, and that's why the I think the resolution, whereas it should clearly state that it's during all operating hours, to add that I'm, sorry repeat , I'm, just saying that we're going to take at least four more questions, so we can move on to the next presentations from transportation.
There were people that got in the front of the bus that did not look like they had anything wrong with them, but obviously they had a disability of some sort, and you know it became evident as you rode, along on the bus with them, but I think it's been great points, Marielle extremely great point on really the difference between disabled and a person with disabilities and everyone else whose contribution made this.
The rebel, CEO and Community affairs person came to the meeting to present sort of their re, their reopening and what changed and how it's been going so far again more information in the minutes or feel free to ask the resolution to get to the resolution.
The, like nine block stretch from you, know, going north of 181St It's the they were just highlighting that those intersections have particularly heavy pedestrian traffic because of the presence of the various schools that people are accessing, etc.
I sort of this, but this resolution was tracking the letter that came from again schools, businesses and representatives of the area, and it was done this way, but that's not to preclude the fact that it's sort of we have discussed as a committee that this sort of these issues of safety writ large or things that are clearly going to be on our docket, this year.
Might be, I think, probably the best thing to do to make sure that we capture the ball fields, issues you know and all the places that people are trying to cross, because I imagine there's not.
I, want to just start off by saying that you know this has been a very challenging year, obviously taking over the public Safety committee at such a turbulent time in our country, where we see racial injustices occurring and police brutality.
So we decided to write a resolution at the executive committee level to request additional time for our board to review the document and to provide a more rational, inclusive way of sharing our feedback.
The purpose of the executive committee passing the resolution asking for more time was for that exec Comm Meeting met Rezo to go out to the 34th and 33rd Precinct.
You know asking for more time, not for it to come to the board first to be ratified So Has that exec committee reso, been issued?
The executive committee does not speak for the board only, but the executive committee can speak for the board if it's time sensitive, So we're going to vote or do we have Can I just say: something, hang on a second daniel before you is mark, leaving a presenter before I have Danielle asks a question.
This is sort of the second time that a public safety reso was sort of held until the General Board meeting, because we actually drafted a rezzo.
And, then no to the Rest Mariella Lee, yes to all, except licensing committee, resolutions, 15 and 18., yes to all, except licensing, 15 and 18, on which you vote no If you're going to vote that way, people just say, you know yes to whatever, except whatever on which I vote.
It is you're voting, I really would never cut in, but I just wanted to make sure that the new people understand that it says objection.
We need to have we're working on it with Maria and Wayne, and everybody else I hope it's a skinny little street, so he can't do what he wants to do.
I know that there was concerns about what that means and what that looks like or how communities feel about that piece, and also to the fact that small businesses need support from the federal government.
Seeing, some of his work and in conversation is, you know, as we've all been thinking about public safety or the words defund, the police, or these kind of these kind of really tense conversations that are actually necessary, that we launched a campaign.
You know in the public hearing around the NYPD matrix of discipline and then using really calling out that the police commissioner looks at the civil section code and really define that if there's conduct that that is still perceived, that might happen like, for example, when the police drove into the protesters in Times square right, and it is.
Taking these allegations pretty seriously and we support a thorough investigation and we admire Curtis's courage in speaking up We're, aware of the efforts by other electeds, like the public advocates office, to have meaningful conversations around anti- blackness in the community.
First of all, I just want to mention just following up to what Kiana said that congressman Espaiot took the lead in organizing the uptown cleanups and they have been going on and were very grateful both to the other electeds and to the community members who are you know, making taking their time to help beautify or at least help sanitize?
He voted no on the executive committee resolution of about the public safety and the time extension that should actually be recorded as not voting due to conflict because he works for the NYPD.
In early August, we had a further presentation on noise pollution, a further discussion with representative of Fdny about fireworks, I'm hoping to work with curtis, so that both of our committees will pass a resolution in October dealing with the issue of controlling the proliferation of the fireworks and the problems that we faced.
Think I would like to see more members also points you know or share their views as well.
So I think that we have to put a lot of pressure on the department of education on being more transparent of the needs of our people in our community, especially the students in our community Well, thank you, Maria and although we did not discuss this, but I, think that actually, I just want to say yes to, depending on the new hearing that is going to be in the community.
When you get them and next month we got a bunch of things going on, including some report from domingo about some improvements that his group, Uplift New York, are looking to do.
It's, just I'll, be coordinating with I'm going to be in communications with the hospital over the concerns over the I would refer you to the minutes, but I think for the first time in 10 or 12 years.
Discussion came out of the email that I think every community board member got from the Department of City planning in late June, stating you know their support for black lives.
You know things that comes to mind, but we can also think in New York City.
It points to an issue that the Community board has passed resolutions in the past 10 or 12 years that have asked city planning to do things or have asked landmarks to do things and in this particular case it overlaps, because we did a soft side analysis when Scott String was born president, that identified areas such as this that are zoned r8 as being potentially vulnerable because R8, you know, zoning density would allow bigger buildings that are currently there, and it's not that it does anything illegal about it.
City planning has not done a thing to act on the resolution passed by CB12 when the in 2008, when landmarks was looking for advice on how to set the boundaries for what is now the Audubon Park Historic District, the Community Board passed the resolution telling them to study a broader area that would include what we refer to as the upper and lower drives like where Maria lives would have been included.
The emails that we've received about courts and things like that does not make the new members out of our community.
Think that we need to you know, work together, one of the things that you know actions have consequences recently on we've been talking, about.
You know very sad, situation, and I just want to alert people that you know all these problems, that we have a fire cracker and things like that.
I want to thank them for doing that, because that's really important that we actually that they are vested as well and what's going on within our board.
That's been has happened, though, the work that we put in because a lot of times, the sort of effort and the work that we put into like addressing these social issues, and these do not get recognized, and so you know, I would love to have had that sort of support, a public acknowledgement when we were going through hell last year with because I was the one that filed the eos CEO in case people do not understand, do not know because they're new about the bias against women on the board and when I thought it was over in January.
We had at the committee of the whole resolution authorizing the creation of a rezoning, task, inward rezoning task force, and somebody I do not remember whom at the beginning of the meeting asked if you know where we were on that So okay, I'm excited to hear your report.
