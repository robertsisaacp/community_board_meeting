A first draft plan was presented at the most recent meeting and while it does not get to what hours and days The bus way would be in operation or what hours of the day it did reflect, again, a pretty solid, first crack and also sort of it seemed mindful of the specific concerns raised through that community Advisory Board, specifically as it related to, And I, know for people that have said on this committee.
They'll know this specifically as it related to looking at the broader area, because the 181St street can't really be looked at in isolation, because so many people move to the surrounding blocks to get around.
Generally, one thing, that's sort of been talked about a little bit at this committee is Riverside drive when people are exiting the highway near henshaw.
Members were on that on that session, and a group has formed out of that meeting called which I know some of some people on the community board are also involved in about you know a neighborhood group sort of looking to get at this decibel level issue they reached out to this committee about speed, bumps and other tools to address some of the streets related aspects of that and as a reminder.
I just want people to sort of start thinking about it, because we're going to have to leave all of that.
So if anybody maybe wants to tell me about it, later, as far as I know that happened- maybe D.O.T, can fill us in like two weeks ago or a week ago and remember that was an opportunity both to sort out the intersection at 165Th and St Nicholas, amongst other things, as well as 160,170, in that crazy spot, where saint Nicholas and Broadway Cross, but also add 20s parking spots, just south of 165Th on I, think I'm up to Riverside viaduct project.
That is an ongoing project, as people may know that I think in total a five- year project or has about four years left or some such there is a construction liaison who's in touch with the community.
People have two minutes to speak, but one thing that sort of tripped me up by now is that when a committee member a board member, even a member public, commenting have a question.
How many people are like spend time understanding the issues providing feedback following up letting us know what's happening out there at the same time, sometimes or whatever.
Dot presented a project that addressed a few things in one around the area of like 158Th Street from Riverside, just about to broadway a lot of pedestrian safety kind of issues at intersections.
Because I know a few of you are newer to the committee and there may be people from the community that were not on the call in May. So just want to recap a few things: first, so This project as a whole.
Our D.O.T street ambassadors team, as you can see in the photo on the bottom right, has done outreach at 158Th Street talking to people in the community about the intersections along this corridor.
And then in may we presented to your committee to talk about the whole project and like what was said before the committee supported the improvements between 155Th Street and 158Th Street, but wanted us to look more at the design and function of the street conversion proposal that we had so just to visualize.
We have Riverside drive west and on the right we have Edward Morgan place and the 158Th Street intersection.
The area outlined in Blue is the area that was supported when we came to the transportation committee in May. This included the lane reduction to make it feel more like a residential neighborhood, as well as the concrete medians at 157Th Street and the enhanced crossings there.
They asked the question: Would you support making a two- way street one way if it could add parking and increase intersection safety and 69 of respondents?
We would like to add two no standing any time areas so that vehicles can load and unload or pick up and drop off people, and then that's highlighted in the pink along the West Curb and then along the East curb.
Keeping the parking and kind of the northern and southern ends gives more room for the bus to travel through there, and it also we keep some of the parking, which is something that was voiced during the community outreach process, and we also still get to keep the concrete curve extension at the intersection of 158Th Street, and so we can revisit this.
We can add time to the signal for pedestrians crossing along that north curb because we're removing that northbound movement and then also adding about 26 parking spaces with that spot parking, and so knowing that with the conversion, comes a diversion, route.
Guess all right, so I do not have anything from the else from the committee right now, but before we go to Natalie So, they sort of see two things here like there is a safety issue, Pedestrian safety issues related to the six- legged intersection that is what's is addressed in a here, but that also a big part of this was sort of to address parking concerns raised by the community when they lost 180 spots to the viaduct project.
I believe Transportation Committee presentation that we gave this was supported, but we needed to look a little bit more into the conversion and diversion okay, but you're inferring support just from the discussion, but not because a resolution was issued, right, Deborah, correct, me.
Drive adjacent to It might be really disruptive to the pedestrian and traffic flow, because the viaduct project is like it's like a war zone over there, So I, guess the question of the DOT is: Having second thoughts about how much tumult there would be with yet digging up.
This fall, we're still figuring out a few internal capacity things because of covered, but that we kind of wanted to this meeting happened and see what the discussion is like, but the plan would hopefully be to move forward in about October or so and bruce just to add to that I think that it's definitely a point well taken, but I think that the in the scheme of the length of the viaduct project- This is a very small implementation timeline relative to that, and Then I get committee members who want to talk.
We're, also proposing two no standing zones along the West Curb to allow for people like ups and fedex, or people picking up and dropping off to pull in and make those deliveries, but also allow a few sections where we can add some additional parking to alleviate the parking that was displaced by the viaduct work.
The way they made the term, and it took us a lot of time to get them to have a stop there to accommodate the people who come from the overdrive to take the bus number six there all right.
Now you are going to block I'm sure some of the area where the people with the steps are to accommodate the fancy angular parking that you intend to do.
I can also speak very fast, but with my accent, I want to make sure that people such as Mr Basket, that does not realize the impact that something like this is going to have in our community and his community.
We could maybe come back if she spoke, speaks again and wants to have some very clear questions that we can answer, I'd be happy to respond to them, but in general we hear the concerns about the diversion, but we do still feel that there is we're responding to community concerns here at that intersection and community requests for parking at this time.
Riverside drive , so I think you know, in addition to the concrete Walkway area that you're adding there should be some sort of abutment or some sort of way of keeping people unfamiliar with this new traffic pattern to from driving right up and hitting pedestrians.
You look to the northern section of Riverside drive where there's parking on both sides of the street, I've observed this area with an Eagle eye view of the street for over 10 years, now, and just to be honest with you, people are going to stop where it's convenient.
But if they stop in the area, where there's only one lane of traffic between two parked cars to decide, that's going to be the fastest and easiest way, you will have a build build- up of several cars and a lot of noise pollution within moments of that occurring and people just won't move their car because they want to unpack their groceries where they want to unpack their groceries, Even.
If it's just a quick, uber, ride, pickup or drop off so anywhere, where you have double parking on this avenue, it's going to just cause that backup immediately as soon as somebody pulls up to where they want to pull up, regardless of loading, zones.
Attracting more cars to the area, I think is counter intuitive to an idea of having a greener city down the road, especially if we're getting back the 100 and some odd parking spaces.
Conscious of anybody else's concerns, will literally just stop and go the road and take as much time as they want with no other way of cars getting around those double parked.
And I just want to point out that I think Kim mentioned this before that we heard so many comments about how unsafe the intersection of 158Th Street felt from a pedestrian perspective, as well as a motor vehicle perspective when you're driving through there, So that's what made us look at converting this street from two- way to That would get us the benefit of the large concrete, curb extension, which gives so many pedestrian benefits and the reason we've been looking at the parking along the eastern curb Is, because we had also heard from a number of people in the area that they wanted additional parking, because the viaduct project is so long, and so we What we're trying to do is accommodate that with these spot parking, measures.
I can look back at the survey to see if there was more comments about additional parking, but the one question we had asked was: Would you support making a two- way street one way if it could add parking and increase intersection, safety?
They want not necessarily the space that you're providing for them, and that's absolutely true, I mean, like I said, as a driver driving this area.
During like rush hour, traffic, I can tell you, there's about three or four cars: Double parked on the westbound side of that street, every single morning, and they are not fedex and they are not.
Four o'clock: five o'clock when that street backs up for three blocks because of people trying to go through a five car light at 165Th Street and that's an impossible route and the same thing will happen when we get through Covid-19 and traffic returns to normal on Riverside drive heading north in emergencies.
So I have real questions about you doing this as a permanent thing, and I suggest that Lee's suggestion to try it out as Southbound and see what happens, because I think it's going to cause lots of problems that you have not anticipated.
We still have a couple more items on the agenda, so I think I'm going to have to sort of cut us off for first for a second round of questions, but I still have Jim Berlin You said you asked people, you know what would they think of making a street one way if it increased more traffic?
It's, the only way these streets work, and, ironically, which I know totally infuriates your D.O.T mentality, the fact that people have to drive slowly and carefully actually limits accidents and with all these double parked cars cluttering things you can't go fast.
I hear what you're saying I think that does not mean there is not room to kind of rethink, how this behavior happens and how the street can be designed to sort of get around that opposing entering the opposing lane, and also just to reiterate again that it's not the entire that most of the stretch that's proposed here does not have parking on both sides.
We then expanded to a considerable area in Brooklyn and Queens in 2019, with over a thousand vehicles, and earlier this year in March, we expanded throughout Manhattan and the south Bronx during sort of the height of Covid-19, where we worked with Corey Johnson, the speaker, the D.O.T, to basically offer free rides to health care.
As we worked with the mayor's office as we worked with NYPD, we had two issues: And I think one of the things that happened was you know coming out of Covid-19 call it from April.
Think hundreds of thousands of people in a very short period of time were looking for a way to get around the city that was safe way to social distance while getting around and frankly just had a lot of fun, especially maybe after being cooped up in their apartment for 10- 12 weeks.
What we did was over the last month, as we worked with the DOT and city hall, every single time you ride now, And you'll see it out in the street.
The other thing that we realized, and one of the reasons why I'm at this community board meeting today is certain neighborhoods like Inwood, for whatever reason from you know may through July there was an increase in rider.
I mean tell me if I'm wrong, but I think it's decreased in a really good way, which is exactly what we needed to see with the relaunch some other safety initiatives that we built over the last month that we had shut ourselves down and worked with D.O.T with increased lessons.
If you think it's the right thing to do to ride down a one- way street the opposite way for three or four blocks, guess what now we know exactly what happened?
We, know where the one- way streets, are, and we've suspended a lot of users and If. You can't ride this vehicle, the right way.
I'm glad Frank that you noted all summer the things that were happening, but it took debts for rebel to finally do something, but you knew all summer long that it was tormenting communities like Inward, Washington Heights, who were being chased down blocks and streets sidewalks by people on rebel.
So I think, in terms of being a Covid-19 spreader, I'm going to have to politely disagree a bit in terms of the helmet use every single time we battery swap vehicle, which in Manhattan is literally every single day, because the demand is so high.
That's just an example of like one suspension policy that we have for a violation- You know for things like riding up a one- way street for five or six blocks.
Second, in terms of things like riding the wrong wind, a one- way street going in parks going on acrosss, bridges, etc.
So we basically got a written letter signed by commissioner trottenberg, saying we approve of the safety enhancements you're, making we're looking forward to working together and you're approved to relaunch on the streets of New York.
Let me put this as there's always politics here, but I'll, say the commissioner of the DOT is not going to sign a letter approving of our relaunch without approvals from certain people, but just to ask that we have been working closely with City Council members in all four boroughs who we consulted.
We got the feedback and within two hours we had shut down the lessons and moved the location and we actually reached out and tried to coordinate the a better location so that we have a new location for Inwood and Washington Heights people that it's really just like in a very quiet area,, there's really no residence on either side We were just trying to find the best place that would satisfy the community, but also They get some amazing experience on how to ride We really want people to take advantage.
We call it the you know, sort of just the squiggly line, alert, which is basically like when a GPS trail is just makes no sense, and it's just going back and forth around the street.
You do not know what second one we're going to get you connected outside of this, because we're like double the amount of time for that You have something after Ira and the center's office, hello, I've heard commented.
You know checking the distances where people are traveling, whether or not they're going on one- way streets or into parks.
Let us know how things are going and talk to you all soon, thanks again and Carol connect with you absolutely getting people's info all right.
Since all the material is in the letter that I think someone else might want to take a crack at it, because you know the writing res and you can look at all resolutions and the thing is, it can be very brief.
I'll have her take that up with us in October I, just this would be for the future, but so people know another thing that there's been a lot of community feedback about is that there is a group of people in the community who are really opposed and upset to have to lose the open street that we had in the Fort Triumph Park Drive, and that open street did come to an end on September 8th in part.
So I am going to ask people to sort of like think a little bit more broadly, let's freshen up that list, and I.
Think our next meeting is in , like three weeks are things traffic studies at you, know, we've talked about by the hospital You know things have come up again from the public on you know around dyckman or We often go into that budget moment, and we do not have a lot of time.
Is I, really like your idea of exploring further the issue with the street and Fort Trying Park.
However, I also think that there have been issues with certain of the open streets in terms of things not being enforced.
I just wanted to add maybe new business for the next meeting, which is that there is a charter school that is supposed to come in to 215Th Street between Park Terrace, East and Park, Terrace West, which is very residential, and so just wanting to ask some questions and look into what that would mean for traffic and busing in that area, which is you know, full of one- way streets, all right.
Yet is that you know certainly there's been a series of issues that sort of have an enforcement aspect, but have a streets aspect and those sometimes are tricky right, because we can only talk about one.
