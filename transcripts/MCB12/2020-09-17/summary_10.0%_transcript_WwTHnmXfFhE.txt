A first draft plan was presented at the most recent meeting and while it doesn't get to what hours and days The bus way would be in operation or what hours of the day it did reflect, again, a pretty solid, first crack and also sort of it seemed mindful of the specific concerns raised through that community advisory board, specifically as it related And I know for people that have said on this committee.
They'll know this specifically as it related to looking at the broader area, because the 181st street can't really be looked at in isolation, because so many people move to the surrounding blocks to get around.
Generally, one thing, that's sort of been talked about a little bit at this committee is riverside drive when people are exiting the highway near henshaw.
Members were on that on that session, and a group has formed out of that meeting called which I know some of some people on the community board are also involved in about you know a neighborhood group sort of looking to get at this decibel level issue they reached out to this committee about speed, bumps and other tools to address some of the streets related aspects of that and as a reminder.
So if anybody maybe wants to tell me about it, later, as far as I know that happened, maybe d.o.t, can fill us in like two weeks ago or a week ago and remember that was an opportunity both to sort out the intersection at 165th and st nicholas, amongst other things, as well as 160 170, in that crazy spot, where saint nicholas and broadway cross, but also add 20s parking, spots, just south of 165th on I'm.
Emergency repairs and I also attended a presentation on how that was all going to get done, that very busy artery with a very needed emergency, repair, and : People have two minutes to speak, but one thing that sort of tripped me up by now is that when a committee member a board member, even a member public, commenting have a question.
How many people are like spend time understanding the issues providing feedback following up letting us know what's happening out there at the same time, sometimes or whatever.
Dot presented a project that addressed a few things in one around the area of like 158th street, from riverside just about to broadway a lot of pedestrian safety kind of issues at intersections.
So, just a little background, because I know a few of you are newer to the committee and there may be people from the community that weren't on the call in may So just want to recap a few things first.
So this project as a whole riverside drive from 155 to about 161st street we've been talking about it for a year and a half now starting in late 2018, and did you already move it Is it not working okay, not being in full screen?
Our d.o.t street ambassadors team, as you can see in the photo on the bottom right, has done outreach at 158th street talking to people in the community about the intersections along this corridor, and then in may we presented to your committee to talk about the whole project and like what was said before the committee supported the improvements between 155th street and 158th street, but wanted us to look more at the design and function of the street conversion proposal that we had so just to visualize.
They asked the question: Would you support making a two-way street one way if it could add parking and increase intersection safety and 69 of respondents?
There was concern about the bus being able to travel smoothly through this corridor, and so we're asked to take a look at the design a little bit more, maybe remove some parking in some spaces.
We would like to add two no standing any time areas so that vehicles can load and unload or pick up and drop off people, and then that's highlighted in the pink along the west, curb and then along the east.
Keeping the parking and kind of the northern and southern ends gives more room for the bus to travel through there, and it also we keep some of the parking, which is something that was voiced during the community outreach process, and we also still get to keep the concrete curve extension at the intersection of 158th street, and so we can revisit this.
We can add time to the signal for pedestrians crossing along that north curb because we're removing that northbound movement and then also adding about 26 parking spaces with that spot parking, and so knowing that with the conversion, comes a diversion.
, so I don't have anything from the else from the committee right now, but before we go to natalie So, they sort of see two things here like there is a safety issue, pedestrian safety issues related to the six-legged intersection that is what's is addressed in a here, but that also a big part of this was sort of to address parking concerns raised by the community when they lost 180 spots to the viaduct project.
I believe, transportation committee presentation that we gave this was supported, but we needed to look a little bit more into the conversion and diversion okay, but you're inferring support just from the discussion, but not because a resolution was issued, right, deborah correct me.
In light of the viaduct project starting another project along riverside drive adjacent to it might be really disruptive to the pedestrian and traffic flow, because the viaduct project is like it's like a war zone over there, Having second thoughts about how much tumult there would be with yet digging up riverside drive at the same time and that's basically what I'm asking This fall, we're still figuring out a few internal capacity things because of covered, but that we kind of wanted to this meeting happened and see what the discussion is like, but the plan would hopefully be to move forward in about October or so and bruce.
We're, also proposing two, no standing zones along the west curb to allow for people like ups and fedex, or people picking up and dropping off to pull in and make those deliveries, but also allow a few sections where we can add some additional parking to alleviate the parking that was displaced by the viaduct work.
I can't read them on my on my phone, What question number two, the parking that would be provided on the east side is that parallel parking or Yes, because you know we have guard rails right along that whole stretch of the park, so the people on the passenger side of those vehicles would wouldn't So. If you look at it so that the people on the driver's side are not going to be able to get out of their cars, so we have so.
It took us a lot of time to get them to have a stop there to accommodate the people who come from the overdrive to take the bus number six there all right.
Now you are going to block I'm sure some of the area where the people with the steps are to accommodate the fancy angular parking that you intend to do.
I can also speak very fast, but with my accent, I want to make sure that people such as mr basket that doesn't realize the impact that something like this is going to have in our community and his community if he says that he lives in this area.
So I think you know, in addition to the concrete walkway area that you're adding there should be some sort of abutment or some sort of way of keeping people unfamiliar with this new traffic pattern to from driving right up and hitting pedestrians who might be waiting in that area.
If, you look to the northern section of riverside drive where there's parking on both sides of the street, I've observed this area with an eagle eye view of the street for over 10 years now, and just to be honest with you, people are going to stop where it's convenient.
But if they stop in the area, where there's only one lane of traffic between two parked cars to decide, that's going to be the fastest and easiest way.
And I just want to point out that I think kim mentioned this before that we heard so many comments about how unsafe the intersection of 158th street felt from a pedestrian perspective, as well as a motor vehicle perspective when you're driving through there.
So that's what made us look at converting this street from two-way to one-way And That would get us the benefit of the large concrete, curb extension, which gives so many pedestrian benefits and the reason we've been looking at the parking along the eastern curb is because we had also heard from a number of people in the area that they wanted additional parking, because the viaduct project is so long, and so we What we're trying to do is accommodate that with these spot parking, measures.
Is it okay to come back to you after I just work through the last of the Actually just have a quick question from what carissa just said, which is maria, made a comment about the people who are involved in the feedback for this project over a year and a half ago and carissa.
I can look back at the survey to see if there was more comments about additional parking, but the one question we had asked was: Would you support making a two-way street one way if it could add parking and increase intersection, safety, and that was a yes,?
During like rush hour, traffic, I can tell you, there's about three or four cars: Double parked on the westbound side of that street, every single morning, and they are not fedex and they are not.
Four o'clock: five o'clock when that street backs up for three blocks because of people trying to go through a five car light at 165th street and that's an impossible route and the same thing will happen when we get through Covid-19 and traffic returns to normal on riverside drive heading north in emergencies.
You said you asked people, you know what would they think of making a street one way if it increased more traffic?
This is not orthodox DOT traffic school thinking, you're, never supposed to cross that line unless it's an emergency, god forbid, but on real streets here in washington heights on wadsworth, which is narrow and edgecombe, and this street and audubon like I, said this happens, all the time.
It's, the only way these streets work, and, ironically, which I know totally infuriates your d.o.t mentality, the fact that people have to drive slowly and carefully actually limits accidents and with all these double parked cars cluttering things you can't go fast.
I hear what you're saying I think that doesn't mean there isn't room to kind of rethink, how this behavior happens and how the street can be designed to sort of get around that opposing entering the opposing lane, and also just to reiterate again that it's not the entire that most of the stretch that's proposed here doesn't have parking on both sides.
We can go back for sort of more surveying to sort of to sort of capture get at the issue that the questions were asked in sort of generalized and linked ways and to try to get underneath these two, these two threads here about and to sort of separate the parking issue from that intersection, If you all think we're ready to go up or down vote, then I would move that this issue be tabled to the call of the chair.
You know every subway is basically built to do one thing to get you into Manhattan, but if you want to do any other trip sort of good luck, so that was really the genesis of revel back in 2018 We did a small pilot of close to 100 vehicles in the summer of 2018.
We then expanded to a considerable area in Brooklyn and Queens in 2019, with over a thousand vehicles, and earlier this year in March, we expanded throughout Manhattan and the south Bronx during sort of the height of Covid-19, where we worked with corey johnson, the speaker, the d.o.t to basically offer free rides to health care.
As we worked with NYPD, we had two issues and I think one of the things that happened was you know coming out of Covid-19 call it from April.
Think hundreds of thousands of people in a very short period of time were looking for a way to get around the city that was safe way to social distance while getting around and frankly just had a lot of fun, especially maybe after being cooped up in their apartment for 10-12 weeks.
The other thing that we realized, and one of the reasons why I'm at this community board meeting today is certain neighborhoods like inwood, for whatever reason from you know may through July there was an increase in rider.
If you think it's the right thing to do to ride down a one-way street, the opposite way for three or four blocks, guess what now we know exactly what happened?
We know where the one-way streets are and we've suspended a lot of users.
But you knew all summer long that it was tormenting communities like inward washington heights who were being chased down blocks and streets sidewalks by people on rebel, but I'm glad you finally did something about it and suspensions.
So, that's just an example of like one suspension policy that we have for a violation- You know for things like riding up a one-way street for five or six blocks.
Second, in terms of things like riding the wrong wind, a one-way street, going in parks going on across bridges, etc.
All sorts of elected officials, the mayor's office d.o.t. We basically got a written letter signed by commissioner trottenberg, saying we approve of the safety enhancements you're, making we're looking forward to working together and you're approved to relaunch on the streets of new york.
Let me put this as there's always politics here, but I'll, say the commissioner of the DOT is not going to sign a letter approving of our relaunch without approvals from certain people, but just to ask that we have been working closely with city council members in all four boroughs who we consulted, so I guess relevant to the support community board.
We call it the you know, sort of just the squiggly line, alert, which is basically like when a gps trail is just makes no sense, and it's just going back and forth around the street.
You know checking the distances where people are traveling, whether or not they're going on one-way streets or into parks.
We want to make sure you're not able to take a second ride until we review that we actually just reported all sorts of statistics to the DOT last week, How many people do you have who are doing this type of work?
Let us know how things are going and talk to you all soon, thanks again and carol connect with you absolutely getting people's info all right.
So I am going to ask people to sort of like think a little bit more broadly, let's freshen up that list, and Traffic studies at you, know, we've talked about by the hospital You know things have come up again from the public on you know around dyckman or We often go into that budget moment, and we don't have a lot of time.
However, I also think that there have been issues with certain of the open streets in terms of things not being enforced.
Maybe new business for the next meeting, which is that there is a charter school that is supposed to come in to 215th street, between park, terrace, east and park, terrace west, which is very residential, and so just wanting to ask some questions and look into what that would mean for traffic and busing in that area, which is you know, full of one-way streets?
Yet is that you know certainly there's been a series of issues that sort of have an enforcement aspect, but have a streets aspect and those sometimes are tricky right, because we can only talk about one.
