Who's, made yourself available to have this exact meeting in now, Wednesday September, 16th I'll, say the word, which is a lot of obstacles along the way on my report, I was going to have Richard allman, take a few minutes and speak about an initiative that he's trying to be part of, or make us be part of, I think I believe it was a change on the medal or the highest annual that a fire department gives from an individual who was a known to be a racist individual now to a new name.
It is critical that we understand the nature of what noise really means before we head on or move on into something that is more organizational And I had the office sent each and every one of you or the email so that you guys can have the link and be part of this initiative that we are trying to have you guys be part of once That panel or that presentation is takes place on Friday, then what we will do is to customize it and have the individual data be presented to us from specifically the complaints in District, Community Board, 12.
For a few months a number of emails asked to receive the licensing, committee, preliminary paperwork and never received that, and I had I got all sorts of excuses, and so this is the problem This is a public information and I entitled to receive it, just like any other person, because it's public, let's see if it's going to work.
We have available in October the 8th, the 15th, and I do not know you want to do it after the executive committee on the 20th 21st, which days of the week are those I'm, sorry to say, again.
We moved the Youth Committee to the first Monday of the month because we have a holiday on the second Monday Columbus day, and now we are discussing where we're going to place the budget consultation hearing in October.
You know a day two days after the executive committee in October, eliza has a question.
I submitted this request to the executive committee to see if there is no objection And, you approve it as we do every year to close the office the day after thanksgiving that's great thumbs up any other suggestion or comments on the November calendar.
So I think that my work as the chair of the parks and Cultural Affairs Committee is very important and for this reason I am remaining on the board.
Thank, you for your service, Liz. If I have to fill in the secretary chair, I absolutely need help with everything, including fill me in with like what you know.
That is supposed to be unhackable by the Russians, not to say the Russians are going to hack our community board election, but you never know so, but you're scared, okay, all right!
If I just may, as I mentioned to you when we ran into each other on the Census day- And I, told Jonathan also that we could follow up on this, but one of our CBS, a few of our cities, have already had elections in this remote platform and our Cb one district manager, Lucian Reynolds, did present at the last borough services cabinet, step by step, how the system that they had used, So, while that is not an open meeting that we recorded, that is certainly a resource that ebenezer can connect you to as a model for a successful board election in this platform, with the consultation of our In- House Council, and all of these other regulating entities like to join the moments of thanking our comrade at Borough President's office in Honolulu and is, and for Curtis young of public safety for his pointing out the problem with the potential taking of elections.
First quarter would obviously be July, August and September, so not a report, but more a request that we can put those numbers to paper and present that at the at the next the first quarter would that be possible sure this week, Tomorrow I had the district service cavity, meeting.
That is a critical number that if it comes through it's going to devastate our restaurant industry in other Manhattan, As, we know, they employ a lot of the local employees and for us that'll, be devastating.
It was a busy summer, Like I know, for almost every committee, I am not one to take a lot of time in this committee.
A lot of the first meeting was spent trying to communicate that we felt overall that some of the main issues that were raised were recognized either already in the plan or recognized verbally by DOT.
My guess is the DOT will be to us in no in the November tnt and therefore the November general, and that Moving on to CitiBike, as people may know, who have spent time between the southernmost portion of CB12 and 184Th Street, most of the stations have been installed.
Solutions did talk to me about speed, bump requests, but I just want to make people aware that speed bumps no longer come through the committee and people do those direct with DOT, but I'm, trying to keep in hand keep close to sort of what they're isolating most of what they seem to be identifying Coming to my meeting so with two big items on the agenda , first was if people remember, we passed a resolution last spring with regard to pedestrian safety changes around the area of like 157,158 west of Broadway and going out to Riverside, and but there was a component of that proposal which would convert what is currently a two two- way street into a one-.
I do not want to go into it tonight unless people ask for it, but where we came out after a lot of discussion was that we were not going to.
So we had great engagement on the issue and again, I'm happy to provide further detail, but people should know that no resolution came out of that.
I. Do not know, question safety thing that you have to do: He feels like that's a good thing, because he has the more of the right people who are going to use the service in the right.
Just I drafted it pretty late last night, so I do not have it for you guys and in fact, I sent it to the office at 45 minutes ago, but I will have that Taking that letter and turning it into a resolution and again that applies to this stretch of Amsterdam, I- want to do this, because this has been an issue.
I'll just mention ADA, was mentioning the right to council bill, specifically the expansion of it, so that it's actually more accessible in the coming next few months, rather than waiting until the end of I think it was 2022 that the official enactment goes through for the entire city as well as a number of others.
That, I went on to begin talking to some of our newest members about the process that will be going on in the coming months, essentially picking our own committees, individual capital and expense items, and that was pretty much it for us.
There's, no movement on the RFP for the new leaf cafe, that, hopefully, will be happening in the next in 2021, but that kind of took a backseat a lot of issues related to Covid-19, but parks continue to be open.
I think some of that is going to be taken care of as the weather gets colder, but we have a number of neighbors who have had a really hard time with that I've been working with curtis and the public Safety Committee, with Jennifer Hoppa Parks enforcement, with the 34th precinct to you, know, try and get some more resources again to stop.
We send a representative on an ongoing basis so that they can share information about deployment and also hear people's feedback, not so that we turn every committee meeting into an undifferentiated, fetching session, but just so that that's another way for for parks enforcement to hear what people's issues are in terms of culture.
There's been some recent correspondence between the elected officials and the president of the hospital president is now saying he's going to do a comprehensive review of their mental health services in the fall when and the nurses, association, asked, and I agreed and I'll be hopefully working with Ellie to do a follow- up letter to our resolution, reiterating our support for the reinstatement of the of the psych unit and indicating our desire to work with him on whatever review they're conducting about their mental health.
We want to know about the services you've been providing and the impact that Covid-19 has had on the facilities in our community, and I reiterated that request in a meeting of the Community Leadership Council of the hospital.
That may be more feasible that we can pick up on and during the course of that public hearing, Tanya Bonner had suggested to to ezra that the Community board form a task force to continue to act on the issue and at that public hearing Ellie said he would do so, but subsequent to the public hearing tanya and some of the other people from that group decided that they would prefer to have what they considered to be.
So I just want to address Steve what you said about Ddc and the project that DEP has going catch basin replacement at the corner of cabrini in 181St, Which, by the way, was a brutal thing to have during pandemic, as restaurants started to be able to put some tables outdoors and obviously.
The thing that makes me crazy in this situation is that if it was a capital project, there would be that community liaison as reports to Steve's, committee, and I, get copied on a lot of stuff as well about what's happening in a project.
You know the hospitals, community relations on this issue, I think, leaves much to be desired.
Well, my report, as you probably already everyone, so we, our community, discussed on a very important issue that everyone knows.
I think that it was that I commend my community for is for allowing this specifically or came up with the idea that having then just expressed next Monday on the 21st, we know the mayor, along with other high- ranking leaders.
You know You know in the meantime, just think about it to see if you, if you want to have that, following in collaboration with the youth and Education committee, perhaps maybe on October 13-- and this is my report and thank you.
And I would encourage you to ask the DOE in how many teachers, like actual teachers, not substitutes, are operating within the in school instruction because from my understanding, there's a big issue going on around there not being enough teachers, because a lot of them have opted out to only work virtually because of a prior condition, etc.
I, think all board members probably received an email from the Department of City planning sometime in late June, whereby you know DCP stated their support for black lives.
Matter, and you know for inclusion and equity in Well, not everyone, but a number of organizations are issuing their public statements, but I wanted to understand what city planning saw as some of the historical ways that planning and zoning was used to exclude and not to be inclusive, and so I invited initially our two DCP reps They later invited some others from city planning to join us.
You know that equity and inclusion are in fact, part of that, and we of course need our elected officials, the borough, President Office, to help us push that forward, and one of the things we probably want to pay attention to is the neighborhood planning and land use study that we worked on once again with city college back in 2007.
You know there is a lot of community opposition to that, and the question is whether the zoning calculations are correct, which, for the most part, you know, we've checked, we've been in touch with city planning and, with you know, the borough president's office.
The community board was asked to give an opinion on what the study area in the boundary should be, and we included the upper and lower drive, for you know reasons that if you look at the housing stock there, it is, as you know, older, as interesting as some of the buildings that are in the historic district landmarks did not act on that.
That does explain a lot because it came up for amongst people on Monday night, I guess just brief question is: Do you anticipate any issue with like in terms of the width of the street, that they'll just count the lower roadway like they're, not going to treat all of that And then the little the little upper tiny roadway they're not going to count?
The same street does not make sense, but that's the question how you know: How is it for dot's purposes, a narrow street and for city planning's purposes, you'll be a wide street I think D.O.T said it was only 30, feet.
So we got D.O.T saying that the lower road is only 30 feet wide And, it's a narrow, road, and This is an easy one, and at this point you know people are kind of having a lot of love for the Post office.
Yes, did we have Ariel from the controller's office wanted to say something, Sorry, guys, I'm, not sure if this is appropriate or not, because you move pretty quickly on these meetings, but I just had a question for Debbie that I put in the chat in the beginning and did not have a chance to ask when you spoke just if folks were concerned about the margaret corbin, not being an open street anymore, because I know some other areas have complaints about that.
Think what Mary's resolution I think, hits on a very significant issue, which you know affects a lot of people.
There are some stores that do provide some advanced hours for seniors, but maybe not enough, And I think this is a very good issue which the community board can utilize to attract some attention to itself.
We should we should make a we should make something out of this issue and and try to let people know that we're advocating on their behalf.
My second thing Mary, is that I'd like to talk to you about the this budget request of yours, because I think it may be duplicative of of the of what is has been the number one priority from the health and Environment Committee, and I would not want to divide the votes that or the ranking.
The mental health of people acrosss the board, but let's work together on this all right I would definitely be able to support this resolution because I think it's needed.
I will remind them that you know this is a community board request and also will be a best practice for businesses, and I'm.
It's been a very busy summer with all of the situations happening around the community, we did participate in the noise complaint hearing as well as we convene our committee during the month of July to kind of address some of these issues as well.
We'll try to address some of the issues we maintain communication with the people who established the noise group on Facebook Claudia I have also been working with the precincts trying to help localize situations with noise, be resolved like sort of a block by block type of approach, by referring people to the business and helping them to get in contact directly with the NCO.
So, as you know, quality of life continues to be an issue in the community.
Because technically I was part of a situation that went down in one of the parks, and I myself heard an officer, say: So, my question to that is: there's like this strike that wants to be considered a slowdown going on You have this crime spike, currently happening, and is it like it's like the pba is enjoying this because they go and endorse trump, but at the same time it's like they're, just chilling yeah, We did that did come up in our meeting this past month of the perceived public, strike.
They'll come, but I think citizens are not getting that same sort of like individualized support when they need to for the particular issue.
I. Think the similar concern that I have around the suggestion with the russell of next week for the general meeting is that it is a substantive amount of information to present that same night, where more members will probably want to support and make amendments and additions, If we can collect how we have done in the past some more of those recommendations that and Kurt is concerned into a letter, because you know it's a substantive And I think again, a lot of the work that we've been doing in the last couple of months.
Meeting Wayne also did send an email in response to Curtis's email which attached all of this, which said rather than have all of the whereases, just have a very simple, whereas that says, whereas the police were, you know, advised to do this top to bottom study and they submitted this report and they've asked for community input by from the public input by September, 30th.
We can at least agree that there are people, okay, that it might be a problem, and so I think that we'll be able to serve the community's interests and respond in a way that is thoughtful without having to get too into the weeds about agreeing.
I would like us to take a position that more time is required and that the community should be allowed to consider a 53-page document in more than just 30 days, The time period is a problem, so I'm not sure we passed back from the executive committee so that we can just vote on that and have a very short because that's not terribly controversial, we can say the executive.
I try my best to just pick out some of the main substance of the document, but I do think that having more people review it and more public input will be helpful not only to the committee, but The community overall.
It's an issue that the community board, I think, should consider I'm, bringing it directly to the executive committee just because I think, there's a particular time.
I. Think with the issue I'd like to see the community board be in a leadership position on this That's why I'm, bringing it directly to the executive committee, And I, would certainly be glad to work with that.
I think, unless it's a very time sensitive issue as the one that is presented Liz, please Calendar I'll, be glad to work with you, And I would like I'd love to have second Tuesday of every month at 6:30.
