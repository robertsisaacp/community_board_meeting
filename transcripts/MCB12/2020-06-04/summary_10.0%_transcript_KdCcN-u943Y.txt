And hopefully the goal is to have some action steps and some next steps we can take as a community with their leaders and as a committee, to take to our full board and also to share our concerns with larger audiences meeting, is being recording So. Without further ado, we usually run our meetings and with their updates from the local precinct, so I'm gonna turn it over to captain bellow to give us update from the thirty-third We're, coordinating a plan, hopefully to quash whatever people.
Obviously, we saw from the media covers that issue escalated and it became politically racially tense in a situation between african-american community members as well as those you know who live in the area from type in Dominicans and I thought that was instigated by the police force by Allah.
Do, a resolution from the committee that calls on our electives to you know fully repeal 58, because if so, we would need to sort of have just a quick agreement on what the provisions would be and vote on it.
So I would like to just open the floor up to conversate your comments on of my people in my PD funding issue, and if we felt as a committee that it was appropriate to somehow do a resolution to link all those issues- I'll go after you, full repeal of 50a and writing resolution on that.
I, believe that we do in this particular conversation is the reason why I do think that both of these resolutions repeal at fifty a and ways to reallocate the NYPD budget require a very specific view on them, especially in the case of the budget.
When it comes to the budget, and just give me about a minute to say this piece of it, I can definitely understand from folks how you know the phrase defund NYPD or anything like that.
It's, exactly what Curtis said: there's better uses for the money than the hyper militarization of our police, for instance, and that's why it when it comes to you having a specific resolution for reallocation of the budget and really on all of this and think you saw me proposing that link.
It's, very important, so I just want to say that first and if anyone has a better marketing line than the two words of defund NYPD, I am one hot to present all ears, because that's what it's going to take and Councilmember Mark Levine did speak about his efforts to reallocate funding to other community-based programs and not to spend soft.
What support I'm, going to make sure that we're cognizant Maybe we can, the resolution can speak to equity and how those cuts would happen, because the reality is that there has been an increase over the last four or five years in the NYPD budget, and we want to ensure that when there is a cut that they're not cutting the black people that actually work at the lower end in regards to salary in the department and we're talking about, for example, the traffic, these safety officers, those to help the crossing guards.
Okay, not about budget equity, specifically All of the important points that we should include in this I think, including that term, specifically, though, would be great and really important, and perhaps not using language like defund NYPD, but sort of you know, reallocating funds and making sure that and showing our support or even occasion of funds, and so I guess.
It ultimately be police, reform, more accountability and So I think we are one quick, comment, ok, yes, Sally redirecting to community-based programs, but specifically with regard to people with mental illness and responding to calls for mostly disturbed persons.
We need people there with the proper mental health training that can deescalate So I think that we need to have the proper personnel and that does not exist with echo with salia, Singh It's a Reid effect redirecting funds to perhaps case manager, and there was a New York Times article about an opinion piece that was really great about region sort of social workers who could potentially respond instead of police officers Yes, they have a medical person, there, Thank, You, Sally, Maria, Luna, Maria.
Member now is there a second Is there motion on the floor to create a separate resolution of tackling the issue of budget equity?
So, when you're saying a resolution on budget equity and voting on that, I mean I'd like to see.
We would focus the language on a budget equity and the things that we throughout the meeting, particularly the issue of, maybe even looking at what Mark Levine is already advocated for advocating for reallocating funding to healthcare.
A comment in the chat about restorative justice, training, which I think I would prefer seeing something like restorative justice initiatives, because I don't know that the police are the right people for that.
And I think it's also then easier for people who may have disagreements about this, or that particular thing to unite behind the concept that when we say defund the NYPD, we're not talking about disbanding it all together and saying you know: [ __, ] Made, it very clear that he's received thousands and thousands of calls on this particular issue.
And I think that the D fund is a hinderance, no We have the opportunity in this resolution, to talk about what that means and to kind of recapture that language and to say something: like, whereas when people talk about defund, NYPD they're, not saying disband, it, they're saying spread the budgetary love so that we can pay for some of the other things that very necessary that go hand in hand with you, know: justice.
That's, going on to acknowledge how people are protesting against funding the NYPD , so I think we have to use our, whereas to describe or to acknowledge that there have been excellent number of calls made to define in my PD during this time period, and we focus on just acknowledging it and did making it more, maybe defining what the fun means we'd have to go into.
