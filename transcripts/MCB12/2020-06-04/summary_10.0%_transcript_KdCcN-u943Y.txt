I'm, hoping tonight that we can dive into some of those issues, hear concerns from community members about things that have conspired in our community as well as around the city, and hopefully the goal is to have some action steps and some next steps we can take as a community with their leaders and as a committee, to take to our full board and also to share our concerns with larger audiences meeting, is being recording So without further ado.
We did take two shootings, one on basic things and another one on June 1st and as far as I know, So you're, saying that the mayor asked the community to police themselves in the neighborhood, something Obviously , it's not the responsibility but local, but for people to for to police their communities, and it obviously we saw from the media covers that issue escalated and it became politically racially tense in a situation between african- american community members as well as those you know who live in the area from type in Dominicans and I thought that was instigated by the police force by Allah.
Are you going to do a resolution from the committee that calls on our electives to you know fully repeal 58, because if so, we would need to sort of have just a quick agreement on what the provisions would be and vote on.
How do we look at the NYPD budget and reallocate some of that funding to support some of the graffiti occurs from bid for businesses, support education, program?
A little concerned about suggesting coding or moving forms from one area to another when we do not have people who are sitting on the table to do that type of negotiation and making sure that the money goes to the right areas that we are that are needed.
I, believe that we do in this particular conversation is the reason why I do think that both of these resolutions repeal at fifty a and ways to reallocate the NYPD budget require a very specific view on them, especially in the case of the budget.
When it comes to the budget, and just give me about a minute to say this piece of it, I can definitely understand from folks how you know the phrase defund NYPD or anything like that, like Abolish, ice and stuff like that, can certainly be very polarizing, and it also seems like an absolute it's not an absolute when we say things: like.
It's exactly what Curtis said: there's better uses for the money than the hyper militarization of our police, for instance, and that's why it when it comes to you having a specific resolution for reallocation of the budget and really on all of this and think you saw me proposing that link.
So I just want to say that first and if anyone has a better marketing line than the two words of defund NYPD, I am one hot to present all ears, because that's what it's going to take and Councilmember Mark Levine did speak about his efforts to reallocate funding to other community- based programs and not to spend soft.
What support I'm, going to make sure that we're cognizant Maybe we can, the resolution can speak to equity and how those cuts would happen, because the reality is that there has been an increase over the last four or five years in the NYPD budget, and we want to ensure that when there is a cut that they're not cutting the black people that actually work at the lower end in regards to salary in the department and we're talking about, for example, the traffic, these safety officers, those to help the crossing guards.
Okay, not about budget equity, specifically All of the important points that we should include in this I think, including that term, specifically, though, would be great and really important, and perhaps not using language like defund NYPD, but sort of you know, reallocating funds and making sure that and showing our support or even occasion of funds, and so I guess I would be in support of having two separate resolutions.
We need people there with the proper mental health training that can deescalate And, so I think that we need to have the proper personnel and that does not exist with echo with salia, Singh It's a Reid effect redirecting funds to perhaps case manager, and there was a New York Times article about an opinion piece that was really great about region sort of social workers who could potentially respond instead of police officers Yes, they have a medical person, there, Thank, You, Sally, Maria, Luna, Maria.
What member now is there a second Is there motion on the floor to create a separate resolution of tackling the issue of budget equity?
So, when you're saying a resolution on budget equity and voting on that, I mean I'd like to see.
We would focus the language on a budget equity and the things that we throughout the meeting, particularly the issue of, maybe even looking at what Mark Levine is already advocated for advocating for reallocating funding to Healthcare Education housing.
There's a comment in the chat about restorative justice, training, which I think I would prefer seeing something like restorative justice initiatives, because I do not know that the police are the right people for that.
And I think it's also then easier for people who may have disagreements about this or that particular thing to unite behind the concept that when we say defund the NYPD, we're not talking about disbanding it all together and saying you know, It's saying that we're saying, as Nobles suggested earlier, that we have to have some equity and fairness in how that budgetary pie is sliced.
NYPD We should clarify that, because I think it's important to people the way that the folks on the committee put it makes a lot more sense.
We have the opportunity in this resolution, to talk about what that means and to kind of recapture that language and to say something like, whereas when people talk about defund, NYPD they're, not saying disband, it, they're saying spread the budgetary love so that we can pay for some of the other things that very necessary that go hand in hand with you, know: justice.
That's, going on to acknowledge how people are protesting against funding the NYPD And we focus on just acknowledging it and did making it more, maybe defining what the fun means we'd have to go into.
In terms of where that budget goes as a qualifier of quote, unquote, defunding, NYPD, You can I actually brought up restorative justice as something that needed to be funded in our community.
