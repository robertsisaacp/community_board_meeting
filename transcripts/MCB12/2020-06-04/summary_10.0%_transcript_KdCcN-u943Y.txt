Just bridging community engagement, okay, I, see Orlando from Carmody LaRosa's office is here I'm hoping tonight that we can dive into some of those issues, hear concerns from community members about things that have conspired in our community as well as around the city, and hopefully the goal is to have some action steps and some next steps we can take as a community with their leaders and as a committee to take to our full board and also to share our concerns with larger audiences meeting is being recording So. Without further ado, we usually run our meetings and with their updates from the local precinct, so I'm gonna turn it over to captain bellow to give us update from the thirty-third we're coordinating a plan, hopefully to quash whatever people problem.
It sounds very unfortunate and something that shouldn't be condoned, but yeah I just wanted to sort of say that for I know the pharmacy Royal pharmacy on 213 and Broadway was broken into, and the pharmacist made me aware that a bunch of other pharmacies and the neighbor had also been broken into What would be that specifically just businesses that are in the neighborhood, not just on Dyckman, because I saw a presence on Dyckman today how you mentioned that folks should report it PD So much from our committee members before we move on to our elected officials Yes, since the pandemic, it's Charlie Bello again, three As far as bicyclist in the three we really haven't had any problems since the pandemic started Obviously, because people are self quarantine again because the curfew has taken effect, but the pandemic sorted is being lessened.
You might be present concerning the budget Do a resolution from the committee that calls on our electives to you know fully repeal 58, because if so we would need to sort of have just a quick agreement on what the provisions would be and vote on it.
Like abolish ice and stuff like that, can certainly be very polarizing, and it also seems like an absolute it's not an absolute when we say things like It's, exactly what Curtis said: there's better uses for the money than the hyper militarization of our police, for instance, and that's why it when it comes to you having a specific resolution for reallocation of the budget and really on all of this and think you saw me proposing that link.
There is You Curtis for you're, inviting me to tonight's Public Safety Committee meeting I like to just say that to pretty much follow what Nobles were saying, which was remarkable in my opinion that we spend more money on policing, then our mental health services, affordable housing and youth programming combined right, so I think that when we're talking about defunding I can see how that can be.
The resolution can speak to equity and how those cuts would happen, because the reality is that there has been an increase over the last four or five years in the NYPD budget, and we want to ensure that when there is a cut that they're not cutting the black people that actually work at the lower end in regards to salary in the department and we're talking about, for example, the traffic these safety officers, those to help the crossing guards.
Okay, not about budget equity, specifically All of the important points that we should include in this I think including that term, specifically, though, would be great and really important, and perhaps not using language like defund NYPD, but sort of you know, reallocating funds and making sure that and showing our support or even occasion of funds, and so I guess I would be in support of having two separate resolutions: Fifty pieces of legislation that were mentioned by the other elected officials tonight in this one reso that addresses a bunch of those I mean I.
If we have an early where apis that talks about the moral imperative and a budget as an expression of our priorities than anything that might be missing from the very specific language is easily added in when, for example, community board 12 does its annual budget exercise Really good suggestion list connects up for our September budget and I think it's also then easier for people who may have disagreements about this, or that particular thing to unite behind the concept that when we say defund the NYPD, we're not talking about disbanding it all together and saying you know, fuck it We can work with this office to get some examples of what people have been saying and to help So. With that being said, Liz I would like to propose a motion that community board 12 You know with a number of where Rex is talking about our budgetary priorities in general and some of the efforts of our local elected officials, including feedback from constituents that we support NYPD, a reduction in the NYPD budget that allows for an increase in the budgets of some of the other programming and social investments in New York City that achieve our collective goals of equity, justice and fairness I'm a volunteer.
We should clarify that, because I think it's important to people the way that the folks on the committee put it makes a lot more sense and I think that the D fund is a hinderance We have the opportunity in this resolution to talk about what that means and to kind of recapture that language and to say something like, whereas when people talk about defund, NYPD they're, not saying disband it , they're saying spread the budgetary love so that we can pay for some of the other things that very necessary that go hand in hand with you, know: justice I think we should also include some of the language which Danielle had recommend a year and a half ago when we were doing our budget priorities, She had some very strong language recommendations on different kinds of programming, and those are the kinds of things that we're talking about here, like Social Work, like restorative justice, like transitional programs for people who are coming out of incarceration I think you should specify exactly when you defund one on one part: Where is the funding going on the other end?
That's going on to acknowledge how people are protesting against funding the NYPD, so I think we have to use our whereas to describe or to acknowledge that there have been excellent number of calls made to define in my PD during this time period, and we focus on just acknowledging it and did making it more, maybe defining what the fun means we'd have to go into.
