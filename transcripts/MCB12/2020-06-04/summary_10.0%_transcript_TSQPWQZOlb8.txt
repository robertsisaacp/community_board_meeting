Looking for all committee members to, let me know- The same thing is true: When I circulate to the committee reference information, there was some information that I circulated to the committee pertaining to both the BSA application that we'll be considering, but also the West 158 Street rowhouse district I think the resolution that the board passed years of I circulated that for reference, so that committee members, who are not committee members at the time, have some background on what we're talking.
First item is the consideration of a BSA application for the wind community music charter school, and this is an application that was presented to land use in February of this year.
We had a detailed conversation about that, I think it was last month for reference, the February committee minute, so that everyone who was not at the meeting had some background and also so that the members who were there since it is going back several months, could just refresh this is not you're.
The Community Board passed a resolution several years ago asking the Department of City Planning to rezone various c8 districts in Washington Heights in wood, because that zoning designation really does not allow for any residential development and a community facility cultural, the things that you know.
So we recommended that the applicants coordinate with our Health and Environment Committee, our traffic and Transportation Committee, and our youth and Education committee, so that those committees-- although this is really just asking for permission to put a school use in a CA district, those committees, would have interest.
All of those meetings took place in May, and so we then suggested that the applicants come back to us too, for us to more formally consider that so with that I turn the floor over to Richard LaBelle, who is counsel representing the applicant, as well as any of the members of the wind charter school who are present.
It, says I'm disabled We had very and productive meetings with the Health and Environment Committee traffic and transportation and youth and education.
You know there are many comments and a robust discussion about traffic about loading and unloading, about noise impacts both on the school and on the school in the surrounding area.
A lot of questions had a very good discussion and really you know all the all of the all of the committee and meetings were generally positive.
It was more about coordinating unloading and loading on the street because they also have buses, and you know, vehicles for people with special needs or handicapped individuals coming and unloading to the building.
When is that it uses El Sistema system of using music as a way of providing primary education to kids, in this case K through 5, and so all the kids go to have music twice a day and Then also the performance they learn instrument, starting in kindergarten I mean in first grade Never done one at this size that has a little theater, so the organization of the building is based on is sort of based around that on 80, underneath 1St Street.
You come in past the offices and reception and welcome area, and then on the street level is a 400 person, House theater that can house all that can stage a performance with all the kids downstairs are the rest of the music classrooms and then because the rear yard is lower than the street level, you can see Street here, there's two kindergarten classes which give them kind of direct access to the outdoor, which is helpful because they do not have as far to go to get to the recess space and moving up to the building.
Now, it's a tight gym, but for K through five school it provides a good space, for you know the active play and the curriculum that goes along with physical education, and that is in the back of the building and then moving down.
You know existing ambient noise levels, including noise associated with the FDNY vehicles, acrosss, the street, Then what we did was we looked at occupancy of each of these terraces and so that noise of the children playing is added on to that ambient noise to determine the level of basically the thickness of the windows and walls and the level of attenuation.
I did that analysis and we specified that attenuation level, and we also looked at the potential impact of students playing in these areas on adjacent buildings, and we looked at a number of different receptors and actually did a very detailed line- of- sight study to see how high each of these enclosures around the terraces need to be.
So we had actually, you know, collected data on the existing wind location and looked at where the students are reside and how the modes of travel in order to basically prepare a preliminary model of the number of vehicle.
We would be coordinating directly with them, and it's important to note that for an application like this as a threshold level, finding the school needs, we need to the environmental studies which support of the legal findings of this special permit.
Yeah 27% from the Bronx And it says, 70% reside in Manhattan, but, looking at your map , I mean it seems to be heavily concentrated in Upper Manhattan, right Can. You just describe the house how kids are selected for the school in that process, because it's very much focused on this area?
You know when we were in the building and then, though, they'll get like an inside look at everything and then also because all of our historic families are clustered in this area.
You know waited way to share about the work, and so our current families tell other families who also live on the same block, And I mean III, received some feedback from the youth and Education committee and from traffic and transportation, and so it was not clear from the comments from youth and education.
Is it correct and are you currently co- located in a public school building, correct, so you're, actually community- You're in a existing public, school You know kind of a touchy issue with a number of folks, But you're.
Actually, with this project moving out of the public school building into your own space.
Okay are there so for our new committee members who are present that would like to vote.
The next item on the agenda is an update on the West 158 Street grow house district, something that has been presented to the committee and the community board a couple times over the years and the parties involved.
When, the Audubon Park historic district, which is the base the residential buildings just north and west of the Audubon Terrace historic district, when that was being proposed by LPC back in I, think 2008 2009, the Land Use Committee and the Community board fully supported that.
Indicative of you know the kind of pre- war apartment buildings that were developed and a representative of the urbanization of Upper Manhattan, driven by the both the extension of the number one train, moving north and Riverside Drive being extended.
You know the committee and the Community board has really.
Vivian 2015/2016 Vivian noticed that there was some activity on the block and we were quite concerned about what might happen with that block, and so we had been sort of dormant and working on getting it added to the Audubon Park historic district.
I'm sure you know and say it right off the top of your head, but the folks in Albany, who are the coordinators for National Register status when they reviewed the Audubon, Terrace, Ark designation reports and then looked at this row.
Of course, the group, the grouping that should be included in a historic district, would have Audubon Terrace, Audubon Park and these row houses, but they subtracted a couple of apartment, buildings, 158th Street that are actually outside of the original historic over here and say: Oh you're, a compass of Suman, Terra, I , just let Paulo know the whole conversation was being blasted, so Vivian.
Is the cultural history of that particular block in relation to the Audubon, Park, historic district, and also in contrast to it one of the things that we did not include, and actually we did not know, If it's okay for me to plug my book, I will I have look on the Audubon Park coming out in September.
Rentals had been, as the decades were, on the area adjacent in the Audubon Park neighborhood or the apartment buildings was undergoing the same sort of urban blight that many cities in the United States were, but something really remarkable began to happen on west under 58th Street, and that was that african- American families began to buy the homes and to convert them back from these multi- family home single occupancy, residence.
I wonder if any of the committee members particularly committee members who are seeing this for the first time, have any questions or comments, and if you so, you would have to unmute yourself, And I think the research that has led to more information on the cultural significance of the area of certainly you know, builds on the argument for designation.
