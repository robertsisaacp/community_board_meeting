Looking for all committee members to, let me know- The same thing is true: When I circulate to the committee reference information, there was some information that I circulated to the committee pertaining to both the BSA application that we'll be considering, but also the West 158 Street rowhouse district I think the resolution that the board passed years of I circulated that for reference, so that committee members, who are not committee members at the time, have some background on what we're talking.
First item is the consideration of a BSA application for the wind community music charter school, and this is an application that was presented to land use in February of this year.
We had a detailed conversation about that I think it was last month for reference, the February committee minute, so that everyone who was not at the meeting had some background and also so that the members who were there since it is going back several months, could just refresh this is not you're.
The community board passed a resolution several years ago asking the Department of City Planning to rezone various c8 districts in Washington Heights in wood, because that zoning designation really does not allow for any residential development and a community facility cultural, the things that you know.
Think both the traffic studies and the environmental studies were not complete, so we recommended that the applicants coordinate with our Health and Environment Committee, our traffic and Transportation Committee, and our youth and education committee, so that those committees-- although this is really just asking for permission to put a school use in a CA district, those committees-- would have interest.
All of those meetings took place in May, and so we then suggested that the applicants come back to us too, for us to more formally consider that so with that I turn the floor over to Richard LaBelle, who is counsel representing the applicant, as well as any of the members of the wind charter school, who are present.
I think I would turn it over to Amanda who attended all the meetings and kind of guide some of the various team members and professionals that we have regarding the consideration of the factors than the special permit sure rule , so we're joined by Tom Glock project, architect.
A lot of questions had a very good discussion and really you know all the all of the all of the committee and meetings were generally positive.
It was more about coordinating unloading and loading on the street because they also have buses, and you know, vehicles for people with special needs or handicapped individuals coming and unloading to the building.
You can see Street here, there's two kindergarten classes which give them kind of direct access to the outdoor, which is helpful because they don't have as far to go, to get to the recess space and moving up to the building.
Now, it's a tight gym, but for K through five school it provides a good space, for you know the active play and the curriculum that goes along with physical education, and that is in the back of the building and then moving down.
We've tried to create these kind of core areas and both stairs and the elevator access that so, whether it's someone who needs to use a little bit or on a teacher or staff or admin or students, obviously, and Statement, our air quality noise and hazardous materials and transportation, so health and environment.
You know existing ambient noise levels, including noise associated with the FDNY vehicles across the street, Then what we did was we looked at occupancy of each of these terraces and so that noise of the children playing is added on to that ambient noise to determine the level of basically the thickness of the windows and walls and the level of attenuation.
I did that analysis and we specified that attenuation level, and we also looked at the potential impact of students playing in these areas on adjacent buildings, and we looked at a number of different receptors and actually did a very detailed line-of-sight study to see how high each of these enclosures around the terraces need to be.
We had actually, you know, collected data on the existing wind location and looked at where the students are reside and how the modes of travel in order to basically prepare a preliminary model of the number of vehicle.
We would be coordinating directly with them, and it's important to note that for an application like this as a threshold level, finding the school needs, we need to the environmental studies which support of the legal findings of this special permit.
Yeah 27% from the Bronx And it says, 70% reside in Manhattan, but looking at your map , I mean it seems to be heavily concentrated in Upper Manhattan, right Can. You just describe the house how kids are selected for the school in that process, because it's very much focused on this area?
You know when we were in the building and then, though, they'll, get like an inside look at everything and then also because all of our historic families are clustered in this area.
You know waited way to share about the work, and so our current families tell other families who also live on the same block, and The word I'm, assuming you shared all of this with the youth and education committee, I mean III, received some feedback from the youth and education committee and from traffic and transportation, and so it wasn't clear from the comments from youth and education.
Actually, with this project moving out of the public school building into your own space.
So for our new committee members, who are present that would like to vote.
The next item on the agenda is an update on the West 158 Street grow house district, something that has been presented to the committee and the community board a couple times over the years and the parties involved.
When the Audubon Park historic district, which is the base, the residential buildings just north and west of the Audubon Terrace historic district, when that was being proposed by LPC back in I, think 2008 2009, the Land Use Committee and the community board fully supported that.
Indicative of you know the kind of pre-war apartment buildings that were developed and a representative of the urbanization of Upper Manhattan, driven by the both the extension of the number one train, moving north and Riverside Drive being extended.
Looking at the that, you know urbanization above Manhattan You know the committee and the community board has really.
Is, the cultural history of that particular block in relation to the Audubon, Park, historic district, and also, in contrast to it, one of the things that we didn't include, and actually we didn't know.
Rentals had been, as the decades were, on the area adjacent in the Audubon Park neighborhood or the apartment buildings was undergoing the same sort of urban blight that many cities in the United States were, but something really remarkable began to happen on west under 58th Street, and that was that african-american families began to buy the homes and to convert them back from these multi-family home single occupancy residence, a single room, I couldn't see.
I, wonder if any of the committee members particularly committee members who are seeing this for the first time, have any questions or comments, and if you so, you would have to unmute yourself, And I think the research that has led to more information on the cultural significance of the area of certainly you know, builds on the argument for designation.
