There are a handful that you know regularly provide their comments, but I'm really looking for all committee members to let me know- The same thing is true: When I circulate to the committee reference information, there was some information that I circulated to the committee pertaining to both the BSA application that we'll be considering, but also the West 158 Street rowhouse district I think the resolution that the board passed years of I circulated that for reference, so that committee members, who are not committee members at the time, have some background on what we're talking about On the same page.
This is for a special permit to allow a school or school use to be placed in a building that has c8 zoning and the CH zoning is, you know, simply put something that it's really more automotive focused and I also mentioned in at that time, and at last month's meeting and then circulated for reference to the committee.
A zoning doesn't allow, and this is a perfect example where you cannot build a school in a c8 district That is the reason why this project needs a BSA special permit At that time, I think both the traffic studies and the environmental studies were not complete, so we recommended that the applicants coordinate with our Health and Environment Committee, our traffic and Transportation Committee and our youth and education committee, so that those committees-- although this is really just asking for permission to put a school use in a CA district, those committees, would have interest.
All of those meetings took place in May, and so we then suggested that the applicants come back to us too, for us to more formally consider that so with that I turn the floor over to Richard LaBelle, who is counsel representing the applicant, as well as any of the members of the wind charter school who are present You Wayne good evening, thanks to the committee for having us here again as we've discussed, This is a special permit.
It says I'm, disabled We had very and productive meetings with the Health and Environment Committee traffic and transportation and youth and education You know there are many comments and a robust discussion about traffic about loading and unloading, about noise impacts both on the school and on the school in the surrounding area.
More specifically with the senior centers It was more about coordinating, unloading and loading on the street because they also have buses, and you know, vehicles for people with special needs or handicapped individuals coming and unloading to the building.
We worked up plans on the way down, so on the very top floor, you'd still do have an outdoor recreation space, so this is programmed for recess and just kind of the stairs in circulation and shaft space, and then there is a gymnasium up here: Now it's a tight gym, but for K through five school it provides a good space, for you know the active play and the curriculum that goes along with physical education, and that is in the back of the building and then moving down.
You know existing ambient noise levels, including noise associated with the FDNY vehicles across the street and we also looked at the potential impact of students playing in these areas on adjacent buildings, and we looked at a number of different receptors and actually did a very detailed line-of-sight study to see how high each of these enclosures around the terraces need to be Is. There areas that we would have to restrict access for students, which was the case here and or to ensure that there would be no adverse impact to any of the surrounding?
It would be great if you could also send us this information because it looks like it was presented to youth and education, but this would be good reference, Yeah 27% from the Bronx, and it says, 70% reside in Manhattan, but looking at your map , I mean it seems to be heavily concentrated in Upper Manhattan You just describe the house how kids are selected for the school in that process, because it's very much focused on this area?
it's from the youth of education presentation We gave on five eleven mm-hmm and just before we, you know sometimes I have to remind myself in the rest of the committee that we are land-use We are not land-use and everything else, but the school is currently located in Washington, Heights and you're on a hundred and sixty fourth Street Is it correct and are you currently co-located in a public school building?
It will I'd like to make a motion to support the special permit, so it's moved by Vivian A second I can set I'm actually on the committee, so just so everyone, and particularly for the new community board members The way.
I don't feel have enough in front of one to oppose, but I don't feel I have enough information to also vote So that closes out the discussion of the special permit for BSA The next step is the committee's resolution will be presented to the full board at the general meeting, which I believe is the fourth Tuesday of this month and if the full board adopts that becomes the official position and that resolution will then go out to BSA the when music school team should email the office You know, probably just during public session two to talk about that.
The next item on the agenda is an update on the West 158 Street grow house district, something that has been presented to the committee and the community board a couple times over the years and the parties involved.
Who is a committee member and Mathews Beatty, who happens to be one of my name and Matthew was one of the many local residents who was When the Audubon Park historic district, which is the base, the residential buildings just north and west of the Audubon Terrace historic district when that was being proposed by LPC back in I, think 2008 2009, the Land Use Committee and the community board fully supported that Indicative of you know the kind of pre-war apartment buildings that were developed and a representative of the urbanization of Upper Manhattan, driven by the both the extension of the number one train, moving north and Riverside Drive being extended, If you're.
Talking about this is amazing, oasis in the middle of urbanizing New York, and there was also this sort of four page manifesto by Balch in himself and Bolton was the resident of 636 and he was an archaeologist of Upper Manhattan They looked quite a family and Bolton to this idea of creating a cooperative that actually owned Now the parking lot That shows that Bailey spoke at who, whose family owned six thirty West.
