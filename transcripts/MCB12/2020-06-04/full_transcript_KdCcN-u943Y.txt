But obviously this has been a very challenging time for our country, for the world and for our community. You know, as we watch protests to develop, wrote you know. Our community must really stand together in solidarity. All forensic against all forms of injustice and ending of discrimination- we are a community has built stronger because our city I spent and the calls to bring an to acts of violence I'm in our community and communities of color around the world. We have to do that together. I mean nothing. Lot of events have happened over the last 24 hours that were concerning. We can find a way to protect our businesses and who have worked hard, maintaining their establishments that maintain their safety, but we have to find a way to do that is not in a race charge way. You know. Lastly, I want to say we must not forget what protesting it's okay to voice our concerns in a variety of way, but we almost. We must remember the reason why people are posted to protesting and that's because a black man was killed and lost his life. Recently, there's been thousands of others who have gone through the same situation, so we are protesting for that particular reason. We know that looting is a is a another way. Another thing that is a byproduct of protesting, but in as we condone looting, we must also remember why people are protesting and try our best to understand that root, evil that exists and do whatever we can as a community as a board as a community to stand together against all acts of injustice and discrimination. I've said my piece, my committee members, please take a moment to introduce yourselves.

Okay, great and I believe we have two representatives from the precincts 33rd and could you please introduce yourselves captain Charlie Bello commanding officer the 33rd precinct all right? Well, thank you all once again for joining us. It is a very challenging time, as we know around our city, our country and around the world, and we to tackle the complex issues of systemic inequalities around this country. I'm hoping tonight that we can dive into some of those issues, hear concerns from community members about things that have conspired in our community as well as around the city, and hopefully the goal is to have some action steps and some next steps we can take as a community with their leaders and as a committee, to take to our full board and also to share our concerns with larger audiences meeting, is being recording and so I'm hoping that we have Peter. Please join again to pose questions in the chat box. So without further ado we usually run our meetings and with their updates from the local precinct, so I'm gonna turn it over to captain bellow to give us update from the thirty-third I'll get up to noon captain below again so far, we haven't really had any other issues that other boroughs and other pre since I've been having. We got into looting. We have me several apprehensions regarding burglaries, which we've been spiking all years in all year. In regards from couple of nights ago, there was a pharmacy that was burglarized what we were able to make an apprehension, and there was a firearm that was recovered they're targeting establishments like t-mobile spots or pharmacies for the most part anything that they could try to get their hands on. We do have information. There is something that is supposed to unfold tonight in the calm front of the three four specifically dike meant so I reached out to the commanding officer the three four we're coordinating a plan, hopefully to quash whatever people problem. There are between individuals but as of now, like I, said all the problems that you know man hand, South, Brooklyn, Queens I've been having we really haven't been experiencing in Manhattan north. Thank you. Are there we'll go to the 3/4 under report first and then next in the world, fools questions through the captains, the development we do have you know in power and we covered diamond school. It's been an issue that also with tackled, so we have record at all times, especially ethical concern. We did take two shootings, one on basic things and another one on June 1st and as far as I know the whole time we've been down for the year and in burglaries for the burglaries I. Have the I give the guys the locations where we have and I what they're doing that we could diminish our Daquan say at anything else. We just we just been focusing on the what's going on in the country right now. Okay, thank you both for giving the update on from your precincts. You know, I do think that there are a lot of concerns. Pretty I have concerns, particularly the events that unfolded on Dyckman yesterday evening. You know my perspective. It seems as if you know they were. You know you know, sort of their own hands themselves. So you're saying that the mayor asked the community to police themselves in the neighborhood, something they would I. Think that there were. You know, obviously it's not the responsibility but local, but for people to for to police their communities and it obviously we saw from the media covers that issue escalated and it became politically racially tense in a situation between african-american community members as well as those you know who live in the area from type in Dominicans and I thought that was instigated by the police force by Allah. Knowing you know, people to police themselves, so I know that everyone's under pressure there may be resource issues, but it seems it seems to me to be hydrant appropriate and it was a situation that escalated. That did not need to happen and I think that the situation you know is from what I saw in the video footage was authorized by the brother by the NYPD. The video showed there was the commanding officer there, giving them directions on how to differentiate themselves from others who may be out after curfew. Know it's captain below three again. So some of the things that we've been experiencing in the three is that the property owners or business owners are actually safeguarding their own property. So you know they're at their business establishment, they're, basically in front if they do see something that is suspicious, they'll call number one and we response that tends to get a faster response, as opposed to, if they're, not in their property waiting for either ten eleven alarm to show up and the police or police presence responding. So I guess this is might be what some of the issues of the three people were experiencing, because that's something that we're seeing in the three I mean to be honest with you. I will commit another violence per se, but I'm keeping an eye on their establishment if they do see something the instructions I'm, providing it corn I'm on one right away and then will show up as opposed to them, not being there the next thing in the morning their place got. It are burglarized, I! Think I'll stop. After this final statement, you know I, don't think we're in opposition to business owners protecting their business. They work hard to protect those businesses, but the problem is when there are groups of people deliberately going after people walking on the street and they're not associated with businesses. I think that is the difference that I saw so I think that is something we have to be cognizant of. We can continue to encourage people to protect their property. We should do that. We should encourage people as a community as community leaders to call the precincts and call 9-1-1 when there are issues, but I have to walk it's a very thin line between deputizing folks from the community to do the job that we feel should be done about the NYPD. That's my only concern. Are there any concerns by the committee members? I could speak on this particular issue before we turn it over to our elected officials. You know I I'm, not familiar with the event that you're referring to Curtis, but I will say that I did in the event yesterday by uplift. In my sleep, which has been doing a lot of positive work in the uptown community and the whole was to just provide additional reporter businesses and to try to protect the neighborhood, and but here we were saying but I do think that the that the that the it was sort of a positive there was a the goal of just traditional support to businesses. But I not familiar with that video and I'm not familiar with what happened. It sounds very unfortunate and something that shouldn't be condoned, but yeah I just wanted to sort of say that and then I guess I'm just one. It's a 3 and 3/4 I guess mostly the 3/4, because I live in Inwood. So I'm from the fact that pharmacies- and apparently there has been a string of pharmacies that have been broken into I- was just wondering if you could speak to that. Just what's being done there yeah I, know for I know the pharmacy Royal pharmacy on 213 and Broadway was broken into, and the pharmacist made me aware that a bunch of other pharmacies and the neighbor had also been broken into so I just wondered. If you, what would be that specifically just businesses that are in the neighborhood, not just on Dyckman, because I saw a presence on Dyckman today how you mentioned that folks should report it PD. Should they just call 3-1-1 I mean sorry 9-1-1, or are you providing a direct line to your precinct or what yeah? So if you could just speak to those things called our was uptick in burglaries, I believe that we have the same issue the last the last time you spoke, so it's like something we've been combating on one issue already. Thank you. So much from our committee members before we move on to our elected officials, I mean I think that this is not pressing, but I just wondered about any of it on drag-racing. You know protecting bicyclists, just like other. Yes, since the pandemic, it's Charlie Bello again, three, we really haven't had a spike or any issues when it comes to bicyclists or more roving bands. Since the new curfew was implemented. To be honest with, you, I think it's very effective and it's been very helpful for us to be able to come back and differentiate, those that are protesting, I, guess legally, and those are this only for looting. So as far as bicyclist in the three we really haven't had any problems since the pandemic started. Obviously because people are self quarantine again because the curfew has taken effect, but the pandemic sorted is being lessened. However, we've been instructing the officers, one be back wall and guys that will alleviate the bicyclist having less issues to go around. We don't really have a lot of lanes, I've seen more length that I've been here, but the one that we have, which one out this perspective. Okay, alright, this time, we'll take a few questions from our community members. If there are any questions for the office crunch, okay, so Danielle is there order. We have four questions. My points are not quick or happen. If you have a question, please acknowledge you, don't show so we'll start with Sally. You have a question. I guess I find the thirty-fourth reports very shocking, given what has been going on there on our community there's, especially on the east side of Broadway. There's a lot of all night partying going on outside and I know the arrow wasn't under curfew, but these are things that you know social distancing wasn't being observed. People were being kept up all night, so they're there a lot of complaints and there's a lot of complaints about the drag racing and then in particular, I wanted to know, given that there was big heads up because there's stuff all over social media yesterday exacerbating the situation at Dyckman I, wonder how you prepare for something like that. When you say you know, business owner can call me there and what's the plan, if you clear so we have okay, I guess I. Can you explain to me what the presence of a car does to stop things? I mean when I hear from the resident is the car is there you might have your sirens on then they just turn the music louder. So I mean it's community is thinking that you're not really solving the problem. You might be present concerning the budget. I know just a procedural follow-up. So are we going to? Are you gonna? Do a resolution from the committee that calls on our electives to you know fully repeal 58, because if so, we would need to sort of have just a quick agreement on what the provisions would be and vote on it. Then it can go to the full board for packets later this month. Most certainly I would like to see if we can move with the conversation on the funding, because perhaps there is a way to do a larger resolution that tackles several of the issues that we discussed tonight, or we can figure out a way to just do two resolutions. One on funding, so I would like to just open the floor up to conversate your comments on of my people in my PD funding issue, and if we felt as a committee that it was appropriate to somehow do a resolution to link all those issues- Mertes, yes, no, yes, it's great I think Graham wanted to jump in Graham was that you yeah go for it. I'll go after you full repeal of 50a and writing resolution on that. With the issue of defunding, you know I I'm, not a hundred percent on board with that part of it is because I don't fully. You know, I read some of the articles and it feels like it's a kind of a blunt tool to use. So you know I would like to learn more about it and right at this time. I. Just don't I, don't know interested hear what other people say. You know I, think that word, if on the phone is misleading, I think what a city council member mark levine mentioned, that it really is reallocating some of the funding. You know, there's been in equality in our proposed budget cuts. You know the city obviously is experiencing huge deficits, so we've seen programs like education, for example- there's been like I, don't know two hundred and thirty seven million dollars to be cut from education program, but only 24 million from NYPD budget. So we're looking at the budget looking at this defunding issue as like to say: well, how do you budgetary equity for the most part? How do you provide for? How do you consider- maybe you know, keeping things like their Street graffiti genes that we definitely need now? You know now that you know we didn't talk about that yet, but the team under an NYC Department of Economic Development, that's completely cut. That was a 2.5 million dollar, a line-item that, as we see now as a byproduct of protest, there's a lot of graffiti happening all over the city and there's no city funding to support businesses who may need to clean up their business they're building. So how do we look at the NYPD budget and reallocate some of that funding to support some of the graffiti occurs from bid for businesses support education program? We advocate for domestic violence last month, so it's more so not defunding, but really allocating towards programs. That's gonna make the community stronger, so I will start I, see two hands three hands: actually Maria Luna, followed by nobles Crawford, and then we will go to our non committee, members, I'm, Sean and then Johanna Maria. Can you hear me now I'm a little concern about talking about a coding from here I'm moving from there when, with music there we go? Okay, come I'm, sorry I'm, a little concerned about suggesting coding or moving forms from one area to another, when we don't have people who are sitting on the table to do that type of negotiation and making sure that the money goes to the right areas that we are that are needed. So I think that we have to be very careful about talking. You know we saw enough information after what is a benefit from the funding, especially the police, deparment, so just kind of refocus on the question that you posed to us Curtis. Should we be treating these as two separate resolutions? I believe that we do in this particular conversation is the reason why I do think that both of these resolutions repeal at fifty a and ways to reallocate the NYPD budget require a very specific view on them, especially in the case of the budget. Now, when it comes to the budget, and just give me about a minute to say this piece of it, I can definitely understand from folks how you know the phrase defund NYPD or anything like that. Like abolish ice and stuff like that, can certainly be very polarizing, and it also seems like an absolute it's not an absolute when we say things like. Do you find the NYPD? It's exactly what Curtis said: there's better uses for the money than the hyper militarization of our police, for instance, and that's why it when it comes to you having a specific resolution for reallocation of the budget and really on all of this and think you saw me proposing that link. All of this falls underneath the umbrella of budget justice in NYC. Where is the money going to help our safety net services and our civil services? First right? It's all budget justice. So, yes, we need to be very strategic about what it is. We put our support behind as a community board when it comes to where this money is reallocated, and so that will definitely require a conversation, but I also don't think it's not something we shouldn't take up. It's very important, so I just want to say that first and if anyone has a better marketing line than the two words of defund NYPD, I am one hot to present all ears, because that's what it's going to take and just an Maria I just want to add. Earlier we had all of our elected officials on prior to you joining and councilmember Mark Levine did speak about his efforts to reallocate funding to other community-based programs and not to spend soft there is. There was someone speaking about the tube who has attacked it from a budgetary legislative perspective, so we're going to move over to Sean, followed by Johanna John, you're muted good evening everyone. My name is Sean Thank You Curtis for you're, inviting me to tonight's Public Safety Committee meeting I like to just say that to pretty much follow what Nobles were saying, which was remarkable in my opinion that we spend more money on policing, then our mental health services, affordable housing and youth programming combined right, so I think that when we're talking about defunding I can see how that can be, and you know every word for many, but keep in mind that, if we're just saying reduce the NYPD's budget by a million influences, that is not eliminating the NYPD, in fact we're simply restoring them to where they operated to 2013 and 2014, and it would also provide a lot of benefits for our youth, which I think is very important, and so it's really not as radical as people say. It's just that we have to reflect a budget that represents justice, and that represents the interest and needs of our you do that. Thank you. Thank you, our assistant chair, danielle, joanna personally. When we're looking and being very surgical and the funding, I might be peeing again defund. My TV is basically a hashtag to get people's attention and look a little closer at the inequities of how the city prioritizes who was going to budget and what agency is going to get. What support I'm going to make sure that we're cognizant and maybe we can, the resolution can speak to equity and how those cuts would happen, because the reality is that there has been an increase over the last four or five years in the NYPD budget, and we want to ensure that when there is a cut that they're not cutting the black people that actually work at the lower end in regards to salary in the department and we're talking about, for example, the traffic these safety officers, those to help the crossing guards, the majority of them are women of color, and if the NYPD, like any other agency, is asked to take a cut, they're gonna. Look there first. So when we ask for someone to agency to make a cut, we also have to look for justice and equity in those cuts. So I think that resolution should speak to that. Thank you very much see. Maria I. Think that also kind of goes back to what you were saying. We are not budget analysts we're not trying to analyze the budget, we're trying to make your statement on equity, so I think Johanna made a very good point of whatever the resolution ends up being, it seems like we're aiming towards two different resolutions: one on budget equity and on CCRB. So are there any other comments about these? The two issues separately, I think we've exhausted. We don't we I think we pretty much agree on CCRB. You just need a motion and then we need to either oh wait a minute. Danielle didn't you know my assistant cher. Has a question? Has a comment on budget equity? Can you hear me? Yes? Okay, not about budget equity, specifically and I feel like you've said. Everybody's mostly already mentioned. All of the important points that we should include in this I think including that term, specifically, though, would be great and really important, and perhaps not using language like defund NYPD, but sort of you know, reallocating funds and making sure that and showing our support or even occasion of funds, and so I guess I would be in support of having two separate resolutions. Fifty pieces of legislation that were mentioned by the other elected officials tonight in this one reso that addresses a bunch of those I mean I. Don't know people have strong feelings about 50 a spending alone, but you think we could perhaps have one reso that addresses a number of those legislation item together and then separately this Arezzo on the reallocation of funds. If that encouraged and Danielle I have a comment, you know, Danielle was super sweet since because it's the there seem to be efforts to work. It knows it's collectively at the state level. There's a package of let goes from black and Latino caucus and the city level, as well as a statement, so it may make sense, look at some of the existing resolutions and what's happening, I'm there and maybe lumping CCR hate getting with that and keeping the budget equity separate. So I agree with you on that package of ten items which are all addressed: police reform and so I think it'd be really great to sort of have all of those things together because it ultimately fifty a is getting at. You know more transparency, it ultimately be police reform, more accountability and so I think they so I think we are one quick comment: ok, yes, Sally redirecting to community-based programs, but specifically with regard to people with mental illness and responding to calls for mostly disturbed persons. We need to have the proper personnel accompanying the police to those occasions. We you know, I have a friend that was actually killed by the police. We need police when someone with mental illness is dealing with the police having a policeman. There tends to escalate the situation. We need people there with the proper mental health training that can deescalate and so I think that we need to have the proper personnel and that does not exist with echo with salia, Singh and I think Shawn and elected official attention. That is, it's a Reid effect redirecting funds to perhaps case manager, and there was a New York Times article about an opinion piece that was really great about region sort of social workers who could potentially respond instead of police officers so yeah they need to respond together. Yes, they have a medical person there, Thank You, Sally, Maria, Luna Maria. Very briefly, I won't be able to vote on the resolution and I'm being interviewing another channel right now. I have to be on about two minutes. So I'm. Sorry, I am no. You know I'm getting my responsibility, my priorities, also in line. So thank you very much Maria. Thank you. We don't have a motion. Yes, I, don't know the mode. The two resolutions yet as I also have to make people understand that I'm older. Also, the proceeding of the 33rd Community Council, so I have to be very careful how I vote I have to analyze every step regarding any police matter. Thank You Maria touch I'll. Send you the minister by email Maria. Thank you. So without you know, I think I did have Street graffiti I mentioned that briefly. You know, there's that budgetary issue I think it requires much discussion I'm. So is there a motion on the floor? Our resolutions in support of the repeal da Rosa proposed for her police reform. Also mullah Veen mentioned a couple of items from this city about fools. Could you can we do two separate motions? We need. We need to have two separate motions. So there's a motion. First on the preview check with the purse, emotion, which is the CCRB it's for the rapini, but all ones that quick motion. Ok, second, so there's a motion on the floor: well not on the floor in support of community board public safety committee supporting a full repeal of 50 I. Second, that motion. Thank you all committee members in favor, all right, scram aye! Do you have quorum? Yes, Maria is not a part of our committee or our now for our general board members, Sally Fisher I brought third eye Tanya there, any additional board members to Bianca yes use of kolinsky. Are you still here, yeah I'm, abstaining on this one I'm stating okay. Thank you! Okay! So now we checked with the first resolution, pass it to committee level, four yeah for committee members of support, and we have six committee members, it's a general court members and support and one abstain. What member now is there a second now can we look forward with the next motion? Is there motion on the floor to create a separate resolution of tackling the issue of budget equity? My the first resolution my proposal earlier was to include 50 a and also supporting Carmen de la Rose police reform package and that same four Rezo. Yes, that was my understanding when I voted in favor, okay, clear to everybody, yes, I'll, make sure that's in the minutes that we understand will be what the vote was already. Can you just clarify something Curtis? So when you're saying a resolution on budget equity and voting on that, I mean I'd like to see. What's how the resolution is worded so do we ultimately approve that or well we can. We can discuss a few of the components, other position now to be included on those general components and we'll draft you between now, our general body meeting I'll certainly can circulate the draft in progress. If there's a motion in this approve a draft of the resolution prior to in getting to the general body meeting of this, you me I'm partial body meeting: that's how the process would work. It is a complex issue. It is a we would focus the language on a budget equity and the things that we throughout the meeting, particularly the issue of maybe even looking at what Mark Levine is already advocated for advocating for reallocating funding to healthcare education, housing, youth programs such as SYEP Mark Levine, also mentioned a funding. Cut of excuse me ASAP program, so those are things that we would include in budget equity. It would be, you know, really looking at it as a as a statement of you know from our board saying that we're not you know we're not saying cut their budget, we're saying, allocated reprioritize their budget. There's a comment in the chat about restorative justice, training, which I think I would prefer seeing something like restorative justice initiatives, because I don't know that the police are the right people for that. Just like I, don't like the mental health. First aid training, that's being done with the police, the people we need other alternatives, I guess also. You know, I never brought up a good point earlier about. Well, what are they reallocating from you know and where those cuts going to be coming from you know, because we don't want them so buying military gear. You know and funding some of the things we think they should be funding with still purchasing and doing these things that they shouldn't be doing and then cutting. You know people salaried workers, so that's a concern, and how do we address that? Yes, so yes, there's restorative justice, training in our box. There's balance our priorities in our chat box. Yes, I think it's also important to just note that a that a budget, whether it's an institution or an organization's budget or a government's budget, reflects the priorities and the values of the organization or the society whose budget it is and that our recommendations would flow from that. And that way, if there's anything that, because there are so many components: healthcare, education, Social, Work, restorative justice, summer, youth, employment, it runs the gamut if we have an early where apis that talks about the moral imperative and a budget as an expression of our priorities than anything that might be missing from the very specific language is easily added in when, for example, community board 12 does its annual budget exercise. So you know these things are all of a piece and I think if we try and get super specific on exact numbers of dollars from here or to there, we get way in the weeds. But if we talk about this as a document of our priorities, then it it's a little bit easier to build consensus around that yeah. Really good suggestion list connects up for our September budget. You know, process exactly and I think it's also then easier for people who may have disagreements about this or that particular thing to unite behind the concept that when we say defund the NYPD, we're not talking about disbanding it all together and saying you know fuck it we don't need cops. No, it's saying that we're saying, as Nobles suggested earlier, that we have to have some equity and fairness in how that budgetary pie is sliced. So you can make a motion to dodge wanna make another statement. I'm councilmember Levine made it very clear that he's received thousands and thousands of calls on this particular issue. I think that's insane! It's not I'm like we have a rationale. We can work with this office to get some examples of what people have been saying and to help. You know draft the language and maybe include other advocacy efforts that she's already been a part of on this particular issue. So with that being said, Liz I would like to propose a motion that community board 12. You know with a number of where Rex is talking about our budgetary priorities in general and some of the efforts of our local elected officials, including feedback from constituents that we support NYPD, a reduction in the NYPD budget that allows for an increase in the budgets of some of the other programming and social investments in New, York City that achieve our collective goals of equity, justice and fairness. Second, that that's perfect! Thank you very much. Oh wait. I'm a volunteer, so there is a motion from Liz and has been seconded by Nobles all in favor. Please state your preference committee members. Yes Graham yeah I, but I'd like to just add that in whereas is it possible, the term defund NYPD I just think is very problematic and I think. Maybe we should clarify that, because I think it's important to people the way that the folks on the committee put it makes a lot more sense and I think that the D fund is a hinderance. No I actually I agree with Graham, which is why I disagree with nobles I. Think that, whether we like it or not and frankly, I don't defund NYPD is going to continue to be a hash tag. So we have the opportunity in this resolution, to talk about what that means and to kind of recapture that language and to say something like, whereas when people talk about defund, NYPD they're, not saying disband it, they're saying spread the budgetary love so that we can pay for some of the other things that very necessary that go hand in hand with you know: justice. Yes, it's an it's a teachable moment and I think we should grab it. I think we should also include some of the language which Danielle had recommend a year and a half ago when we were doing our budget priorities. She had some very strong language recommendations on different kinds of programming and those are the kinds of things that we're talking about here, like Social Work, like restorative justice, like transitional programs for people who are coming out of incarceration. You know all of that. Solis I think you should specify exactly when you defund one on one part: where is the funding going on the other end? You should specify that, because right now, the way it is right now when you say they found NYPD, it sounds horrible, so a little too into the weeds. If we say you know we're gonna take a million dollars from here and put a million dollars. There I think that, as long as we say something general like when we say defund, we don't mean disband all together, we mean shape a budget that funds some of these other things out. Those other things up in here I think that the goal is to acknowledge the movement. That's going on to acknowledge how people are protesting against funding the NYPD, so I think we have to use our, whereas to describe or to acknowledge that there have been excellent number of calls made to define in my PD during this time period, and we focus on just acknowledging it and did making it more, maybe defining what the fun means we'd have to go into we're advocating for defunding. We have to just acknowledge it. I believe in a whereas I think, this'll solve our solve our issue and also OSI and also OSI when Liz was talking about earlier with the quote-unquote defund. She also qualified that, with making the budget more fair according to the needs of the community, and therefore we can fill in what those details are, as the conversation evolves, but I think that giving us the blanket umbrella term of the needs of the community in terms of where that budget goes as a qualifier of quote-unquote, defunding, NYPD I, think that gives us a catch-all. Okay, are you jump in here really quick and talk about what I was on? You can I actually brought up restorative justice as something that needed to be funded in our community? We did. We were successful in getting a highly ranked by the board we requested, but so I think we should find out status of what has happened with that to see if the city has responded in kind or if there needs to be follow-up and then maybe include language related to that in this Raziel. Thank you very much. I want to jump in I feel strongly about, including first of all, Thank You Liz, for what you for your comments, because there was an item last year in the public that came from the Public Safety Committee about adding additional police officers and we modified it shoe include or to say, police training and specifically for a mental health homelessness. Since youth and so I think my feelings would be to include some of those sort of general buckets and not maybe get so into the weeds, but include things like Sally mentioned. Mental health, homelesses substance use I. Think also for folks who have been formally incarcerated since are a huge target, especially folks who are continued to remain on parole. So that would be my cue again. Danielle I just want to make sure that this is not what I'm advocating for is not mental health training for policemen I'm advocating for people with mental health, expertise. Okay, my good work Liv had referenced the item last year. I totally agree with it: I'm not referring to police training I'm, referring specifically to mental health programming, so it seems like we were. We were so we have yes, so you have a motion. There's a second on the on the floor. Danielle said yes, Graham have said yes Gabby and said: yes, our other board members Liz, yes, Sally, yes, Oh see, I need to read it. I'm sorry, I, just jump in on to the meeting like seven minutes ago. I think it's unfair to just vote right now and yes, it's abstaining on this one. Thank you very much. We are both of our resolutions. Passed, I'll, work up, I'll, start draft language. You will share with the committee within the next two weeks. These are your large resolutions and they're gonna be very complex, so I would love to get you put along the way as I begin to draft them Daniel. Oh I'm, sure we always work together on these, so I'll make sure that we started a shared dock. We collaborate with. That being said, I have our last agenda item is summer schedule you know. Obviously we are in a very time period: I, don't excuse to calm down over the summer because it's the summer so I to suggest you know. I would like to suggest to the committee and whoever else wants to attend. You know it's summer meeting of sorts in July. Maybe we can focus on a particular topic. You can pick it's the forum, you know whatever we want. It should be, but I do think we need to have a place where community can come and share their concerns, as well as perhaps learn about another issue that we've tackled tonight. So we can do a issue forum. It can be partition. Forum part updates, whatever the committee desired, but I do for the little that is needed. We can check the month of August off. Maybe we can revisit this visit in June. Excuse me July, but I do want to suggest that we find that we have some agreement, at least on a meeting that we can figure out the date. We can that's my recommendation. Are there any comments about that? I agree. Yes, a much easier doing this on zoom' over the summer, I think also I've been coming to the office so makes it easier for me to say yes, I just want to remind people where my secretary attendance cop hat that I think it's a great idea to have a meeting I. Think it's fantastic. If the maximum number of people who can participate do yosef is totally right. That zoom makes it easier for anybody who can't participate. Just know that would be you know, the participation is optional and it would not be considered an absence that counts against you in case anybody's, worried about that, and we can talk about the agenda right now. I'm thinking we can focus on a particular one issue, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of developments over the next few weeks, so we can all collectively start to monitor, what's going on and decide what our topics are going to be collectively since it'll be a little more laid-back meeting and in July does that sound like a plan? Okay, whatever? Thank you all. It was a very long meeting. Well, this is our longest public safety meeting we've had since I've been the chair. We have a lot of issues to tackle. Obviously in our community we didn't. You know there are a lot of things that we have to continue just and hopefully resolve in our community, but I do want to acknowledge. You know that this is the tough challenge for all of us, particularly me, as a man of color I had a very challenging eight days, I've had a we've had a challenging 400 years in this country. So you know it's nothing new to me, but I do feel shortened up your porns of acknowledging that history. You know my shared our share, our shared history and we're going to call you know trying to do our best to make a difference. We're not perfect we're never going to be perfect and yeah. That's all I have to say so. Thank you all is there a motion to adjourn I? Think no boses daughter is gonna. Second, that motion you wanna say. Second, we say second sleepy all right. You all have a great day and thanks for joining in. Thank you. My mother, the folks I, am so moved.
