Okay, so now I have a problem because people said I want this and I want this whole thing. What happened to the other one I said: I can no accommodate whatever I have is our and I'd seen yesterday, I had to and the rain it's this woman called me. She just came from the dirt that she had eye surgery and she said she had nothing to eat. So I shall up all the way there. My sister's furious, but I say how can I you know I think, have anybody to go and deliver the food. She was so happy, but in this cases that I'm really similar, it's just heartbreaking, just heartbreaking I know so I do not know, and then this community, what is also driving me crazy, yeah I, think that we are missing something. The arguments that usually have is limited and I do not think we are doing a good service to the community, because people from community that comes to committee meetings or to the general meeting I'm not going to have full information of the leader period time that we have with this type of system, no matter how nasty some people guessing our meetings but I think that is a you know. In- person meetings in person are more productive and this ai, not you know, that's my that's my take it's comfortable, because if I am, if I want to drink water, go to the kitchen, I can come back right away and do the same, but I do not know somehow. I do not feel that I'm functioning the way it should. You know that I could or that. Maybe people happy that I'm not around that all thing anyway. I doubt that hey you're, a spokeswoman for a very large percentage of the community, so I do not believe that people do not want from here. Let's see what let's see what happening after the primary you know. Aisha is running against me for the state committee. I know, I saw them doing a campaign like your food, like she's, going to have a salary of two hundred thousand dollars a year. They do not really well. Maybe they do, but it's your sorry self. She has a team. She has two ten, so I guess I'm going to have to deal with them. I can wait. I can get away for this into. You know to happen. Yeah well, I do not know we'll see we'll see. Richard are you on? Are you with us he's not on over to you he's on you, yes to unmute himself? What's good listening, hey are I hear you. We did not get a chance to hear from you much less at the last meeting, how you doing oh I, think I missed the last meeting. Yeah I'm, okay, I'm part of the things you've been here a little bit of part of the things you've been hearing about a couple people speaking previously along at home and what Maria had to say about zoom meetings and Technology yeah. Oh, it's nice being in a meeting that is not 20 to 20 and 30-somethings I. Think having that type of meeting I think we have, we know we can tell by body movement by conversation. You know whose agenda is really on the floor. I think it's different. It's really different I was on Public Safety yesterday, I know that you were as well Richard I do not know if you were Glennis, but I went on to hear about our community in this time of protests and hearing about the vigil and the protest, but also about looting and unrest. I wanted to get like a more global perspective on what's happening in our community and there were more than 50 people on the zoomkour. But you do not hear everybody, because you can't possibly in this format, really hear from 50 people and so, and they say bothers me- is not some people in our bore, monopolize the conversation and they're. You know they wait to see you know. The way they see sees does not mean that they are representing a large number of people. Our community is just like. Their ego is just going crazy, so this is what bothers me because then you know the people who are listening probably feel or think that we feel similar to them, and that is very dangerous, very happy, my name's, you know, but that was exactly the problem. You could not really tell how the bulk of the people felt, because a lot of people that are particular people dominated the conversation. What was your sense of it? Richard I first comment really is for all of the zoom meetings they Center more on the chair and with the I mean all of our committees. Not many of our committees are as participatory as we might hope, but the chair dominates more in these meetings. One of the things I wondered about last night and I. Think staff would have to answer that all of our other community board meetings have been Zoom meetings. Last night was a Cisco WebEx meeting and I was wondering why that was different for the public demanding. Well, it probably had something to do with it being the police, because WebEx is a more secure, medium, enzone yeah. The other thought picking up on something that Maria said what I miss most in meetings and maybe what I miss most generally is the conversations you have before meeting after a meeting the chance to talk to someone to confirm. Is that what you really mean the informal things that happen around a meeting? Something I do not know whether it means we're really too much meeting the Lord's and too much experienced in these ways, but the informal stuff that happens around a meeting. My sense is: it gets just as much done as a meeting and then the other problem is what Maria is said about people's perception of meetings and perceptions of the community board. As for last night's meeting, I had really bad Anders. The Internet reception last night, so I was in and out through much of the meeting had trouble picking up on a lot of what was being said night. So it's easier for me to comment on the process than the content from last night, Glennis, anything to add I, think just in general, so I'm working from home, the armory is still operating, you know, but remotely. So it's been a lot sorry about the background noise, my son, so you know it's been. You know it's been overall just overwhelming since the beginning of all of this, just the shift in everyone routines right and now to throw in all these virtual room meetings and the technology and having to learn a whole new thing. You know just to be able to communicate with everyone. At this point, I mean where I use them. I do not know what everyone else, but personally as well, I have happy hours with my family. I have birthday parties I've been to a baby shower I've, been to you know all kinds of celebrations, because this is little life we're living now, but I'm hopeful that my September there'll be some kind of change right when we're back that things will shift in a positive and we can have some kind of no normal. That is not just this way amidst human content. Are you saying that you think that you're going to be reopening in September Glennis? Oh no I mean I'm, hoping that the CB twelve will be back. You know that via zoom, probably I mean it all depends on what happens with the phases and the reopening right and what slo- Mo says. So, depending on what phase we fall into in terms of opening, our doors will probably open right away, we're already prepping the buildings in sightseeing the Essure. We have masks and all that on hand. So you know we have the attained lab as well, so we're hoping that as soon as we're probably we're thinking that we're going to fall somewhere into Phase, two or three and not well, no, because they just mentioned summer camps are opening at the end of this month and we have summer times yeah and we have summer programming all summer long. So I do not know we're going to have to cross the bridge when we get to it as of right now they only said summer camps, but they did not say that a facility like ours could open so I think we have to determine and see, and you know, ask people for guidance on it. So I will tell you that we got notified on Saturday that the city is going to open cooling centers in the senior center world. It's going to be the senior centers that occupy 10,000 square feet or more, and that means that both the 174Th Street site and our 146 E Street site, a Phillip Randolph Senior Center, will be opening on the heat emergency days. Only at this point they required us this week to not just clean but disinfect, based on the assumption that heat emergency could happen any time and we need to take webinar on what the rules are going to be. I've made a lot of assumptions and I'm moving forward, so I'm purchasing acrylic dividers for the spaces Shields for the desks with like teller slots, so that people can pass papers back and forth. We know the seniors are the most highly vulnerable population of all and so I feel pretty strongly that we've got to do our best to be protective, but also be able to offer the services that they needed. So that's sort of where we are right now with more info to follow as the city rolls it out like you, I expect that the actual congregate, Senior Center meal program will probably be the last face. Give me a second turn good. The person on the telephone. Please unmute yourself. If you can all right yeah, you can press Star, six okay, go ahead for him, go ahead for that, actually by Friday I'll be sending a memo out to the board, letting everyone know what our statuses for now that you're talking about the cooling center, we heard that the city is going to be providing air conditioned. I have about seven phone calls from people said: I need an air condition, so I just do not know it today break then I will text you Maria I, have a contact or actually Richard you have it right of where the seniors should call I can find it. I mean I have I, have script for calling the seniors who are on the city's pre- selected list for air conditioners, but that script also includes seniors, who were not on the list, where they're supposed to call to get themselves onto a list for air conditioners. Okay, so I assumed because I think this is part of our conversation on this committee, because there are a lot of seniors who do not have apartment. They live with someone. You know relative essentially that if the air city start requesting a whole lot of information about it's like the people of, if you have leaves in your apartment, they can provide you restarting you know manifested, but if they do not who qualify and who does not qualify. The person who is in charge of the apartment I have about seven calls so far. People asking for this party since there's so much just started. Iming all the Sun right mine, the mayor announced it. What happened? Was the mayor announced it? So we started getting calls- and then it's just like the Gate food program as we started, making calls other people call and say I heard from my neighbor I heard from my friend: I should get it also, and there are income guidelines on the air- conditioners. A third of them were set aside specifically for night two buildings and two thirds for the community and every Senior Center was given a list of people to reach out to and find out these people have scream or have some other qualifying benefit. That makes the city believe that they should be getting the air conditioner. Maybe for today's meeting, I would like to report things that I have found now, while doing this thing with him. You know with your meals and also I, had gone with Adriana and company to some night surveillance and surprise. You seen that I have seen there how viscose and I just I do not know how we're going to be able to cooperate or cure the you know some of the mess that I have seen it's criminal, it's really criminal, so that probably we could do that. Are the new business para Mary, okay, married one other thing on air conditioners, the first question we ask people is: do you have a working air conditioner now so that this program can be used for is for pink? His internet is bad yeah, my favor having issues yesterday Richard we miss everything you cut off completely, so try it again is. Can you hear me now all I was saying: is that the first question we asked people in checking eligibility for the air conditioner is: do you currently have a functioning air conditioner? So if people you know most often the answer that when people we talk to is no, but this can't be for a second air conditioner. If say they have one in the living room and really want one and deserve one in the bedroom. This program can't fulfill that I'm on another call. Can I call you back. Okay, Oh si o si. Are you there Oh si, no estamos idea better way. I! Might oh? No okay, Oh si? Okay. Why not bye all the senticles are being forwarded to my phone hold on Oh si? Yes, it's Oh see on the phone she typed a question or a statement that she thinks that the Blasio bought 20,000 air conditioners for low- income residents. It's actually 24,000 air conditioners for NYCHA residents and about 47,000 air conditioners for non NYCHA residents. Okay, so the people who live on other type of buildings are going to be at the angle de line. Well, it's two separate lists: yeah I know, but still about business here now, that's right! Okay, so we've covered lots of stuff here just want to follow up with some things. From the last meeting, there was a lot of discussion around what we could do for the first bell for the Isabella residence and I've actually been talking to Betty, and she has turned spoken to the Recreation Department and what they've come up with is that they would really benefit from having some magazines, some spiritual reading books- and you know, they're. You know novels that have a lot, but they have a lot of pictures because they're not into doing so much. You know intent reading, but in both languages in Spanish in English. So if there are people on the committee and who have neighbors and friends and relatives that would like to donate those kinds of reading materials, I'm willing to transport them up, to- Isabella English in Spanish, English and Spanish ships, mostly Spanish, but yeah I- have a lot of National Geographic, but they had in English and they brand- new. We only you know, read them my sister and I and I. Can you know I have a solution right. You won't believe you see, probably about 20 years of them, I'm trying to try to get this posting, and it's in that nobody's really interested in reading that much I'm saying something about like with graphics. Essentially I, unless those are those magazines that you buy on the Newsstand little poner on the front, you do not find really good magazines to read. No more, that's my experience, but anyway I'll try to again I'll stay interested in National Geographic I. Can you know I can do that I can even deliver them to Isabella. Okay, that'd be great. I do not know if they want 20 years worth, but no it's worth everything. Is that mean you'd be surprised, this thing that they know years ago, and this really, you know, quality. It's really. You know important anyway. Okay great, so you know if anybody needs me to transport the transport. The goods I certainly am willing to do so because I'm lucky enough to be able to get in the front of the bus, so I do not have to worry about social distancing of the bus. Let's talk about a little later also we should torch them that they experience about the front of the bus. Oh please, you have experience and we have another experience. Okay, all right! You know we talked about to the future of the meetings, because, if zoom continues, our seniors from the community are not going to be able to get in on these meetings because they do not have the equipment they do not have the technology. I do not have the technology but I'm trying to learn. God knows so, and also some of our committee members Carol weeks has been having trouble. She can't get him Miriam James who's on the committee has not been able to get him so I do not know it's difficult, but at best the other thing I have on the agenda. Is we talked about a lot last time is the long lines at banks and post offices and stores of all kinds and making it very difficult for the seniors and the disabled. Because those long lines you know you can stand outside for an hour creeping up the line, there's an occasional store that has accommodations for seniors like I, know, stop and shop has an hour in the early morning early morning for seniors only but first I'm concerned it's too early. So I do not know you know what they. You know, I'm, just not a person to move out that early at this point, but wondering if there's any thing we can do about it. If anybody has any suggestions, I do not know if we want to try to formalize a resolution and put the my sister said that I talk too much. That's one of my one of my problems. I talk too much, but experience about banks. I go to the upper bank here on Berlin 159 street. They have set up the inside the bank. They do not have many people outside unless it's like at the beginning of the amounts were all senior they get their security check and everybody's rush there to buy these. You know the payments for the you know, rent and electricity, and all that thing. So this is why Julio Batista for some of the community businesses around here, those little markers where you know like if six feet from you know each other and the Apple Bank is very good because they said of chairs individual chairs every six feet. So minions can wait. You know for the services I think that's awesome, as opposed to the TD Bank of 150 cell 58Th Street on Broadway. They eliminated the service, the counters. What I call a counter service? They only had the ATM machine, so you see on the loan lines on Broadway, going down to 100, 57th Street. So I think that is a you know. They said if you need something to do like view how to make a deposit you have to go to the bank, the to the bank that is not like to 204 I do not know which one is the closest one. But running is really you know, I think that's outrageous, there's! No one that I could complain about. There was some not too long ago was raining and I saw people I happen to be in the area going to the post office and I saw all these people outside just to use the ATM machine. Yeah, no senior sang everybody, so I think that some of the businesses may accommodate some people. I know they do not agree with you about the early morning shopping for people, the elderly. You know if you want to go there and buy a seven o'clock in the morning. So what is it you're going to get over 5:30 together race and get someone there is no home attendant? That can you know, go with him, so I just do not see the benefit of that early hours for seniors, but I just do not know who set up that particular system. I. Think the early shopping hour happened when people were really panicked about the shortage of food. So I know that recently I mean I. Do not know everyone else's experience. So I order a lot of my food. You know into the car BJ's. They all do deliveries for pretty reasonable prices like 599 things like that. So you know maybe, like three weeks ago, you would have to wait a week, sometimes maybe even two- to get a slot to get home delivery for food, and now everyone has delivery available. Amazon fresh all these services, like my point, is because I know a lot of elderly people do not have access to the technology. I think there's people are more relaxed about getting food. I do not think everyone thinking that you know the world is going to end I need to hoard crazy amounts of food and I think when that was happening. They were saying, let's give the seniors an opportunity to get in the supermarket early. Take their time not be rush, not be overcrowded and have like that extra hour to do it. So all the stores in my neighborhood I live in Riverdale all have that they all have the eight to nine. In the one hour before the regular business hours of letting people in I had the senior citizens so I do not know if the rest of the Bronx is still doing it. I know they're doing it at the food town and Broadway as well and 231st, so I'm not sure what else is going on, but that's where I think the thought was where it started their early access. Well, none of the stores around here doing it, that's for sure I do not have the ability to order online either and I go to the stores. Wait in lines, I'm fortunate enough that I have walked the rollator, so I can sit. But you know there are a lot of only you know really. Elderly ladies, come shopping with their shopping cart and it's very hard for them, and also this had to be said because I know there are people, the elderly, people that go shopping most every day or every other day for socializing, as opposed to just there is one of my you know, people that we know here there are on their late eighties. He will go back to buy milk. He says I used to say you know you can't do you can't do them, how to go shopping for milk I mean you buy a large kite song and since I said, oh no, I go and I see my friends and also it's fresh, so I said I think the same melt that you put aside yesterday is you're buying today, but there are people who do that, especially seniors in my community in this area, where I live, it's like really a low- income type order. You know community people do not, you know, do not have those abilities and some people go shopping. They drive, they have someone to drive them to the other side and since like that, so how are we going to solve that problem? I just do not know, but it's really limited. When we talk about the food banks, we are the distribution of food, then we go into the little later. I do not know what the answer is. I was just trying to you know see if we could get some suggestions or ideas about you know if this is something that's able to be resolved at all, and oh, maybe four and have something to say about it. So like Lennis, I, live in Riverdale and the stores near us are open from 7 to 8 for seniors are from 8 to 9 for seniors I agree. I personally would like them to be like from 5 to 6, but that's not what they're doing and it's the same in Westchester, so I do not know whether it's a supermarket Association group. That's made. That decision then therefore I'm not really sure how to impact it because I think it's not like they discussed it with anybody. They just did it mmm. You know that are doing delivery, including Gordon Gorman, that you can even call them and tell them you a list and they'll deliver Richard. You were going to say something. Yeah and I was mostly its agreeing with what's been said. I do not think that the early senior hours were made from a central place. I think it was probably just merchants convenience that if you have to get a different group in and out it's easier to, do it on one end of the day or the other, where you just have to get them in or just have to get them out and do not. It do not have as much of groups bumping up against each other, I think they're, probably I. Think if we're trying to change it, we probably do need to go to merchant groups and see how they might lead on that. The only other thing that you can think of that might help a little bit would be pushing them to do weekend hours for seniors when their hours are more limited, so it might start later in the day or be it five or six o'clock in the afternoon rather than 10:00 at night, but I mean through community book through CB 12. We have good contacts with the local merchants associations, not to change the Sidra would be you know, source help, I think that's a good place to start the discussion. So maybe we can also recommend, like years ago, you used to go to the bank and you have a line for the seniors and the other lines for the irregular. You know. People who are you know, do not consider themselves seniors, but that was something that the banks had Citibank Apple chase. They all had that line for seniors and that would be taking care on that. You know a specific area and I think that maybe they could go back to their I, do not know about in Vegas a supermarket, but I mean maybe Alissa for that type of service. That would be doing. Yeah I mean you know. I know most I mean many of the stores around here where I live. They have someone, you know sort of monitoring the doorway, especially if there's a long line and they let a certain number of people in at a time. You know, must people leave, because only a certain number of people are allowed in the store at the time, but a couple of times what I've seen is that the person monitoring the doorway if they see an elderly person, they'll motion for them to come on in you know, even if their way down the line, but that's not true every for every store, so I do not know, but I can tell you it's not true. The pharmacies, the farm at the big pharmacies like Walgreens and like are also limiting people and it so they set up this line either. One on two thirty first and Broadway can be a block, long advertising. Anybody. You just stand there and wait right. Very individual bye-, bye, they're, throwing a company manager what the chain the chain pharmacies they were delivering now yeah, that's pretty new! Yes, and that can be done by phone. Yes, then, especially the one you already have your prescription with, because that's the easy, also all Foodtown you can call and make a food delivery. So you call them, you tell them exactly what you want. They shop it for you. They even stay on the phone with you and shop with you, and then they delivery. You so I think I want to taste, like$, 2.99 and I do not know if they make considerations for senior citizens, but I know all of them are still doing that. So that's a resource, Lou towns are located. You know around the city in General, there's one by us here, but I know there's one in Washington Heights as well, and there's one in Harlem. The problem is the problem with seniors and groceries. Is that seniors and I'm included in that I want to see what I'm buying okay I do not want somebody else, picking out my green peppers, okay I do not want somebody else deciding which bag of rules I want. You know I want to see what they have what's on sale. What might be you know more along the lines of what I need or want all right, I completely understand that, but I think that in terms of people not going out at this time in terms of being protected in terms of not standing on line, there are limited options right. If you buy your food online and many of us are uncomfortable with that I'm, certainly not you get the same thing: somebody's picking your food, so I go out every Saturday and I shop for myself and my parents, because my parents are not going to. Let somebody that's not me, pick out their food, but they would not prefer to go and meander around the store themselves. It's just too hard. Then my mom can't wait online. My dad can't wait online they're, both 90 right, it's just not practical in the current environment, for them to be waiting online to go and buy their food, so I think you're right in terms of people's preferences. I. Think most people like to pick their own food but I think in practical terms. We have to balance that, against the advice of doctors to stay home, certainly my parents- doctors- have been oh, my goodness crystal clear that they will not survive getting Covid-19, so they better do what they have to do. I mean you want to get to 90 right. I do not know there beats the alternative. Everything that we are saying is really. You know the real stuff, but also we have to consider the economic side of this thing. If you go to the supermarket, you see the price of the green peppers versus of the red peppers and the yellow peppers, and things like that, and then you make it sure, is it which one is the sale today right. They pick that one as opposed to being on the phone with some an employee. You know ordering and if you do not have a lot of money in there or the credit card or maybe I do not know what a week or whatever those programs are right. It's really a struggle because they've been saying now that I see the lines out there, especially the hot food. They prefer the Hat food I supposed to call vegetables and things like that or they have to you, know, take home, and you know and cook, and since like that, so it's we need to talk about economics. Also, it's not just practical way of ordering getting delivered and I'm. Sometimes what you're going to save on the sale you're going to have to give a tip to the person who delivers so it's a right, listen. We know a lot of the seniors, come to the Senior Center on economics, right, it's not just socializing, it's not just playing with your friends or participating in an educational class. It is that they're surviving on the primary meal of the day and often taking home part of it to supplement dinner so you're absolutely on target. As far as the cost and the dependency on food programs, but they're still giving away food at schools the gap, food programs still exists. It's terrible, but it does still exist, it's terribly inconsistent and what you get and the quality of what you get and actually in the food items. It's not like it's one menu. Everybody gets something different or everybody with one vendor gets something different than everybody with a different vendor, so it I do not like the program, particularly but really. If people are hungry, they need to call 3-, 1- 1 and ask forget food. We are going into the median to the food that we in delivery or giving out to the people, because there is a young I. Think clothes is giving a lot of food right. The bags that they put together fold, people for like it was supposed to be for a wig for a family or for one individual person. I do not know, but I know that people are complaining about that. Getting in light of one particular item. Let's say six banana, you know like when you can the last two days or the plane ten, oh, the other vegetables, that I do not that I do not eat anyway. So one of my neighbor comes here and says they deliver like tree all these humongous things. You have no idea how to cook thing. How do we, you know who is putting these things together and there's a lot of sin being thrown away and it's criminal, because people needs food? We have delivery yesterday to someone in the building. Next to me, she has three kinds of being three different kinds of being. She has never seen them before. She's, not, you know, she's, not at the energies, African- American. She have no idea what these things were all about then she'd they gave her to back to the sins of two. Can one kind of siding and one salma and then two little packages of the little spaghetti a little various things. Spaghetti I do not know what I call them because I do not like. Then it was her what she got and she says man who did she get it from class III do not know who they it's been delivered to her house. Well, I think she got it through three one. It sounds like she got it through three one. Do you want me to describe what's been going on with, on top of that, did she help out like ten little packages of cut up apples? Yeah now you know how sensitive it is because they come and they're in a plastic thing, but who I do not? You gave three apples or two apple instead of all these little really things that you do not know, you're never sorting out, because you do not know who, whose hands have touched that thing right. So that's exactly the problem. I mean you've really pinpointed it. So I can tell you somehow. Richard has heard this story already. Somehow I got onto the food to be delivered list and though I begged and pleaded on Bin me, I can't get myself off it now. I do not live in Washington Heights I live in Riverdale, so I'm getting a different vendor and the vendor that's supposed to be serving Riverdale and they are bringing three or four whole fruits and then they're bringing plastic packed. Meals like you would get from the Chinese takeout place. You know those plastic oblong containers and it's all supposed to go into the refrigerator and you're supposed to heat them up. I guess or some of them are not to be heated up, although there's no actual indication on it. However, I do not want it. I did not ask for it. I begged them to take me off of it now I'm giving them away in my building, because I do not want it and nobody listens. I've written it, I put it into the system because we're authorized and rollers and Dissin rollers. It does not matter what I do for two months now: I'm keeping food from a program that I do not want food from the quality of the food is not great. It's adequate. It's heavily starch, the what I'm getting but then I get phone calls from our seniors. As you see, while we're on the phone it's been happening, I do not like this I do not eat that. That's not my style of food. What is this? Can you explain it to me? What am I supposed to do with it all the time and I've complained and right now the Department for the aging is answer. Is we're not in charge of it anymore? De Blasio created a foods are Catherine Garcia, who is actually the Commissioner of the Department of Sanitation and she's in charge of it and do not complain to us, and so I actually am in the process of writing an email to the commissioner because she's the only one who can effectuate communication with Kathryn Garcia, not me who's, Kathryn Garcia, is not does not know me from anybody. So it's extremely frustrating it's Y, El Telar is involved. Several of us in a food distribution of any kind is because the city's program is not adequate for our community. It's not really adequate for any community, but I can only focus on the community that I serve so I. That may be something that we as a community board aging committee, should send a letter about because it's not serving in the way that it should and it's millions of dollars waste I see on my line because I have at a structure. I have few buildings here that they have committed himself to deliver the food for the apartment, that I know the people that need and I'm they are. You know they bring me stories back and then they exchange sin sometimes differ a few times. I have receive like back with vegetables, one by one die you they gave me a back with like about two pounds of chicken legs and whatever it is, someone said I do not need you know me coming you know, so they exchanged things with each other right. One thing that I do not you know, I do not know it happened in our I mean this is I know something different. Just came to my head. This businesses that were vandalized in some of the areas are there any pharmacists that have been destroyed, we're having happened to those medicine. Those order from you know from anybody that have been you know, destroy I saw one died, man I think. Well, that's what I! That's the only one I heard about was the one up in Inwood right, I, wonder if that person is going to get some help about trying to figure out the door Church and the records that they have on that store. You know what happened to that. Is it's really upsetting me because I know that we're I, you know I purchase our medicine beam here on Broadway. They are very good. They you follow true, they sometime I, said I need something. They said. No, it's not you until like next week. I can not give it to you and things like that. Maybe you miscounted or you know something like that, but then what happened to that type of business that would totally destroy records and medicines and I mean this is just I. Do not know it's just bad, just bad. So this won't. You say: oh it's only one that happened. That's the only one I got at the pharmacy. I do not know about two or seven, but on one 77 there was one that was vandalized 177 in Broadway around 207, somewhere I'm, just looking I'm looking on the internet right now, and the extra the website for Duane, Reade, pharmacy and Eichmann. There is a says on here temporarily closed, so that would be the corner of Dyckman and Post and I would be concerned. That's where my prescriptions there, yeah well I know they temporarily closed. One of the pharmacies up here me I, may actually told me to go to a different pharmacy of that group like a different Duane. Reade are different Walgreens because they have your prescription information and they can call it like St. Jesus, where it's just that one pharmacy, it's not part of a chain, it's a more complicated problem. Oh maybe going back to Isabella, so everything is back to almost normal Arisa Bella. Whatever normal is it's getting back? Yes, because you know I'm in touch with, you know one of the security officers there and also you know with Betty. So it's coming around coming around no base it into the that's correct. Nobody from the outside was allowed in. Unless you work there means of communication only by telephone yeah, because I mean you know. I'm interested can I go back to my casino to play. My numbers I want to go back to work in the gift shop, I missed out. Okay, you know what we had decided some time ago that we wanted to talk about the budget in May and we did not talk about it and maybe cuz everything else. That was going on I had the copies of last year's budget sent to everybody. Did everybody get it? What type of capital? No that the agent well yeah Community Board, the Agent Committee, the Agent, Committee capital and expense budgets? Did you send it Mary anybody get it anybody familiar with, did not get it either. Okay, it's not a long list. I can read them to you. If you want, could you please so again? You know because we have to. We have to make a decision by September. I mean this is going to be the last meeting until September right. Well, that's going to be that's next item on the agenda right, but since then we do not. We do not me the we need. We need to talk about that today. Yes, we will all right, but I do not want to wait until September to discuss this completely I want people to look at it. I want people to start thinking because you know come September and you know nobody has looked at it. Nobody remembers, then you know we're going to have an issue because we got ta get it settled. You know, as things go, there's a lot of things to think about and consider what we want to ask for. If you probably know I seat on the advisory board for the Department for the aging, they may use it, but they have been canceling meeting they postponed in a concern they postponed and postponed Ian, and we have been being able to meet their new commissioner that she study at the beginning of this year, Lorraine Cortez came up with suggestions that each one of us we channeled a member, had to come up with a idea. I mean a list of sins items that we really needed for the aging communal community and for the senior some of the Dyatlov senior centers sit on that you know and that Camellia, so everybody is pushing for you know whatever they want, but now that, with this pandemic, we may be thinking about how we go into there or the seniors are going to be drilling. If this scene does not go away forever or something else comes up that we, you know how to address those needs. That will you know imperil. You know, especially the seniors. Just supplies like for our center, so you know we should be prepared for certain scenes which we went in because who ever thought about that? You know hitting us. I do not know what did we have on the bike? The priorities metaphor: there was something when I say: expanding I sell I have to I have to here in front of me renovate existing or build replacement, senior centers as needed, provide funding to construct, affordable, accessible, wait a minute somehow that got chopped off hold on a second, the one for housing provide funding to construct, affordable, accessible housing for seniors, right and system-, wide upgrade of airier senior centers to improve connectivity through Wi-, Fi and telecommunication services. Those are the were the three capital budget items yeah that was a still Mm-, hmm, that was a from an agency perspective. Those are still the capital items. Maybe you know as seen their census it's starting to age. They may be a request for replacing furniture and equipment, but diff to pretty much handles those individually right now the expense budget may be. Can we go back to the? Maybe we should focus also or maybe in the priorities move they are. You know help on the telecommunications with the seniors, since they are there, people who are no, they do not have internet in the house and try to get in touch with this with these senior centers provide services for them, because now that everything is going online for lying and for your mother- in- law, we need to you know, see how we can, especially for the early seniors many people between 55 and on, as opposed to the very elderly that are not going to get. You know, I mean educated thing on training thing on this type of thing, it's going to be impossible, not only because they are elderly, but because of the education academic, education that they have they're not going to be able to follow up on this thing. That may be fun into for the Centers to have a very communication link. So you're saying that should be number one rather than number three, as a house are going to be, housing is good. Housing should be supporting the affordable housing we when we did it originally, it was sort of a joint reso or a joint concept, so I think Mary, you're, probably going to have to reach out to the housing chair, got it and keep that as a priority with them as well. Okay, because otherwise it won't get the votes, but I would agree with you Maria. What we're seeing is the biggest deficit is that our seniors are really deficit in understanding, how to use most technology and since our systems internally also we're not upgraded. It's a bad combination. So we want just the two capital budget items today, but I leave them if we can just move right but I'm, saying the housing, let that go with housing, but make sure that they include seniors. No make tell make the communications through connectivity number one right and move the housing for us. Two: three right: okay, but do not drop it just make that you've spoken to housing so that they have it as well, so that the votes will be cumulative from both. But what we've been told in the past is that if we have similar budget requests to, let them be on one committee or the other. Not, but you know you have to talk to that committee and see whether they're going to carry it or not. Okay, gotcha, okay and then expense. You were going to say: Mary, oh yeah increase the expansion and the program, expanded in- home services for elderly persons, funding, increased funding to expand services at senior centers to include additional hiring additional social workers. Increased funding for transportation for seniors by restoring prior budget cuts to expand access and outreach to healthy No yeah to healthy food increase, funding for naturally occurring retired retirement communities, increase OTPs funding for replacement, furnishings non- capital and senior centers as needed. So I would add one that I think again for me. Just from what we've been experiencing and I'm sorry, is there anything from you? It's massless just watching my earpieces I can't stay on these earpieces either all right, no go ahead. I'm going to advocate for really expanded. Geriatric mental health services from the senior centers I think that we've seen now with the Covid-19 crisis, just devastation in the senior community anxiety depression. So many people have died that all of those mental health needs have just gone through the roof. They we're always significant, but now they are just outrageously high and we've got to address it. Okay, what do you? What is the rest of the committee? Think oh I, definitely agree with that community services also looking into because not only are we seeing a higher number of younger people being depressed, not a Joseph. When we talk about younger people, know the 1718 celebrity. You know the young adult I have to say Parea. Also someone pointed out when I say the young adults. They consider a young adults from 18 to 27, so we have to be yeah respective Maria, we're so used to anyway. But there is so much I mean there are they were in cuts for the mental services, but there were a lot of people who were lacking that support services. Are they neither because you know no matter what we said they being abused no physically but mentally, and they going through so much and there is no, you know unless they open up and they have conversation with social worker than since, like that, we do not reach that cup. You know. No, that's right and my opinion is always that going through a familiar service like a Senior Center is helpful, but the reality is whether it's us or it's in which community services or its metropolitan. We just need so much more in services. So you think we want to put that to number one on the expense special. How many more do we have there's six? The way we are seeing the city boy have been discussed, two centers for having one they have to know just to have the staff for just her serve. You know to do this thing so I admire because of that is just I think you know just trying very hard I'm talking about you for a lingua, oh yeah, I'm saying do we want to have the mental health issue number one? It would be to me, but I do not to speak for the whole committee. I think we need to know what the committee thinks I mean I'm, not involved in senior centers, so much I. Think, as you know, as being you know from another point of view, I think the mental health services is vital because people are dropping right and left. You know I mean I, can't talk to anybody that they have not lost a sister, a mother, a brother. You know whoever's plus you've got all the other things that people you know have been dying from years four years cancer and our rates are crazy. Where is ready to jump out the window over? Nobody seen I guess since, like this from a Mo Community Services Riverstone Esperanza sent that I'm always involving all the centers and all this you know for senior describe, because we saw that on our golden years, people are going to be more secure, that everybody was going to most people going to have steady life until you going to the other were and now we're seeing that the seniors are becoming more desperate because they have. We are not providing with yeah I, just want to add I, guess name into that is a priority and for our internal work with the community board, probably want to check in with Health and Environment Committee, which puts out which will put mental health priorities in the budget and just to make sure that we say those things in complementary ways. All right do we want to leave the other six on board as well. Increasing expansion in the program, expanded in- home services for elderly persons, though we probably clue they're covered by the very first item. Right, I'm, sorry go ahead, man I thought. Maybe that could be combined with the body. First, you know item because it's really it links one with the other. Hmm I mean I. Do not know what do you think for what's linked with mental services, because if we isolate that people may know way too much of them, maybe they won't rank thing. Hi, DeLeon, less willing thing with all the services increased on this increase funding for mental services, and you know what whether it's social services that are that was. There was a request for social workers, so we could link it with that with it requires an MSW. Not you know any old caseworker that you pick up yeah because you send them a lot of the social workers. Are you know exporting one facets of you know of needs, as opposed to others need more social worker. There are we to deal with the elderly population Donita yeah I will I would I would certainly double it I. If do you want to say it both in the social work hard and as a separate item? I certainly think it can't her. If we do not. If we double the people in the community war, when they had to, they have to rank 55 items yeah, then they get lost yeah a good point so say again. What we want to do include I'll, leave that I leave that to foreign further I'm going to say: let's make the geriatric mental health it's its own item, okay, yeah and I would say number one but, like I said I'd like to hear as well I agree well, you'd be number one Oh see any thoughts. Still there nope, okay, I, think she's been writing him Senora Que Su Nombre Senora. Is it irrational? Okay? So we're going to leave the other six in yes, okay, boy, Después, De Sao throw a union con line from us young Porque, Estoy, Aqui, Ando, Pero, no Puedo, daughter, basic Tiempo, okay, bye- bye. All the centers calls are coming to me. Right are not you lucky anything else. Any additional items, I think we've got a fair list of issues that we've already identified: I'm, not inclined to drop them. I just want to push this up to the top, because it's so big right now, okay, I think we're good on that any announcements, everybody house, no the only thing, I hope they improve the quality of the food that they deliver. The only thing I it's critical to most people and also one of the things that I can see for this summer. You know when the since get warm some of the items that they deliver. Unless someone has a very good refrigerator some, you know some of those things are going to spoil so quickly. I do not know my sister said. Is she going to have to add two more arms to my body for the other stuff? No, it's a it's very sad I, see things getting really. My golden years are no, do not look to bowling. They look a little brownish when I'm your age I want to be. You I had a very dear friend to it in his older years before he passed away, had a quote that he would say about the golden years. So you know just imagine. I won't say that we're going to mention, maybe because you brought that up at the traffic and transportation committee. The I did not know that the BOCES was free. Since we do not, you know we have to be out far so we usually take. You know Tashia later that Sunday after the vigil, the robucket song Adriano and someone was put together, someone we could not find a tactic. You know so someone said: let's go and take the boss and I said: oh, my god, my sister, she knows she I dragged her along and she came along with me anyway. So we are waiting for the boss, or boss said that was Sunday after about 6:30 7:00 for bosses came by no service altogether I'm talking about it number 100 they coming from the Bronx we were on 218. There was a number say: two of them came no service. Finally, one came, but the birds have already two people on the front of the for the 24. We saw needing a system, so they said that there was no room for their space. Whole unit is six feet between two of you know the we waited for the next one by the time. Okay, so the one that came the driver was very nice too. You know he put the ramp for my sister, so she getting and then but the when we went alone down to 170 something I mean so they would not they wedding. The driver was not cool for about the distance, so there was like about four people, so we got out and then it stopped, but so that is something had heard. Some other thing are really bad. Somebody I'm talking about the driver, some of the bus drivers well I, had another incident, speaking of buses that I actually reported at the traffic and transportation meeting Howie Levine was there and number 100 at 180 first on Broadway downtown on the downtown side in front of McDonald. So wherever does a 100 came along okay and was that the curb and I'm standing in the front? You know by the front door with my were later and the driver is looking at me and violently pointing her thumb, I'm saying no I can't get in that back door. I have to get in here and she's still motioning. With that thumb back to the back. For me and I said, if you do not, let me in I'm going to report you go ahead, go ahead. Yeah I, know man so nasty. You know, that's what you know I mean. What's the point, another thing that is going to come out as far as seniors impact on seniors mobility is, that is the plan for the bikes that they, the CitiBikes, that are they going to install in so mething are what they can putting on sidewalks, because we do not have those very wide avenues, type of thing that they can put this. You know humongous long lines of bicycle, and that is going to be forcing people who you know. Someone like it is printed that has that type order that it's not going to be they narrowing the pass for people to you know to use the sidewalks and I was looking at this. The plans for the bike slain by the backsight, whatever they point, a color point where they're going to be located and they are on sidewalks Omega, no half of the thing, so they they're going to be impacting on people who have mobility problems and also the families people into baby carriages, and things like that. I do not know about the bicycles, I, love right, but I do not have use for bicycle. No more so there's something that needs to be said every time when they come to rubber- stamp or this bike. You know sight in your community. Not only are they limiting cutting down on parking spaces, but also sidewalk spaces, so they made a presentation on Monday at the traffic and transportation meeting. I do not know yeah. That was bad. It's really bad yeah. You were yeah anyway, so many so many things to do so little time to do it. I know. So. Does anybody have any thoughts about our next meeting? Should we meet over the summer No going once going twice? Let's have a vote here Jerry. Let me a three out of thought before we vote or whatever this commit compared to the other CB committees we're generally a summer vacation, is welcome and relaxing in a little bit we're sharing practical advice here and it functions a little different from other committees. I would consider scheduling, meetings or scheduling them at the last minute, or even scheduling this group of people in an informal way. It's a useful group. Okay, anybody else, yeah I, think it's a very good idea. Glennis I agree: good, okay, so well scheduled for July and August. Now, I do not think I'm going to go anywhere for the summer, because I have a feeling that I'm not going to get upstate for my usual visit with my sister. They do not want the city folk up there I do not think and probably won't for a while, so I have a feeling. That's not going to even come to be so. I have no problem, I mean like any summer meeting or specially scheduled meeting attendance is not mandatory, but there may be some good ways for us to interact and people can either make it as I can. Do you think we should stick to the first Thursday of the month. I would say: what's the first Thursday of July 2nd if I'm not mistaken, because July 4th is on the first Saturday yeah everyone, okay, this time works for me too, like early morning, it's easier than later. In the day, yeah like this morning meetings, we actually tried having this committee meet in the evening, because we wanted to get more board members involved and it did not work and, of course, and of course we had no seniors attending the meeting because they're not going out in the evening I do not I do not know who the new members are I mean somehow I miss the you know any presentation of a new members, because it's very difficult to do it this way, but they have they appointed anybody over 50. Are the community going out and you membership are? They are the new members are on board. I do not know, I mean I'm. Talking about the age of the new members, I mean how do they appoint anyone that is like close to become a senior or are they all young activists? Not that I noticed I mean some of them were. You know who they were at the general meeting yeah, but you think seething I mean you can see. Who is who and this type of median yeah we saw some of them yeah might have been one I. Think that this one, maybe my point is that maybe the focusing on the younger generation that are trying to make changes in our communities and they print around you know either background different type. You know involving no mustering, or some of them will be interesting in you know, seniors issues seems like that was from the beginning, I'm, the one that said of this committee. This we never had a seniors committee until I became the chair of the boy, Mm-, hmm I said. Oh this committee and also the youth. The Youth Committee is a you yeah sure. Within the other day, he called me, and he said, have some happy birds. I said heard my birthday song August, all my god anyway. August is the only the first Thursday I miss a home midnight in two years. How's he doing it. Okay, but if you say you can not go he's limited now as a wheelchair, and he goes to the scenic off. Maybe once every you know, for whatever service is that you know he needs to go, but he's you know, he's: okay, he's! Okay, that's tangent! My regards. When you talk to him next, okay, so the meeting in July would be in the second and August 6, okay. So the other question in August, when is Maria's birthday right thing like I, spent the big cake right here, I'll tell you what, when I come to the border office, I'll have the cake here, the cake, okay, so meeting adjourned I have to go Cole back like five seniors. Okay, I'll speak with you. A little later about the magazines are bringing a magazine afternoon with the Hobart stone at three O clock. So I have another way yeah. So then I had the are Maria six. Okay, people call whenever you're free, Maria. Okay. If people individually bring magazines to Isabella, let them know it's from the community board: Asian Committee! Okay, all right! Thank you and they go to the Recreation Department. Okay, Jessica Garcia up there Richard okay, take care everybody! You fear.
