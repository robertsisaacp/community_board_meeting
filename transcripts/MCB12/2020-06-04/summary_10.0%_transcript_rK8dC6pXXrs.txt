Okay so now I have a problem, because people said I want this and then this community, what is also driving me crazy, I think that we are missing something the arguments that usually have is limited and I Don't think we are doing a good service to the community, because people from community that comes to committee meetings or to the general meeting I'm not going to have full information of the leader period time that we have with this type of system, no matter how nasty some people guessing our meetings but I think that is a you know.
Aisha is running against me for the state committee I'm part of the things you've been here a little bit of part of the things you've been hearing about a couple people speaking previously along at home, and what Maria had to say about zoom meetings and Technology We know we can tell by body movement by conversation.
You couldn't really tell how the bulk of the people felt, because a lot of people that are particular people dominated the conversation Richard I first comment really is for all of the zoom meetings they Center more on the chair and with the One of the things I wondered about last night and I Think staff would have to answer that all of our other community board meetings have been zoo meetings and I was wondering why that was different for the public demanding It probably had something to do with it being the police, because WebEx is a more secure, medium, enzone My sense is: It gets just as much done as a meeting and then the other problem is what Maria is said about: people's perception of meetings and perceptions of the community board Glennis, anything to add I, think just in general, so I'm working from home , I, don't know what everyone else, but personally as well, I have happy hours with my family.
She typed a question or a statement that she thinks that the Blasio bought 20,000 air conditioners for low-income residents So the people who live on other type of buildings are going to be at the angle de line I know, but still about business here now From the last meeting.
There was a lot of discussion around what we could do for the first bell for the Isabella residence If there are people on the committee and who have neighbors and friends and relatives that would like to donate those kinds of reading materials, I'm willing to transport them up to , Isabella English in Spanish, English and Spanish ships, mostly Spanish, but We only you know read them my sister and I and I Unless those are those magazines that you buy on the newsstand little poner on the front, you don't find really good magazines to read.
I know they're doing it at the food town and Broadway as well and 231st, so I'm not sure what else is going on, but that's where I think the thought was where it started their early access Elderly ladies, come shopping with their shopping cart and it's very hard for them, and also this had to be said because I know there are people.
You know, people that we know here there are on their late eighties, so I said I think the same melt that you put aside yesterday is you're buying today, but there are people who do that, especially seniors in my community in this area, where I live, it's like really a low-income type order.
You know a specific area, I mean maybe Alissa for that type of service, and they let a certain number of people in at a time.
Housing should be supporting the affordable housing we when we did it originally, it was sort of a joint reso or a joint concept, so I think You're, probably gonna have to reach out to the housing chair, got it and keep that as a priority with them as well We want just the two capital budget items today, but I leave them if we can just move right but I'm, saying the housing , let that go with housing, but make sure that they include seniors No, make tell make the communications through connectivity number one right and move the housing for us.
Okay, but don't drop it just make that you've spoken to housing so that they have it as well, so that the votes will be cumulative from both What we've been told in the past is that if we have similar budget requests to, let them be on one committee or the other, but you know you have to talk to that committee and see whether they're gonna carry it or not, okay, gotcha, okay and then expense Expanded in-home services for elderly persons, funding, increased funding to expand services at senior centers to include additional hiring additional social workers.
That is a priority and for our internal work with the community board, probably want to check in with Health and Environment Committee, which puts out which will put mental health priorities in the budget and just to make sure that we say those things in complementary ways: Increasing expansion in the program, expanded in-home services for elderly persons, though we probably clue they're covered by the very first item.
Hmm I mean I, don't know what do you think for what's linked with mental services, because if we isolate that people may know way too much of them, maybe they won't rank thing.
