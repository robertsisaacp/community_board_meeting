What is also driving me crazy, The arguments that usually have is limited and I do not think we are doing a good service to the community, because people from community that comes to committee meetings or to the general meeting I'm not going to have full information of the leader period time that we have with this type of system, no matter how nasty some people guessing our meetings but I think that is a you know.
Their ego is just going crazy, so this is what bothers me because then you know the people who are listening probably feel or think that we feel similar to them, and that is very dangerous.
It's been a lot sorry about the background, noise, my son, so You know it's been overall just overwhelming since the beginning of all of this, just the shift in everyone routines right and now to throw in all these virtual room meetings and the technology and having to learn a whole new thing.
You know that via zoom, probably I mean it all depends on what happens with the phases and the reopening right and what slo- So, depending on what phase we fall into in terms of opening, our doors will probably open right So we're hoping that as soon as we're probably we're thinking that we're going to fall somewhere into Phase, two or three and not well, no, because they just mentioned summer camps are opening at the end of this month, and we have summer times And we have summer programming all summer.
Now they only said summer camps, but they did not say that a facility like ours could open, So I think we have to determine and see, and you know, ask people for guidance on it.
Okay, so I assumed because I think this is part of our conversation on this committee, because there are a lot of seniors who do not have apartment.
You know relative, essentially that if the air city start requesting a whole lot of information about it's like the people, of, If, you have leaves in your apartment, they can provide you restarting you know manifested, but if they do not who qualify and who does not qualify.
Then it's just like the Gate food program, as we started, making calls other people call and say I heard from my neighbor I heard from my friend: I should get it also, and there are income guidelines on the air- conditioners.
A third of them were set aside specifically for night two buildings and two thirds for the community and every Senior Center was given a list of people to reach out to and find out.
There was a lot of discussion around what we could do for the first bell for the Isabella residence If there are people on the committee and who have neighbors and friends and relatives that would like to donate those kinds of reading, materials, I'm willing to transport them, up, to- We, only you know, read them my sister and I and I.
If zoom continues, our seniors from the community, are not going to be able to get in on these meetings because they do not have the equipment they do not have the technology.
This is why Julio Batista for some of the community businesses around here, those little markers where you know like if six feet from you know each other and the Apple Bank is very good because they said of chairs individual chairs.
All these services, like my point, is because I know a lot of elderly people do not have access to the technology.
All the stores in my neighborhood I live in Riverdale In, the one hour before the regular business hours of letting people in I had the senior citizens So I do not know if the rest of the Bronx is still doing.
Think the same melt that you put aside yesterday Is you're buying today, but there are people who do that, especially seniors in my community, in this area, where I live.
Only other thing that you can think of that might help a little bit would be pushing them to do weekend hours for seniors when their hours are more limited, so it might start later in the day or be it five or six o'clock in the afternoon, rather than 10:00 at night, But I mean through community book through CB 12.
Somebody else, picking out my green peppers, okay You know more along the lines of what I need or want all right, I completely understand, that, but I think that in terms of people not going out at this time in terms of being protected in terms of not standing on line, there are limited options: If you buy your food online and many of us are uncomfortable with that.
They, prefer the Hat food I supposed to call vegetables and things like that Or they have to you, know, take home, and you know and cook , We know a lot of the seniors, come to the Senior Center on economics, right It's not just playing with your friends or participating in an educational class.
That I know the people that need Was the one up in Inwood Right , I, wonder if that person is going to get some help about trying to figure out the door Church and the records that they have on that store.
I want people to start thinking because you know come September and you know nobody has looked at it.
So everybody is pushing for you know whatever they want, but now that, with this pandemic, we may be thinking about how we go into there or The seniors are going to be drilling.
You know help on the telecommunications with the seniors, since they are there, people who are no.
Know, see how we can, especially for the early seniors many people between 55 and on, as opposed to the very elderly that are not going to get.
That's right, and my opinion is always that going through a familiar service like a Senior Center is helpful, but the reality is whether it's us Or it's in which community services or its metropolitan.
I think we need to know what the committee thinks I mean I'm, not involved in senior centers, so much I.
Do, not know what do you think for what's linked with mental services, because if we isolate that people may know way too much of them, maybe they won't rank thing.
Let's make the geriatric mental health Okay, I, think we're good on that any announcements, everybody house, no, the only thing, I hope they improve the quality of the food that they deliver.
You know he put the ramp for my sister, There was like about four people, so we got out and then it stopped, but Somebody I'm talking about the driver, some of the bus drivers, Well I, had another incident, speaking of buses that I actually reported at the traffic and transportation meeting.
Know, seniors issues seems like that was from the beginning , I'm, the one that said of this committee.
