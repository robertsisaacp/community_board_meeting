Don't think we are doing a good service to the community, because people from community that comes to committee meetings or to the general meeting I'm not going to have full information of the leader period time that we have with this type of system, no matter how nasty some people guessing our meetings but I, think that is a you know.
Let's, see what let's see what happening after the primary you know, Aisha is running against me for the state committee , I know, I saw them doing a campaign like your food, like she's, going to have a salary of two hundred thousand dollars a year.
I'm part of the things you've been here a little bit of part of the things you've been hearing about a couple people speaking previously along at home, and what Maria had to say about zoom meetings and Technology We know we can tell by body movement by conversation.
So, it's easier for me to comment on the process than the content from last night, Glennis, anything to add I, think just in general, so I'm working from home It's been a lot sorry about the background, noise, my son, so I, don't know what everyone else, but personally, as well, I have happy hours with my family.
So we're hoping that as soon as we're, probably we're thinking that we're gonna fall somewhere into Phase, two or three and No, because they just mentioned summer camps are opening at the end of this month and we have summer times And we have summer programming all summer, long, So I, don't know we're gonna have to cross the bridge when we get to it as of Right.
Now they only said summer camps, but they didn't say that a facility like ours could open, So I think we have to determine and see, and you know, ask people for guidance on it.
You know relative, essentially that if the air city start requesting a whole lot of information about it's like the people, of, Iming, all the Sun right mine, the mayor announced it.
We started getting calls - and then it's just like the gate food program, as we started, making calls other people call and say I heard from my neighbor I heard from my friend: I should get it also, and there are income guidelines on the air-conditioners.
There was a lot of discussion around what we could do for the first bell for the Isabella residence If there are people on the committee and who have neighbors and friends and relatives that would like to donate those kinds of reading, materials, I'm willing to transport them up to , Isabella English in Spanish, English and Spanish ships, mostly Spanish, but We. Only you know, read them my sister and I and I.
So I, don't know it's difficult, but at best the other thing I have on the agenda : Is the long lines at banks and post offices and stores of all kinds and making it very difficult for the seniors and the disabled.
Were all senior They get their security check This is why Julio Batista for some of the community businesses around here, those little markers where you know like if six feet from you know each other and the Apple Bank is very good because they said of chairs individual chairs.
All these services, like my point, is because I know a lot of elderly people.
Is gonna end I need to hoard crazy amounts of food, And I think when that was happening, they were saying: Let's give the seniors an opportunity to get in the supermarket early.
All the stores in my neighborhood I live in Riverdale In, the one hour before the regular business hours of letting people in I had the senior citizens So I, don't know if the rest of the Bronx is still doing.
You know that are doing delivery, including Gordon Gorman, that you can even call them and tell them you a list I, don't think that the early senior hours were made from a central, place.
You know more along the lines of what I need or want all right, I completely understand, that, but I think that in terms of people not going out at this time in terms of being protected in terms of not standing on line, there are limited options: If you buy your food online, and many of us are uncomfortable with that.
They, prefer the Hat food I supposed to call vegetables and things like that Or they have to you, know, take home, and you know and cook, and since, like that We know, a lot of the seniors, come to the Senior Center on economics, right It's not just playing with your friends or participating in an educational class.
I want people to start thinking because you know come September and you know nobody has looked at it.
So everybody is pushing for you know whatever they want, but now that, with this pandemic, we may be thinking about how we go into there or The seniors are going to be drilling.
These senior centers provide services for them, because now that everything is going online for lying and for your mother-in-law, we need, to, you know, see how we can, especially for the early seniors many people between 55 and on, as opposed to the very elderly that are not going to get.
No, that's right and my opinion is always that going through a familiar service like a Senior Center is helpful, but the reality is whether it's us Or it's in which community services or its metropolitan.
I think we need to know what the committee thinks I mean I'm, not involved in senior centers, so much I.
Don't know what do you think for what's linked with mental services, because if we isolate that people may know way too much of them, maybe they won't rank thing.
Let's make the geriatric mental health, I, think we're good on that any announcements, everybody house, no, the only thing, I hope they improve the quality of the food that they deliver.
Know, seniors issues seems like that was from the beginning , I'm, the one that said of this committee.
