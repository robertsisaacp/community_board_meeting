Just a general overview of where we're headed tonight we'll talk a little bit about the overall bus plan and then why we're here, tonight, at 181St, Street, specifically in existing conditions, talk about some of our community engagement efforts, give an overview of the traffic and parking analysis that we're still on undergoing So. As Kim mentioned in June, the mayor announced the restart of our better buses plan as part of the restart nine corridors were identified around the city, five of which were bus ways and then four of which were bus.
We, really wanted to make sure that we were focusing on locations with high concentrations of vulnerable populations, essential workers, people who have been traditionally underserved places where there are a lot of bus passengers, of which 181St street is one ability to implement things fairly quickly and also making sure that we're hitting all parts of the city.
If we take a step back and sort of define what we're talking about when we say busway, it's very similar to what we just recently installed on 14th street, where essentially, buses, trucks and emergency vehicle movements are priori prioritized along the corridor.
Only, trucks, buses and emergency vehicles can travel from end to end on the corridor, so private vehicles and taxis they may get on the street to either park or load or unload, but they must make the next available right turn off of the corridor.
We do quite a lot of data analysis, one of which is taking a look at all of the parking regulations throughout the corridor by analyzing, what's happening on the street and also doing a thorough monitoring before, during and after the busway is installed, so that we make sure that it's working well for everybody involved.
I'm walking as part of the Busway project on 181St DOT has convened a community advisory board or Cab For. The cab consists of local elected officials, the business improvement, district members of Community, Board, 12, transportation, advocates and other important institutions near and along the corridor like Yeshiva University and New York Presbyterian, in addition to the police, department and Fire department who have facilities either on the corridor or nearby.
We did hear that the issue is not so much the fact that there is street vending, but that the way that it's set up in a lot of places really obstructs pedestrian flow and Oftentimes obstructs bus stops, which creates safety issues for people getting on and off the bus, because the bus can not pull all the way to the curb and load and unload passengers.
That means that there are, you know, parking spaces available for the people that need to be there, and this ties into ensuring that we're supporting local businesses on the corridor.
We would evaluate it throughout and come back to the cab and the Community Board before any other final decisions were made, so I'm going to turn it over to Robert Joseph from MTA to talk a little bit about the transit patterns on the corridor and Robert.
I'm, a bus, planner at New, York, City, transit , I'm, going to review a bit of 181St street for you in terms of buses, as many of you are probably aware.
Think Nolan is going to talk a little bit more about some of the travel patterns and how people are traveling back and forth what they're doing all right thanks Robert, so utilizing that data that Robert just mentioned, we compare it to the vehicle.
We know that bus riders actually make up a vast majority of roadway users on 181St street anywhere between 62 and 70 percent, depending on the time of day and location.
We know that they only have a very small amount of dedicated space there's currently bus lane, that's in effect in the evening rush hour going in the eastbound direction, but even when that is in effect, the bus is moving less than three miles.
We want to make sure that we are accommodating people who are coming into the neighborhood, so they can easily access their place of work and simultaneously get around Washington heights.
We know that 6,000 riders are coming from the Bronx during morning rush hour on the buses on 181St street alone, using a data analysis tool called streetlight, which looks at GPS data to study traffic patterns.
Bronx or other major thoroughfares when they're backed up and those are the vehicles that we really want to make sure not just using 181St street when they do not need to be there That is not cut through traffic.
We can likely assume that mode choices are similar on 181St Street, given that we know that the primary users of the corridor are pedestrians and people on buses.
We did hear you know a lot of issues about you know being able to get deliveries and finding space in front of a business because of lack of lack of access to the curb, because there's so much double parking and traffic congestion.
Before we present a final busway plan, we really wanted to make sure we took a hard look at the traffic patterns in the area, given that was one of the primary concerns cited in our initial meeting with the cab.
In addition to some of that street Light data that I mentioned before to analyze what the traffic patterns might be after a bus way is installed.
The model will provide very detailed results about expected bus speed, improvements, in addition to where we think people will go and how that would impact the local street.
That MTA is going to talk to you about after this presentation, the replacement of the elevator for the one train station at 181St, and then the department of design and construction will be installing curb extensions at a couple of intersections on 181St. You know what the construction issues will be, How much road space they need, etc.
At Amsterdam near the Washington Bridge, due to the rehabilitation work, we will actually allow vehicles to come off the bridge, but they would need to make the first right turn at audubon.
I mentioned that we really want to make sure that you know at the beginning of the corridor we're prioritizing buses and trucks on this block, since there is a bus.
You know, takes a look at to make sure that we're balancing those needs, while prioritizing bus service, so in the eastbound direction.
Using you know the services that are on this street, so this will allow to make sure that we have a dedicated space for them, while making sure that you know bus and truck traffic is moving so coming from the other direction.
These cars will have to travel east and west on other streets, and it turns out, as you probably know, quite well and Have all this traffic back and forth to the George Washington Bridge?
I was going to say the same thing along the same lines as Jin mentioned, because the one thing that I was paying close attention to in the presentation was access to side streets in terms of how much the main corridor is, which is 181 right now, going to be shifting all this traffic to these side streets and my concern really is 180Th Street, because, if you're trying to access the Washington Bridge.
What's going to happen on the 180Th Street, when we're offloading all this traffic from 181St, Street, And, I, understand the traffic patterns and the studies will hopefully give us a glimpse into them We want to report back to you with like Exactly how much we think that traffic will increase.
I know that the context is quite a bit different there than here, just given the proximity to the cross Bronx and the highways and the George Washington Bridge, but just an offer of you know of comparison, And I think we've we faced a lot of the similar concerns on 14th street and We had to take considerations on cross Bronx people who driving for the crossroads to get to 181St and Amsterdam.
You know, do exactly as you're saying where we you know, may install cameras to try and count and understand where vehicles are going and how many there are, especially in a location like this, where we know there is quite a lot of traffic angel.
My question is actually going to be about your experience with 17th street, but I think you already kind of touched on that in terms of folks having to bleed into the side.
We, do know that when the cross Bronx gets backed, up, people do try to use 180 first street as a cut through this number encompasses.
You know we want people to stay on the highways as much as possible, rather than causing unnecessary traffic on local streets.
The amount of traffic congestions that we might be exposed, something that perhaps the Eop might also consider, because I do not know if you any cities on the slide that you have, but I think was proposed that you were going to or you intend to widen up the sidewalk.
Imagine that, given what you've mentioned about the you know, kind of community profiles of Washington Heights and a lot of the communities in the Bronx that these bus routes are served, that the numbers are probably higher on the routes going across 181St street compared to some of the other routes.
You have a question for DOT or MTA all told their answer And I'm the senior organizer at Rider's alliance, So I have been attending all the cab meetings for the better bus restart We know that it's going to help a lot of essential workers, which is really important right, now, as we are still continuing to survive in this pandemic, and I.
There's, often congestion around the bus terminal from double parking and around the precinct house near 184Th, where the officers parked willy- So I would like to see a lot more enforcement at the bus terminal and some sort of off- street solution for police parking in order to restore two travel lanes to broadway throughout this area is D.O.T able to look at improving the restoring the two travelings on Broadway as part of this project.
You know the elevators fire and other safety systems, which is kind of one of the later pieces of the project, and the majority of work of the work at 191St Street is complete and then the most recent of the closures was at 190th.
It will tell us, you know when things look like they're going to need some maintenance or preventative maintenance, and then the new versions of this are.
So I just wanted to give that kind of unfortunate update, and let you know that, given I, think that was something that this community board is looking forward.
I think we are going to need to have some real coordination with the bid and with some other city agencies to make sure that the storefronts, the street vendors, you know kind of keep that area largely clear, so pedestrians can get through the block.
First of all I want to thank kimberly for responding so quickly to me and to Debbie and others in the neighborhood who freaked out A lot, and I took some photographs today that I'd just like to go through quickly with you, because I know you'll have to get up early and vote This is a photograph of the where 157 intersects at the end to Riverside and all these stripes are new If you look on the second photograph, that's the front door of 790 Riverside, the riviera, which you can see that the whole corner curb has been extended.
When you cross the street, there's a new median , that's being constructed between 790 and 801, and right down the middle of Riverside, and I'm, not sure how that's going to play.
This is like we're going to have a problem, because every time you do you know most of the time when you're loading there's cars, parked there, so by definition, you're, creating a situation where people have to cross into what's not supposed to be crossed, into, and then, where the concrete is.
If there's any, if DOT, can let us know, if there's any timing available for the changes that were approved for 178Th Street, going from the George Washington Bridge, towards like wadsworth and at Broadway, and if that project has any date for kicking off and or the project that also there was we resolved on down by Riverside to the entrances, to fort Washington, Park, look at 172Nd and where all the all the improvements for the crossings where the the highway lets out or people are entering and Riverside drive.
I know that we've been talking quickly, just trying to kind of see what exactly is going on around there, and I think we had a conversation as far as some other DEP work.
There is no additional kind of certification process for the school to come in, but it is increasing the amount of traffic that will come in right, So like the school building that this school is going to occupy Only because you know it is already going to be December and 700 extra students working in a school.
