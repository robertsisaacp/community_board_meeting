I'm going to just do a count: hi lyle, oops hi. How are you I'm good? I'm good, I'm just trying to do a count on the committee. Omar Jim Mariella, all right, we're just going to wait just a minute or two we can get. We do have six out of 11 of us, so we can get started. I just want to give it one more minute or two and see if we pick up somebody else. We've got from the committee myself, Omar Jim Mariella Bruce Gerard, so I can see how I would look bald if I shave my head Bruce. I also noticed that on Halloween that those that, were you know, cat ear headbands were also did not show up with virtual backgrounds. Who was that lyle, no howie, that was howie. Thank you howie! Well, if you just turned on a picture bruce, then we could see you in the canal, in Venice or under the canal. It used to be the cloisters, but to my notorious rbg blue background, and I have not given up on it, I'm still in mourning over various things. You can imagine Jim all right tomorrow. I will be happy- hopefully no I'm not just- hopefully I believe it from your mouth to God's ear as my mother, all right with that, I think we've been we've been joined by angel. So let's get this started. It's 7.05 calling this meeting to order it's October 5th. This is CB12 Manhattan, traffic and transportation meeting. Did I just say: October 5th, I meant to say, November, 2nd, that's just a little bit. I think I have in my notes from last month, so tonight we are going to start with D.O.T and the 181St Street Busway that we will also, as part of that hear from the MTA because obviously involves them as well, and then we'll have the MTA up after that to talk to us about the elevator replacement process at 181St, Street and and then we're going to there's been a lot of action on one of our old business items this past month. So Bruce is going to take us through and hopefully kimberly. You can stick around right after the MTA presentation. Just so we can talk about what's been going on at 157Th Street, so without further Ado, I'm going to pass this over to kimberly lyle and team kimberly. Do you have what you need for presenting, or did you need anything from Chanel it'll be nolan that would be screen sharing. I think right. Of course, okay looks like I need permission to screen share all right, so Chanel, that's Nolan levinson. If you can just set him up for sharing his screen, sure so Nolan's the project manager on the 181St street best way and I'm from the Manhattan borough commissioner's office for those of you who do not know me, but we are here to give an update today. This is a project I know Nolan's going to give a bunch of background, so I do not want to share all that in advance, but this is a project that was announced by the mayor back in June, along with a number of other bus improvements as part of the better buses restart and we've been working through the summer with a community advisory board, we've had two meetings and we're still working to develop the project. So no one will get into the details, but we're happy to be here tonight and to give you an update on just kind of the background how we got here and what our proposal is looking like at this moment. Does I see Ed's here does Ed want to be promoted, hey hold on what's higher than Manhattan borough. Commissioner, I know I feel very honored. I'm not sure that I've had that here in a traffic and transportation video chanel, if you could just promote Ed Pink Edward Pinkar, please I guess now, he'll have to speak and Nolan. Did you get the screen rights? Are you still waiting, I'm still waiting? It still says that I can't share my screen all right. Chanel am I able to do that all right hold on. If so, I could, I could send it to you. We should be able to get set up hold on that's your co- host now, so maybe that oh yeah, I'm good. I got it now. Yeah hi Ed, I'm Madam Chair. How are you I'm good? I have some screaming babies in the background, so I'm going to go on mute, but I'm here if anyone needs all right, how's that looking that's looking great okay, great yeah, thanks everyone for being here tonight and thanks for having us my name is Nolan Levinson. I am the project manager for the 181St Street Busway project and I'll give a little bit of an overview of what we've been looking at. So far, we've been working with a community Advisory board group of which Deborah has been a part of so she is pretty familiar with what we're showing tonight, but we wanted to give you all a chance to see what we've been working on so far. So just a general overview of where we're headed tonight we'll talk a little bit about the overall bus plan and then why we're here tonight, at 181St, Street, specifically in existing conditions, talk about some of our community engagement efforts, give an overview of the traffic and parking analysis that we're still on undergoing and then we'll show you a preliminary draft busway proposal and then talk about what next steps look like. So, as Kim mentioned in June, the mayor announced the restart of our better buses plan as part of the restart nine corridors were identified around the city, five of which were bus ways and then four of which were bus. Lane projects 181St Street, was selected as one of those busway corridors all of these corridors. I have a few things in common. We really wanted to make sure that we were focusing on locations with high concentrations of vulnerable populations, essential workers, people who have been traditionally underserved places where there are a lot of bus passengers, of which 181St street is one ability to implement things fairly quickly and also making sure that we're hitting all parts of the city. So if we take a step back and sort of define what we're talking about when we say busway, it's very similar to what we just recently installed on 14th street, where essentially, buses, trucks and emergency vehicle movements are priori prioritized along the corridor. While all vehicles may utilize the street. You can see in the picture here on the right. You know there is a personal vehicle there. Only trucks, buses and emergency vehicles can travel from end to end on the corridor, so private vehicles and taxis they may get on the street to either park or load or unload, but they must make the next available right turn off of the corridor and I'll explain a little bit about how that would work on 181St as part of any busway project. We do quite a lot of data analysis, one of which is taking a look at all of the parking regulations throughout the corridor by analyzing, what's happening on the street and also doing a thorough monitoring before, during and after the busway is installed, so that we make sure that it's working well for everybody involved. So why are we looking at 181St Street? Specifically, it is one of the busiest transit corridors in the city for buses, with five different MTA bus routes that carry 42,000 daily riders on the corridor each day and even more throughout the Bronx, the routes on 181St street. They serve neighborhoods with high concentrations of essential workers, as you can see in the map on the top right connecting places. You know in the east Bronx in addition to Washington Heights and Inwood, and bus passengers comprise the majority of people who are actually using the road. So the people on buses make up 62 to 70 percent of roadway users on 181St Street, but the buses move very slowly, which is probably not news to anyone. There's also a lot of traffic average bus speed is less than four miles an hour. We also know that the majority of Washington, Heights and Inwood households do not have access to a car and, for the most part, commute via public transit. I'm walking as part of the Busway project on 181St DOT has convened a community advisory board or Cab and we've convenience for the other, better buses restart projects as well. The cab brings stakeholders together to guide the project before, during and after implementation of the project we have been regularly presenting to the cab for 181St Street. We plan to return to them later this month. For your awareness, the cab consists of local elected officials, the business improvement, district members of Community, Board, 12 transportation, advocates and other important institutions near and along the corridor like Yeshiva University and New York Presbyterian, in addition to the police department and Fire department who have facilities either on the corridor or nearby. So we presented our. We did an initial kind of touch and talk with the Community advisory board in July just to get an understanding of the issues in the neighborhood and we heard sort of five different themes of issues. Both you know on 181St Street and in Washington Heights in general. We really wanted to make sure that we, before we delved into creating a plan. We understood what some of the issues were. So to start, we heard a lot about issues related to street vending, which has been you know very prevalent on the corridor both before and especially during the pandemic times. We did hear that the issue is not so much the fact that there is street vending, but that the way that it's set up in a lot of places really obstructs pedestrian flow and Oftentimes obstructs bus stops, which creates safety issues for people getting on and off the bus, because the bus can not pull all the way to the curb and load and unload passengers. In response to some of those concerns, we could be in a meeting with the bid and small business services to talk about some potential strategies. We also installed some physical infrastructure to help move some of the vendors out of the bus, stop area by installing some city, benches and leaning bars at bus stops, particularly at the intersection of St Nick, and then the other major issue, or one of the other major issues, is making sure that we understand what the effects of a busway would be on traffic, both on the neighborhood streets and some of the other regional roadways around 181St street. Later in the presentation, I'll discuss in more detail about the kind of traffic analysis that we are undertaking, which we have not yet completed but planned to before we present to the cab later this month. We also heard a lot about neighborhood development, a lot of things happening in the neighborhood new development schools, a target. We want to make sure that we're incorporating those things into our analysis. We also want to make sure that you know all of the businesses and various uses on 181St street are accommodated in the design. So that means that there are, you know, parking spaces available for the people that need to be there, and this ties into ensuring that we're supporting local businesses on the corridor. We know that you know it's hard enough being a small business in New York City, as is let alone during a time of pandemic, so we want to make sure that we're working hand in hand with those businesses to address any needs and issues as they arise. So this is an overview of the project timeline. We started with a project kicked off in July, then in July and August, we met with the bid and small business services and developed a draft plan and planned for doing traffic analysis. We presented this plan in September, we're still finishing up the traffic analysis and just trying to understand exactly what the implications of that are. First, before we present back to the cab and we're here now in the fall winter box, where we're you know discussing with you and we're still hoping to potentially install the busway by the end of this year, pending what happens with you know the resources and the weather after the busway is installed. I want to emphasize that this is a pilot, so it would be in the ground for a year. We would evaluate it throughout and come back to the cab and the Community Board before any other final decisions were made, so I'm going to turn it over to Robert Joseph from MTA to talk a little bit about the transit patterns on the corridor and Robert. Just let me know- and I can advance the slides great we'll do. Hi everyone, I'm Robert Joseph, I'm a bus, planner at New, York, City transit, I'm going to review a bit of 181St street for you in terms of buses, as many of you are probably aware. 181St street is one of the busiest corridors in the whole city. Four buses for us at New, York, City, Transit there are over. There are five routes carrying over 40,000 customers, passengers going across 181St street and during peak hours in the morning and in the evening, these very frequent buses. Sometimes there are more than 50 in a particular hour. It's a lot of buses at one particular time and it's worth noting that the the buses connect to a lot of other transportation within the area, including the subway at the one train and the a train, the George Washington Bus station, as well as other buses that run within Manhattan. So this is a very big and critical corridor, as Nolan has already mentioned. Bus speeds along the corridor are among the slowest in the city at 3.7 miles per hour. This is just about the speed that most new yorkers actually walk. If they walk fast and that's not doing our customers bus customers, service, the buses tend to clump together when they're running this slowly and more than about sixty percent of the time. The buses are either crawling along on the street or stopped due to traffic. So traffic has a significant impact on the operation of these buses on 181St Street, and it's important to note that there are about over 40,000 customers just on 181St street traveling, along that street and of those customers about 3,700 of them are just within Manhattan they're, not riding out of Manhattan they're, just riding along 181St Street and not crossing the Washington Bridge not going to the Bronx, and it is also critical to note that a lot of the a lot of the holdups along this route end up being from 181St Street. This is really a bottleneck area for for a lot of bus service, not just in Manhattan but also for the Bronx. So in addition to benefiting the benefiting customers from Manhattan, this is really going to be a massive connection for people within Manhattan to get to the Bronx and people from the Bronx to get to Manhattan. It's a we've seen that 3,500 customers are taking this taking these buses in the morning to go toward the Bronx and 5700 are coming back toward toward Manhattan in the evening. So there are big benefits for for not only the people who are coming in and shopping in, Washington Heights working in Washington Heights, but for the people who live in the neighborhood as well, and I think Nolan is going to talk a little bit more about some of the travel patterns and how people are traveling back and forth what they're doing all right thanks Robert, so utilizing that data that Robert just mentioned, we compare it to the vehicle counts. We know that bus riders actually make up a vast majority of roadway users on 181St street anywhere between 62 and 70 percent, depending on the time of day and location. However, we know that they only have a very small amount of dedicated space there's currently bus lane, that's in effect in the evening rush hour going in the eastbound direction, but even when that is in effect, the bus is moving less than three miles an hour. In addition to serving local residents. We want to make sure that we are accommodating people who are coming into the neighborhood, so they can easily access their place of work and simultaneously get around Washington heights easily. So they can shop and take care of errands visitors to the neighborhood include almost 19,000 people who work in Washington Heights that do not live in the neighborhood, many of who rely on public transit as an example, we know that 6,000 riders are coming from the Bronx during morning rush hour on the buses on 181St street alone, using a data analysis tool called streetlight, which looks at GPS data to study traffic patterns. We are actually analyzing the trends of how people are getting around the neighborhood and the region at large. The data indicate that a significant amount of traffic that is on 181St street is not utilizing the services and businesses on the corridor. Nearly half of the vehicles on 181St Street have a destination other than 181St Street, which means that they can potentially be redirected to other regional connectors rather than the smaller side streets. So these would be folks that potentially are using 181St street instead of the cross. Bronx or other major thoroughfares when they're backed up and those are the vehicles that we really want to make sure not just using 181St street when they do not need to be there so of the 53 that is not cut through traffic, so these are people that have a destination on 181St street itself. We know that, within that subset, 38 are coming from Eastbound, 181St, Street and westbound from the Washington Bridge, which means that a large majority, almost two- thirds of people are actually already coming from a number of the side streets and avenues like Broadway, Wadsworth, Saint, Nick, Audubon and Amsterdam. So really we're concerned with that. You know that 38 percent that may be redirected elsewhere onto local streets and we're trying to analyze exactly how that will you know, be affected and what the effects of the busway would be on those folks. So we do know that, in addition to a lot of traffic there are, you know a lot of people who come to the neighborhood by walking in public transit. A survey conducted by small business services in 2018 indicates that almost 90 percent of people who access businesses in Washington Heights are on foot or use public transit. While this study focused on the Saint, Nick and Broadway corridors, we can likely assume that mode choices are similar on 181St Street, given that we know that the primary users of the corridor are pedestrians and people on buses. Given this mode split the bus, the bus way would support the vast majority of people that access 181St, Street and perhaps even encourage more to come there. So now we're looking at our community engagement tools, we want to make sure that, in addition to speaking to the cab and with you all that we're getting as much feedback as possible from as many stakeholders as possible, so one of the ways we're doing this is through online outreach. We launched a project website. The information is on the link on the slide. We can also share that with you all after the meeting, the site has quite a few resources in terms of what the project entails. The various presentations we've had and perhaps most importantly, has a map- that's pictured here, where you can give feedback about specific locations that may be of concern to you know. We really want to harness that local knowledge to understand what the issues are. We also have a more detailed online survey that is available in both english and spanish. That really tries to get at. You know how people are getting to 181St street, how the busway might affect how they get to 181St Street, and we really want to make sure that this is spread far and wide. So please be sure to share this with your. You know your networks, and we really want to make sure we're hearing from as many folks as possible. We also know that you know the businesses and services on 181St street are really critical and we really want to make sure that you know we're doing what we can to understand what their needs are. Although this was pretty pandemic about a year ago, we did do some outreach to all the businesses on the corridor to learn about their loading and delivery needs. We did hear you know a lot of issues about you know being able to get deliveries and finding space in front of a business because of lack of lack of access to the curb, because there's so much double parking and traffic congestion. So, as we get closer to project implementation, we will be developing a survey specifically for businesses to make sure that we're getting that feedback in real time. This is something that we did for the 14th Street Busway and we found to be very helpful in terms of getting feedback, so we really want to emphasize that you know this is an iterative and ongoing process and, as you know, as the project progresses, we will be making sure that we're tuning in to what people have to say. So before we present a final busway plan, we really wanted to make sure we took a hard look at the traffic patterns in the area, given that was one of the primary concerns cited in our initial meeting with the cab. Fortunately, there was a very complex traffic model that was created by the port authority just a few years ago. In regards to the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal redevelopment project, we were actually able to utilize that model with more recent traffic data that we collected. In addition to some of that street Light data that I mentioned before to analyze what the traffic patterns might be after a bus way is installed, the model will provide very detailed results about expected bus speed improvements, in addition to where we think people will go and how that would impact the local street network. We do want to make sure that we present the results of this to the Community Advisory Board. Before we actually install the project. We also heard a lot specifically about traffic on fridays. We know traffic is consistently an issue, but we know that you know people leaving town on Friday afternoons and evenings swarm the neighborhood. You know it is very gridlocked on all the approaches to the George Washington Bridge, so we want to make sure we're incorporating that fact into the traffic analysis. I mentioned that we're looking at the new development in the neighborhood, the cab it provided five different sites to us to take a look at. We will be using environmental documents and precedents from other projects to build into the model the anticipated increase in trips that are expected from these, even though some of them are, you know, still proposals like the charter school. We want to make sure that you know we analyze sort of what the worst case scenario is. So another really important part of the busway proposal that I mentioned is that we really want to make sure that we get the parking right here, since there are so many demands for the curb. So what we did was a time- lapse. Analysis study, where we take images on all the different blocks: 181st every minute between 6 am and 10 pm for a few days. We did this in January of 2020. The tool really allows us to provide insight on how long people are parked, whether people are illegally parked double parked and the type of vehicles that are there, which really will allow us to cater to exactly what the specific needs are. Obviously, like a restaurant may have a very different parking need than the New York Presbyterian facility, so we're going to be taking a close look at that and presenting that to the Community Advisory board as well. We also know that there is, in addition to some of the you know, the development that we mentioned before. There is construction of infrastructure projects happening in the area. We are coordinating very closely with the units responsible for those. The projects are include the rehabilitation of the Washington Bridge, which has started to see some lane closures, but we'll be going into a more full- fledged rehabilitation. The project that MTA is going to talk to you about after this presentation, the replacement of the elevator for the one train station at 181St, and then the department of design and construction will be installing curb extensions at a couple of intersections on 181St, so we're making sure that we're understanding you know what the construction issues will be, how much road space they need, etc. Okay, so now we're going to take a look, a preliminary look at plans for the busway on 181St Street. Specifically, I do want to reiterate that this is a draft plan. You know we got feedback from the cab in September. We definitely want to continue to get your feedback and also take into account what we find out from the analysis which just is not quite ready yet before making any decisions. So you know keeping that in mind when you ask your questions and I'm also happy to flip back to any of the specific locations or slides to answer any questions so starting in the eastbound direction. We would start the bus way at Broadway with more of what I'll call a sort of like hard gate treatment. So this means that the first block between Broadway and wadsworth would be bus and truck only and just in the eastbound direction, while the remainder of the eastbound blocks would permit local access so everywhere, east of wadsworth, which means vehicles, can travel only one block before they make a right turn in the westbound direction. At Amsterdam near the Washington Bridge, due to the rehabilitation work, we will actually allow vehicles to come off the bridge, but they would need to make the first right turn at audubon or they can. You know, make the existing left turn in Amsterdam if they need to go somewhere else. Besides 181St street, the following slides will show you know each of these in more detail. I do want to emphasize that you know we do not know exactly quite yet when the busway hours will be so we know that it won't be. In effect, you know 24 7., so we will be presenting that proposal to the cab at our next meeting with them, so I'll go through block by block each of the locations for all of them. The blue arrows that you see here show all the permitted movements both in the existing and then what will be the proposed condition. As you can see, this is the block between Broadway and wadsworth. There is an eastbound bus lane along the south, curb that's true for the whole corridor and the bus stop. There's a bus stop on the south side of the curb. This is here for the whole block, but other than that you know, movements are allowed in every direction at Wadsworth and Broadway. So this is a proposed alignment for what the busway would potentially look like on this block, so starting at Broadway. I mentioned that we really want to make sure that you know at the beginning of the corridor we're prioritizing buses and trucks on this block, since there is a bus stop on the south curb here. There really is not a reason that anything, but a bus or truck should be accessing this. The eastbound part of the street, so we will be banning the right turns off of Broadway left turns off of Broadway and the through movement from 181St headed eastbound in the westbound direction. The street will function almost exactly the same as it does today, since all of the buses they make. This left turn heading westbound on 181St and they make the left turn onto Southbound wadsworth. However, we would restrict this turn from wadsworth or sorry from 181St on to Southbound wadsworth to buses. Only this would allow us to prioritize bus service on this street and make sure that we're not gumming up Wadsworth avenue too much so east of wadsworth. The more typical busway treatment would begin. Vehicles from Wadsworth may turn on to eastbound 181St Street, but they must make the next right turn on to Saint Nicholas. I do want to highlight here- and this is true on all of the blocks you'll see. There are parking lanes on both sides of the curb so essentially anywhere where there is not a bus, stop you would still be allowed to park, load and unload depending on what the needs of the businesses are. So this is a look at the current conditions at St Nicholas. Currently, there are a number of turn restrictions at St Nick, all the turns from St Nicholas are banned, so you can not turn on from Saint nick onto 181St. You can not make left turns from 181St onto Saint Nick in order to facilitate local access on every block, we'll actually be removing the right turn restriction from Saint Nick onto 181St Street. This will make sure that people can get to where they need to go on that street, as we mentioned before. Any vehicle that arrives here either from the east on Audubon or the west at Worth, will have to make a right turn off a corridor unless you're a bus or truck. So if you're, traveling, east and you're here, you must make this right turn on to St Nick at all. The bus stop locations you'll see that it kind of looks like there's a double bus lane. The reason for this is that the lane along the sidewalk is a bus stop location. So we want to make sure that there is a lane for travel, whether it be four bus buses passing one another or trucks or whoever else is turning onto the corridor to be able to get around those buses that are at stops. So this is a look at the audubon to Amsterdam segment of the corridor. We are sensitive to the various unique services on this block. We have the firehouse the postal service, the potential New school. The new development at 2420 Amsterdam are all things to consider here. So the Busway plan, as I'll show here you know, takes a look at to make sure that we're balancing those needs, while prioritizing bus service, so in the eastbound direction. All of the traffic that came from saint nicholas, that's where my cursor is here, would have to make the right turn at audubon. Buses and trucks, however, would continue straight to keep going towards the Washington Bridge vehicles coming either north or south on audubon can make all the same movements that they do today if they are coming south and they turn right towards saint nick, they can travel on the street for one block and they must turn as saint nick or if they're coming south and they're heading east on 181St street, towards Amsterdam or if they're coming north and heading east, they actually will be able to continue on to the Washington Bridge here or make the right turn. However, we will be restricting the left turn from eastbound 181St onto northbound Amsterdam in will probably be an improvement over the existing condition. Today, on the south curb you can see that we now have a space for parking and loading. This is where the existing bus lane is today, and it is constantly blocked by various vehicles using you know the services that are on this street, so this will allow to make sure that we have a dedicated space for them, while making sure that you know bus and truck traffic is moving so coming from the other direction on the Washington Bridge. So if you're headed westbound you're approaching Amsterdam, you can make all of the movements that you do currently today, so you can make a right or left on Amsterdam or you can continue straight on to 181St. However, if you continue straight on to 181St, you must make the next right turn at Audubon, Avenue other than that all of the other movements maintain the same if you're coming north and south on Amsterdam, you can continue to make right or left turns, except in the northbound direction and, as I mentioned before, the eastbound left turn from 181St onto Amsterdam would be restricted. So in summary, the extent of the busway would be from broadway to Amsterdam in the eastbound direction and from Amsterdam to wadsworth in the westbound direction. I want to emphasize again that local access would be permitted on all of the blocks, except for eastbound, between Broadway and wadsworth. Parking will be available for pickup and drop- off activity, short- term parking and loading and unloading, we're still determining the busway hours, and we do plan to make some tweaks based on feedback. We hear tonight from the cab from the survey, in addition to the traffic analysis, so I know I went over a lot tonight, so I definitely want to make sure we get back and are able to answer questions, but I do want to just give an overview of kind of where we're headed here we do want to. You know, hear what you all have to say this evening. We want to complete the traffic analysis and parking study before any final decisions are made. Same, goes for reviewing the online feedback we receive and we will definitely be sharing back any revised proposal both to the cab and to you all before installing the project. So I'm happy to you know flip back to any slides. I know it's a lot of info, so let me know if you have any questions and thanks everyone for listening. Thank you. No one, that's an enormous amount of work, an enormous amount of information. So let's just get to questions so, starting with the committee. I've got, I have my hand up, yeah. Okay, I can see you so Jim. You go ahead, followed by Omar, okay. Thank you very much and thank you so much for your very interesting presentation. I've lived in this neighborhood, my entire life, and if you see me on the screen, you know that's been quite a while 181St Street has been a mess, since there were trolley cars there and I actually vaguely remember them anyway. There are sort of two issues. One of them is that by the time you were done and again it's just not that you, the explanation was truly excellent, but you know my eyes were glazed glazing over just because the plan is so complicated. Now you know it's almost like you'd have to and I'm being a little bit facetious. You have to publish this whole long list of things at the beginning. You know of the street explaining people all the rules so that you know I mean you know and again I'm impressed with the fact actually that you've been able to come up with a plan at all, because this has been a bane in the existence of this community board in this community forever. Now. The other thing is all the cars that are being discouraged from driving on 181St street or being pushed off very quickly. These cars will have to travel east and west on other streets, and it turns out, as you probably know, quite well and if you want to put that slide up, you can most of the parallel streets. Have a variety of complications like 179Th, Street and 178Th Street. Have all this traffic back and forth to the George Washington Bridge? That's already there 180Th, Street and 182Nd Street, because eventually people are going to be able to go north also, and they do that when they turn it at audubon, they're, very narrow, 183Rd street is a wider street and it's actually 2-way. I believe the other complication- and this is very significant- is along those streets, including 179th and 186Th and 183Rd there's a total of something like six or something schools, and even though you know not all the kids in school at the moment, you know we do not want people who are frustrated barreling down these streets in the vicinity of school buildings. So now- and I I'm almost done the thing that actually works in your favor for this plan is 181St. Street is so awful. Probably most people with cars try not to drive on it anyway, so it may be. You know there won't be that many cars to drive off of 181St Street so that you know it may work in everyone's favor. But again I congratulate you for the efforts you've made and I just wanted to make those two points. Nolan do you want to say anything about Jim's point? I think I know you covered some of that in the sort of the amount of traffic. That's already moved off the corridor of the from the private vehicles right. I think I think Jones Point is well taken. You know. One thing that the traffic analysis will determine is you know just how much that increase is, I think, we're definitely sensitive to the increase on the side streets, especially 180th and 182nd, which are much more narrow than a lot of the other alternatives. So we'll definitely, you know continue to take that into consideration and appreciate the point Omar yeah, I was going to say the same thing along the same lines as Jin mentioned, because the one thing that I was paying close attention to in the presentation was access to side streets in terms of how much the main corridor is, which is 181 right now going to be shifting all this traffic to these side streets and my concern really is 180Th Street, because, if you're trying to access the Washington Bridge, all of this is driving traffic towards that type of street. Where you can get on 180 and go straight across eastbound then try to take the left to go up towards the Washington Bridge. So that's my concern is that, what's going to happen on the 180Th Street, when we're offloading all this traffic from 181St Street and I understand the traffic patterns and the studies will hopefully give us a glimpse into them, yeah. I think you know again that's something that we're definitely taking a close look at, and I do think we want to report back to you with like exactly how much we think that traffic will increase. One thing I can say is that you know in our experience on 14th street, which really is sort of the best comparison is that you know we really did not actually see a very large increase in traffic on the side streets after implementation. I know that the context is quite a bit different there than here, just given the proximity to the cross Bronx and the highways and the George Washington Bridge, but just an offer of you know of comparison and I think we've we faced a lot of the similar concerns on 14th street and those did not fully bear out so just something to keep in mind, but we'll definitely be looking at that. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at keeping the order of the hand, so I'm just going to go in the order on my screen, robin and just Robin, I think, was at one of the cabs. If not both good evening, everybody also, we had to take considerations on cross Bronx people who driving for the crossroads to get to 181St and Amsterdam Avenue is a lot of traffic and there's a chaos every day after five or maybe in the morning. Also, it's crazy. So what you're going to do with that? We use you guys, take a consideration and take out like put cameras in there and take analysts analyses about the traffic in there 181St. So we no, I think, you're muted, myself, yeah! You know I think again. Those are really good points our. So our traffic analysis is using pretty recent traffic data from the end of last year to inform how we figure out. You know where we think traffic might go. One of the things that comes along with this kind of project is really intense traffic monitoring. So after it is installed, we do actually, you know do exactly as you're saying where we you know, may install cameras to try and count and understand where vehicles are going and how many there are, especially in a location like this, where we know there is quite a lot of traffic angel. Oh, my question is actually going to be about your experience with 17th street, but I think you already kind of touched on that in terms of folks having to bleed into the side street. So I think I'm good there. What percentage do you think I mean? I do not know how you all would track this of the traffic is folks that are getting off of I-95 and trying to get across on a local route during like the super busy time that is I-95 almost 24 hours a day. Yeah, that's a very good question, so I mentioned this tool that we have yeah, so I apologize. I do not have that number offhand, but part of this analysis that I showed here about cut through traffic comes from exactly analyzing routes like that. We do know that when the cross Bronx gets backed up, people do try to use 180 first street as a cut through this number encompasses. You know every possible route. You know that someone might be using 180. First, three is a cut through, but we do think that it is a pretty significant number. Obviously you know we want people to stay on the highways as much as possible, rather than causing unnecessary traffic on local streets. You know, fixing the issues with the cross. Bronx is a little out of scope for us. Unfortunately, but you know we do know. That is really where we want to make sure you know the neighborhood in Washington Heights should not have to. You know, bear the brunt of that just because people do not feel waiting in traffic like there's the neighborhood's congested enough as it is without the extra traffic from that right. So it seems like. Hopefully you said that you did mention in the presentation that this would be a one- year pilot, so with some hope we can change some behavior within that one year. So going back to the pilot it's one year and then we revisit procedurally speaking, I'm thinking now like we revisit, you give us a report on how things are going and then we decide whether we like it or not. Is that did I get that right? Maybe that's a question for Debbie, I'm new to the to the to the board, nolan, so yeah, you know and we're doing quite a few of these projects around the city. So I think that the process is definitely evolving. Right, like the cab process is not something we typically do, but that is the sort of general idea, and I think you know we would probably come back more frequently than just after a year, maybe have multiple check- ins throughout yeah. In general I mean we, including these kinds of projects like any of the other projects we put in. The monitoring is ongoing and sort of reporting back is as well, and if there are major issues it's not like, we would wait until a year later to try to resolve them. So it's a more iterative process than that, especially now that we're looking to kind of keep the community advisory boards ongoing throughout the for pilot period discussion. Thank you. Those are my questions. Next, I'm going to move on to that's it from the committee and I'm going to seizure. Medina has his hand up. Thank you. David for bringing this up to our community also nolan great presentation. As always, I'm a fan of our great presentations that you have done that as we have discussed this in previous locations, we are a little bit concerned from a economic development perspective on the amount of our traffic spots that might be affected as we move forward. As you know, I have brought this up in different locations. I'm happy that the intersection between was fourth and broadway. Those parking spots are not going to be affected, so that's something that sorry that we would like to keep because parking on this area is paramount. So I'm happy that those are not going to be touched touched also along the same lines as Jim Berlin. We are a little bit concerned about the overflow of traffic moving westward on 182Nd. We pride ourselves very much in keeping the state of our students much in check and it's something that we would like to see the analysis once we go through the year of as a test. We also understand that this community should be open to have a clean air. We have been exposed to a lot of our pollution from the current traffic that we have been being exposed not only through one in the first, but also through the carrier of 95.. We also understand that we have 42,000 writers just on 181St, but we also must take into account that they are the perpendicular avenue of Amsterdam saint nick. What's up Amsterdam, sorry, Amsterdam, snake broadway and for Washington also have boss lanes and those are contributing factors that will also take into account. I'm happy that you tell us later on the traffic the password hours when that will be in effect, because once we know the hours of the you know the bus way that will also be applied to other turning points, turning signals. So once we have a clear understanding when that's going to happen, then we can add those parking pass spots back into the small businesses that we have in the area. Also a bit concerning nolan on 180F, going eastward between Saint Nick and otter, one there will be a new supermarket there, and I know that that's going to bring some traffic as well and all the traffic that would be directed through 181St Renault to 180 street, going eastbound towards the Bronx. So that's an area that we are also a little bit concerned because, as you move east from San Nicolas up to Amsterdam, as you approach, Amsterdam there'll be a parking garage entrance there to the new hotel there. So I have proposed that perhaps we can make part of 180 street and Amsterdam a short two- way street we're talking about less than maybe 100 to maybe 150 feet Max, so that folks, who will want to go into the parking garage, will not have to come around and pollute the neighborhood and could congest our community improv. You know having more traffic, so I think that can dilute a little bit. The amount of traffic congestions that we might be exposed something that perhaps the Eop might also consider, because I do not know if you any cities on the slide that you have, but I think was proposed that you were going to or you intend to widen up the sidewalk. And if that's the case, we a little bit concerned from the business perspective. Even though the governor's, the major plan is to open up our storefronts for businesses. That in itself can bring congestion for our pedestrians, because that will be in conflict with some of the street vendors that we have so once we have the storefronts allowing them to open up and sell the merchandises in from the stores, along with the number three students that we have in the community, in that this area might not make this an accessible sidewalk. So I hope that somehow we can work on the street furniture that D.O.T my think of providing to our community. Besides the other benches, and all of that. But I'm happy that it's going to be a pilot, a program for one year and we're looking forward to working with DOT and see how we can make this work, I'm fully supportive of this project. I understand that by diluting the traffic we were going to open up money first in case of emergency gas for business emergency 181St firefighters will not be able to go and respond to that emergency because it's so congested from next. You know four o'clock to perhaps seven o'clock at night, so I'm happy procedure, let's just wrap it up. I'm happy that you're doing this. I'm supportive of this and I'm looking forward to see about the analysis that you present us in a year. Thank you, Nolan! Thank you thanks, dylan all right, so we have three people amongst our attendees who would like to comment I'll just remind people that oh late arrival Gerard go for it quick question, two questions, one related to the models and then maybe some things that were done down on 14th street and is there an attempt to do similar things up here? Models? How kimberly mentioned that over the next year? They'll be like a consistent look at what's happening and you know things will be modified or looked at as time progresses. What have you done to the models to take into account actually increase traffic into the city without really an increase in population, because people do not want to get on different forms of transit, as well as just the reduction in people coming into these places? So are you modifying models actually and you'd have to modify it because your models, pre- covered, if they have not been adjusted, really might not be the right model to take into account the new traffic, I'm not going to say patents but the number of cars? So that's one question: what do you? What are you all doing to modify your models? Postcovid? It may be another year, maybe even more before occupancy into the city even gets close to what it was. So that's one question, and I know that on 14th street there were different modifications to some of those street traffic patterns following that 14th street. That was, you know, had people really disrupted, they were on streets that traditionally had gone certain ways and changed. So are there any plans to do something similar like that? The next three to four months after you do this that we're not hearing about or that it's still you're something you're thinking about? So those are my two questions sure I think you raised a really good point with the coronavirus questions and the traffic model, and I think no one can speak to that a little bit. It's certainly a challenge for us as far as collecting data that can be meaningful and then just to touch on the 14th street projects. Some of the changes that we've made following the implementation would be signal, timing, changes and looking at where we could add turn lines or things like that to adjust issues that we see and that's sort of as we observe and as we get data after the fact we can. We can look at where there might be problem areas and see what kind of tweets can be made, but it's really site- specific and depends on what ends up happening. As you move forward, but no one, I do not know if you have any additional response to the question yeah the Covid-19 question is a good one and it you know it is a little bit tricky because the situation does change. You know it's a little bit of a moving target, but one thing I can say is that you know in a lot of cases we actually have like automated. So on the Washington Bridge, for example, we have automated traffic counters on it, so we can actually see what the fluctuations are week to week and compare that to some of the counts that we got before Covid-19 to kind of get an understanding of what you know what the fluctuation is like. I can say that, and I do not have the specific numbers on hand. You know a lot of the bridges, the Harlem river bridges, East river bridges are pretty much back at their pre- covered traffic levels. Certainly anybody who's. You know you all know, but the time that I've spent near 181St street you know still looks just as congested as ever to me, and we do know too that you know. Bus ridership is definitely back in a big way, not necessarily at its pre- covet levels. But I do not know if transit knows sort of the latest percentages offhand, but there still are quite a lot of people on the buses. Even if you know there are concerns about Covid-19, so we do want to make sure that you know we're taking the adjustments in traffic into a consideration, but also you know want to make sure that we're still prioritizing transit service. I'm. Actually that reminded me that I did have a question sort of, but along the lines of what you just mentioned, nolan, if MTA could give us an idea of what what's the bus percentage right now and if you have it on these five routes in those 42,000 people. What's do you have any sense for the percentage on those routes that are crossing 181St street? Because if I'm, if we're following the data and we're, if you know the setup of this presentation, was that we're somewhat over represented with essential workers with non- car owners and all that, so I'm just curious, if you have that number and if you do not have that number, if you have any sense of like if it's sort of come back more than the other bus routes, if is Robert still here, Howie Debbie, yes over here, I'm looking into the numbers, I do not have specific numbers on these five routes, but I am looking at the proportion of bus ridership that has come back yeah debbie overall, the system seen. I think it's about we're about 50 or about half. I think it fluctuates a lot which is better than subway ridership. I imagine you know I do not know, but I imagine that, given what you've mentioned about the you know, kind of community profiles of Washington Heights and a lot of the communities in the Bronx that these bus routes are served, that the numbers are probably higher on the routes going across 181St street compared to some of the other routes. In the city, but I think we could probably look into that and see what we can dig up and get back to you with thanks all right. Well, we are this, is you know turning out to be a long topic and rightfully so? But let's move on to our attendee group, I'm just going to do it again on the order that they're on my screen, so apologies. If I'm getting some of you out of order, I'm going to start with Joliece, then Phil, Anna, David and Daario, and so just as a reminder. People have two minutes. If you have a question for DOT or MTA all told their answer and you're talking can't be more than three so with that joliece hi. If you just want to unmute you're there, oh there we go. Can you hear me yep hi? My name is Joliece race. I am a I'm the senior organizer at Rider's alliance, so I have been attending all the cab meetings for the better bus restart and I just want to say that this is a really great plan and thank you so much for going over everything. You know this plan is going to help 42,000 daily riders and we know that it's going to help a lot of essential workers, which is really important right now, as we are still continuing to survive in this pandemic, and I just had a quick question about implementation because there has been some people think that this has been starting to get implemented. But we have not had any clue about whether it's been started. Implementation has started because I know that weather is getting really cold. It was very cold today. So I just want to know like realistically like what are the chances we're going to have to wait until next year to see this busway completed right. So we that's a great question. Obviously we're getting closer to the end of marking season and we are working through a lot of projects. We've still been trying to. You know finalize the development here we wanted to have the community board's feedback and we look forward to incorporating that and some of the other information that we've been gathering into the final plans and we'll keep you posted as we as we move forward and hope to have updates really soon about that. Thank you, Thanks Julius Phil good evening. Thank you to the DOT and MTA for bringing this plan forward as one of the majority of uptown residents who do not own a car and travel between Manhattan and the Bronx be the best frequently. I'm just very excited to see this excited that the this plan does seem to be prioritizing bus riders over the people that are cutting through on the way to the gwb. Having visited the 14th Street Busway really did make a much more pleasant, pedestrian experience down there very quiet and the fact that traffic did not seem to be diverted to side streets, but instead, just disappeared from the network was great. On the Covid-19 note, I do think it's great that faster buses with less bunching is definitely good. Getting those buses moving allows. You know for less crowding. I would definitely urge MTA and city DOT to really opt for very strong, automated enforcement and I'd like to hear a little bit about that as up on 207Th street. The bus lanes are perpetually blocked by parked cars. It also cares if it was considered to extend the Busway to fort Washington Avenue to connect to the a thanks for bringing this proposal. Thank you, yeah. That's a good question. I can talk a little bit about the automated enforcement. We do. You know on almost all the bus ways we have enforcement cameras so that it is automated to make sure that, it's being you know, the rules are being obeyed. We do also when we launch these projects. We do tend to have traffic enforcement agents at a lot of the key intersections to make sure that you know there's a period where people are learning and understanding what the you know. The new changes are getting people accustomed to it, so it is not such a sort of like quick turn on and then all of a sudden everyone's getting tickets. So there is definitely a learning process there, but I do think we definitely would like to see automated enforcement here. I can't say for sure when we would install cameras here, but it is something we're looking at. Thank you, Anna, oh and I'm going to promote you to a panelist for a moment. Apparently you have old zoom hold on all right, hey! Thank you so much for taking my question. Actually, I used the enhanced 14 street version as a driver, and I think it was great. I think it worked out great, so I'm sure the 181St will work out as well. So thank you Nolan, but my question is about the horrible backup. That's happening right at this moment on Broadway Northbound Broadway between Negligence backed up all the way to 181St because they expanded somebody expanded the sidewalk outside the post office and now the car and there's also a construction project going on so the cars just can not get through and it includes ambulances and fire trucks. So I know this is not the scope of this meeting, but if you can direct me to where I can address it, because if they base it on the same models that you guys have been using, then I then the models are obviously not working. That's it thanks! Anna do you have to maybe we could sort of circle back to this in old business and just talk about. If you have any information on the work, that's sort of just completed there and then the continuing traffic. I think that might be the better way to do this. Thank you. Thanks, Anna, okay, next up I've got Dave Tom Hi. Can you hear me? Okay, yeah great hi as a resident of upper Manhattan, and even as one who does own a car? I just wanted to express my support for this and similar projects please build more of these traffic is elastic. Better management of our curb and traveling space is desperately needed, and this is a good thing to try to improve matters. I do have a specific question, also about broadway, which will likely be receiving some additional traffic volume. There's often congestion around the bus terminal from double parking and around the precinct house near 184Th, where the officers parked willy- nilly all over the place. So I would like to see a lot more enforcement at the bus terminal and some sort of off- street solution for police parking in order to restore two travel lanes to broadway throughout this area is D.O.T able to look at improving the restoring the two travelings on Broadway as part of this project. I do not know that's something that we're considering at this point, but I think it'll be a little clearer for us after we have the results of the model, the traffic analysis and as we monitor following implementation of the project. Certainly, if we see additional backups in that location, we can look at what's going on there and whether there are there are solutions to adjust it thanks kimberly, I think the fact that you guys are looking broadly, we will be taking advantage, as you can tell with some of that data. I think across some of the you know the adjacent issues. So I think that's a good point that Dave and Anna are making, both of which, I think can be informed by you know we can piggyback what we're going to get from this project. Yeah. Let's see all right with that. I think that covers this project. Thank you so much to the DOT team and to robert from MTA next we're going to move into the conversation about the 181St Street elevator replacement on the irt line, and then I will, as a reminder, be asking kimberly and lyle and whoever else and ed if he wants to to stay for old business, because we do have a few things. Obviously, that that we'll be wanting to ask about and follow up on, and so let me see who do I need to get promoted howie still. I forget that I can do it. So just let me know if I've got all your people where they need to be no worries. I think we're all where we need to be okay, I'm just looking through yeah if they could stop the screen sharing. So we could see one another right, yeah and if sorry, everyone yep I'm on it, yeah go oh hi, Richard, Allman, Hi, Mary and then I'll. Try sharing my screen but yep it's disabled right now. So I think we need to make me a co- host, so I can share the presentation perfect. Thank you thanks Chanel, all right. Can everyone see the presentation? Yeah perfect well, good evening, everyone. You know it's in all 181St street night here at the committee, I'm Howie Levine government relations at MTA, New, York, City transit for those who do not know me. I'm joined tonight by Robert Joseph, who was presenting in the earlier presentation, he's one of our bus planners and also Avarga Bay. Who is our construction manager on this project as well, and so they really are experts on this and I'm going to go through the presentation and just to start just want to talk a little bit about kind of where we've been this. Is you know the fifth and final of these deep station elevators that we're going to be replacing as part of this project? So you know, of course, going back to 268Th Street, which was the first of these, which you know we closed early in January last year and then reopened ahead of schedule, December 20th last year, and just some photos here of the news station, then, after that these are in chronological order, after that we close the elevators at 181St Street on the a in August of last year, and then we reopened them right on schedule in August of this year, despite the pandemic kind of interrupting and changing some things with the construction process, you have kind of the before picture on the right and the after picture now on the left, and then we have the two that are still in progress. This is 191St Street on the one station. This is a picture on the right of what it looks like right now. You know we're here because we're on track to finish this elevator closure ahead of schedule. Right now we're currently testing you know the elevators fire and other safety systems, which is kind of one of the later pieces of the project, and the majority of work of the work at 191St Street is complete and then the most recent of the closures was at 190th on the a, and this is a picture of it right now the we closed that in August late August of this year, we're currently still removing all the kind of deteriorated parts of the machine room and repairing the elevator shaft, where it needs to be repaired. We're still on schedule for reopening this elevator it's in September of next year, which I know everyone's looking forward to so now over here really present on 181St street on the one. So, as I think most of you know, the station opened on night in 1906, listed on the U.S register of historic places. The elevators go 122 feet below ground and that's the picture of the elevators at the upper mezzanine at 181St Street. So just the kind of scope of work is very similar to what we've been doing on all of these elevators. In the past. You know just increasing the overall reliability of the elevators, replacing you know the elevators themselves, the machine room, really all equipment associated with the elevators and then also renovating and repairing the elevator shafts, the machine room and kind of a more structural sense whenever it needs to be repaired, we're going to be installing a new lift net system which will improve our instant response time. Just to remind folks that is the system that tells us, you know what's wrong with an elevator when it breaks down- and you know, with the newest system, it will tell us, you know when things look like they're going to need some maintenance or preventative maintenance, and then the new versions of this are we have this on all of our elevators and escalators in the system, but the newest, elevators and escalators have the newest lift net, which sends us much more information which lets us. You know maintain the elevators better and lets us repair them quicker by knowing just exactly what's wrong. What parts we need, what personnel we need on scene we'll also be adding a system which allows passengers to exit the elevators during a loss of power to the station. You know just one, which is just it's pretty simple as a battery backup that we keep as part of the system. Just you know in case there's a loss of power any for any reason. Passengers will be able to exit the elevators, we're also doing communication system upgrade, which you know, you'll notice, most with the two security cameras in each elevator. So there won't be any blind spots in those elevators try and make them as safe as possible, and then, lastly, one piece of 181St street that is unique compared to the other elevators projects. We've done is you know, inaccessibility and circulation, enhancements achieved by bringing the elevator all the way down to directly to the northbound platform, and so I'm going to go into that in a bit more detail right now. So this is a diagram of the station right now. This is the elevator right here, the elevator shaft, which has staircases behind it right now the elevator comes to the lower mezzanine. You walk out here. If you want to go to the northbound platform, there are stairs right here. If you're going downtown, you walk across the bridge down these stairs and then down other stairs right here. These are the this is the these. Are the tracks right here, and so that's the current condition. That's what it looks like right now, and so once we're completed with this project. What it's going to look like is this: where there will be this extra stop on the elevator right here right on the northbound platform, and of course you know, this is not going to make the station even the northbound platform accessible. You know, but it is a will, be an important step in future accessibility at the station and just to give you more context, because I know you know for some of us- we maybe have not been in the station for a while. This is what it looks like right now, so this is looking at the northbound platform. These are the stairs that I had called out in the with the arrow, and these doors right here in this brick is: what's going to be opened up and will be an entrance for podesta for customers to exit and enter the elevators from directly from the platform, and just so, you can see a little bit better sense on the right. You know just get the right. This picture right here is that bridge, and so right here is where that door is it'll be opened up. In addition, it's not actually just going to be the main door right there as it is above it right now, there's actually side doors as well that if you go to the station you'll notice it's a little bit of a different brick than the rest of the station, and so it was, I think, closed up at a later time, and so of course the you know the bad news which is to do this work. We need to close the station completely because the elevators are the only way to get to the platform, and so we're going to be starting. Our work in this closure on December 5th of this year and so the again it's a 12-year closure as it's been planned for all of these, and so we'll go through December of 2021.. So, while this is happening, you know we need to get our customers to one line service, so existing M3, which you know is currently running 24 7 right now, with the subway closed overnight, is going to provide service to the one and a train for 181St street customers, we're going to be monitoring service and adding additional m3 buses when needed, which will just travel between 168Th, Street and 191St Street, so bringing customers you know either in the downtown direction, to both the 1 and a and c trains and uptown. If they're, headed uptown to 191St, Street, M1, Weekday Frequency ranges between every 6 to 10 minutes and, as I mentioned, running every 20 minutes overnight right now during the subway overnight closure. Additionally, the M 101 also remains an option for those traveling on to locations on Amsterdam, like yeshiva university, that always trav always is available. 24 7 and weekday frequency ranges between 8 and 11 minutes. One thing: that's a little different about this closure compared to our past closures and I'll go through this thoroughly and kind of orient people. Is that because of because this station only has the elevator entrance- and you know the only one entrance the the mpt here or the space we need to take on the street feels a little more onerous. I would say, because previously we've been able to split it up between both entrances, where you'd have half of it at the elevator entrance that was closed and half of it stationed at the tunnel entrance and the only place where that was not possible. Previously was 168Th Street, but we had the kind of you know broader intersection, where we could use some space in the middle of the intersection without disrupting you know, businesses and customer flow too dramatically. So this is the proposed mpt for 181St street. While we're doing our work here. This is we're facing up so up on this drawing this is 181St street. This is saint nicholas, so up is facing West North is over here, and so these job yards right here just to be clear, are going to be for material storage. There's not going to be really any work happening in these areas, just because the station, as I think everyone's aware, is pretty small in terms of the spaces that it has available. It's. We just need to store our materials on the street, and so we need that storage to be as close to the entrances as possible. This is the mid- block entrance right here, so right in front of this job yard, and then the other one is right here right at the other on- street entrance to the station and so and then right here is also our third job yard, where we have a ventilation shaft right here, and so we have some work in that ventilation shaft as part of this project as well, and so that is, unfortunately, there are three different spots that we are going to be needing to take up some street space and we can go through the presentation. I'm sure we'll be coming back to discuss this a little more when I'm finished, but I'll leave it there for now, and so so because of these street spaces we'll be taking up. There are a few bus. Stop changes we need to make. The first is the northbound M3 stop at 181St. Street is going to be bypassed, so I'm going to skip back for a second if you'll notice, that stop is normally right here and then right where this job yard is, we looked at. You know, adding another stop, but really it we're it's. So it's so close to 179th street stop 480 feet as this slide notes that we've just let it be right for now and you can either you know, get off 179Th street or at the 184Th street stop which is just off this slide as well, which is a little farther away, but if your location is north of 181St street, that would be better for you. Additionally, the because of where that ventilation shaft is that I mentioned the bus, stop that is on that corner, which is the Bx3 and the Bx36 is going to be relocated to kind of merge, with the existing Bx11 Bx13 and Bx35 stop on the southwest corner of the intersection, and so right now that stop is 100 feet. We're going to be, and this stop is 85 feet. We're going to be adding the 85 feet from over here to this, stop to get us at 185 feet, stop over there for the length of this closure, and so just revisiting our timeline of these projects. This is pre- pandemic, so it has not been updated to reflect certain changes, but of course this was originally scheduled to begin in March we've been able to accelerate it to December. When you know over in this period with lower ridership inconvenience, fewer riders is our hope and kind of get out of everyone's hair as soon as possible. The biggest change- I would note really to this slide is that previously we had planned to start the escalator replacement at 181St street in March of next year or March of Sorry 2022, when we were completely finished with the elevators, because we do not, we did not want to do it at the same time. As you know, for many of these stations, the escalator entrance at 181St Street was an alternative, but unfortunately the escalator replacement is part of a separate contract and so is currently on hold as long as well as with most of our other capital projects. Unfortunately, so I just wanted to give that kind of unfortunate update, and let you know that, given I think that was something that this community board is looking forward to. So you know just to thank you, that's what we have tonight. You know, as always, we have our website our project page for this project, and you can always find information there as well. Thank you, howie yeah. I was kind of wondering when the first bad news would arrive about the already you know was also already. We did not know where 40 billion was coming from and now we really do not know where 40 billion was coming from. That's a hit Jim, I think, and then Robin. I just wanted to comment that when I was a kid the elevators went to that lower level. So that shows that I mean that was all part of the design of the station, but it's so good that you you've been retrieving these things. You also did the back doors on some elevators and stuff, like that. So you want to be complimented to. You know, take advantage of all the old remaining cleverness that you can. Thank you, our pleasure Jim. You know, let us know if you dig up any pictures of the station back then or the trolleys I did not have a camera. I was a little kid. You should have one camera Jim Robin. I come to my concern that you said you guys going to take some part of the street and some part of the sidewalk to put your equipment, but also, if you take into consideration that the merchants also have part of the sidewalk. So you do you think the Lichen pedestrians will be able to walk without no problems. Let me mute myself first, so let me just go back to that slide yeah. So we currently have right here. It's you know seven feet for pedestrians and eight feet over here. You know that that's normally enough. I think we are going to need to have some real coordination with the bid and with some other city agencies to make sure that the storefronts, the street vendors, you know kind of keep that area largely clear, so pedestrians can get through the block. You know, I think that's something we are going to need to keep an eye on throughout this project, but I you know we have been thinking about it. I've been talking a little bit to isidro about it as well. So it's something that we are aware of and are going to do what we can to monitor and work together with other city agencies to make sure we can. We can do what we can to make sure that this remains an accessible sidewalk. Yes, please, because you know the 181St there's a lot of people taking buses to go to work and a lot of people. You know walking without no concern. They do not even see cars, they do not even see light et cetera, yeah, absolutely there's a lot of people walking on 181St street this intersection. You know all the time for any number of reasons, so yeah understood. Thank you Robin. Thank you, Cathedral. Thank you, David again, howard. I was great meeting you in sharing the proposed changes coming to 181St. As you know, I discussed with you. There is concern about the proposed major decision to open up storefronts, plus the expansion of the proposed storage place that you will have for this project. I think you know when crouched into a pedestrians space, but we know we discussed that. I'm very happy that, like Jim said that the lower level going on the uptown side is going to be open, I always wonder why that was never like entertained, but I'm happy that you know this is going to be an option now for writers that are going up down, but also radius, that get off on the up down side, one in first, it's often really congested on the stairs going up and that creates havoc. So I'm happy taking care of it. Question that I have so. As you look on the north side going up, there is an unused bridge that connects both the north and downtown side, I'm wondering if that will connect to elevators or what was the purpose of that bridge. You know I actually do not know what the purpose of that bridge was Abe. Do you happen to know what that's currently used for what it was built for hi? I do not know what it was originally built for it used for. I know there's another shaft on the north bound side there that that's the vent shaft comes down to there and I know that there's a calm room down there and that's probably why it's blocked off. But I do not know you know. You know what the original plan was with that. I know that I could come if I could comment on that again, because I've been around the ventilation, shaft used to be elevators and they had the same scheme going on the other side of the thing and the other thing that bridge, I believe, has switching equipment in it that you know that thing that you see draws talking about, but that equipment may not be working anymore, and that would be a connection between the north and south platforms, enabling possibly some kind of handicap access. If you want to look at it also howard, I was wondering if you perhaps can send us this presentation so that I can share with our businesses. I think it's crucial that they get fully noticed. I know they're going to do a walkthrough, but you know I would do my walkthrough to expand North, East and west of us and Nicholas. So it's going to go much further when I do the walkthrough myself and I like to have a relevant information so that I could be fully in front, so I can also be informed as to the changes that are coming to our 181st. But again, thank you so much and this a very simple way to support this, because I think that in the long run it's going to help us in bringing more ridership quite easier to the community to our small businesses that are in dire need to have more vibrancy, so we're definitely going to work with you making this happen. Thank you. Bell appears thanks. Thank you esidro. You know, you know we appreciate working with you on this and happy to share the presentation, especially so you have it and I'm hopeful hoping we'll have kind of some form of materials to to have for you as well. Well, thank you howie and team MTA, and thank you to the bid for you know and for reaching out to the bid and making sure that all the various stakeholders understand what's coming. I mean this will be the first I mean I understand that 168Th Street was considered a station closure, but this is our first real, like all the doors are shut station closure. So it's a big important project and off we go so with that. I'd like to spend a little time on old business. I think sort of two things in the main first and I will be handing it over to Bruce but just to catch up committee members. Who may not be aware, although I think I've I shared some of the information in boosted as well, that implementation has begun on the Riverside drive. You know 157 to 160 project. You know all the parts that we did approve to improve pedestrian safety in that area and last week as MTA started to mark, you know where some of the concrete features would be particular specifically at 157Th street. When people started to see it on the street, there was a moment of shock like wait. A minute. This street looks like it's going to be impossible. Impassable and Bruce's phone started ringing a lot and he really took the lead, which I really appreciate to just make sure that the connections were made between community members and kimberly and lyle and to get as much information as possible to be able to understand. Did we have did we did we have an unintended consequence which, with this plan that is so long awaited to address the safety issues, particularly as people exit the drive at speed and come around on Riverside, so bruce is just going to kind of present to us a little bit sort of what happened and where we're at now. Thank you, Debbie. Can I put up my pictures? Can chanel? Can you make you yeah you're a co- host now bruce, so you should be able to just do it directly yikes? How do I do this? Okay? I know I have not done it that many times but yeah you you'll just work from your share screen. I got ta find the file, oh, my God Chanel. Can you put up the file that I sent you? Thank you. I appreciate it. I appreciate it so. First of all I want to thank kimberly for responding so quickly to me and to Debbie and others in the neighborhood who freaked out I'll just say it that way about what was happening quite suddenly, and we've been back and forth a lot, and I took some photographs today that I'd just like to go through quickly with you, because I know you'll have to get up early and vote and then I have a few couple questions, but maybe others have questions too. Here we go. Oh, this is great, so go to slide one please or two slide two. So this is a photograph of the where 157 intersects at the end to Riverside and all these stripes are new they're going to be petty ramps on either side of this. And then, if you look on the second photograph, that's the front door of 790 Riverside, the riviera, which you can see that the whole corner curb has been extended into. I guess what you call a soft curb, which will have gravel and petty ramps and go on to slide three, please and when you cross the street, there's a new median, that's being constructed between 790 and 801, and right down the middle of Riverside, and I'm not sure how that's going to play out. If there's going to be soil in the in the middle or whatever, but go to slide four I'm going to go through this quickly. We can back up, and so then walking south and west. The Riverside oval has the yellow stripes to the side of it which are new, and then you can see looking north again, the Riverside oval stripes, where this young fellows walking across the street keep going slide. Five. The thank you and the yellow stripes are continued along the current median. Where you can see a car is parked in the yellow for whatever reason and then on the right hand, side. There's unloading in front of the only accessible entrance to the Riviera 790, which has been a big question with a lot of people. How can we double park to unload in front of that building and my building, which is 800 and yet have cars, go around us? So this is sort of how that's been playing out as of today with the new stripes and people dealing with the actual situation, please, okay, so further south and West. This is a meet a median little plaza opposite 156, again, with the yellow, stripes closing off the travel lane to one lane, but having the option of having to go around the travel lane if it's blocked and then we move on to the corner of 155 and Riverside, which has been really problematic for cars coming off, Riverside drive west kind of shooting up, 155 cutting the corner. Now you have this extension outward where please, some of the cars are actually following this new direction, new line, but I was standing there watching and some of them just cut across the white lines into that blank area which is going to be graveled and sectioned off. So it's interesting to see how certain cards will follow the new pattern and others did not, and so back to my building, which is 800, which is we're the next up for putting in a median where you see the yellow double line and dealing with the issue of having Ups Fedex Moving Van once in a while double parked and then having the travel lane to the left of that and how the new meeting is going to funnel that to 185, which is I'm sorry 158, which has been the real crux of the matter, all along people cutting across 158 and trying to get to the bridge and so forth. So that's, basically it, and so I have. I have a couple questions for kimberly and company. One is: will there be plastic pylons that will be on the yellow stripes and if so, how will that impede cars from going around the travel lane if they have to pull over to the side? As you saw on one of the slides and the other is, will there be a walkway between on 155 between 780 and the benches, which is the sidewalk along the cemetery area? Thanks for that overview, it's really helpful and good to see the pictures. I have not been up there guys you guys are doing a great job and it's really amazing just to see it happen. It's all. It's all new to all of us. Thank you sure. So. The for the first question. That's a straightforward one. We do not put delineators on those yellow, channelization lines. We will put sorry. I miss that your audio is not great. Is that better? Try to? Yes, please? Yes, thank you, so the we won't be putting flexible delineators, which are like the little posts. We won't be putting those on the yellow lines, but we will put them in the painted pedestrian space around the white curved lines that you called the soft okay we'll go there yeah. I do not know the proper terminology for that soft. I like the soft curve. I have not heard that one, but that's a good one. I think. Okay, well I'll take credit for it and then the other one is the other one. I'm trying to look at where exactly you're talking about. So, if you put up the slide again, I can back you up to it. It's around that last soft curve between 780 Riverside and the sidewalk that runs parallel to the trinity cemetery, the most southern, that's actually, the most southern part of Washington Heights. We're really downtown here. Do you are you meaning between the two painted pedestrian spaces across one like this yeah? Yes, there should be a crosswalk added between those two pedestrians and they'll and they'll. You have one going. That's you have one that's going a diagonal right, but then there needs to be one that or does not need to be one, but I'm not sure of the plan that runs North, South or East- West on 155.. I think we can just pull up the old presentation, probably and yeah. That's all I have to say, and I'm going to let neighbors chime in if they have some comments. Let me let me just add before we take this up, that I mean one thing that can be, as I understand it done almost overnight is you know there are concerns about, obviously loading and unloading at 790 and at 800. Certainly I'm sure there's a few other addresses where this might be an issue, but those were the two main ones that came up and that DOT can put signage, making that a nose standing for some daytime hours quite easily and basically overnight. So I think we need to watch the space and, I think, yeah the response when people looked at this is like we're going to have a problem, because every time you do you know most of the time when you're loading there's cars parked there, so by definition, you're creating a situation where people have to cross into what's not supposed to be crossed into, and then where the concrete is. You know obviously there's more limitations and let me just see who's. I've got joy. Had a question: yeah joy, yeah, joy, Gramolini: there you go yes. First of all, I think what you did with that diagonal walkway on 155Th is great. I think that's the way most people cross there, and so long as there are you said you were going to put those little oh shoot pylons up there. That should be, I think, sufficient. Now in terms of unloading, I've got to say as a car owner anything that's going to take more parking spaces that have already been taken with all the construction should be thought of carefully. For example, there is a new parking zone near the front of 10790 near the 157Th street entrance. It shows up in one of bruce's photographs. I do not know which one, but it goes it's a car length wide. I mean that could be our unloading cell rather than taking another spot in the middle of the block or you could let people maybe use the area within the yellow lines for unloading. I mean it's really getting terrible up here. There's a few I mean the signage on 100. I got a ticket on 153rd a couple of weeks ago. The signage is one way on one side of the street. Another way on the other side and it's really become hard. So as much as I know, we agreed to all of this in advance. I would like you to consider some of the spots that are already designated no parking, no standing as possible in loading zones and the one near the Riverside 150Th 7th street intersection, which is already no standing, could possibly be a an unloading zone for us all right, thanks, joy, so kimberly. Maybe if you can just hold on to this as we as we watch this, you know if we feel like we need to create some space, you know what do we look at and sure yeah? We can look at the options that make sense and, as you mentioned, it's essentially the community board, making a request for a quality of life, change to a parking regulation in front of a residential building. Typically, there's no parking because it allows for the loading and unloading, but we can talk through what would work best after we evaluate with our bro engineers and everyone, but certainly that's not an opportunity possibility, and then I just I just want to say and Paul D. I have you. I have you next so get ready, but I also want to thank Vivian Ducat, who I know is also staying close to this last week and Wayne was involved, etc. So, thanks to our CB board members Paul hi good evening, everyone and thank you for the very helpful meeting tonight, getting back to Bruce's photograph of that Ups truck and where the partition's going to be made to the left of the car that is going around the Ups truck from what I've seen in the previous plans. It looks like it's wide enough. The cement barrier between the opposing lanes is wide enough for some sort of planters to be put in place of some sort. My concern is that you know if it's not a ups truck, it could be an ambulance and a lot of these loading zones, as we've seen in the past, will just be free parking for a lot of people and anytime. You have an ambulance which is more important than a fedex truck in my opinion, parking there and you do not have enough width in that area for cars to get around. That could be a problem. So I just wanted to make sure that section where you do not have the yellow stripes, but you actually have a concrete barrier. There is enough with, for somebody to go, buy an ambulance or even a fire truck. Thank you, yeah. Just a quick response to that is that we do any project that we have like this. We do review with fdny for those reasons, especially when there's concrete involved, and so they have reviewed and signed off on these plans. Okay, Jerry Culligan and then we're going to wrap this item up. You are jerry. You should be able to unmute yourself. Now there you go. Yes, I just wanted to bring a another point in. We tabled the section north of 158Th Street, but nothing was actually done about the intersection at 158Th Street, and the suggestion I have is that D.O.T revisit that for revamping the lighting in that I've looked at it a lot and you almost need to put in a pedestrian light at that crossing because of the confusion there, you really need to give pedestrians their own time to cross, particularly 158Th Street on the west side from Riverside drive. I think D.O.T needs to take a look at it, just change the lighting and give a section for pedestrians. Thank you all right. Thanks jerry, it is true that becomes an open item because by not moving forward with the switch to one way. Okay, so I want to move now to just a few follow- ups. If you do not mind kimberly on like old stuff, one obviously came up earlier in this meeting, but we actually have a few things, so I think I'm going to take advantage of having you and lyle, both here at the same time, but starting with the Nagel Hillside Broadway work that I know was, or I think was just completed and Jim Berlin just ran just sent me a picture of the of what Anna had reported about the backups, and it is true that area does get backed up a lot and I guess it would be helpful for us to hear how like what follow- ups I mean. Obviously you make those changes they were. They were meant to achieve some goals and but sort of what's the follow- up. You know now that that's rolled out and and sort of what are you seeing this these traffic backups? I mean we do hear it period. We hear it a lot or I hear it a lot. So that's like yeah that whole project that you had- and I think DEP was in there too, at Hillside Nagel, Bennett Broadway area yeah, I'm, unfortunately, I'm not very familiar with that particular project, I'm not sure if lyle has feedback. Otherwise, if not we're happy to take that back and come back with more information about why I'll feel free to jump in there yeah. I have a little bit of information, not a lot, but basically just to reconfirm this. Is it's not a DOT project? It's actually a DDC project. The idea behind the project, yes, is to increase enhanced Pedestrian safety and traffic measures around the area. If you remember how it was prior, that is a five- point intersection and that street was pretty wide as far as not really much ability for pedestrians to cross. If you recall, the sidewalks were pretty short, at least as far as especially the long crossings along Broadway, but this is a DDC project, so they're the ones that are running this project but they've, given us an update, at least as of last week, from what I've heard the project is about 85 complete to this point, there were some issues that the Ec had due to the pandemic and there was a Con Edison project that was also here that I think had overrun, so it had delayed them going back into the area to finish up their work, but it's on their radar to be completed sometime in the future. I do not have a full timeline as to when the work is going to be complete. Now, last time, like I said it was 85 complete, I think it is scheduled to be done in finality. I think, sometime early next year, but I'm not sure exactly when we can reach out to DDC again to get some specifics all right. Well, if you guys can keep an eye on it. I do. I am somewhat concerned that I mean it is true. This kind of thing they actually they were not working during the endemic on the set of projects. It's impacted the streets in CB12 really Germany. Let's just keep an eye, but I cuz you know right now, at nine o'clock at night it's backed up a solid five blocks. It sounds like fermana what she was saying that it was backed up even worse, a short while ago. But that's you know, that's a lot now. Is that all because of kind ed stuff? I do not think so, but so let's keep an eye there and actually so Anna look. Can you just keep your comment under a minute and I see dario, I see you as well, oh yeah, sorry and I'm getting you promoted again. All right. You should be able to talk now. Thank you. So emma I did not catch. You said DEC. What is that? I did not think the department of design construction so for a lot of the projects that go on citywide. We work in conjunction with them and in the instances of the resolution on this instance that division Department is running, or at least in charge of this project, the department of design and construction. So it was a horrible idea, so this will take less than a minute and every day, until the next year, it's potentially every day that an ambulance can not get through and a fire truck can not get through. Emergency vehicles can not get through. So it's not acceptable until next year. It has to be addressed sooner because it could be you who dies, because the ambulance can not get there. That's all for me, okay dario! You should be able to unmute. Now there you go with the moving of the equipment for this weekend. Due to the shuttle Bus Service, I was mostly improving the southbound side, not on the northbound we, but we did see some improvements. There's still a lot more to go, but we do appreciate your support and getting relaying the message to CDC yeah, no problem. We yeah, I really the message to them. Just let them know of your concerns because of what you mentioned as far as the subway closure, so I'm glad to see that they we're following up at least on you know the most of it, but if there are any other questions reach out to me I'll see if I can relay those concerns over the DDC in the meantime, I'm not sure if they have a liaison for this project, but I guess you can send all the questions to me and I can pass it along in the meantime, since no problem thanks Kyle Sorry Jim, I did not realize your hand, was up, go ahead. Yeah, I just stuck it up. The thing is that, although this project that's causing all the traffic and right now, it's died down. I just looked on Google maps again, but the point is, although maybe DDC is building it the entire design for this, since it's a traffic improvement was DOT, so you are responsible for the fact. In my view, if it is not working- and you know based upon what you know we saw you know the line, the red line was, I think, five blocks long to the south of it. When I sent the picture to debbie around nine o'clock or whatever it was. So you know me again: it's your responsibility, because it's your project, they're building it, but you designed it not you personally, of course thanks Jim yeah, and I guess this one. I feel like this predated me, so I feel like this one got presented many years ago and there was a big gap until it actually started happening all right. So I just have a few things. Just if there's any, if DOT can let us know, if there's any timing available for the changes that were approved for 178Th Street, going from the George Washington Bridge, towards like wadsworth and at Broadway, and if that project has any date for kicking off and or the project that also there was we resolved on down by Riverside to the entrances, to fort Washington, Park, look at 172Nd and where all the all the improvements for the crossings where the the highway lets out or people are entering and Riverside drive. That's the park access, one yeah and then just know that my computer seems to want to restart to download software. So if I disappear, I will be right back if I can't get it to stop doing it plug my computer in but real quick before I plug it in. Hopefully, my computer does not die before then the first one, the 1 78th one we that was planned for this year. Obviously our implementation season. We had a lot of challenges and a lot of projects we were trying to get in. So I believe that one is probably being pushed back until next season, just with Covid-19 and everything our resources were really short. We did not get our like implementation program really up and going until much later than usual, and I think in this case it kind of makes sense because we'll be looking at 180 first as well, and obviously those areas are really tied together. So it does give us a chance to kind of see what's going on how they might interact those locations. The other one I believe when we presented we presented, is something that would not go in this year. We had to it's one that has some concrete work that we're looking to get support on for a grant. So sometimes, when we have these federally funded grants, we have to have community support, but within a certain you know, time frame before we do all the administrative work with a grant. So I think it's not ready to go. We were not planning to do that. One this year, anyways and we'll come back to all right. Okay, Lyle Street lights on Cabrini, I feel like something's happening, but is it that I'm trying to verify? I will continue to really get an update from our side. I know that we've been talking quickly, just trying to kind of see what exactly is going on around there, and I think we had a conversation as far as some other DEP work. That's going on around there, but I'll see exactly which one of these projects is moving first and we'll be in touch I'll. Give you posted well, some of them are back, and some of them are not like the one outside my window. Is there again right, but there's a lot of darkness? I mean that I have to say I'm so disappointed I mean it is. It is really dark. It was really dark all of 2020 and when the streets were quiet I mean we do not have cross streets, it gets really dark, and that is a long time to be. You know to be without I, rumor has a DEP is wrapping up at the corner and that now it's the road restoration. So I imagine you guys are a little involved again. Okay, great, so I am now zooming you by my phone as well, so this should be okay but but conade is still around, but for the most part you know this. That part of cabrini is pretty is opening up. You know, as of this week, little by little, I think there was asphalt port today. So that was good. All right. We had, I think, that's it for old business. I know Richard Allman. We talked about getting that information to MTA so I'll. I gave howie a heads up about it and I'll have to follow up with him again about how we might pass that to him and Richard Allman was following up on the resolution that passed at last week's general meeting for the street co- naming at Dykman and Nagel and sharing that with the MTA to see if they could possibly, we lost debbie- oh no, she will, she will probably reappear. She alerted us that she that her computer was oh that's right and someone else must be a co- host or else the whole thing would have dissolved. So she will reappear omar you want to take over. I can't because I do not have the notes of where Debbie was going with her comments at the moment. She should be right back really. I could probably finish that sentence. Let's give her a few minutes. Let me at least try to finish that scent that one sentence she was in there we got okay, we miss you debbie. We do not hear you either. Ah now we may hear you there's some microphone somewhere. We do not hear you and it's not like you're muted, that you do not have a microphone, so you might want to go away and come back. Can you hear us Debbie nod your head nod your head. You see that maybe she's trying well, I know which there she is the miracle of modern technology, although think about what they went through in 1918 when they had a similar pandemic and they did not have Amazon and they did not have zoom and they did not have telephones. So we are, I mean we have a lot of idiots around, but we are so. What did you? What did you do then? Jim? Oh, I do not quite remember. Actually it was so long ago. I remember the glaciers too a little I. The thing I find so ironic is that at most of the Zoom meetings, people have behaved much better. No, you did so did you did you? Do it through the internet on your phone? Did you say, use internet audio? You have to agree to that. There's two steps. You have to agree to be video and you have to agree to be internet audio or you have to call up. Oh, I know what I can do call her and put her on speaker. Basically, I got a text from her which says: can you hear me? It says sorry, I can't hear anyone. Can you or omar close that clues out the meeting I can't get back in so Omar. Apparently the meeting is over unless someone else wants to add something we have new business. Whatever do we have any? I know Richard wanted to complete the sentence that, oh absolutely he was in the middle of doing so I'll give Richard the floor. That was simply following up to the last part of the discussion we had about naming for Isaiah Maranta at last month's meeting that we were going to try to if the resolution passed we're going to forward it to MTA for their consideration in naming the plaza right in front of the one train entrance, and maybe he is trying to make that happen. Yes, that's correct, and with that said, I know, I see Angel's hand up visually yeah. I did want to say that type in about a different topic, if that's okay with you yep. So when we were so, I'm also part of the licensing committee I see Gerard is on. He may remember this. Last month there was an issue surrounding the traffic. It was a traffic issue in front of a location. We were approving, or you know, approving a resolution for a license for I'm not going to get into the details about the resolution for the license itself. But an issue that came up was the congestion in front of a particular location that is causing for police cars, fire the fire engines to be there's a lot of congestion, and these first responders can't get through the road. So we thought it might be a good idea, gerard- and I briefly talked about it during that meeting- to bring it up during this committee because it might make more sense. I do not know if this is the committee or if it's public safety, but I do know that there's an issue about you know first responders not being able to get through this particular street. It's Nagel Avenue between Elwood Street and Sickle Street, so I just wanted to bring it to the attention of the committee angel. This is deputy. I'm back sorry about that. I think that there's a good- and I would say this, for I mean not necessarily the December agenda, but one thing I do want to start talking to curtis about. Is this general topic of that's coming up increasingly about? Is it us on streets? Is it? Is it an enforcement issue and therefore the public Safety committee and NYPD enforcement, and I think we have so much stacking up and when we saw this with the henshaw situation, which will only tangentially get sort of slightly? You know considered from the resolution that we passed last month, but I think I think this makes sense for us to perhaps have a figure out a time where we could have a joint session on it. And it's interesting that then again and then we had the licensing aspect of it as well. And I think it's something that's worth talking about. You know as an agenda item and really give it its due time, because we are seeing it pop up and affecting people all over. And then you know, because the emergency vehicle part is in public safety and the enforcement is in that public safety. But one thing that I think that I'm seeing constantly on Facebook- and I think we've heard it a bit on this committee- is that as people are dealing with some of these more like quality of life issues again leaving the emergency vehicles out. That they're, like everybody's, like there, should be a speed bump on every all these streets, and I think we need to you know you can't there's sort of streets that we have that need to be made more safe and obviously we've just had so many of them on Amsterdam at 157 that we were just talking about with pedestrians and then there's times they're, just bad actors- and I do not you know it does not necessarily mean the streets should be changed, but I think it's worthy of more extended discussion, so I certainly will have it as my takeaway to reach out to to curtis to see. If we can, we can arrange that at some point early in 2021. I had no idea that there was, I figured you were talking about henshaw. I did not realize that there's another place where this is becoming. Is that issue so yeah? It was brought up by the precinct as an issue, and then we had some community members that also that also chimed in and described a pretty hectic situation when it comes to like just double parking too many vehicles, emergency vehicles can't get through so right. Okay, all right does anybody have anything else that we should be thinking about for a future meeting, because I'd like to just sort of get in my it's almost election day, all right, oh yeah, Mariella, has her hand. I have my hand up. No, I just blended Richard see if there was an update- and I know that Dave Tom is also here to talk about new business, to see, if there's any update on the communication with Amber charter school, because we had reached out to try to have them come for this meeting. They said that they could come in December, but we had talked about hearing from the community. Briefly in this meeting debbie. No, I think I said we're not going to do it two months, so that'll be it's on the agenda or December. I'm sorry. What I meant was, if that, at the December meeting, when it's on our agenda, that we potentially yeah I'll offline that stuff with Dave but Dave wants to you know we might expand the time for for him to speak since yeah. But no it's a December item. We're not going to talk about it for two months, but well I what I will say, though, just for this meeting, so that we're prepared as a committee is what we are discussing about the charter school that is coming in to the Park terrace area. That is in a space that is already cited as a school. So there is no additional kind of certification process for the school to come in, but it is increasing the amount of traffic that will come in right so like the school building that this school is going to occupy currently has less than 200 students, but their charter was approved for upwards of 700 students. So I do not know if there is. I do not know how this works. I do not know if this is going to be they're just going to present what they what they want to say, but I think that it would be really great to get ahead of this only because you know it is already going to be December and 700 extra students working in a school. I can tell you it's not a small thing understood, but I think we have the time set aside to discuss it. There is not a formal process triggered as there was with wooden charter about to be. You know for a traffic study for BSA, so I think we'll just we need to bring those concerns. That's why it's on the agenda. That's why we're discussing it? I think for good reason, all right anybody else on New business Richard has his hand up unmute yourself, Richard seems like you're, muted yep. We can hear you now Richard. I raised this to set up a discussion for next month. There's been quite a bit of attention in New, York City, recently to the particular heritage of James Gordon Bennett and the particular engagement with slavery. The fire department recently renamed an awards program that had been named in his honor. For that reason, their discussions in multiple places are starting to happen around Bennett Park, and I believe that discussion is going to come to the parks Committee this month, and I know the Parks Department also has its own particular process for looking at any of a range of renamings. I raise it here because Bennett Avenue is named after the same person, realizing also that renaming rather than co- naming a street, is a complex process, but I'd like to see us grapple with that next month and okay, there's some silence there. If lyle has, if lyle has anything just briefly to mention over what a process might look like or what would need to come forward. That might be helpful. Just briefly right now to think begin thinking about next month. I can follow up an hour and I'm not sure exactly what the process is. Industry completely changed, but I can I can do some research. Do you? Where is the street again in particular Bennett Avenue? It's a significant street in Washington the whole trip? Okay, I I'm not sure, what's appropriate, to advocate here. I'm not sure that I would want my street renamed for the inconvenience it might cause. So I think, there's I think, there's a discussion to be had and we should look at the best way to handle this issue and probably to stay in touch with parks along the way. Okay, so lyle, if you can just look assume that we can get that on the agenda, I think we'll be fine in terms of length and lyle. If you can sort of dig around a little bit about what that process would involve, then what would be required. That would be great just again what about renamings versus codenamings, okay I'll see I can find out. Thank you Jim is that old hand or new hand got it sally hi thanks new hand, not old. I guess the question: is this committee going to discuss the the open restaurants open streets program and the idea of making these year right round and permanent? There have been quite a few issues on Dikeman, Street and questions about things like tents that are now being put out there. That look to be increasing the footprint of certain restaurants by basically enclosing outdoor space, and also there are some pods up this weekend with. Hopefully they have been removed because to me they look like little super sweater things that were around the tables, and so I just wondered, since this is sort of a big change for certain streets, and we have at least one and maybe two in our district. If we are going to discuss this at the traffic and transportation since it's a DOT program, we had not, we did not have plans to. Should we make plans to. I do not know where else it would be to stop yeah. I sort of feel like it's the I understand why it's you know. I understand why this would be the first place to come, but I sort of feel like that's it's almost you know in that it sort of fits into well, technically response, etc. I sort of feel like it's like a whole community board thing. If I might technically it's up to the chairperson to decide which committee he would like to discuss it or which collection of committees, that is one of his powers or their powers, yes yeah, so let's also yeah talk with Eli and I think I think it sort of is better suited for something. You know some sort of special meeting with a few committees. I just do not. I do not really love the idea of it just having like a meeting in Tnt. I just think it's a little bit bigger than that, just in terms of where it sits in city policy and the pandemic, where I do not know how you assign or how decisions are made given that DOT matters would usually fall in this committee, but it is a public health issue yeah it's I just explained exactly how Eli determines what committee will do it period? That's how it works. Okay, I said I did not understand that. Previously, it's not a viewpoint. It's in the bylaws. Those are the rules the chairman decides, but it is okay, it's a good! It's a good point. It was like as a board. You know, are we going to spend some time on that because it's a big, it's a big issue. It's a big topic. I should say yes so sally. Let's keep at this and maybe reach out to Eli together, okay, great yeah. That would be great debbie. Thank you, yeah, because it's you know we could probably name five committees that this is definitely impacting. Okay, great! Thank you. Thanks sally sorry, I'm just doing this on the phone, so I'm just trying to work out things. Oh marge, we do you see anything else or can we have a motion to Adjourn? Are we there? Yet? I will second that motion because I do not see anything else all right, great, all in favor all right. Well, thanks! Everybody! Good luck to us all tomorrow and everybody stay safe, stay, healthy and I'll talk to you on the other side. Thank you. Bye-, bye, good night peace.
