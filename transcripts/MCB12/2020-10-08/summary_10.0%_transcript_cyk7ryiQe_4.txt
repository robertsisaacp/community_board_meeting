If you are on the line from the precinct or the district attorney's office or any other elected officials office, please let me know that you're here , You're here, I see Natalie Espino from Manhattan borough president's office, hi Curtis and my counselor.
Please, announce yourself at this moment all right, hearing, none our first item on the agenda, I'm just going to put that up for one second, give me a minute: I do not know how to use this system very well, all right, so you all can see the agenda.
Nypd and the sheriff's office to tackle the distribution of illegal fireworks and in addition, we worked with several affinity groups within the fire department to develop a fire safety education campaign and working within hot spot areas based off three one: data, where communities that received the most 3- 1- 1 complaints were targeted for focused tabling and fire safety education, information.
I think that it, you know, added to the fact that there was an increase of illegal firework activity throughout the city.
But again you know we did work with our local law enforcement in terms of just mitigating and trying to mitigate as much as possible.
Think One aspect that the fdny wants to do is work with civic and community- based organizations to do education and outreach well in advance of the fourth of July, maybe even targeting June and may because beyond just the prevention issue of targeting the distribution, I, think it's an education and alerting community residents of how to report illegal fireworks to the fire marshal task hotline that we have and, in addition, fire for safety presentations in local neighborhoods to basically educate the community residents.
Again, we are more than happy of partnering within the years to come, with the community board to basically spread that message in advance and work to basically to mitigate that issue in advance of the fourth of July season.
Think when it comes to the issue of enforcement, I would say at that: Point: NYPD would be taking the lead and with our assistance in terms of really you know our fire marshals enforcing where they can within fire code and fire Code, Regulation.
So I would definitely share that feedback on engaging with civic education as well as Cbo's for sort of public education projects prior to the fourth of July week, and I think, that's a great Obviously.
I. Think one of the big issues that we have to figure out is: How do you disrupt the pipeline interrupt the pipeline because it seems like people are buying illegal fireworks from somewhere They can't buy them from New, York state, so they're?
It is a little tough, because I know community residents we do give out the fire marshal the fight, the illegal firework hotline Sometimes community residents do report And then, when people do respond, the issue of fireworks.
That's a long- standing problem that all agencies when it comes to law enforcement are really tackling I think , is just educating residents on how to report out on the dangers of fireworks and basically how to work with local law enforcement to really address reoccurring issues with within neighborhoods.
My question is I understand that the mayor wanted to disrupt the distribution into the city, but that was not what the issue was.
The police would drive by acknowledge that they were being set off and do essentially nothing to stop the setting off of fireworks It was hell and throughout northern Manhattan You mentioned outreach starting in May, and you know by may.
As a lawyer for a long time and the NYPD might answer this in connection with the fire department setting up checkpoints at toll areas from neighboring states that can be done in a legal on a legal basis random, but according to a plan where cars get checked and that might very well be deterrent.
So in terms, I could not really hear the first part, because the first member who who was asking questions Broken up a little, but in regards to education in terms of advanced, you know our fire Safety education unit that really provides year- round education on all levels of residential fire, safety, and I.
Typically, when you look at fireworks and historically throughout the year, the months leading up to the fourth of July, usually around May and June, where you see the most firework activity around the city, I mean if we want to work a lot.
I, maybe educate the community to call in and to you, know, report it as soon as possible.
You know the issues of fireworks are overwhelmingly high and especially around the fourth of July.
Again having to deal with issues at the point of explosion to report out, I, you know, I, can't imagine how many units or how many calls are coming in at one time, especially in the neighborhood, where at point of explosion, there's a lot of reports going on.
You know, I, think essentially, and it may be something to consider with operation- How do we enforce right around those holiday seasons where you do see a spike in fourth of July , Some level of presence or enforcement and again how that would look like and what we could do from an operational level?
We are going to be discussing this at the health and Human Services Committee, I'm, Steve, Simon, Like I, said earlier about this issue, which is going to stay on both of our agendas as we work towards the early winter to hopefully have some sort of recommendation in the form of resolution for to share with the enforcement agency.
Something to consider is maybe a sit- down conversation to get a better understanding in terms of operations from our Bureau of Fire investigation, And I think, having an open- ended conversation with both committees being that this is of interest, and we do welcome the support and looking at which ways we can potentially augment education or some level of operations other than just education.
And I would also welcome, even maybe a joint task force or even or committee, made up of both fdny and NYPD to basically look at it on the local level, because I again, I do not want to speak for NYPD, because NYPD is on the call, but I think all emergency response and law enforcement agencies could essentially work together.
Maybe they feel that leaving the car on notifies the traffic agent or the officers that oh, that we're nearby- You know for a couple of minutes, which they should not do because again it's an easier opportunity for these perpetrators to steal.
Is there, any systematic connection with the crime prevention officer to follow up and secure apartments of people that have been burglarized so that the building itself and the places that have been burgled are really secured, because we do know that burglars tend to return to areas that they feel comfortable.
We're going to try to spread that news around and let people know that there is a service that we not a service, but our crime prevention officer will do a survey for you.
I know I'm the secretary of the 34Th Precinct Council Captain Chung Okay , so I have some things that I would like to mention to captain Chung.
The other night was right around the corner from where I live, and somebody I witnessed it and said that there was two cars drag racing, one that hit the woman jumped in front of the other vehicle swerved hit, the woman and just kept going.
What's going on with these drag racers, it's like they're doing this with impunity, because they know that the police are not doing anything.
You know we do not chase motorcycles and or cars, and the reason being is that the underlying and most important thing is public.
If you chase this motorcycle with a police car with lights and sirens, it's only going to cause them to drive even more right.
We try to as best as we can gather as much intelligence about the groups as we can, including body, worn, camera, video and or Argus camera videos, or any other video that we can get so that we can identify these perpetrators and arrest them at a later time, when it's safe or When, we'll put alarms out on them personally, so that if they encounter the police at a later date, we know we have an open case against them for reckless endangerment for operating these vehicles in a reckless manner, and as best as we can, we try to target, especially when we have the large groups.
This is probably a longer answer somewhere down the road, but I think it'd be worthy of considering task force, whether it's a joint task force with state police, denmark, cars, when these guys are getting reported, traveling north at 155Th, Street on Broadway, and you can activate a task force to 165Th Street and as they approach they're blocked, then they have nowhere to go.
So I'll get it out of the way now for both captains, the beauty of stopping these guys, whether it's on a motorcycle, an rv, a dirt bike or in one of these hot up cars that are out And I can hear them out on broadway just over on Riverside drive.
I know this is beyond your, but I think you know as a as a public safety committee as a community board, we should take a stronger stance on the legality of these vehicles.
I would say that you know if you're, if you're, when you talk about the enforcement, it actually helps with the enforcement, because, instead of chasing people and confiscating them when they're committing an illegal act, just the possession becomes illegal.
Get into that in a second grand larcenies again What we're seeing are the exact same issues, construction, sites, windows or people of You know when not windows, doors at residential buildings, where people are going in and going into the basement and stealing tools.
Sometimes I reiterate what captain Chung said: They people believe that if they leave the car running and step inside a store very quickly and they have the key fob in their pocket that the vehicle can not be driven, away.
We started doing enforcement on unattended vehicles because we see that it's driving our crime and people are just.
We've been aggressively kind to trying to enforce these unattended vehicles by issuing summonses quickly and in the traffic area.
Do you have a mechanism to sort of force supers to install these these boxes, if they're buildings that have been identified as high crime or heart , I would encourage your super to you know to reach out to our crime prevention officer, and we can discuss what we believe is, and they will go through your building and do a survey and give suggestions and recommendations on how he can harden that building to make it less susceptible to someone coming in off the street and and stealing packages.
You do not recognize someone just do not let them in, and I will tell you from personal experience with 25 years in policing, if I need to get into a building in a hurry for an emergency I'll hit every button on the on the panel and sooner or later, someone's going to just open the door without even knowing who it is so.
It could be such a simple thing as stealing a package, or it could be someone that has an order, protection against someone in a domestic incident What we do and not just arbitrarily open doors or allow people to come in when we do not know who they are or what their status is in the building.
I mean if you want to come down and have residents come down into the precinct, we can make an appointment with your with our crime prevention officer and discuss things specifically for your building that works for you, because every building is not the same.
Take, a hard look at that and say work to improve I do not want to use the word forcing, but in a way forcing the supers to comply with your recommendations, because I think you can do education, but I think that even but sometimes people are still going to you know.
Yes, Barbara, as a matter of fact we're planning another operation like we did the last time we had to kind of take a backseat to that, obviously, because of the issue with resources in Colvin 19, but now as we're trying to normalize we're actually setting up another operation, hopefully we'll get it done next week with with our tow operation.
Not only are the paper plates being an issue parked, but for some reason, the paper plate thing has kind of exploded, even operating vehicles on the street.
You know I remember when I first got here, we put out maybe nine or ten cars , it's very rare, That I'm able to put out that many cars, so it does have an effect on staffing and response time, but we try our best to you, know, even with the manpower issues to still you know, service, the community.
As, you know, our community has been mainly invaded, I believe, from the outside this summer by the people that generally cause the noise and mayhem.
To answer your question about the hot spots, we definitely have a list of hot spots that we consider that were that were really problematic during the summer months, especially once the city kind of semi opened back up to the public on those areas were usually on the later.
And my question was basically that this was what I did was drunk people causing a fight like, even if, even if there were not things being thrown around, which is what we were You know.
We do not have enough temp meters in NYPD that every police officer rides Sorry, wait one second, so I I'm trying to understand your concern with the tent Is, the tent itself, causing some sort of public safety concern?
We have been getting a lot of complaints via calls and emails from the community on the very issues that you've been discussing, tonight, including the drag racing, the noise levels.
You know the drag racing, the Pedestrian safety issue, the speeding, all that all that stuff that has been occurring in our community.
I've, reached out to a 34 person several times about it, and you know, like the one of the representatives said like when they come, they it's actually the people are gone.
We, are equipping our community with resources and knowledge on the issue of domestic violence, which was not really discussed in great detail by the precinct.
They worked very closely with ADA professional staff in my office to come up with this campaign, and I'm just sharing it, because it was very refreshing even for me, and I would love to see more people from the Washington, Heights and Inwood community.
As, you all know, next month is domestic violence awareness month and my office takes it very seriously, not only by prosecuting our cases, but also by educating the community.
It is a city- wide issue and because of this, we are working very closely with NYPD to host a gun.
We could have a more fruitful fulfilling conversation on what we want our numbers to be as a committee, and also to think in advance about items we need to add to the list.
Stretchers number five was the argus cameras acrosss, the 33rd precinct in high crime and low traffic areas, which we heard referenced this evening several times and then the last one is the procurement of an all- terrain vehicle for fdny, meaning they would be able to go.
I guess I'd want to know where these speed cameras are in the 34th or the 34th precinct like where exactly they would be planning to install those cameras.
Other committee members I mean I think they were all hard to choose among all these really important, issues, and actually.
You know it's just it's concerning, especially since we've had so many fire issues in our buildings.
Are there particular issues you want them to cover in this public education, outreach, sort of programs, I, mean, I, think, fireworks, driving safety.
And, I, understand double parking, but I just feel like I do not know just because somebody has a car.
I. Think the captain mentioned earlier that the dirt bikes are not plated and that some of the cars are using.
Do not want people to speed, but I just feel like I have a thing about the towers and the cameras There are high crime areas, like, for example, jump line.
I'm, recalling correctly, that was like sort of a hot spot for cars being stolen, so I totally get that, but I think that we had also discussed cameras in other areas, and I.
So should we just add that here and just to be safe, I think that noise is not going to be addressed by the cameras and also, as somebody just said, that it does not address the issue with the drag with the with the dirt bikes or illegal cars.
So it's only two people, so Okay, so number five light tower or terrain vehicle.
