We also recognize the fact that how we run this committee might not be perfect, but we are surely trying our best, and for that reason, I know that with this technology that we have, I will soon things can happen every now and then, and we would like to prevent anyone who has been waiting for a long time and will not get the proper attention because of some glitches.
Having said that, I'm going to ask for girard to please do a roll call before we start and before we do introduction of our prison and, of course, any elected officials that might be in the house, you're right sure, good, evening.
Thank you for delivering these documents to me is important, because I need to have things visually Having said that, the way that we're going to function for the new applicants is that we would entertain the agenda as this.
I know that this will need a vote from the General Board as a whole and that vote takes place on the fourth Tuesday of every month and that'll be the final decision that the board will make on your application.
We had a civil court summons issued for loud music in 2018, and we also had someone that was cut with glass on new year's eve from 2017 going into 2018 at that location, very wrong.
You know there is an ongoing issue of just people, congregating on that block, and I visited them myself a number of times in the past, and They have this 24-hour little grocery next door, where you know, residents, just set up camp right in front of it Right next door to the Villas lounge and play dominoes and drink beer openly and basically play their own music, So, that's something that is just going completely out of out of the their control.
You, know, I mean set up tables outside They do have music outside, but I do not think it's loud again.
He stated that he thought that he could not have more than 50 patrons inside at one time, which was clearly not the case at all, especially when the coronavirus was first kind of came into effect within New York City, so that was in March Most recently in on October 1st, the SLA and the NYPD vice they conducted inspection at the location, and they found that they were also again in violation of the mayor's executive.
You, know, I know it does not sound like it's a lot of people, but they were told there was no indoor dining at all You're right for the sake of of giving people a fair chance, an opportunity to come and have their opinion be heard, and, obviously to themselves.
And I'm, asking also this at the rest of the committee as well, We leave this agenda item until right after five.
We'll come back to this and let's proceed with agenda item number four : This is under item c, which is state Liquor, Authority method of operation.
This is to change Monday, closing hours to 4 pm to 1 am, and this is 4c the kitchen and The representative from agenda item number four, please: How are you doing to sign Miguel Acosta once again representing Susana manon who's on the call with us here in the meeting She's, the president and operator of Cbb Kitchen and Bar Corp doing business as room 4996, so we did submit when we applied for this license.
I. Would entertain a discussion with committee members once we hear the opinion authority for prison and also from our residents, but I'd like to hear first of all, 34 percent.
Yes, actually I want it to open at 11 Monday through Friday and 12 o'clock, Yeah and saturdays and sundays, because our liquor license does not permit to serve any alcohol or beer pm.
Can I, please hear your opinion, probably, if not, I think I would recommend that we're going to vote.
Next on the agenda is under item d on the Agenda State Liquor Authority alteration license, and this is going to be to convert one of its service bars to a full bar.
That's, going to help him continue to operate his business in a way, that's economically beneficial to him, and I hope that you approve this application.
You know, assuming cover to stable at some point we're making an application for the license there so that we can actually serve the community.
This is a very dangerous, an unfair situation where people or businesses were taking advantage of regulation when pleased to prevent other barriers from going to infect our community, and yet this merchant.
This is the new license section put on the agenda and this is for item number, six crack and peel located at 126, Nagel Avenue, it's at the corner of arden street crack and peel welcome hi.
Thank you for the sake of keeping our residents saying and perhaps from preventing the community from getting issues, I'm going to recommend that you do buy a sound limiter.
Thank, you very much good night, all right good night next, on the agenda again under on- premise, liquor license for new is item seven, and this is for seven Henshaw Inc Dba cloisters grill, located at seven henshaw street.
To point out that there are residents who hear noise at a loud volume just want the people to know.
So I, respect and appreciate that you know you kind of need a liquor license to make this happen, but I have real misgivings because there was no posting of this meeting around the location.
I would like to recognize now Nancy, yes, hi, thank you, and this is conveying this for Ted gallagher, who is a resident of the same building, and also you know a community member for over 38 years, who actually has a worked for 17 years as a senior city planning at HPD.
You know he opposes this because he says henshaw street is effectively a service road for the henry Hudson parkway drivers use it to avoid the bridge toll, even without a proposed liquor, license noise and traffic congestion.
And I can commiserate, but I think that you know I think they've been a good neighbor as far as I know , This is a very tough time for restaurant owners and if they go out of business, what's going to take their place is crime.
Aside from that, you know, my main concern is more with regards to music, and I understand the tenant's concern is any type of noise, but sometimes especially right now we have 25 indoor dining some days, especially this past couple of weeks.
You know time for business owners to comply with every single rule and regulation when it comes to noise, because if you have a pickup, you have patrons that.
You know right, now, she's, operating her business and was unable to attend the meeting, but I would definitely address every single concern that may have.
You know somehow around this community, but taking into account the residents that are very concerned about noise, double parking issue and opening late, I'm going to recommend some stipulations sure my steps will be a sign that will be no bubble.
And, as you know, Miguel, to send us a copy, approve a purchase out to the Community Board before Friday the 23rd before five o'clock, perfect committee members.
That's like a focal area of the precinct when it comes to noise and disorderly groups and people playing music and stuff so in every direction from this location through the summer.
Up until now, there's just it's just crazy, with people playing music and stuff That's, definitely good, because that was also a concern because it's directly under the residential building, but other than that I mean the double parking on Saint Nicholas Avenue is horrible, adding a their establishment, definitely not going to help.
I am also a member of the Community board 12 and also a member of the Public Safety committee, and also I am a resident for 12 years already, living in 11 Fort George Hill, which is a right acrosss from where this particular business will be located and understanding that you know we are a community that we need to live.
You know we had at a public hearing on noise pollution in this community at the Community Board Was, an area of lots of noise traffic safety issues, so that you know, we would hope that the committee really considered the impact of this on the public safety.
I want to know from the committee how long you give the community a chance to be notified about this meeting.
I do not know if this application meets the sla's definition for oversaturation, but from the perspective of a layperson, the general activation of the street, the number of SLA licensed establishments within a couple of blocks and the construction of this particular place, which I do not know if you've seen pictures of it, but as Eileen says it's all windows, which is going to offer zero very little sound proofing from just the glass and is going to be a huge problem when the windows are open.
It's good for ventilation for Covid-19, very bad for noise, I, do not know speaking as a community board, member.
The fact that it was not that you say was not in any way shape or form or display when they came in the first time in 2019 and as you mentioned, that it was only posted by yesterday and he checked that it was not there on Sunday, it's very concerning, because it seems that the residents did not have a fair chance to know that this is coming forward.
And you know, the understanding is that the public has to know when a liquor license is coming to a community or an area.
So, this committee and the board had already approved their liquor license a year passed and in the meantime they had been doing some type of construction work.
The precinct some of the community members who have voiced legitimate concerns where maybe a meeting at the establishment could be held where people would come together and express.
I will consider that as the best practice, a business coming in wanting to be fair with other residents, noting that there are concerns also for prison, because I'm very concerned that, in case of emergency too many double product vehicles.
We have president, we have a precinct if you can coordinate a meeting amongst yourselves Thou Hop. If a meeting does not take place, and this becomes a problem, the resident to come back and tell us that you know a meeting was not scheduled for whatever reason, but we can not stipulate that it would be highly recommended you're right and to that's something.
Anybody else from committee members, okay, so I'm going to recommend that first Novalee parking sign It's illegal, but I would like to emphasize that we should not have any double part vehicles in this area for obvious reasons of safety and security, and that no bullet parking should be visible.
So we have to come up with idea community members to make sure that we get something like really that can call attention right in making sure that the pages are not hanging out outside in front of an establishment.
Let me just repeat the steps: a sound limiter, a no ballet parking sign, not our parking sign as well phone number on three different areas where someone can be reached in case there, any problems, a good neighbor sign and as a best practice, we will recommend that the owners meet with the residents and the NYPD did.
I would be very interested if you come to the next general meeting or the one following and let us know if this actually occurred, because I think it's really important and Alegria is going to show good faith or not with this ownership.
If that please come back and report to us, let us know at our next licensing committee we're very interested.
So much before I move on committee, our decision, at least you have a question: I mean if you're going to vote on.
They went through the application, so you're probably going to want to come next week next month , we'll come next month, and we hope that the questions that the committee members the board members had and the public have will be addressed at that time.
I was just thinking about this business owner And, I'm conflicted, because I totally acknowledge and recognize the public safety issue that has deteriorated in our community, from the tip of our of it, with down deep into Washington, Heights and well passed us And, it's unfortunate, because a lack of will and a lack of leadership and resources.
I think this community and leadership and public safety needs to start moving in the direction of enforcement and resourcing agencies that are supposed to do that and supporting that enforcement, so that business owners can be empowered to try to make a go of it.
If we're going to treat one business that way, that is having a similar issue with the community at large in terms of noise in the area, then I would move to try to treat the other businesses in a more in the same consistent manner, and you find well made And, I, think angel, just in committee right, now.
Honestly any comments from other community committee members This is a be a behavioral issue in the sense of you know, a sense of a lack of awareness and concern for your fellow residents or people that live in these buildings, because I always look at this as it's a public safety, issue.
You know people are out and about To, like Gerard said it does affect the community, not only the buildings residents with the noise, but you know people, students, acrosss, the street, there's a school there, but I do think we should give them a fighting, chance.
We do need to give businesses the opportunity to prosper when operators are good, they tend to clean up the areas that you know have major issues.
If we, you know, do what we do best as a community board ask the right.
All right, so I seen other committee members Miguel Well, I want to thank everybody that voiced their opinion with regards to the neighborhood and things that are going on in our area and in our community and Basically.
You know that should be very addressed in any meeting that traffic is discussed, Dyke, I'm my office in the corner of Dykma Street and Sherman Avenue that, where it's loud music.
Please let him know about if he can at least work and making sure that his patrons do not double park so that they will not exacerbate the problem even further and nobody parking please work without the owner, because this is a very serious concern for the precinct.
There will be no live music Unless there are some very concerning issues from the committee members and to save time, I recommend I go to straight vote.
This is a you know, an application to to bring it in only because liquor has really helped the locations.
She thinks it's going to help her sales and from the way the business is operating.
