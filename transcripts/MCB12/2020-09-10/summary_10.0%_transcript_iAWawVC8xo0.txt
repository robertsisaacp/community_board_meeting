Travelers coming from these states must quantity for 14 days and travelers are also required to complete the state's department of health travel reforms when traveling by you know different transportation methods, And I guess they decided on a date, so schools resume on september 21st with different learning capacities, so some students will come to school.
Second question: is: To what extent you all are communicating, with the department of transportation etc, on the open streets, open, restaurants, Again, that's a particular hot spot in our neighborhood, because in many cases the masking requirements and distancing are not being enforced.
Okay, I can find that report and forward it to you and to steve If we had to report, we can definitely take a look at it, but as for opening the schools on, it is ultimately up to a DOE right Her second question was about the open streets program and how masking and social distancing So with the open streets.
That responsibility was relegated to that office, so they're, the ones that created various task forces of different inspectors from HPD DCA, department of health of buildings, fire departments and so forth, and they go out in droves, They you know, conduct inspections based on complaints and also for enforcement.
You know, city of affiliated, employees that are working in parks or targeted areas, but I can definitely reach out to find more details about where these masks are distributed on a regular basis, great, and it would be helpful if you would at least consider free mass dispensing machines.
City, health and hospitals had opened 22 testing sites, including the dieckmann testing site at the dikeman houses in washington, heights.
We're always looking for more ways to reach the community and have more people come in for testing.
We do want to make sure that people are protected when they're coming to a test site.
That's right, and we know for sure that you have at least two sites in in our community in washington heights in inwood and possibly a third just one at dickman, one at high bridge, and then I will cross check on the dohmh site.
We would appreciate any data you can provide to us on how contact tracing is actually working in our specific community board.
Members of the DOE and daycare workers are prioritized for both access to testing and their results at 22, health and hospital sites, including all 11 of our acute hospitals and 11 clinics, including, and they are also prioritized in terms of access to testing across all of the pop-ups, so very committed to making sure that DOE staff daycare staff who are essential to the reopening of schools and other services.
We have a number of test sites that are within health and hospitals or operated by the city, and we also have partnerships with private labs that are also prioritizing teachers.
I know, there's intention to build up the city's own capacity to process tests and we've also been working on strengthening our capacity to produce the actual test kits and viral transport media that those test kids get.
If somebody's insured there's no cost to the patient, we bill insurance, we don't build a patient, a copay, and we also wanted to make sure that our testing for uninsured folks was, you know, not hindered.
We prioritize for tracing and folks who have tested positive and then once we speak to that person or people, and they, let us know who else they've been in contact.
And I know ross knows this, but just if other people, don't you know, there is an effort to do a streets co-naming for 168th street, between broadway and fort washington, healthcare heroes, way for the folks there at columbia, as well as new york, presbyterian, I can just say that public, thanks to you and all who are working on this effort, obviously I'm biased, I just want to say that that'll be brought up at the transportation, committee, traffic and transportation committee meeting next month.
You, know secretaries and bosses, not just people in the ambulances- Also just one question not to you:: don't have to address it now, but if you could think about it and get back to steve in the committee we're doing our expense and capital priorities, and you mentioned that you that you needed to have more capacity, which obviously you don't have, but if you could think about what your capital equipment needs are what your personnel needs are so that we can reflect them in our budget.
We have staggered hours so that when it's shift change, you know it's not like at a factory where everybody goes home at 3 o'clock and the new people come in.
You know there is going to be some level of impact to service, but I think at this point Sorry, a couple of questions on what on fireworks over the past summer.
I just want to, as I think, I'm speaking on behalf of the entire community board, to express the appreciation for the devotion and the work that was done by ems during this entire crisis, but the work that you do overall, but especially the work that that you did during the have that you've been doing during this pandemic.
However, the department in working with the sheriff's office, due to the mayoral task force due to the severity of fireworks over this past summer, which spanned from early June all the way up to July 4th and a little bit beyond, that, basically established a group to target seizures or to target the distribution ultimately to seize firework, large-scale fireworks, distributors.
So what can be done even once that those illegal fireworks get into the communities anything that can be done, but first I just want to know like.
Fireworks use as you draw closer to the fourth of July annually, but I think this year, just with cobia 19 and the quarantine and a lot of restrictions in overall distribution or access to hold on I'm sorry hold on a second sorry, apologies, the you know, I think, beyond just what was going on with Covid-19 and the quarantine that could have exasperated a lot of the issues as well.
Ultimately, working collaboratively to tackle the distribution, levels, I, think on enforcement and looking on a more local level, working with local fire units and NYPD pres precincts to respond or monitor, quickly, more to incidents or reports of fireworks with certain communities, and I.
Think it's all about public education as well, and working with community stakeholders like the community board and other tenant organizations of really educating in advance of these periods, where we do typically see a spike in firework use and just basically educating communities to the to the dangers of fireworks and what can occur and clearly.
I. One of the things that happened is that at first people were saying we were told to call 3-9-1-1 when we saw illegal firework activity, I guess because they got so many, and I, don't know if you're aware, but in our community we had on like 5, 000, fire, illegal firework, complaints or something like that.
So we were first calling they were told to call when you would go to 3-1-1 It seemed like in the middle of this crisis, we were sort of left spinning, because the avenues that were set up for us to do this were sort of cut off right, and so we just sort of suffered in silence, What resources are you all going to have for the community to use to address this in the future, because I you know, I, just see this happening again?
Knowing that the spike usually does occur in the month, leading up to the fourth of July and around that time, I would say: proactively, working with again the community board or community based organizations and getting out and doing education, ultimately to showcase the dangers now in terms of other ways of basically reporting or using an enforcement tool.
I know in central Brooklyn It was another community in the bedstein crown heights region, where I think it was either the second highest in the city that we were getting reports of fireworks, complaints.
You know rest assured that we are going to be working within the coming years and year, given this circumstance that we just experienced of really tackling this issue, because it's not only the distribution and tackling those that distribute, but at the end.
It's an issue of distribution that occurs from you know from year to year, and again the spike usually is seen right around the July fourth time and leading up to it.
I'd be more than happy if coordinating it, but I would also, from a departmental standpoint, also bring in the outreach and public education units just because I think beyond understanding the task force and the enforcement aspect from the department standpoint, you know I think we have to think of it from a holistic approach of not only enforcement but education as well Oh, all of that's fine, but having worked on outreach and communications issues, myself, I want to make sure that the onus isn't placed entirely on the community to fix the problems and to be better educated.
You, probably know from the press that a lot of effort has been put in by the medical community in general, as well as state and federal state and local governments to secure funding for various services and we're part of that.
They are being handled on a virtual basis in many cases, although in some cases we're able to go to visit people now in their homes to be able to make sure that they're , It's an ongoing effort, as you can imagine, like the medical community at large.
I, don't know, but right now, we're holding firm and we're very grateful for the support we've gotten from the community in terms of people offering to help with providing masks and providing other kinds of obstacles.
Yes, all right, so I'm, looking at the state health department report that came out yesterday with you, know, statewide data on on nursing, home and adult care, facility, covert, related deaths and the numbers for isabella.
I, just I, just want to add steve that chris mentioned that the psych nurses are actually doing kobe testing they're in milk scene right now, and you know last time we said that they're doing orientation, medical, med, surg orientation in all the different floors of the allen, but now, according to chris.
And, you know of the med surge There was an exchange of correspondence between state, senator jackson and I The president of the hospital and corwin wrote back I mean they still talk about how they're not prepared to reopen the psych unit at this time because of the possibility of a second wave and how they're going to need these beds again for for covert 19 patients.
First of all, I wanted to follow up steve because he said that, because in 2018 we were able to put together a resolution right that was passed by cb12 regarding the near the allen site We don't need to do another resolution, but instead they're going to be sending a follow-up, letter.
Well, that's maybe more than he has said in the past, but I do want to see how he intends to work together with us on this plan that he's talking about daryl Sorry, if they, you may have answered some of this, but there's three questions so one for the folks at new york, Presbyterian working in psychiatry and mental health has the pandemic had significant effects on the number of in or out patients.
Sarah, because looking at the bigger picture, we actually have a campaign, save new york, psych bed, it's a statewide campaign We want to build a coalition that will include more community organizations and we would like to invite cb12 to be part of this coalition.
So I just, I think, the community board, and this committee should consider another resolution that builds on our first resolution reiterates a lot of these points, but also addresses the fact that the need is greater than it was when we originally focused on the ellen.
So, first of all, I just wanted to thank you so much for including us, today, and especially to steve simon for hosting the noise pollution hearing on august 4th and bringing all of the necessary resources and agencies to the and policy makers to the table.
We formed several working groups that aim to solve noise pollution at the source, balancing the need for quiet with our shared community priorities of outdoor socialization and recreation, businesses, thriving and the minimization or elimination of police contact.
We are also engaged in community outreach and have an email and phone number by which non-facebook users can contact us, we're additionally reaching out to members of housing networks such as supers landlords, tenant association, and, hopefully, also other housing such as nursing homes, which we understand that noise has been an issue at isabella as well.
People understand what decimals are so, I would say something like maybe noise levels or something, but I think the decibels is just not a common term for most people.
We are also calling for increased red light cameras and support residential parking permits, as we are aware that much of the noise we've experienced this summer has come from outside of the city and often also outside, of the state.
Let me just say you know: I work for the parks, department.
I, don't think we were seeing that as a way to enforce things, because we understand that needs the the proper decibel meters that the department of environment, environmental protection has, but the niosh app would be part of the public health campaign where we measure the decibel levels around us, and so you know, one of the things that happens is when people are around loud decibels, all the time they lose hearing, and so people who are making noise may not realize how much noise they're making because it doesn't sound as loud and so by empowering everyone to check.
Fourth of noise pollution hearing Was the idea of the task force to come together to bring all these entities together to begin to talk about solutions, because you know it's important that we start bringing people to the table to start to talk to each other talk across departments to talk, across.
We want to bring all the different entities together, but we feel is important that this is something that is coming out of the community in terms of leadership on this issue.
This is gonna, be translated into spanish before we put anything out officially, but it says the wahi inwood task force on noise is a broad community-led coalition of neighborhood groups, local residents, small businesses and public health experts.
What people can do, monetarily what roles people will play where the accountability will be on certain issues, and so we think that is an extremely important role and we also, as I said mentioned, that we really want to make sure that we are including voices of the diverse voices in this movement, making sure that those voices are represented in anything that we do We could tell that's important, especially being a predominantly hispanic community.
These things were, people were saying: Nothing happened as a result of following those three one complaints, and at this point, when it comes to quality of life.
What this tells us one of the things this tells us that we need to bring people together, because I think a lot of people don't know about all of the different agencies and entities that could come to the table to bring some really creative solutions to these problems, and I.
We're gonna, be you know, trying to bring all these community partners together to really come to the table to do this, but we really think it's important that the community is really a equal partner at that table to make sure their voices are heard in that their interests are.
We're really saying this is a public health issue, I don't want to go on because it's late, And I know people are.
One said regarding karen's question about three one: not showing up on board stat: There are people at beta, NYC, actively working on this question for washing heights in wood for respectful decimals, so that was fun, and then someone also commented that you know inwood hill park is out of control, as it relates to this.
Depart hello, I think it would just be good, you know, maybe to help people focus and help them.
So, that's exactly what we are doing right now is doing a community-led task force that will bring all of these people.
We have people committed to working on that Is to bring all these people together to the table, to talk about to come start becoming to come up with these priorities of in terms of how to tackle these things, as daryl was alluding to you, know, looking at things like in terms of what are the most Force and, as I said, community board 12, of course, steve, and all these people will be able to be a part of that.
Speeding all over that neighborhood I just want to point out that that we can work on more than one track, and You know.
How are we going to ensure that people are on this test, like people outside of the community board and people that are directly impacted, are on the task force and that we're just not driving the rhetoric?
The different scenarios to the group, and people really want this to be community-led, and that was the reason.
You know deeply entrenched in these issues, deeply from the grassroots level they're coming up with these name and with these potential people and potential participants, and of course.
All of the different entities that you know would be interested in and being a part of this conversation, I was going to say too: There are models in the community where this has actually worked, like we've had models in the community where this type of process everywhere has worked really well in addressing issues see we just we.
That's doing the task force and respectful decibels is a group of it's a facebook group of 800 members who are free to choose as they wish, and we definitely do want to partner with the community board all right, I.
Just thank you tanya for answering my question, but I just want to emphasize and like urge everyone that is involved in the task force selection process to reach out to people that aren't voluntarily displaying interest, because I think there are parts of our communities, like my grandmother who are affected by this issue.
All of you who are doing this incredible work of reaching out to the community about noise and quality of life and testing and tracing might You know mention, while you're at it make sure people have filled out the census.
The noise issues that we that we've talked about a quick announcement, I, know what I'm working.
I think fabricio said it has a role to play in terms of dealing with the illegal distribution of fireworks, but in on general noise, issues, I'm, not so sure that it does have a role to play, but that might be worth looking.
We're going to break off into groups like that people have chosen to do the activity of their choice, so there'll be an open discussion on these environmental justice issues, including noise pollution.
