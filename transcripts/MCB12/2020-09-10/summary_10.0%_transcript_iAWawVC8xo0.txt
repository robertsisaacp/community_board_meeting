I mean I believe what I've read and There was a report on air filtration systems in northern Manhattan schools So as for the schools, the city department of health is participating in a task force with department, education and other related parties to to you know, to create policies and to also you know, take it take these concerns into account and make make amends or try to fix them.
That responsibility was relegated to that office, so they're the ones that created various task forces of different inspectors from hpd DCA, department of health of buildings, fire departments and so forth, and they go out in droves and they you know, conduct inspections based on complaints and also for enforcement efforts Ultimately, if you have any concerns, please reach out to the mayor's office.
One second I think sally had a third I was one of them to go on the subways and hand out masks to people It's not just that people are being jerk, it's in our neighborhood We definitely agree and the mass distributions are headed up by the mayor's office as well, so they've been they've, been handing out mass through the parks enforcement personnel and any other personal The question I had was about testing and the results from testing Sorry I jumped the gun, but yes, you jumped the gun, don't steal her thunda Do you have anything else for che just also to address a question in the chat about restaurant procedure?
As you might know, our workflow is when somebody tests positive for Covid-19 19 We also connect people to programs, including get food I know there was a question earlier about mosques right so at highbridge, for example, if somebody comes to the test site and doesn't have mass, we would give them a mask for the time.
I'm sad that we lost our department of health colleague before that question was asked So at the moment you have the 24 pop-up testing sites and 10 mobile units That's right, and we know for sure that you have at least two sites in in our community in washington heights in inwood and possibly a third just one at dickman, one at high bridge and then I will cross check on the dohmh site.
We do put out signage to maintain the six feet apart since right from folks If. We, if you do hear of concerns around safety at the high bridge or dikeman sites, I can't speak for the department of health site that is well known, named quest I think an article in the new york times and several other local state and nationwide media reporting the delays with quest labs Covid-19 You know the utility of that result being diminished by that delay with access.
We would appreciate any data you can provide to us on how contact tracing is actually working in our specific community board district members of the DOE and daycare workers are prioritized for both access to testing and their results at 22, health and hospital sites, including all 11 of our acute hospitals and 11 clinics, including, and they are also prioritized in terms of access to testing across all of the pop-ups, so very committed to making sure that DOE staff daycare staff who are essential to the reopening of schools and other services there are.
We do send the tests away to get processed the remaining 22 health and hospitals, acutes and gotham sites, and four of our mobile units use bioreference labs, which it does not I, know, there's intention to build up the city's own capacity to process tests and we've also been working on strengthening our capacity to produce the actual test kits and viral transport media that those test kids get I mean this is anecdotal, but based on people's comments that I read on the inwood social media sites, people seem to be very satisfied with the site on diamond street Is it 175, nagel avenue In one case, someone wrote that they got their result, maybe the next day, so the service at at the dyckman family health center appears to be pretty good.
Those positive test results are reported to the state as part of infection control protocol, so the lab, in addition to reporting it to the provider and the patient reports it to the state, and we get the data from the state So. We get data on folks who test positive across the city, no matter where they were tested and also Only, reaching out to folks who test positive for the current currently having cover 19, unlike say someone who's negative for it, but has the antibodies for the first time, We prioritize for tracing and folks who have tested positive and then once we speak to that person or people, and they, let us know who else they've been in contact with We, would also prioritize all of those folks and to make sure that they are able to access testing Any other questions I'm.
Our clinics are seeing patients, the labs are operating all on reduced density, always social distancing and a strict mask policy, and all this strict Covid-19 protocols in terms of some of the community outreach This year, the medical center neighborhood fund has been focused completely on food relief in northern Manhattan We've been working with our colleagues at morningside and have made several large donations of pantries food pantries throughout northern Manhattan, we'll be doing some more over the next month.
, we're very interested in knowing how our our ems unit has been able to survive through this whole pandemic and how you've been able to handle it and and where you are now and how the response times have been, because, basically, ever since the the base station moved up to washington heights, the response times have been declining and during this pandemic I'm sure you, you suffered some setbacks, but maybe now you can tell us where things are and then they added another medic ambulance and one more emt ambulance in may 3rd What presently we're 150 capacity?
The first thing: I did was: I first have to tell you that these are 911 calls I, don't really have access to citywide to all the hospitals in voluntary units, so there's department numbers and it's raw data, I compared months to month, from 2019 free coping to month to month during 2020, and even though the you know, the I think the first really reported case was was confirmed in first of march or the end of february.
We had many more calls than the rest of the city that were covered related and that you know, starting in april, the rest of the city didn't want to go to the hospital because they didn't want to, and this year I extrapolated the numbers from august That's probably because of the people not going to the hospital Those ambulance calls are you know they only use lights and sirens when it's when it's a priority, one two or three call a life-threatening call.
Whenever that is determined, you know there is going to be some level of impact to service, but I think at this point it's too early to determine what that number would look like if it's going to happen and exactly what that would incur in terms of overall operations.
On the first of the front lines Maybe, it's played the entire city, but it's also been plaguing our community going back to maybe the end of may early June Sometimes couldn't people couldn't sleep, it was It was just all over the place from one end of washington heights to the inn to to the tip of the island, including inward and I want to do a resolution.
in one case on nagel avenue, a family was burned out in another and actually on the very same day, until the early hours of july, 5th, You know right after the midnight of july 4th, they were burned out on bagel avenue and and an apartment on 157th street fireworks was set off on the roof For. You know they didn't suffer, maybe as grievously as the people on nagel avenue, but they couldn't they couldn't get in back into their apartment, I believe for at least 10 days or so, and then we have at least one case where a daughter reports that her mother suffered an anxiety attack, then a heart attack and then died all because of these fireworks and people is how many other instances have might have occurred during this period in our in our community, where fireworks created fires, where, where people did, who didn't give a damn where they launched these fireworks, if it ended up in somebody's apartment or somewhere else was the 184 nagel avenue that occurred on july 5th in the early morning, where it was on the first floor apartment where, ultimately, there were two minor There were two minor patients reported both non-life-threatening, but the cause was because of the use of fireworks However the department in working with the sheriff's office, due to the mayoral task force due to the severity of fireworks over this past summer, which spanned from early June, all the way up to july 4th and a little bit beyond that, basically established a group to target seizures or to target the distribution ultimately to seize firework.
The fire department in the coming years will continue to do tabling right around or prior to the fourth of july weekend, where we do see typically a spike in fireworks, but specifically in the zip codes of town of inward washington heights, the only ones that we can say that were caused officially by fireworks within our records granted, there might have been smaller incidents that may have not been reported out and investigated due to cause, but the only one that we had was on the 184 nagel avenue, which was on july 5th, I, think it was 551.
You know I generally this year, I think was a bit different from previous years, just because of everything going on with the quarantine and Covid-19, ultimately hindering outdoor public events and possibly the distribution of fireworks in other states and across the states Typically.
I think it's all about the work of combined task forces in terms of enforcement similar to what was done This year with NYPD, the sheriff's office and the fire department, ultimately working collaboratively to tackle the distribution levels, I think on enforcement and looking on a more local level, working with local fire units and NYPD pres precincts to respond or monitor quickly, more to incidents or reports of fireworks with certain communities and I.
One of the things that happened is that at first people were saying we were told to call 3-9-1-1 when we saw illegal firework activity, I guess because they got so many and I don't know if you're aware, but in our community we had on like 5, 000 fire, illegal firework complaints or something like that.
You know in terms of prevention and working on the education front, I think it's just working collaboratively, knowing that the spike usually does occur in the month leading up to the fourth of july and around that time, I would say proactively, working with again the community board or community based organizations and getting out and doing education ultimately to showcase the dangers now in terms of other ways of basically reporting or using an enforcement tool.
I know in central Brooklyn It was another community in the bedstein crown heights region, where I think it was either the second highest in the city that we were getting reports of fireworks, complaints, So again, just to reiterate everything I think it's all about early education and again having and continuing to work with law enforcement and fire and fire protection services.
Could again, I think it's a with the quarantine and everything that Covid-19 19 impacted on overall business and distribution of materials, Again I think when you talked about the illegal distribution, because again, the use of fireworks varies from state to state so again how things are distributed things, how our soul is going to affect differently across the board could have It's an issue of distribution that occurs from you know from year to year, and again the spike usually is seen right around the july fourth time and leading up to it What steve just had to say about the fireworks supply and its impact My question would be to mr carroll.
Force of the unit in advance, I'd be more than happy if coordinating it, but I would also, from a departmental standpoint, also bring in the outreach and public education units just because I think beyond understanding the task force and the enforcement aspect from the department standpoint, you know I think we have to think of it from a holistic approach of not only enforcement but education as well All of that's fine, but having worked on outreach and communications issues, myself, I want to make sure that the onus isn't placed entirely on the community to fix the problems and to be better educated.
We also have our community-based programs our senior resource center, our north programs and our upper Manhattan partnership for senior independence They are being handled on a virtual basis in many cases, although in some cases we're able to go to visit people now in their homes to be able to make sure that they're, it's an ongoing effort, as you can imagine like the medical community at large We, do not know what the fall will bring.
Yes all right, so I'm, looking at the state health department report that came out yesterday with you know, statewide data on on nursing, home and adult care facility, covert, related deaths and the numbers for isabella They.
Right now, and you know last time we said that they're doing orientation, medical med, surg orientation in all the different floors of the allen, but now, according to chris, they are assigned to do Covid-19 testing at the milstein heart center, correct You , know the patients in the community So you we're talking now about psych patients were mixed in with the rest of the patient inpatient population at at allen, while the spike unit has been closed, but normally if the psych unit was open, They were still sent to allen, which maybe suggests to me that that there's a need for these feds at allen, because the population can't be served elsewhere.
Where we're still closed, so that's and how many site patients could could you say have been in the in the med surg beds at allen, and you know of the med surge There was an exchange of correspondence between state, senator jackson and I I mean they still talk about how they're not prepared to reopen the psych unit at this time because of the possibility of a second wave and how they're going to need these beds again for for covert 19 patients If I remember correctly from that letter, he still doesn't make a clear-cut commitment to live up to the requirement to restore those beds.
I wanted to do one the community board, so, yes, I do want to do another letter I'm now holding the letter that dr corwin sent back to say, state senator jackson, where he says I very much understand the desire to know when these those inpatient beds will return to northern Manhattan At. This time we are undertaking a thorough evaluation of our behavioral health inpatient capacity and outpatient services at both the allen hospital and our milstein campus We can determine a comprehensive plan that best meets the behavioral health needs, including inpatient beds of the northern Manhattan community.
Sarah, because looking at the bigger picture, we actually have a campaign, save new york, psych bed, it's a statewide campaign We want to build a coalition that will include more community organizations and we would like to invite cb12 to be part of this coalition As. We know the hospitals are still hiding behind the excuse of Covid-19 and whatever gom como will be mandating We have a second surge So. This is an invitation to see b12 to be part of that coalition and to help us, if you guys, can help us identify in washington heights community Other organizations that we haven't engaged with regards to fighting to reopen the allen.
apparently, those calls are not being referred to the police if it was at some point, a function of the police, it's now being handled through the mayor's office of enforcement So, you could certainly you can certainly file a report through three one Okay we're now on to our follow-up on the noise pollution hearing that we held back in early august Oh, actually it says, host has disabled attendee screen sharing Sorry.
It became clear that high decibel levels are not merely quality of life issues, as they have been characterized in the past, but are actually health and safety issues Dr arlene bronsoft, a renowned noise expert who spoke at the hearing on august 4th and has been offering us advisement Her groundbreaking study from ps98 in inward showed that children consistently exposed to the loud noise of elevated subway tracks next to their classrooms, fell a year behind their peers in reading ability by the end of elementary school Dr bronzaf, followed up on her work by collaborating with city agencies resulting in the subway tracks being coated with the material to become quieter so that all the children could succeed in school as we go back to school now, and children additionally need to be able to study at home more than before, Motorcycles and stereo systems begin on the street At night noise has many health effects, including cardiovascular disease, and a link to diabetes As you can see, street and sidewalk noise vehicles and residential noise comprise 96 of all the complaints.
One, second, is that richard I mostly comment because I appreciated the depth of research and other issue work that went into the presentation that was just made, but I also want to make sure we don't leave this issue without at least an acknowledgement, heavy lifting that our colleague, johnny bonner, has that our colleague, tony bonner has done on this issue, both in the community and especially within the community board, to see that our committees are aware and that there's an awareness throughout the board double thanks all around all right As, a lot of people know there's been a lot happening on this issue for years behind the scenes.
Also I just wanted to just touch base about our what we what we talked about, what I brought up at the august fourth of noise pollution hearing was the idea of the task force to come together to bring all these entities together to begin to talk about solutions, because you know it's important that we start bringing people to the table to start to talk to each other.
So here is the mission statement that we've come up with, as people can see , I'll read it out loud for those of us who might have hearing difficult, I, mean site difficulties, mission statement and, of course this is gonna, be translated into spanish before we put anything out officially, but it says the wahi inwood task force on noise is a broad community-led coalition of neighborhood groups, local residents, small businesses and public health experts.
People sometimes tried to contact their police precincts directly, and some people felt that did not lead to at all lead to any sort of solutions, and people didn't realize that the parks department has an enforcement unit like about half of the people and I thought that was pretty telling So I think what this, what this tells us one of the things this tells us that we need to bring people together because I think a lot of people don't know about all of the different agencies and entities that could come to the table to bring some really creative solutions to these problems and I think it's important that we provide support and I would love to have everyone's support.
To do this, but we really think it's important that the community is really a equal partner at that table to make sure their voices are heard in that their interests are, you know, are considered in this and, as we said, we want to make sure that we are valuing it and listening to minorities in the community about how they've been impacted by all of this, and also their leadership and voices on this We do have some support as well from for this task force from some of our electeds, and we want to really over the next month, convene our first meeting to begin to have these dialogues and conversations, and we really love to have.
Think what needs to happen is we need to bring that issue to the table when we have our task force and have the parties You know steve, thank you so much for bringing beta NYC to that hearing and we were able to coordinate that and bringing the police department to that conversation so, and mark levine obviously expressed interest in this issue, so bringing all those parties together to be able to figure out what is actually going on and what you know.
You know you and curtis have the ability to get these agencies to show up and that's their responsibilities, agencies they have to report back to us That's what we're doing, but it's going to be community So, that's exactly what we are doing right now is doing a community-led task force that will bring all of these people together.
As, you saw the mission statement we have people committed to working on that is to bring all these people together to the table to talk about to come start becoming to come up with these priorities of in terms of how to tackle these things as daryl was alluding to you know looking at things like in terms of what are the most and we are moving forward on that task force and, as I said, community board 12, of course, steve, and all these people will be able to be a part of that We want to make sure that's coming from the community that is representative of the community, that the voices in the in the needs are being that are that the voices of the people of community are being heard and being heard fairly So that's why it's important, but those and I you know we obviously have support here.
All of you who are doing this incredible work of reaching out to the community about noise and quality of life and testing and tracing might as well You know mention, while you're at it make sure people have filled out the census.
