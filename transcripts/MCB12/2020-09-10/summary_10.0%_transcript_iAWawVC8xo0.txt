He's allowed to speak to us, even though he's from another borough, and can everyone mute themselves, please all right As of this afternoon, we have over 27.9 million reported cases in the world in New, York state outside of New York City.
Travelers coming from these states must quantity for 14 days and travelers are also required to complete the state's Department of Health travel reforms when traveling by you know different transportation methods.
Second, question: is: to what extent you all are communicating, with the department of transportation etc, on the open streets, open, restaurants, Again, that's a particular hot spot in our neighborhood, because in many cases the masking requirements and distancing are not being enforced.
I have friends that teach in these schools that are terrified to go to work So as for the schools, the City Department of Health is participating in a task force with department, education and other related parties to to you, know, to create policies and to also you know.
Okay, I can find that report and forward it to you and to Steve If we had to report, we can definitely take a look at it, but as for opening the schools on, it is ultimately up to a DOE right Her second question was about the open streets program and how masking and social distancing So with the open streets.
That responsibility was relegated to that office, so they're, the ones that created various task forces of different inspectors from HPD DCA, department of Health of buildings, fire departments and so forth, and they go out in droves, They you know, conduct inspections based on complaints and also for enforcement.
You know, city of affiliated employees that are working in parks or targeted areas, but I can definitely reach out to find more details about where these masks are distributed on a regular basis, great, and it would be helpful if you would at least consider free mass dispensing machines.
Testing trace, was launched by the mayor as part of the surge in response to coved New York, City, Health and hospitals had opened 22 testing sites, including the Dieckmann testing site at the Dikeman Houses in Washington Heights.
Obviously, we're always looking for more ways to reach the community and have more people come in for testing.
We do want to make sure that people are protected when they're coming to a test site.
That's right, and we know for sure that you have at least two sites in in our community in Washington Heights in Inwood and possibly a third just one at dickman, one at high bridge, and then I will cross check on the dohmh.
We would appreciate any data you can provide to us on how contact tracing is actually working in our specific Community board.
We have a number of test sites that are within health and hospitals or operated by the city, and we also have partnerships with private labs that are also prioritizing teachers.
I know, there's intention to build up the city's own capacity to process tests and we've also been working on strengthening our capacity to produce the actual test kits and viral transport media that those test kids get.
We provide access to PPE right, especially when there's been shortages with the health centers and with city Md. If somebody's insured there's no cost to the patient, we bill.
We do not build a patient, a copay, and we also wanted to make sure that our testing for uninsured folks was, you know, not hindered.
We prioritize for tracing and folks who have tested positive and then once we speak to that person or people, and they, let us know who else they've been in contact.
, you know in terms of the campus And, what's going on at the medical center , we are still you know, largely virtual, but more and more people are coming.
If other people do not, you know there is an effort to do a streets co- naming for 168Th Street between Broadway and Fort Washington Healthcare heroes, way for the folks there at Columbia, as well as I, can just say that public, thanks to you and all who are working on this effort, obviously I'm biased, but I think this is very well deserved.
We have a thing called csu, which is a counseling service with the psychiatrists and stuff, and so you know I'm just I'm so proud of our guys, because everybody came to work, nobody complained.
You know it's always easter famine with a with a fire department Ems, because we have so many people that want to go to fire suppression.
Not just people in the ambulances- But I know that four years ago, I think there were maybe 750 ambulances totaled in the city.
We have staggered hours so that when it's shift change, you know it's not like at a factory where everybody goes home at 3 o'clock and the new people come in.
Reductions that have been planned are intact numbers for Ems training and there is an outlook or a positive outlook of remaining or maintaining some level of Ems training, meaning that we are as a department going to look out and provide emts into the workforce within the coming years.
You know there is going to be some level of impact to service, but I think at this point So I just wanted to add that piece to what the captain had mentioned.
Which and then captain The fireworks issue- Maybe, it's played the entire city, but it's also been plaguing our community going back to maybe the end of May early June.
However, the department in working with the sheriff's office, due to the mayoral task force due to the severity of fireworks over this past summer, which spanned from early June all the way up to July 4th and a little bit beyond.
The fire department in the coming years will continue to do tabling right around or prior to the fourth of July weekend, where we do see typically a spike in fireworks, but specifically in the zip codes of town of Inward, Washington Heights, the only ones that we can say that were caused officially by fireworks.
So what can be done even once that those illegal fireworks get into the communities anything that can be done, but first I just want to know like.
You know I generally, this year, I think, was a bit different from previous years, just because of everything going on with the quarantine and Covid-19, ultimately hindering outdoor public events and possibly the distribution of fireworks in other states and acrosss.
You did see a mass distribution ultimately on an illegal sense, acrosss neighborhoods acrosss, the U.S. You do see a spike in fireworks use and legal fireworks use as you draw closer to the fourth of July annually, but I think this year, just with cobia 19 and the quarantine and a lot of restrictions in overall distribution or access to hold on I'm sorry hold on a second sorry, apologies, the you know, I think, beyond just what was going on with Covid-19 and the quarantine that could have exasperated a lot of the issues as well.
I. Think it's all about the work of combined task forces in terms of enforcement similar to what was done this year with NYPD the sheriff's office and the fire department.
I, think on enforcement and looking on a more local level, working with local fire units and NYPD pres precincts to respond or monitor, quickly, more to incidents or reports of fireworks with certain communities, and I.
Think it's all about public education as well, and working with community stakeholders like the Community, Board and other tenant organizations of really educating in advance of these periods, where we do typically see a spike in firework use and just basically educating communities to the to the dangers of fireworks and what can occur and clearly.
I. One of the things that happened is that at first people were saying we were told to call 3- 9- 1- 1, when we saw illegal firework activity, I guess because they got so many, and I do not know if you're aware, but in our community we had on like 5,000, fire, illegal firework, complaints or something like that.
It was higher than all of the other communities in all of Manhattan up here But we were that switched on us, so we were first calling they were told to call when you would go to 3- It seemed like in the middle of this crisis, we were sort of left spinning, because the avenues that were set up for us to do this were sort of cut off right, and so we just sort of suffered in silence, What resources are you all going to have for the community to use to address this in the future, because I, you know, I, just see this happening again?
I think it's just working collaboratively, knowing that the spike usually does occur in the month, leading up to the fourth of July, and around that time, I would say: proactively, working with again the community board or community based organizations and getting out and doing education, ultimately to showcase the dangers now in terms of other ways of basically reporting or using an enforcement.
I know in central Brooklyn It was another community in the Bedstein Crown Heights region, where I think it was either the second highest in the city that we were getting reports of fireworks, complaints.
Given this circumstance that we just experienced of really tackling this issue, because it's not only the distribution and tackling those that distribute, but at the end, but it's also about educating the community of how to basically report and teaching the danger so that you know this message is loud and clear.
I think, just as a whole, it's an issue of distribution that occurs from you know from year to year, and again the spike usually is seen right around the July fourth time and leading up to it.
I'd be more than happy if coordinating it, but I would also, from a departmental standpoint, also bring in the outreach and public education units just because I think beyond understanding the task force and the enforcement aspect from the department, standpoint.
You, know, I think we have to think of it from a holistic approach of not only enforcement but education as well Oh, all of that's fine, but having worked on outreach and communications issues, myself, I want to make sure that the onus is not placed entirely on the community to fix the problems and to be better educated.
I do not know, but right now we're holding firm and we're very grateful for the support we've gotten from the community in terms of people offering to help with providing masks and providing other kinds of obstacles.
Yes, all right, so I'm, looking at the State Health Department report that came out yesterday with you, know, statewide data on on nursing, home and adult care, facility, Covid-19 related deaths and the numbers for isabella.
Right now, and you know last time we said that they're doing orientation, medical Med, Surg orientation in all the different floors of the allen, but now, according to Chris.
The president of the hospital and Corwin wrote back I mean they still talk about how they're not prepared to reopen the psych unit at this time because of the possibility of a second wave and how they're going to need these beds again for for Covid-19 patients.
First of all, I wanted to follow up steve because he said that, because in 2018 we were able to put together a resolution right that was passed by CB12 regarding the near the allen site We do not need to do another resolution, but instead they're going to be sending a follow- up, letter.
We will reach out to discuss and work together with you and our other government and community partners on that plan in the fall without knowing with certainty whether there may be another surge.
Well, that's maybe more than he has said in the past, but I do want to see how he intends to work together with us on this plan that he's talking about Daryl Sorry, if they, you may have answered some of this, but there's three questions so one for the folks at New, York, Presbyterian, working in psychiatry and mental Health has the pandemic.
If you guys, can help us identify in Washington Heights community other organizations that we have not engaged with regards to fighting to reopen the Allen psych unit- And you know the New York state psych beds in general, we would love to get assistance so that we can reach out to them.
So I just, I think, the Community board, and this committee should consider another resolution that builds on our first resolution reiterates a lot of these points, but also addresses the fact that the need is greater than it was when we originally focused on the ellen.
So, first of all, I just wanted to thank you so much for including us today, and especially to Steve Simon for hosting the noise pollution hearing on August 4th and bringing all of the necessary resources and agencies to the and policy makers to the table.
Her groundbreaking study from Ps98 in inward showed that children consistently exposed to the loud noise of elevated subway tracks next to their classrooms, fell a year behind their peers in reading ability by the end of elementary school Dr Bronzaf, followed up on her work by collaborating with city agencies resulting in the subway tracks being coated with the material to become quieter so that all the children could succeed in school as we go back to school, now, and children additionally need to be able to study at home more than before.
I assume, to be honest, I'm, not sure, if this, if the fireworks are registering as noise complaints, the 311 or if, since the 311, had people calling 911 if they're a separate thing, that's something that we could try to find.
We formed several working groups that aim to solve noise pollution at the source, balancing the need for quiet with our shared community priorities of outdoor socialization and recreation, businesses, thriving and the minimization or elimination of police contact.
We are also engaged in community outreach and have an email and phone number by which non- Facebook users can contact us we're additionally reaching out to members of housing networks such as supers, landlords, Tenant, Association and hopefully also other housing such as nursing homes, which we understand that noise has been an issue at isabella as well.
People understand what decimals are so, I would say something like maybe noise levels or something, but I think the decibels is just not a common term for most people.
But the niosh app would be part of the public health campaign where we measure the decibel levels around us, and so you know, one of the things that happens is when people are around loud decibels, all the time they lose hearing, and so people who are making noise may not realize how much noise they're making, because it does not sound.
Fourth of noise pollution hearing You know it's important that we start bringing people to the table to start to talk to each other, talk, acrosss departments, to talk acrosss.
You know communities and community groups, and things like that to sort of come up with these.
We want to bring all the different entities together, but we feel is important that this is something that is coming out of the community in terms of leadership on this issue.
This is going to be translated into spanish before we put anything out officially, but it says the Wahi Inwood task force on noise is A broad community, led coalition of neighborhood groups, local residents, small businesses and public health, experts.
What people can do, monetarily what roles people will play where the accountability will be on certain issues, and so we think that is an extremely important role and we also, as I said mentioned, that we really want to make sure that we are including voices of the diverse voices in this movement, making sure that those voices are represented in anything that we do We could tell that's important, especially being a predominantly hispanic community.
These things were, people were saying: Nothing happened as a result of following those three one complaints, and at this point, when it comes to quality of life.
What this tells us one of the things this tells us that we need to bring people together, because I think a lot of people do not know about all of the different agencies and entities that could come to the table to bring some really creative solutions to these problems, and I.
You know, trying to bring all these community partners together to really come to the table to do this, but we really think it's important that the community is really a equal partner at that table to make sure their voices are heard in that their interests are.
There are people at beta NYC, actively working on this question for washing heights in wood for respectful decimals, so that was fun, and then someone also commented that you know Inwood Hill park is out of control, as it relates to this.
And I was wondering from that too, like is there maybe like a top 10 or 20 lists of hot spots in the community that you're, focusing on, or I believe it was last spring with the similar data with them about some of the hot spots around, where I am so showing that so you can pull that pretty easily Also I was going to say with the with the parks we do have that information, because people in the group identified the problem.
Depart hello, I think it would just be good, you know, maybe to help people focus and help them.
So, and Mark Levine obviously expressed interest in this issue, so bringing all those parties together to be able to figure out what is actually going on and what you know.
I was just saying that you know that bringing these people together to the table will really make a difference.
So, that's exactly what we are doing right now is doing a community- led task force that will bring all of these people.
Force and, as I said, Community, Board, 12, of course, Steve, and all these people will be able to be a part of that.
Speeding all over that neighborhood I just want to point out that that we can work on more than one track, and You know.
The different scenarios to the group and people really want this to be community- led, and that was the reason.
You know deeply entrenched in these issues, deeply from the grassroots level they're coming up with these name and with these potential people and potential participants, and of course.
I. Just thank you tanya for answering my question, but I just want to emphasize and like urge everyone that is involved in the task force selection process to reach out to people that are not voluntarily displaying interest, because I think there are parts of our communities, like my grandmother who are affected by this issue.
All of you who are doing this incredible work of reaching out to the community about noise and quality of life and testing and tracing might You know mention, while you're at it make sure people have filled out the census.
I. Think Fabricio said it has a role to play in terms of dealing with the illegal distribution of fireworks, but in on general noise, issues, I'm, not so sure that it does have a role to play, but that might be worth looking.
