Is is: is it che no from the City Department of Health? All right? Maybe we do not have maybe he's either on the webex yeah I'm here. What is that? This is cheno from the New York State Department of Health, oh fantastic, all right, so Jay you're a am. I pronouncing it correctly. Yes, Sir! That's correct, okay, great all, right, Jay you're up first, it looks like you're sitting in the City Council chambers. Maybe the can you give us a report on where we stand at the moment with Covid-19., of course? Well, thank you for hosting me. My name is Trey Noe and I am the queen's community liaison from the New York State Department of Health and Mental hygiene. I am covering for my colleague, Pauline Ferrante, who usually I'm assigned to this area. She sends a regard she was not able to make it today so today I'll be giving you some basic updates about what's been going on. Give me a second all right. Thank you. I have two meetings going at the same time, so I'm just trying to see which one I can do. First and thankfully, your meeting came up first, all right, okay, I just I just want to caution my committee members not to hold it against him. That he's from Queens with you know, give him the privilege. You know we're going to give him a courtesy. He's allowed to speak to us, even though he's from another borough, and can everyone mute themselves, please all right, let's get started yeah. So as of this afternoon, we have over 27.9 million reported cases in the world in New, York state outside of New York City. We had a 204,928 reported cases in New York City alone. We have 236 thousand 983 reported cases as of this afternoon and so far we have. We have had nineteen thousand ninety nine confirmed deaths and four thousand six hundred forty probable deaths for the borough of Manhattan Manhattan had thirty thousand four hundred to confirm cases of those cases. 27 percent or 8,301 people have been hospitalized. They are having 2,535 confirmed deaths and 643 probable deaths as of this afternoon. So, as you are aware, New York City is now reopening. It's been reopening for the past couple months, but there's still a transmission of coping 19 in New York City, as you can see from the numbers that are presented every single day. All new yorkers should follow the core four principles. Basically, they are stay home if you're, sick, only leave for Covid-19 testing and other essential medical care or other essential errands such as groceries, if you have no other way to get them, keep physical distance stay at least six feet away from other people when outside your home wear a face covering you can be contagious without symptoms and by wearing a face covering you can protect those around you by doing so, and finally, wash your hands often with soap and water use, hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available. So with this New York City restart. We currently have open outdoor recreation activities such as basketball, bocce ball handball, tennis, volleyball courts and such indoor recreation activities such as bowling alleys and low risk cultural activities are open as of August, 14 2020, so bowling alleys have 50 occupancy fish coverings required every other lane closed and so forth. For museums aquariums, they are open at 25 maximum occupancy with time, ticketing, chairman health clubs, the hot topic finally opened on September, 2nd with 33 maximum capacity. Special air ventilation requirements. Mass and social distancing required must use sign- in forms for everyone for contact, tracing and health screenings must occur at the door. No in the ignore in no indoor classes are allowed. Malls have opened yesterday at 50 capacity. If the mall has the required filtration systems, master required, no indoor, dining or loitering. Casinos are now open too, at 25% capacity with the same requirements, and today we have heard from the governor that indoor dining will resume in New York City at 25% capacity. Was it yesterday, I'm sorry again my day's confused, but it the indoor dining will resume on September 30th temperature checks must be required. One member of each party must leave contact information for a contact. Tracers no bar service is allowed, patrons can have alcohol, but not sitting at the bar mask masks at all times are required when not sitting at the table and tables must be six feet apart. Restaurants also have the air filtration requirements and they must close by midnight and they must come. The restaurants must compose, must post compliance phone numbers and their 25% capacity numbers. If the infection rate does not go up, we can reassess the guidelines and increase the capacity of indoor dining from 25 to 50 and so forth. November 1st is the deadline to make this determination for businesses that have questions about restarting they can call 1-, 800-, 727-, 4692 and interested individuals can visit DOT, gov Ford.Ny.Gov reopening guidance as you're. Well aware, we have a travel advisories in effect, so we have multiple states. I do not want to read all of them, but they seem to be a lot. Travelers coming from these states must quantity for 14 days and travelers are also required to complete the state's Department of Health travel reforms when traveling by you know different transportation methods and we're also arriving at checkpoints, as for schools were reopened for blended learning on September 21st, and there was a lot of discussion and I guess they decided on a date, so schools resume on September 21st with different learning capacities, so some students will come to school every couple days. Some students will stay at home and so forth. As for everything else, that's pretty much it. Those are the new things that happened in the past couple of weeks and please, let me know if you have any questions. Thank you know well, Che. First of all, I assume you have a written report, maybe that you could email me. So I can make sure that I include the correct items in the agenda in the minutes sure I'll have pauline email you, the most up- to- date version of what I said tomorrow morning. All right, thank you, and I just want to report on the on the statistics for our four zip codes, which I do at every meeting, and it looks as though looks as though we're doing a little bit worse than the last time. I checked back in July Zip code 40, which had been number 78 on the list of 177 zip codes in New York City is now up. It moved up to number 69 with 268 deaths. 101,317 cases zip code 32, which is which had been at the 77 spot, was, is now at 73 with 1788 cases. 286 deaths, zip code 33 was 94, is now 93 with 1553 cases, 206 deaths and zip code 34, which had been at at the 100 ranked at number 126, is now at 119, with 100,887 cases and 167 deaths, so all told in our four zip codes. We are now at 927 deaths, Covid-19. back in July. We were at 910, so there have been 17 in basically the last two months, which is I mean 17 people have died, but it's it's not increasing at the rate that it had been a few months back, but it's we do. We have now suffered 927 deaths from Covid-19 in our community. Are there any questions for Jay, okay, very good, to tell pauline okay Sally yeah? I have a few first to what extent were y' all involved in the guidelines were given out for schools. I'm particularly concerned about the fact that it was either 26 out of 28 or 36 out of 38. Schools did not have sufficient air filtration, yet those schools are open and that was in northern Manhattan and it seems like decisions are being made on a citywide basis with schools opening, even though we have data down to the zip code level and community board level. So I want to know how you're involved in that. My second question is: to what extent you all are communicating, with the department of transportation etc, on the open streets open restaurants- again, that's a particular hot spot in our neighborhood, because in many cases the masking requirements and distancing are not being enforced. So you know there are areas where, if you walk by them in our neighborhood, you feel like you've walked into a super spreader event. My third question is in terms of masking I participated in the department of transportation with MTA. They had a few days where they recruited volunteers to serve as a mask force, handing out free masks in the subways where they're required. I wondered if you guys had considered anything like that. We go back to your first question. Are you saying that 36 out of 38 schools in our school district have insufficient ventilation right? I mean, I believe, what I've read and what I've heard is that they've checked all of the schools and only found city- wide, maybe a 20. What some number like that needed to have modifications made for their ventilation right? Where did you see this number? That's 36 out of 38.. It might be 26 out of 28. There was a report on air filtration systems in northern Manhattan schools. I think it might have been in patch or something it was not specifically looking at it for Covid-19. It was looking at what we did not have in our schools, pre- covered, which obviously, if we did not have a pre- covered, we still do not have it, and I just wonder if the city's passage of systems did not was not fine enough to make sure that we actually had sufficient ventilation. I have friends that teach in these schools that are terrified to go to work yeah. I do not J do you have something to add to this? Yes, so as for the schools, the City Department of Health is participating in a task force with department, education and other related parties to to you know, to create policies and to also you know, take it take these concerns into account and make make amends or try to fix them. As for that statistics you mentioned, I am not aware of it. Okay, I can find that report and forward it to you and to Steve yeah, please, okay, that'd be greatly appreciated. So, if we had to report, we can definitely take a look at it, but as for opening the schools on, it is ultimately up to a DOE right and her second question was about the open streets program and how masking and social distancing gets enforced. Yes, so with the open streets program, DOT DOT is ultimately responsible for issuing the permits and they you know they issued a lot of them. Then the inspection and the enforcement falls upon the mayor's office of special enforcement. That responsibility was relegated to that office, so they're the ones that created various task forces of different inspectors from HPD DCA department of Health of buildings, fire departments and so forth, and they go out in droves and they you know, conduct inspections based on complaints and also for enforcement efforts. Our inspectors are involved in that effort, however, we're not in charge of it. So, ultimately, if you have any concerns, please reach out to the mayor's office. Okay, yeah. I believe when we did our public hearing in early August on noise pollution, I believe we had the head of that office speaking to us on and answering. I think he answered that very question at that. At that public hearing what I had a couple, questions Steve, sorry yeah. I do not know one second, I think Sally had a third. My third one was just: are you doing any initiatives with distributing mass like there were days where MTA recruited volunteers? I was one of them to go on the subways and hand out masks to people. Yes, it's not just that people are being Jerk, it's in our neighborhood. It's also an economic issue. Of course. No we definitely agree and the mass distributions are headed up by the mayor's office as well, so they've been they've, been handing out mass through the parks enforcement personnel and any other personal. You know, city of affiliated employees that are working in parks or targeted areas, but I can definitely reach out to find more details about where these masks are distributed on a regular basis great, and it would be helpful if you would at least consider free mass dispensing machines you could put them in pharmacies, businesses, etc. I know that y' all distribute the free mass to businesses, but I'm concerned about residents. So, okay, definitely all right. Thank you, daryl. Just a few things. First from the chat, the article you were talking about, Sally Mohar put it in the in the chat, so you can. Everyone can see that you can cut and paste that and the other question. The question I had was about testing and the results from testing. Do you have any figures of how that is? Hold it hold it hold it hold it. We have. We have a special speaker coming up very soon on that very topic. Okay, sorry, I jumped the gun, but yes, you jumped the gun, do not steal her thunda. Okay, do you have anything else for che, just also to address a question in the chat about restaurant procedure? What is your understanding of how a mask should be worn once someone enters a restaurant to the point of when they leave the patrons must where what must Donna face, covering whenever they're not eating, so once they enter the restaurant, they sit down, they get the menu they talk to the server. They should have the mask on. If they're consuming a beverage consume the beverage put on the mat and put back on the masks and if you're eating you know, you can take off your mask and do so and do such and such, but if you're done with your business, please put on your face covering and proceed as usual. Until the check is clear and then you use the establishment. Okay- and I understand you won't, I think that should be posted in more places. Yes, I understand you are allowed to chew, while wearing a mask. Yes, okay, good any other questions from committee members and all right, very good, all right. Thank you che. I tell Pauline we missed her, but you did a good job filling in. Thank you and I'll relay your concerns to pauline so that she can have it figure it out. Thank you all right, but please send me the report as well. Gladly. Okay, thank you! Jay Captain Freeman! Are you with us Okay Captain, Freeman, okay Sarah, you jumped up a spot Sarah Joseph Kirian the operational lead for testing at dft. How are you doing at the test and trace core Daryl she's she's on the agenda? At your specific request, hello, thank you, daryl for advocating for my presence on the agenda. So Sarah you have a report to give us about how the testing is proceeding in our in our area yep. I have some city- wide information and some information about testing in Washington Heights, specifically so, as mentioned Sarah Joseph Kurian, I'm the deputy lead for testing as part of the test and trace corps. I work at New, York, City, Health and hospitals and I've been in the city with the city for about five years now I manage so before. Testing trace was launched by the mayor as part of the surge in response to coved New York, City, Health and hospitals had opened 22 testing sites, including the Dieckmann testing site at the Dikeman Houses in Washington Heights, but you know 22 acrosss, our hospitals and gotham health clinics. As part of the test and trace initiative, we opened a whole lot more clinics, where the express purpose is Covid-19, pcr testing, so diagnostic testing for Covid-19. We have opened somewhere to the tune of 35 testing sites. We decommissioned some of them to return them to the DOE as part of the reopening of schools, so we were in nine school sites and two sites that we have returned to the DOE. So currently we have 24 pop- up testing sites that are open, acrosss the city, and we also have a fleet of 10 mobile units. The mobile units go to different locations every week, partner with NYCHA or community based organizations to offer testing and as part of the 24, the universe of 24 pop- up test sites. One of them is at the Highbridge Rec center in Washington. In terms of how are you I'm sorry, you consider hybridge to be a pop- up testing site? Yes, pop- up is a, I will say, there's been some lively debate about the term pop- up, but essentially anything where the building or the land is owned by a city agency and is ordinarily used for a different purpose. But we have borrowed it to be tenants to do testing that you consider a pop- up test site so because hybridge is owned by the Department of Parks and recreation and ordinary is a wreck site. We were in the pool and in the gym now we are just in the gym because of twins and rain, making the pool tents not quite tenable for ongoing testing. We have steady engagement in Highbridge. Obviously we're always looking for more ways to reach the community and have more people come in for testing. I also spoke with some of my colleagues in the tracing part of the world. I'm thinking about outreach in Washington Heights. If you've been national, Black Leadership commission on AIDS and Trans latinx network have both been doing flyering and in- person outreach in the neighborhood and there's been a variety of different virtual engagement as well, and then thinking about Washington Heights as a part of the city. Obviously some might consider right pretty disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. So when speaking with colleagues who are tracers, as you might know, our workflow is when somebody tests positive for Covid-19. We attempt to reach them and we also attempt to you know once we've spoken with that individual, we also attempt to reach their anybody who might be considered as being exposed and when we are not able to reach the individual or those who have been exposed or we think likely exposed. We also go something's wrong with the sound where you yeah you're breaking up yeah you're in and out. Well, maybe you can assume that everything I you did not hear was wonderful and super erudite. I'm going to check if I can do anything about the connection or even just speak. Is this better? If I'm speaking closer to the speaker yeah, I know the volume is not the issue, it's so you've, you're fading in and out, but go ahead and through resource navigation. We also connect people to programs, including get food. So I know there was a question earlier about mosques right so at Highbridge, for example, if somebody comes to the test site and does not have mass, we would give them a mask for the time. This is very different, obviously, from handing out moss for everyday use, we do want to make sure that people are protected when they're coming to a test site and there's also when we do our hyperlocal interventions and provide pve care packages. Muscles are part of that as well, but I definitely agree that better access to mass per community we're losing you again. My recommendation for you is to please turn off your video and just have the audio, and I think it will be slightly better. Is this better yeah? Let's see if that works? Okay, all right sounds good, so those are some of the top line pieces of information that I wanted to be sure to share. I'm happy to answer questions or, if there's any other information, that I could help cover or bring back okay. So is there also a testing site right now, with the Department of Health building at 168Th, Street and Broadway 600 West 168Th Street? Is it? Is that site still up and running? I'm sad that we lost our department of Health colleague before that question was asked. I can. I can double check, I'm not certain, but I'm happy to verify. Okay. So at the moment you have the 24 pop- up testing sites and 10 mobile units. That's right, and we know for sure that you have at least two sites in in our community in Washington Heights in Inwood and possibly a third just one at dickman, one at high bridge, and then I will cross check on the dohmh site. You mentioned okay, very good, okay, any other sally! You have a question yeah. I have a couple questions. There's been great concern at these sites in terms of both people arriving at the sites and not feeling safe, because social, distancing etc is not being enforced at the site, so they go in and it does not feel safe even to be there and be tested. The bigger concern is the lag between testing and reporting of results. I'm wondering to what extent y' all are tracking that and trying to address that, because the tests you know become useless with if the results are not there immediately and then I have another question about the contact tracing program. You know it was. I know it was a difficult roll out because y' all were brand new to it. I know that the health department tried to help you, but you were getting really low response rates and I understand that they're still really low response rates. What is response rate and what qualifies as a response yup so I'll try to take them in order. First, with safety, we do put out signage to maintain the six feet apart since right from folks. Obviously we do not wanna. We do not want anybody to not be feeling safe at our sites if we, if you do hear of concerns around safety at the high bridge or dikeman sites, I can't speak for the Department of Health site. I certainly would want to hear that and then I'll also make sure to loop back with the leadership of both of those locations crosstrack how we're doing and make sure that we are abiding guidelines. In terms of your question about the delay, a lot of our pop- up test sites were on Us lab. That is well known, named Quest, and there was, I think, an article in the New York Times and several other local state and nationwide media reporting the delays with Quest labs. Specifically, we have migrated all of our sites off as of as of a few weeks ago, so we are seeing a much better turnaround time more in the 48 to 72 hour window range. Obviously, you know we're doing everything we can to make sure that I'm sorry Sir you're seeing a much better, a much better. What turnaround time so getting the results so turn around time. We measure turnaround time based on when somebody got swabbed right when they had their test for Covid-19 and when they get their results, so we're seeing that time frame shrinking from Quest, obviously in the most egregious of cases, was in the multi- week time window- and I definitely agree with you- know the utility of that result being diminished by that delay with access. Yes, which is the new lab that we're on we're seeing those turnaround times be closer to 48 to 72 hours. We have committed to a three to five day turnaround time and we're much closer to meeting it. Definitely not the case with 100 of the time. There's human error every now and then but we're seeing those rates improve dramatically and then with tracing. I know aggregate acrosss, the city, the percentage has improved pretty dramatically what counts, as a tracing connection, is calling somebody and having them pick up the phone so being able to make contact with the person. We have made a really concerted effort to have more and more tracers from the neighborhoods in New York City right. If people are interested in being connected to tracing work in their community, we do everything we can to accommodate that and having folks speak a variety of languages and coming from a diversity of backgrounds. So, obviously, once that connection is made, we want to make sure also to sustain it and make sure that folks are getting the information they need the connection to resources they need, and importantly, also that we are getting that full universe of folks that they might have been in touch with. So we can also inform them of the possibility that they might have been exposed, but the first, the sort of first few tries, are to reach somebody by the phone and then the community engagement specialist, which is a team under the tracing initiative. If we're not able to reach somebody over the phone, we will try to then see them in person. Do we know what percentage of cases you're actually getting contacts, then? So you go beyond picking up the phone to actually getting information. I know that it is more than half the time, but I do not have a precise percentage if you get that percentage and specifically in our neighborhood, as you probably are aware, we're number four in the city in terms of percentage of essential workers, so we're very high risk communities. We would appreciate any data you can provide to us on how contact tracing is actually working in our specific Community board district. Absolutely, I will follow up on that and then you mentioned essential workers. I know there's a discussion earlier about teachers and staff, members of the DOE and Daycare workers are prioritized for both access to testing and their results at 22, health and hospital sites, including all 11 of our acute hospitals and 11 clinics, including, and they are also prioritized in terms of access to testing acrosss. All of the pop- ups so very committed to making sure that DOE staff Daycare staff, who are essential to the reopening of schools and other services. A number of the teachers I know, have gone outside the system, so maybe that needs to be better communicated. There are we have test sites as part of test and trace. We have a number of test sites that are within health and hospitals or operated by the city, and we also have partnerships with private labs that are also prioritizing teachers. We also have some of the do hmh labs, but but Sarah are you saying that all of the swabs are sent to private labs to be to be tested? We do not have any of our own labs either. You have a yeah, it's a good question. We have a variety of interventions so for the 24 pop- up sites and the 10 mobile units of that universe, 20, the 24 pop- up sites and six of our 10 mobile units. We do send the tests away to get processed the remaining 22 health and hospitals, acutes and gotham sites, and four of our mobile units use bioreference labs, which it does not. We do not send those away, but they're not owned by the city. I know there's intention to build up the city's own capacity to process tests and we've also been working on strengthening our capacity to produce the actual test kits and viral transport media that those test kids get. I tell you I mean this is anecdotal, but based on people's comments that I read on the Inwood social media sites, people seem to be very satisfied with the site on Diamond street. What is it 175, Nagel Avenue that there's no waiting time they get their results back within a few days. I think. Maybe in one case someone wrote that they got their result, maybe the next day, so the service at at the Dyckman Family Health center appears to be pretty good. That's great to hear I'll. Let our Gotham help leadership, know that I'll be thrilled to hear that yeah all right. A few questions, steve yeah go ahead, Daryl one! I was just wondering: what is your coordination with the other like the private sites like city, Md, and so there's? There's that's a good question. There's a number of private sites, so private, including city Md right, but also the qualified health centers like Demian, Morris Heights and a number of others. We partner with a fair number of organizations to build out our overall city- wide testing capacity and we've been with some of the partners. We provide access to PPE right, especially when there's been shortages with the health centers and with city Md. The nature of these partnerships differs in general. We have tried to hold the line on with all of our partners that if somebody is uninsured, we do not charge them for the test. In addition to, if somebody's insured there's no cost to the patient, we bill insurance. We do not build a patient, a copay, and we also wanted to make sure that our testing for uninsured folks was, you know, not hindered. So if you see on our Covid-19 test trace website, there are a number of partners that are marked with access for uninsured folks is, is at no cost so there's you know a little bit of a difference there, but that's you know we partner with PPE. We try to share standards of how we want, but if someone test positive at one of those sites, you all follow up with that person or yeah. If somebody tests positive in New York City, those positive test results are reported to the state as part of infection, Control Protocol, so the lab, in addition to reporting it to the provider and the patient reports it to the state and we get the data from the state. So we get data on folks who test positive, acrosss, the city, no matter where they were tested and also. My other question was just so I'm clear on how this works you're only reaching out to folks who test positive for the current currently having cover 19., unlike say someone who's negative for it, but has the antibodies for the first time. That's right. We prioritize for tracing and folks who have tested positive and then once we speak to that person or people, and they let us know who else they've been in contact with. We would also prioritize all of those folks and to make sure that they are able to access testing. Thank you. Okay. Any other questions I'm just following off on something I read recently one second Sally hold on. Do we any other committee members with questions? Oh okay, go ahead sally! You know, there's been a number of articles that I've read lately about the viral load with the test. So how many runs you have to do of the test to actually show a positive result, and I think this people are using 30 or 35 and the recommendation is that's lower. Do we find fewer positives are y' all looking at what the load is and can that be reported? I'm definitely a few steps outside of my area of expertise, I'm happy to follow up with clinicians who work with us. Your question is specifically around viral load and whether that's something like how positive is it positive? What does a positive mean? So if you only ran and cycled it, I think like 25 times versus 30, you might show a positive, but at 25 you showed a negative, and so it gave some indication of how severe the infection is. I think I'm happy to follow up with tonight to work with us great thanks. All right all right is there anything any other questions for Sarah right, very good would appreciate if you could get back to us about the site at 168Th Street. Absolutely. I think my follow- ups are the site at 168Th Street. If there's any narrowing down of percentages of contacts being made in Washington Heights and also the viral load question so I'll make sure to yeah any specific data you have about Washington heights in Inwood. Our four zip codes would be useful to us I'll do my best. Thank you so much for having me, okay and please convey my thanks to Dr long for making the for finding you and getting you to to will come to us will do I'll. Definitely pass that on. Thank you so much. Thank you all right. Thank you. All right! Captain freeman have are you with us now Captain Freeman from Ems Okay, Ross, Frohmer, Hey Steve? How are you? How are you doing very good? Thank you. So I got a lot of little stuff to go over. That's, but there's nothing major! All that I see Julio's on so he may follow up with some of the the nyp stuff, but I can not remember if I mentioned this in July, but and Neil rustage has taken over as a new interim dean at Columbia Dean Goldman, having stepped down as of July 1st Dr[ _ _] had been the director of our cancer center he's a gastroenterologist by training cancer researcher. He is now our interim dean a couple of things we're working on. Oh, please, okay, you know in terms of the campus and what's going on at the medical center, we are still you know, largely virtual, but more and more people are coming back. Our clinics are seeing patients, the labs are operating all on reduced density, always social distancing and a strict mask policy, and all this strict Covid-19 protocols in terms of some of the community outreach. This year, the medical Center Neighborhood fund has been focused completely on food relief in northern Manhattan. We've been working with our colleagues at morningside and have made several large donations of pantries food pantries throughout northern Manhattan, we'll be doing some more over the next month. Next week is the rally for medical research. Normally we send a contingent down to Dc to lobby Congress in support of the Nih and biomedical research. This year it is virtual, we'll be conducting a series of virtual meetings with members and staff, along with colleagues from around the country trying to drive up to support the budget for the Nih over the next three weeks will be there'll, be a concerted effort on campus by our students, faculty staff in terms of voter registration and filling out the census, posters, Outreach, etc. We participated in the summer bridge program. Normally we have a large role in the New York City Summer Youth employment program. That did not happen. This year we had about 20 youth, who worked with faculty and staff at the medical center on virtual projects through the summer youth program, and then just a heads up on two events on October 4th is our virtual velocity ride each year you know, for the last three years we've been holding a cancer fundraising bike ride, starting in upstate, New, York or Rockland county. Excuse me and New Jersey finishing on the medical center campus to raise money for cancer research. This year's event is a virtual event. It's called velocity day and whatever way people want to participate in order to raise money for cancer research they can. This year there is no entry fee and no fundraising minimums. So, if anybody's interested in participating, you can either contact me or go to this Velocityride.Org and it's very easy to sign up and finally and or two other things mentioned next week, we will be hosting a symposium on physician mental health issues on mental health for providers. This this event is named in memory of Dr Lorna breen, who you may remember, is our emergency room physician who took her own life back in April. I should note that Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Congressman Max rose of Staten island have introduced legislation which they've named in honor of Dr Breen, to address the issue of mental health among health care providers and then the final item is not a hundred percent definite, but I think it's going to happen on October 14th. We will be doing our for every four years: Cuimc election forum. We will have healthcare experts, discuss health issues in the upcoming elections policy and politics. Again, we've always invited the community this year it will be virtual and I will be sending out more information about that encourages many people to come join us for that. That's going to be on the 14th from five to seven. That is a tentative date in time. At this point and happy to answer any questions that folks have yeah. I got a couple of questions ross first, but first tell me again: the name of the New Dean Anil rustigy, it is spelled R-, U-, S-, T G-, I first name: anil a-, n-, I-, L, n-, e-, I-, l, n-, n-, I-, o a-, n-, I-, o and oh, and the last name is R- U- S- T- g-, I yeah. Although it's pronounced as though there's an extra little syllable in there rust again. Okay, all right. Well, hopefully, one day we'll get to meet him. Now there was a plan I think to have all of the students or a fair portion of the students. Come back to campus, but was not there, then a change made or decision that they should remain doing remote online learning. This is primarily with the undergraduates down in the morningside campus. We had hoped to bring a percentage of our students back to campus for this year. The decision was made in August to not do that for undergraduates. So there is all undergraduate learning with. Perhaps some very minor exceptions is is now by remote. There are a small number of undergraduates on campus either because they're from out of the country, they can't go home for whatever reason they need housing or they have jobs on campus or they're. Frankly, they're living in the in the community, our graduate students and that's both warning and of the medical center are having classes, they vary. Some are remote, some are in person, some are hybrid and that varies from program to program and class to class, but our graduate students are in person, so the school of nursing, the School of Public health, peer physicians and surgeons, the schools that are based uptown at the medical center are some of those students are doing in classes and some are doing remote. Yeah now, generally rule the larger lecture classes, I've been replaced are being held remotely, some of the obviously our clinical experiences have to be in person right and then, but I think you may have seen some smaller discussion groups again socially distance with mass taking place in person, but it's a it's definitely. You know hybrid at this point, but you know we rotations chronic rotations have to be done in person. Do you want to say something about? Oh, I see that Captain freeman has now joined us. Do you want to say? Do you want to say something about the decision to change the name of Bard Hall? Oh yeah? I should thank you. Thank you for bringing that up. Samuel Bard was one of the founders of physicians. Of the college of physicians and surgeons, he was a slave holder, Bard Hall is named or was named after him and after a review, the university has decided to remove his name from Bard Hall. That building will no longer be known as Bart Hall. We do not know the name of the new building yet, but it will be if it is now no longer about how bold harold is primarily a residence hall for students and the university felt that it was particularly inappropriate for students to live in a facility who was named after someone who enslaved their own slaves. So this is, I do not know, is it 60 haven Avenue? So it's only even 60. No, I think it's 40, but it's on Haven Avenue. I do not know the exact address of it. Always to me it's just Bart Hall, but it's it's. The building be right. Next to the large towers. In fact, you can access the large towers through Bard Hall right. It's a building, that's been there since the 1930s. It was our one of original dorms yeah, but yeah. It's is it's just north of the the Cold Institute yeah right, yeah, all right, any any other questions for ross. I just had a comment. Okay, if I could I- and I know Ross knows this, but just if other people do not, you know there is an effort to do a streets co- naming for 168Th Street between Broadway and Fort Washington Healthcare heroes, way for the folks there at Columbia, as well as New, York, presbyterian, so yeah and Daryl. I think I thank you privately. I can just say that public, thanks to you and all who are working on this effort, obviously I'm biased, but I think this is very well deserved. Our folks were very much on the front line and to to receive this type of recognition. Appreciation, I think, will be will matter. A lot to our folks will be very well received and we're very appreciated by them. Thank you and that you're doing this I just want to say that that'll be brought up at the transportation committee traffic and Transportation committee meeting next month in October. The one thing I will say I do not know have you heard: is anybody else doing this elsewhere in the city? You know near cyanide near Nyu, I kind of heard something like, but I do not recall where that was right again. Thank you. Daryl yeah Daryl deserves a great deal of credit for coming up with this idea. Any other questions for Ross Jay. Do you have a question? No. Okay, all right, very good! All right! All right! Thank you, Ross, but let me just go back for a moment right now. The name is still on Bard Hall. Is that correct? I will be honest with you Steve, I'm not on campus on a daily basis, so I do not know I was there Tuesday, but did not notice it. I will check I'm going to be on campus tomorrow. I know that there will be an effort to remove it. I know that it's not as simple as just removing a sign. It's actually. I think I think the name is chiseled into the building yeah so, but it is definitely our intent yeah I mean we is no longer called Bard Wall and we will be removing you know any naming signs of it. Just some of it is a you know: construction project. Yeah, I mean I think there are other things that have been named after board as well. I do not know if they're in Colombia, but there's a car is a bard college named for the same guy. I do not know that I do not know yeah. Okay, Steve. I have a small comment about that. Actually it was not the university itself that came up with the idea to remove the name. It was a cardiologist at the university at the medical hospital. I should say that came up with a petition, and this is how this is why the name will be removed. That is correct about, for this is this. Is it was brought to us by one of our faculty members and then the university acted upon it all right, very good, all right! Well, we'll you'll keep watching sorry Steve, there's one more question: there's one more question from the chat: oh, that was that was basically just how often are Columbia Irving grad students tested for Covid-19 good question. I do not know the answer to it. I know we're all subject to what we call a gateway test I.E. You can't come back until you have it and then we're all subject to random testing, but I do not know the frequency. Okay, all right. Thank you ross. All right, okay, Captain Freeman! I hope you can hear me now. Can you yes Yay? Well, I have to apologize. I have been here for the whole meeting, but I'm sort of like I guess I was a lurker until I figured it out. I was on my phone and I was on my laptop and I finally got through on the department's computer. So all right well by somehow you made it as well as long as you made it before. The meeting is over. So you know so. You know captain, as I told you before, we're very interested in knowing how our our Ems unit has been able to survive through this whole pandemic and how you've been able to handle it and and where you are now and how the response times have been, because, basically, ever since the the base station moved up to Washington heights, the response times have been declining and during this pandemic, I'm sure you, you suffered some setbacks, but maybe now you can tell us where things are yeah and thanks for asking we we did better than expected. So just just a quick history, we opened the station late in December of 2012, with five emt ambulances and one medic ambulance, so that was six ambulances. They added one more medic ambulance in January of this year and then they added another medic ambulance and one more emt ambulance in May 3Rd. So the facility was built for six ambulances and we have nine now. So what presently we're 150 capacity? So we've got people everywhere. If you drive down Amsterdam, I apologize. The city charter says that for every line ambulance that we have- and we have nine we're supposed to have a spare- so that's 18 ambulances that we're supposed to park somewhere and if I've got a couple broken down, I might have as much as 20:21 ambulances here right now, I've got about 12.. When we started we had 67 employees. Now I think it's either 95 or 96 employees about Covid-19. You know New York, being the first infected and getting into this stuff early. You know we were as overwhelmed as the hospitals and the nursing homes were we sort of had to go by the seat of our pants and we learned how to treat these patients. You know as we went along, so our protocols restrict us from positioning patients on stretchers for transport on their on their stomachs, and it turned out that with some of these patients, that was exactly the right way to do it. But it's you know it's. You learn as you go cpap. You know positive airway pressure good for some people with with a bad case of the virus, really bad for some people with a bad case of the virus. So just like nationwide, as we've learned and our techniques have gotten better and we've gotten more equipment. You know we still have severe cases, but it's not as bad as it as it was in the beginning, this nightmare that was here in New, York City about section 13. I had not a 90. I think I have 96 employees of my 96 employees. 34 of my employees got sick, that's not tested positive. That's actually got sick and missed work. The average was about 10 and a half days for each of them, that's 37 percent of our workforce, so it was pretty hairy because of cobin 19. We had 348 tours 350,348 times when somebody's supposed to be sitting in a truck when they're not there, because they're home sick and the way it works is. If I worked. If I worked an eight- hour tour on an ambulance and my relief did not show up, then I'm required to work another eight hours. So many of our guys worked 16 hour tours back to back. You know you work 16 hours and either you drive home and go to sleep and drive back for the next eight hour tour or we had people sleeping in their cars and sleeping on cots here at the station. It was pretty crazy. Some of our guys work to work five 16 hour days in a row. You know two weeks in a row, so five 16 hour days, you go home for two days. You work five 16 hour days again, all the people that were sick have have come back, except for one. We have a couple of guys: who've been working for a couple of weeks, but you can still tell they're short of breath and they get tired and they have cardiac problems. These are young guys with no health problems before we still have one guy out today's his 51st day out sick. Sadly, with the department two Emts committed suicide, they were not from our station, they were not from Manhattan, but it was kind of a depressing time we, our chaplain, has just been great. We also have a we have a peer group. We have a thing called csu, which is a counseling service with the psychiatrists and stuff, and so you know I'm just I'm so proud of our guys, because everybody came to work, nobody complained, you know we at one point at that point. You know none of our none of us. Nobody in the Ems ever took the took the job to make a lot of money, and I think our guys knew how bad the community needed them. You know. So we just came to work at one point. I had 10 supervisors in February. I've got nine now, but I had since there's 10 supervisors in February. You know at one point I think in late March, early April, all of them, but one and me were out sick, so supervisors were just nuts too. We had not had any Covid-19 cases in a couple of months. They told me today that they they've transported three covets today from our state this week from from our station, I crunched some numbers. The first thing I did was: I first have to tell you that these are. These. Are just fire department 911 calls? I do not really have access to citywide to all the hospitals in voluntary units, so there's department numbers and it's raw data. So it's not it's close, but it's not. You know to the to the to the you know: it's not perfect and I compared months to month from 2019 free coping to month to month during 2020, and even though the you know, the I think the first really reported case was was confirmed in first of March or the end of February. In January, the numbers from 2019 to 2020 were up 103 in February they're up 128 percent and in March they were up 129 percent, so you can see it was climbing. In April it went to 118 percent in May went to 108 in June. It went to 110.. These are. These are calls from our station in July it was still up 108 and in August it was up. 106, steve. I've sent you all this stuff. As you know, all the actual numbers and stuff, but just to in August 2019 we had 2,343 ambulance calls here, station 13 and 20,000 2020. We had two thousand four hundred and eighty two, so it's a six percent over normal. So then I went to citywide the fire department. Ambulance calls and compared them month to month, and it's different markedly different January of last year compared to January this year calls were up 107 percent. It was the same thing in February 107 in March. It jumped up to 116 percent, but then in April all the way down it dropped. So in April it was 86 percent of what it was in 2019 and May was 64 in June it was 77. July was 81 and August, it's 84., so it's climbing back up to normal, and I just I have to assume just presumably it's because in you know, Washington Heights and wood and Elmhurst were hot spots. We had many more calls than the rest of the city that were covered related and that you know, starting in April. The rest of the city did not want to go to the hospital because they did not want to. You know, get the disease ambulance calls in the fire department. Typically, they grow by about 100,000 a year. It dropped it dropped in 2019 by I do not know, 10,000 calls or something- and this year I extrapolated the numbers from August. It looks like this year. It's also going to drop by about well 2019. We had 1 million 818,565 calls in 2020. So far it's been a million. Ninety thousand so looks like it's going to be about a million four or maybe a million five. So that's also a drop, and I also think that's probably because of the people not going to the hospital because of Kobe. I do not know at some point. It seemed as though all you could hear were sirens from ambulances going through our streets. It was amazing. The sounds of ambulances were so common going back a few months. I would have expected the percentages to be even higher. Well, you know we had. We had a lot fewer calls that, were you know, somebody that has a sprained ankle or a toothache, or you know that kind of thing. So wow those ambulance calls, are, you know they only use lights and sirens when it's when it's a priority, one two or three call a life- threatening call. You know somebody's got a cut on their arm. Okay, big deal, they do not go lights and sirens, but if it's a cut in their arm, that's a weed, they can't control. You know or something like that. Then it's lights and sirens so yeah, all those lights and siren calls were life- threatening calls. So they were Covid-19 cases. You know yeah mostly code cases and heart attack cases which were who knows what percentage of the ones that were called heart attacks in the beginning were actually Covid-19. You know, code related. Are you seeing an increase in calls for overdoses, calls for what man, overdoses, opioid, abuse overdoses? I wonder how those have changed in the midst of this changed a lot we had you know in the beginning. We could not figure it out because you know we get Og calls all the time right and it flowed way down and after about two weeks of it being slow on those calls. We figured out well, the reasoning is that they can't get the drugs up here in New York, so they do not have the drugs to do the overdoses. The overdose cases are back up to normal. You know our our drug toxicity, alcohol, toxicity cause calls are back to normal and I think slowly, the other you know regular calls are going to get back to normal too. I mean that's the way. The numbers look at least so you guys are facing the same risk to personnel cuts that the rest of the city is. Although your usage is much higher than the rest of the city, so are you concerned like looking forward what it could mean when acrosss the board staffing cuts come through? You know it's always easter famine with a with a fire department Ems, because we have so many people that want to go to fire suppression. So we can have a whole bunch of people and then you know the fire suppression calls and takes 300 people, so we're sort of used to that. I I'm going to be subjective here rather than objective, but I'll give you my opinion on it. I think that it's mostly, I think it's Bluff. I do not think it's really going to happen. Good things to try to get. You know to try to get more money for the city from the state from the federal government, but you know I do not want to get political, but I would be amazed if they cut Ems, which you know Koch said, was not an essential service. It's a you, know pd and fire suppression and sanitation. There's not that many of us. You know. I think that I think the fire department, employees and it's less than 4,000 people. You know- and that's counting. You know secretaries and bosses, not just people in the ambulances- and I do not know exactly what it is right now, but I know that four years ago I think there were maybe 750 ambulances totaled in the city. I do not know, I guess it just seems kind of stupid to me if they're going to cut them, but you know they're going to do whatever they're going to do right. We also just one question not to you: do not have to address it now, but if you could think about it and get back to Steve in the committee we're doing our expense and capital priorities, and you mentioned that you that you needed to have more capacity which obviously you do not have, but if you could think about what your capital equipment needs are what your personnel needs are so that we can reflect them in our budget priorities. That would be very helpful. I think that's probably above my pay grade, but I'll talk to my chiefs about it and we'll get something back to you know yeah that would that would be helpful. Physical plant is the physical plant. You know I mean I love the trailers that we have here and I'm completely happy and everybody is with them too. Eventually they will build a reel yeah. You need a real building. I do not know how you can fit. 96 employees into that space that you have that's well they're, mostly out in the field of course, but but the last time I I got a two- minute tour there there's hardly any locker rooms or anything I mean God. It's a you know pretty small area yeah we do not. We do not have lot enough lockers for everybody. So you know we have people doubling up on lockers, not a lot, but some you know we're happy. We adapt everything's good! You know, do not worry about us, we're doing just fine. Well, as long as people are, I do not know how they survive doing five days of 16 hour tours. That's incredible! They did well. That's not. You know, certainly that's not everybody, but I know that everybody had to do at least one or two more double tours a week there for a good couple of months. Wow all right. I just have a question yeah again and then I'll call upon Jay yeah. No, I mean you know- and I think sally touched on this and you really answered as best you could but there's a question in the chat. You know as well about personnel cuts, and hopefully that does not come to pass. You know as it relates to Emt's intent fire, but the other question someone had was how you, basically, you know, treat someone who is undocumented, as it relates to the services that you all provide. We treat them like anybody else. You know the golden rule here is that you got to read every patient like your family, so if they're undocumented, they want to give us their name, they give us their name if they're undocumented, they do not want to tell us where they live or anything yeah. You know we take them anyway. So does that sort of answer the question or am I off track? I mean maybe they could say in the chat if that answers the question, but I think it does listen. I mean Ems is not. Ems is just checking on your health status, they're, not checking on your citizenship status, yeah. We all believe Brad. Okay, Jay, you had a question yeah. Yes, I was wondering the 96 workers. You have what specific job titles do. They have is turnover still a problem either because of low pay or people going on to the fire department. And how are you dealing with those questions? Also how many people are assigned to each shift and what are those hours? Okay? So we have. We have staggered hours so that when it's shift change, you know it's not like at a factory where everybody goes home at 3 o'clock and the new people come in. So we have units that go out at 6:30 in the morning at seven o'clock in the morning at eight o'clock at nine o'clock at 7:30 and then units that go out for the evening shift at you know: 6:30 7 o'clock, like that 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, the majority of the people here are Emts. I'd, say more than three. Probably three quarters of them are ent emts, the rest are paramedics and then all my officers are paramedics, but I have I have nine officers plus myself that are here that you see the you see the ambulances. Then you see those red trucks that drive around those are our patrol supervisors. Those are those are lieutenants or me in the truck as far as overturned. You know, that's been a recurring problem since helping hospitals went to the fire department back in the 90s. It's just it's something that happens, and you know they open up hiring it's getting better now, because it used to be easier to step up from being on the medical side to go to the fire suppression side than it is now. It's open. Competitiveness is the way to go, so that's going to fix itself yeah the pace that pays low but, like I said people do it anyway, you know, and I, whenever I talk to people most of them say well, I thought this would be a fun job. I'd, do it for a year too, and then do something else, and then you know you turn around and you've been here for 20 years. You know all right, a fun job. God it's got to be. It's got to be. I always think it's going to be one of the most stressful jobs, any other questions daryl. What does this mean? I have a hand with a number two. Next to it is there someone else raising their hand yeah it looks like two people, one was Jay, so yeah, I'm trying to unraise my heart. Okay and the other is for me he's. Can we? Is he a panelist kid fabricio? Can you speak? Do you hear me Steve, yeah Fabricio is the director of community affairs for the fire department yeah so good evening, and thank you for presenting this evening. Just one thing to add on, I think, and the captain highlighted it well, I mean I think, right now we're going staffing and doom and gloom with the budget and the talks of potential layoffs. I think right now there's a lot of uncertainty and I do not think right now what what's been being portrayed on the news, ultimately in the media outlets. I do not think we have at this point a concrete idea. I mean the one thing that I can say that the department does have even with the budget. Reductions that have been planned are intact numbers for Ems training and there is an outlook or a positive outlook of remaining or maintaining some level of Ems training, meaning that we are as a department going to look out and provide emts into the workforce within the coming years. Again, you know, with you know, any type of layoffs, and whenever that is determined you know there is going to be some level of impact to service, but I think at this point it's too early to determine what that number would look like if it's going to happen and exactly what that would incur in terms of overall operations. So I just wanted to add that piece to what the captain had mentioned Steve. I know that you had a couple questions regarding fireworks. I do not know if you wanted me to get into that. I'm sorry a couple of questions on what on fireworks over the past summer. Well, actually I, let's finish first with Ems and and yeah. Yes, I do want to talk about fireworks, but yeah captain did you. Did you have anything else to report? Only I think you said. Did you send me some statistics yeah, the stuff that I was rattling off to you? I have all that on grass that I just sent you as an email. While I was trying to get to talk to you, oh okay, great okay, all right, so I can incorporate that into the minutes. Okay, other and- and are there any other questions for the for the captain? Well, I tell you captain I just want to, as I think, I'm speaking on behalf of the entire community board, to express the appreciation for the devotion and the work that was done by Ems during this entire crisis, but the work that you do overall, but especially the work that that you did during the have that you've been doing during this pandemic. It's just been amazing and whenever any discussion comes up about essential employees or frontline employees, you guys are absolutely on the front line you're on the you're on you're on the first of the front lines. Well, my answer to that is: oh shucks, all right! Well I'll put that in the minutes, all right. So if we're finished now with Ems, which and then captain I do want you to come back from time to time and give us updates, so I do appreciate you being able to give us some time tonight. Fabricio. The fireworks issue is really you know. Maybe it's played the entire city, but it's also been plaguing our community going back to maybe the end of May early June. We were just besieged with fireworks every single night, unrelenting till you know I do not know four or five in the morning sometimes could not people could not sleep? It was. It was just all over the place from one end of Washington Heights to the inn to to the tip of the island, including inward. So I what I'm interested in is you know, and I want to do a resolution you know in this committee and in our public safety committee, urging the city to take stronger action next year to prevent a recurrence of what we went through this year. But what I want to know is, I know of at least two instances where there were where these fireworks set off fires and, in one case on Nagel Avenue, a family was burned out in another and actually on the very same day until the early hours of July 5th. You know right after the midnight of July 4th, they were burned out on Bagel, Avenue and and an apartment on 157Th street fireworks was set off on the roof. The roof set on fire. The sixth floor apartment also ended up in flames. For you know, they did not suffer, maybe as grievously as the people on Nagel Avenue, but they could not. They could not get in back into their apartment, I believe for at least 10 days or so, and then we have at least one case where a daughter reports that her mother suffered an anxiety attack, then a heart attack and then died all because of these fireworks and people think they're having fun. This is not fun. This is a. This is a really serious issue. So what I would like to get from the fire department is how many other instances have might have occurred during this period in our in our community, where fireworks created fires, where, where people did, who did not give a damn where they launched these fireworks, if it ended up in somebody's apartment or somewhere else, did it cause fires that your guys then had to put out so Steve? Just to answer your question, I mean again in speaking with our Bureau of Fire investigation. You know again they investigate and the only fires that we investigate is based on the severity and also in terms of any fire injury, ultimately in terms of the ones that did get noted, I'm losing you, hello that were referred by the Bureau Fire investigation, the only one up on our record. You hear me now, no yeah, not quite hello, hear me now Steve now, yeah go ahead. You hear me now. Yes, okay, you hear me now, yes, okay, came within ours was the 184 Nagel Avenue that occurred on July 5th in the early morning, where it was on the first floor apartment where, ultimately, there were two minor. There were two minor patients reported both non- life- threatening, but the cause was because of the use of fireworks. However, the department in working with the sheriff's office, due to the mayoral task force due to the severity of fireworks over this past summer, which spanned from early June all the way up to July 4th and a little bit beyond that, basically established a group to target seizures or to target the distribution ultimately to seize firework, large- scale, fireworks distributors, ultimately, beyond that, the department did take proactive measures in terms of developing public service announcements in various languages and public outreach, utilizing firefighters to table with insect communities based off three one data that rated certain communities as having the highest rankings of fireworks complaints. We send firefighters into that community into those communities to table, to distribute the dangers of fireworks and the illegal use of fireworks, and it's something that we saw somewhat help as a preventive measure. But again I think it's more along the lines of enforcement of really having to deal with the measures of tackling those that do use fireworks. The fire department in the coming years will continue to do tabling right around or prior to the fourth of July weekend, where we do see typically a spike in fireworks, but specifically in the zip codes of town of Inward, Washington Heights, the only ones that we can say that were caused officially by fireworks within our records granted, there might have been smaller incidents that may have not been reported out and investigated due to cause, but the only one that we had was on the 184 Nagel Avenue, which was on July 5th. You do not. You do not have a record of the one at. I think it was 551 west 157th street. I could not look at it, but from what I got from our assistant chief of fire of fire investigation. The only one within the zip codes he provided was 184 Nato Avenue. Well, let me tell you that one was bad enough, because that, as from what I understand that entire apartment got burned out, there were also fires in parks. We had fires in Inwood Hill park that were caused by fireworks Steve. I have my hand up if in case, you do not notice. Thank you, yeah. Okay, all right well go ahead. Go ahead! Tony yeah! I just had a question for you. I wanted to just ask: why do you think this was so much more extensive this year? What was the cause, and do you anticipate this being the same case next summer and what is it that? What is there any? What is you know? I know you talked about your plan, which is you know, trying to stop distributors, but is there anything that can be done because this stuff can find its way into this community all the time? And so what can be done even once that those illegal fireworks get into the communities anything that can be done, but first I just want to know like. Why was this so horrible like this year and what can we expect next year because some people are saying they're going to move? You know or people were saying well I had to. I know I could not live here. I had to escape to somebody's house because I could not sleep and that you know- and so I just wanted to know like if you could just answer that- I'm sorry I do not mean to throw so many questions at you, but yeah just yeah. If you could, let me know that would be great fabricio yeah fabricio. Are you still with us? No yeah? No, honestly, those are great questions. I do not know if I would yeah. Do you hear me? Yes, do you hear me Steve yeah? I can hear you now yeah hey. I apologize I'm on Fort Taunton campus in Queens and I have a poor service. But what I was going to say is that you know those are all great questions. I mean honestly from a subjective standpoint and you know again. This is my opinion as well. You know I generally this year, I think, was a bit different from previous years, just because of everything going on with the quarantine and Covid-19 ultimately hindering outdoor public events and possibly the distribution of fireworks in other states and acrosss the states. I would say on that you did see a mass distribution ultimately on an illegal sense, acrosss neighborhoods acrosss, the U.S. Typically, you do see a spike in fireworks use and legal fireworks use as you draw closer to the fourth of July annually, but I think this year, just with cobia 19 and the quarantine and a lot of restrictions in overall distribution or access to hold on I'm sorry hold on a second sorry, apologies, the you know, I think, beyond just what was going on with Covid-19 and the quarantine that could have exasperated a lot of the issues as well. You know again in terms of how to prevent it in the following years. I think it's all about the work of combined task forces in terms of enforcement similar to what was done this year with NYPD the sheriff's office and the fire department, ultimately working collaboratively to tackle the distribution levels. I think on enforcement and looking on a more local level, working with local fire units and NYPD pres precincts to respond or monitor quickly, more to incidents or reports of fireworks with certain communities, and I think it's all about public education as well, and working with community stakeholders like the Community, Board and other tenant organizations of really educating in advance of these periods, where we do typically see a spike in firework use and just basically educating communities to the to the dangers of fireworks and what can occur and clearly, we've had set examples. You know, as mentioned with the fire and wanting for Nagel, where property has been lost and people injured and to several other instances that were mentioned earlier on the call. You know that, there's a clear danger when people do use fireworks in an illegal fashion. Do you know anybody once I told you do you know if anyone was arrested as a result of that fire at 184 Nagel? I do not know if anyone was arrested. I can look into that with our bureau fire investigation and follow back with you, Steve and I'll actually look into I'll look into the other incident. But again when I spoke with them this morning, investigate our Bureau fire. Investigation only said that the only one reported that there was an investigative report on was 1849. yeah, but I okay, I think I'd like to know whether anyone got arrested. I'm sorry, I can follow up on that. Okay did I Tonya? Did I cut you off? No, it's okay yeah! I just was a follow- up. I one of the things that happened is that at first people were saying we were told to call 3- 9- 1- 1 when we saw illegal firework activity and then they cut that off. I guess because they got so many, and I do not know if you're aware, but in our community we had on like 5,000 fire, illegal firework complaints or something like that. It was very high. It was higher than all of the other communities in all of Manhattan up here right and so obviously there's something specific going on up here. That was kind of even more problematic because to have numbers that high. But we were that switched on us, so we were first calling they were told to call when you would go to 3- 1- 1, it would say, call 9-, 1- 1 for illegal firework activity. Then they cut that off. So it seemed like in the middle of this crisis, we were sort of left spinning, because the avenues that were set up for us to do this were sort of cut off right, and so we just sort of suffered in silence or it tried to escape. So I you know, I just want to know what is it that you would want that? You know our goal? What avenues, what resources are you all going to have for the community to use to address this in the future, because I you know, I just see this happening again and I do not want to be in the middle of a crisis and not have anywhere to turn like we were in the middle of this one this year. So those are all good questions again. I think it's all about the preventive measures beyond just enforcement. I think it's a combination of both on the enforcement- and I can tell you that, with the examples done this past or with the issues that occurred this past summer, interagency and interagency collaborative work will continue into the following years, and fdny will continue to work with NYPD and the sheriff's office per the direction of the mayor. You know in terms of prevention and working on the education front. I think it's just working collaboratively, knowing that the spike usually does occur in the month, leading up to the fourth of July, and around that time I would say proactively, working with again the community board or community based organizations and getting out and doing education, ultimately to showcase the dangers now in terms of other ways of basically reporting or using an enforcement tool. I would stand correctly with just saying that 9- 1- 1 is the is the only number you know. The fire department does have an fdny fireworks enforcement union unit which anyone can call and report illegal use of fireworks to and it will be inspected and investigated, and that number is 718-, 722-, 3600, again 718-, 722- 3600 and that's basically to report the illegal use or report of fireworks within a community, and our bureau of Fire investigation will look into it again. You know this year was a bit challenging just because of the overwhelming nature in certain communities, as uptown Manhattan did suffer with a spike in those incidents. You know we did see other spikes in other communities as well. I know in central Brooklyn it was a it was. It was another. It was another community in the Bedstein Crown Heights region, where I think it was either the second highest in the city that we were getting reports of fireworks complaints. So again, just to reiterate everything I think it's all about early education and again having and continuing to work with law enforcement and fire and fire protection services ultimately to tackle this in advance. But you know rest assured that we are going to be working within the coming years and year, given this circumstance that we just experienced of really tackling this issue, because it's not only the distribution and tackling those that distribute, but at the end, but it's also about educating the community of how to basically report and teaching the danger so that you know this message is loud and clear. Yeah. I have a question I mean one. Second, one I think there are there are three hands up. Is that oh shoot? I think Jays is still up unless that's new, I thought I saw Natalie Espino. She withdrew. She took her hand down okay, but my question was so you go out. Do you go out into schools and talk about your work in general, right, yeah, so fire safety education is not only fireworks, it encompasses all levels of residential fire safety and yeah. We do go to school, that's equal! I just I just want to make sure fireworks was part of that was that was yeah, so fireworks so fireworks. If you look at and we have brochures in different languages as well yeah but fireworks yeah, I mean we do cover fireworks within our fire safety plans and fire safety. Lessons as well. Okay, all right, Jay Mazur is back Jay. Do you have a question? Yes, I think the main cause of the end of the fireworks epidemic was that the legal manufacturers and the legal distributor sold out the merchandise, rather than have any efforts in either public education or enforcement, and I rather suspect if the supply was still available. We'd still have the problem in September, okay, well yeah, I think I mean maybe Fabrizio would agree. I think there may have been an issue or a contributing factor in the fact that maybe there was an an abundant supply of fireworks because a lot of regular fireworks events were not taking place. So maybe the is it correct to say that the the fireworks wholesalers had a supply they had to get rid of. I mean, is there any credence to that? I mean that. Could again, I think it's a with the quarantine and everything that Covid-19 impacted on overall business and distribution of materials. Again I think when you talked about the illegal distribution, because again, the use of fireworks varies from state to state so again how things are distributed things, how our soul is going to affect differently, acrosss the board, and I think just because a potential surplus just be due to the quarantine and everything like that could have. You know caused it, but you know again, I'm not going to just speculate on that. I think, just as a whole, it's an issue of distribution that occurs from you know from year to year and again the spike usually is seen right around the July fourth time and leading up to it. So does Richard Allman have a question he's he his hand is raised. Is it possible for Richard to ask a question he's not a chanel? Can you make him a panelist? How does Richard Allman get to ask a question? He can also type it in if we can't promote him, hello, Richard go ahead. First, just a very brief comment: what Steve just had to say about the fireworks supply and its impact is the one thing I've heard most consistently about fireworks problems this year, and at least I take that very seriously. My question would be to Mr Carroll, having just mentioned the fireworks enforcement unit, the department's fireworks enforcement unit. How can we engage with them in the planning process and everything that happens from now till this time next year, I'd like to see us have more options than just. We can make a phone call some June night when things get bad, and I guess the second part to that question is in doing that. How could that also be coordinated with similar units in the police department and perhaps other departments? Well I mean I can't speak in regards to NYPD, but with fdny I could say you know that's a simple conversation in terms of just planning and preparing for the year to come in terms of connecting with that specific task force of the unit in advance. I'd be more than happy if coordinating it, but I would also, from a departmental standpoint, also bring in the outreach and public education units just because I think beyond understanding the task force and the enforcement aspect from the department standpoint. You know I think we have to think of it from a holistic approach of not only enforcement but education as well so trying to combat this epidemic from all angles. Oh all of that's fine, but having worked on outreach and communications issues myself, I want to make sure that the onus is not placed entirely on the community to fix the problems and to be better educated. It's on both ends. Oh no completely agreed, and I and I think, collaboratively that that's when he took her okay fabricio. I want to have a conversation with you Offline to pursue this further, so I'll be I'll, be giving you a call and thank you, Steve no worries, Steve I'll be more than happy to work with you all right. No. I know that and I appreciate your efforts and we need to work with you on this because we got to come up with with some kind of a solution. There was also something from the chat about the use of sound cameras. Is that something that's possible for enforcement? I could check with our Bureau of Fire investigation. I mean I have not heard of sound cameras, necessarily I'm not yeah. I have some material that somebody forwarded to me about this, which I can send on to you send on to me. Steve. I'd appreciate that I can check with our bureau fire investigation and then I could circle back with you guys. Okay, very good, all right! Thank you! Fabrizio you were unexpected and a and a very valuable guest. Thank you so much. Thank you Steve. Thank you. Everyone all right back to our regular agenda is betty. Do you have a report about Isabella Betty Leman, I'm here, hi yeah, I do have a report. Isabella has, you know, come through some challenging months in the spring, as you may remember, we are fortunately in a situation where everything is under control. We follow all state and federal guidelines for infection control. Having trouble hearing you can you get closer? Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? Yes, yeah, okay, sorry about that, and if others could mute, that would be great. Okay, all right, we has been and continues to follow all state and federal guidelines for infection control and the testing of staff and residents. All staff coming into the building are interpreted every day for given temperature tests every day. Well, anytime, they come into the building. Also, they are tested with the nasal swabs on a once a week basis and those results come back pretty quickly so that we are able to maintain control of our staff in terms of infections and so forth. We do have sufficient personal protective equipment called PPE according to our DOH guidelines and, as you remember, that may have been a challenge back in March and April, but we do have secure funding sources and supply sources for that equipment, funding for supplies and for programs and so forth. You probably know from the press that a lot of effort has been put in by the medical community in general, as well as state and federal state and local governments to secure funding for various services and we're part of that. With regard to our residents in the nursing home, we have two efforts that are underway and have been for some months now we have a hotline or fam visiting has been restricted since March 12th. We do permit window visits today or have been for the last couple of months, and what happens? Is the families will arrange with the social worker for a time and a date where they will come in, and then we bring the resident down into a an area? On our first floor, where, obviously we have windows and we're able to set up a window visit with the family on the exterior of the building in a protected area and then the resident in inside the building that those visits are arranged in advance and they're, typically of a half an hour or maybe an hour of duration depending on the situation and that's been going well. We also have a hotline for family members, any family member to be able to call in and get the status of their loved one on a daily basis. That particular hotline is manned by social workers who are able to address the issue promptly and appropriately to address the family member's concern. We also have our community- based programs, our senior resource center, our north programs and our upper Manhattan partnership for senior independence. Those programs continue to function. They are being handled on a virtual basis in many cases, although in some cases we're able to go to visit people now in their homes to be able to make sure that they're, okay, obviously they have the right equipment in terms of equity, etc. So we're you know we're carrying on as best we can it's an ongoing effort, as you can imagine, like the medical community at large. We do not know what the fall will bring. So we're you know bracing for hopefully a non- event. I do not know, but right now we're holding firm and we're very grateful for the support we've gotten from the community in terms of people offering to help with providing masks and providing other kinds of obstacles. So we're very happy and very grateful for that, and our employees are very happy as well. We did have you know. As you know, we have three deaths among our employees in the springtime. Fortunately, everything is fine. Now nobody has died recently, which makes us happy and that's about it for now- and I I'm sorry Betty did you finish? Yes, all right you'll be able to send me that report, so I can incorporate it into the minutes. Yes, all right, so I'm looking at the State Health Department report that came out yesterday with you know, statewide data on on nursing, home and adult care facility, Covid-19 related deaths and the numbers for isabella. They look the same from the last report. I looked at maybe a couple of months ago, so it does not look as though it does not look as though the Covid-19 has continued to really cause additional deaths at Isabella. Is that the case? That is the case so because those numbers have to be updated on a daily basis. Well, we provide the information on a daily basis. New York State publishes, I think, on Sunday night right. So I mean you hit. You hit that high point a few months back and then now it seems to have settled down. Okay. Well, that's good news! All right! Are there any questions for Betty? I had a question: is it art? Congratulations in order, Betty, you're, the new assistant chair of this committee. Congratulations on condolences! Okay, well, she's got she's, got big shoes to fill. What what's your shoe size now, any real questions, all right, very good. All right is the New York State nurses, association with us. Yes, we are here Steve, we are here. Yes, oh, very good julia did you want to say anything or should we go to straight to Alana and Christopher? We have Christopher here with us and he's going to give an update on what's going on with the allen psych? Yes, yes, my name is Chris, I'm one of the nurses at three river east, which is the Psychiatrist Department at the Allen hospital. So we had a rally back in August, which was really successful. We had a lot of representatives a lot of people with a community. You know, despite the rain, you know every year, always we have a rally, it always rains. But yes, despite the rain, a lot of us showed up and still supported us, which was great yeah, but Allen is still closed. The Psychiatrist Department's still closed. You know, despite all the roll up there on the third floor, the only you know. Half half of a unit third floor is for doctor offices, outpatient doctors, offices, our wing at the allen, is so empty. The kaiju is so empty and there's the Ob Department and you know we're still the floor- is just completely empty. They'd, rather have it empty than take our psychiatry patients up there. There was a I'm sorry good Christopher. Are you finished? Yes yeah? I just want to add sorry. I just I just want to add Steve that Chris mentioned that the psych nurses are actually doing Kobe testing they're in milk scene. Right now, and you know last time we said that they're doing orientation, medical Med, Surg orientation in all the different floors of the allen, but now, according to Chris, they are assigned to do Covid-19 testing at the Milstein Heart Center, correct, yeah, so yeah so far I mean the executives from the hospital. They told us that we're still temporary clothes, they won't give us date. They won't give us time they'd rather have it closed. They moved us from Med Surg to where we took care of you know the patients in the community. There was a lot of patients there as well about I worked on both med Surg floors and out of just a 24 patients. Six of them on each floor was psyched. They had them on one to one, which is constant observation and they were pretty much kept in their room, which is pretty cruel. You know, if we had the psych floor, usually they were allowed to go to groups, you know for with a therapeutic environment, but since they were psyched on a medical floor, they were kept in the room all day with nothing else to do, and so they yeah well that's interesting. So you we're talking now about psych patients were mixed in with the rest of the patient inpatient population at at Allen, while the spike unit has been closed. Is that what you say is that is that what I understand all right? So what happens is sometimes the psych patients on at the allen are maybe they're diagnosed with other diagnosis as well. You know sometimes cardiac issue. They have other issues going on, but we do have a great deal of psych patients on the Med Surg floor, which takes up room for the medical patients as well, okay, but no, but normally if the psych unit was open. That would that would not be. The case is that is that correct all the citations would go up to us, even if they had medical conditions, we're able to handle them on their floor. Okay, and so- and in this case, though, the psych patients were still admitted to the allen and were not sent to gracie or westchester or to another place. They were still sent to Allen, which maybe suggests to me that that there's a need for these feds at Allen, because the population can't be served elsewhere. Am I am I on the right track, you're on the right track. Yes, sir there's such a, I mean there's shutting down beds everywhere I mean Gracie Square, plus. I heard that the third floor. You have four floors. One floor is completely down. Brooklyn methodist is closed still and here at the allen. Where we're still closed so that's and how many site patients could could you say have been in the in the Med Surg beds at Allen. Is there a way I worked on both floors on Med Surg? At my time there within you know about eight weeks there, two months, so I would say about six on each floor. So that's 12. and each floor maybe has about 30 patients. So that's about 20 percent of the beds and you know of the med surge and then they're taking a med Surg floor, so med Surg beds, as well, 20 of the Med Surg beds were occupied by psych patients. Okay, that's that's a good piece of information, all right, I'm going to step away for a moment. There was a I want to pull. There was an exchange of correspondence between State Senator Jackson and I believe some other elected officials and Dr corwin, the president of the hospital and Corwin wrote back and- and I think once again, if I'm correct, did not make a clear commitment about restoring the psych unit. I mean they still talk about how they're not prepared to reopen the psych unit at this time because of the possibility of a second wave and how they're going to need these beds again for for Covid-19 patients. But if I remember correctly from that letter, he still does not make a clear- cut commitment to live up to the requirement to restore those beds once the Coven-19 crisis hopefully goes away julia. Are you familiar with that letter? Yes, I am, and I think I did at the last meeting, I did send you by email, a copy of the response from well the letter to Dr Corwin, and I can rescind the response, which is basically a non- commitment of reopening the psych unit, exactly what you said, Steve that you know they do not know they have to play it by ear, because there may be a second surgeon. They may need that unit for Covid-19 patients etc. So I just wanted to mention that on well. First of all, I wanted to follow up steve because he said that, because in 2018 we were able to put together a resolution right that was passed by CB12 regarding the near the allen site and we do not need to do another resolution, but instead they're going to be sending a follow- up letter. So I do not know if you were able to do the follow- up letter to Dr Corwin or should be we be working on that. Yes, we, yes, we should be working on that. I I dropped the ball. You you're absolutely right. I did intend to do a letter, especially with the when the elected officials did their letter. I wanted to do one the community board, so, yes, I do want to do another letter, and I now have I now I'm now holding the letter that Dr Corwin sent back to say state Senator Jackson, where he says. I very much understand the desire to know when these those inpatient beds will return to northern Manhattan. At this time we are undertaking a thorough evaluation of our behavioral health inpatient capacity and outpatient services at both the Allen hospital and our milstein campus. So we can determine a comprehensive plan that best meets the behavioral health needs, including inpatient beds of the northern Manhattan community. We will reach out to discuss and work together with you and our other government and community partners on that plan in the fall without knowing with certainty whether there may be another surge. We know we need to remain flexible with our physical spaces and resources for the near term. We also must provide these important services to residents of this community. Well, that's maybe more than he has said in the past, but I do want to see how he intends to work together with us on this plan that he's talking about Daryl yeah. I just wanted to ask a few questions from the chat. I'm sorry if they, you may have answered some of this, but there's three questions so one for the folks at New, York, Presbyterian, working in psychiatry and mental health has the pandemic had significant effects on the number of in or out patients. The hospital has been seeing. Treating has there been a surge or a decrease lately or has the number have the numbers stayed constant? Did you want me to ask the other questions, or do you want to answer that? First? Well, I do not. I do not know whether I think the only person who might be in any position to answer would be a christopher. If, but I do not know, Christopher would not really have that kind of I can I can I mean I can say from my point of view. I believe that I mean I worked on message. Four, I mean I would say, Covid-19 patience. We always roll out covetation when patients come in, we do a swab right away from the er until they're, until they're confirmed that they're Covid-19 negative they're always treated like a Covid-19, positive patient, so they're always in isolation, room they're, always on you know we always wear PPE. When entering you know, we take all precautions necessary just like if they were a copic patient once they are co- bit negative and with the swab and with the results, then we put them in a combined rom. So I hope that answers that your question, maybe there's about one or two Covid-19 positive, on a given floor at any time on stage, so the numbers greatly decreased. When I worked at Gracie square when they sent this first degree square where the whole floor was coped or as Allen where the whole floor was, you know all covered, I feel like the numbers greatly decreased since then I'd say, I'm sorry did. Did I cut you off yeah? Are there other? Are there democratic demographics? Sorry stats for patients being treated for mental health issues? I do not have that. I mean I probably I do not know how we can get that, but well that's information. We should request, we should request from the hospital, but I can't let- and lastly, is anyone being actively turned away from Alan actively. Well, I know that the psych patients I mean I've seen on that surge when I'm on the med search for psych patients are getting discharged, a lot quicker. I do not believe they're treated, you know fully 100, you know and they're discharged a lot quicker than they would on our three River East floor. You know they get more resources at three river east. Maybe they get, you know they're discharged to a social worker or you know, maybe a rehab or you know, in waiting for rehab or even we wait for state beds for them on that search floor, even they're, just discharged pretty quickly they're just treated quickly, maybe just not at a hundred percent. I even asked about treatment over ejection patients that are not in the mental state of mind that need I m. You know intramuscular injections over their. You know against their will, basically, which is usually it's ordered by the Department of Health. They have to go to the judge. They hardly do that so they're just pretty much. You know they do not do that at all, so they may not be discharged at full efficiency. Does that answer your question at all? I'm sorry questions. It was not my involvement. Well, I think I think the kind of information that's being requested here is really beyond your ability to provide and this information that we we would have to ask the hospital to give us- and I tell you at this point- the hospital has not exactly been forthcoming in providing us with information. I can't tell you how upset I feel with the hospital at this point, because I keep I've asked over a period of months for information on the number of covered patients that have been treated at at the Milstein and at Allen and at the children's hospital at the facilities in Washington, Ice and Inwood, and they refused to provide the information. It's unbelievable, it's you'd think they'd. They would want to impress upon us how much work they're doing and how they're dealing with this crisis, but they will not provide the simple statistical information on the number of patients that they have been serving, who have been admitted to the hospital, the number that have been discharged. I asked just. I asked how many of patients are in the hospital today with Covid-19 who over 19 symptoms and- and I can't get the information out of them. It's it's to me. It's mind- boggling, there's just no explanation for why they're not being forthcoming and providing just basic information about the services they provide in the in our in our community. So I'm not feeling too positive right now about our ability to get information from the hospital yeah sally, okay, yeah, just to Chris just to review some of the data that was given out that you mentioned today, and it was also at the rally. So we've got the 50 two units at Brooklyn methodist that were they're now gone, one. The 25 beds for the same reason covered capacity reserved for cobalt capacity and then the other 25 for some sort of renovation that they say they're doing, there's one floor of four at gracie. What the total bed count is at gracie and how many beds that would represent. I that's me. I mean I we were there for a while they usually have about. I think 30 beds of floor okay and then at westchester, because the two, what they told us originally was, while their patients are going over to grades and going to westchester westchester's, also closed down capacity in terms of chemical dependence, and maybe even some of the psych. Is that true? Or am I understanding something that I should probably misunderstand? Or am I misunderstanding, something have we lost capacity in terms of services at westchester? I'm not aware of westchester okay, but from what I know outside of aside from the Allen New York Presbyterian Allen, the methodist near presbyterian methodist in Brooklyn, Northwell syosset in long island, Northwell, Health, methadone clinic in Brooklyn, New, York, City, H, north central Bronx, and also westchester medical system that it's called the health alliance in Kingston, and actually thank you for you know bringing that up. Sarah, because looking at the bigger picture, we actually have a campaign, save New, York, psych, Bed, it's a statewide campaign and what? Because there's all of these units that are closing all different hospitals? And we want to build a coalition that will include more community organizations and we would like to invite CB12 to be part of this coalition. As we know, the hospitals are still hiding behind the excuse of Covid-19 and whatever gom como will be mandating. If we have a second surge. So we want to start calling out the DOH and the omh because they have not done anything. You know they're actually being very silent and allowing the hospitals to get away with all of this. So this is an invitation to see b12 to be part of that coalition and to help us, if you guys, can help us identify in Washington Heights community other organizations that we have not engaged with regards to fighting to reopen the Allen psych unit, and you know the New York state psych beds in general, we would love to get assistance so that we can reach out to them also great yeah. I would like to just a couple organizations I work for that would be happy to join the coalition. The the other question or comment is for Steve. The world has changed dramatically with cobit, I think, rather than a letter, I actually do think we should consider another resolution. Basically, we know that the need has gone up with koben. We know that we have this pent- up demand if we ever get through this, but there are many people that in other times would have necessitated inpatient treatment that are not getting it, and I think that we need to emphasize that and focus specifically on the failure to address this need. So I just, I think, the Community board and this committee should consider another resolution that builds on our first resolution reiterates a lot of these points, but also addresses the fact that the need is greater than it was when we originally focused on the ellen. So this my one cent, okay, all right, a point well taken all right, any anything else for for Julia or Chris all right, Julia I'll, be following up with you and sally I'll talk to you a little bit more about what you just raised: okay, very good, everyone! Okay! Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, hey Steve yeah. Can I just ask a couple things or mention a couple things? Well, okay, one just a gentle time check it's 9, 15., yes, who yeah to Betty for your report. I missed a question. I'm sorry, so the no one current no patient currently has a resident currently has Covid-19 at Isabella. Is that correct? Now we know what you know every day. You've got to be very careful to check all the time, so we monitor it closely, but right now we're good and then also someone asked a while ago about enforcing masks. You know at restaurants, especially on those larger corridors like dykman, really the police are not coming. I would say this is my answer, but that 3- 1- 1 would be your best bet. Unless other folks have other answers, you know, I think you certainly should begin with 3- 1- 1 and those apparently those calls are not being referred to the police. That's no longer if it was at some point a function of the police, it's now being handled through the mayor's office of enforcement. So you could certainly you can certainly file a report through three one. All right, so do we still have hands up. Sally is your hand up for sure. Oh, I need to lower it. Okay and Richard. Do you have a question? That's from quite a while ago, all right, very good? Okay, all right. Okay, we're now on to our follow- up on the noise pollution hearing that we held back in early August Claudius share the founder of the website. Is it a website, a social media group Y inward for respectful decimal levels? Are you with us, yes, hi? Thank you so much for having us today, all right! So claudia you have a powerpoint. I do. Yes, I realize it's getting late and I'll try to speed through it as quickly as possible. Yeah, please many ideas. Okay, do you know how you would display it? Are we going to? Yes? Oh you just share this screen. Oh actually, it says, host has disabled attendee screen sharing. Is it possible to enable attendee screen sharing Chanel? Do you know how to do that? I think she promotes the speaker to co- host. Oh okay, Chanel. Can you do that? Chanel, oh Shoot, Daryl. Have you been looking at the Q&And a there are 14, I'm leaving some up there just because, but yeah these are all answered. Oh, they are very good. Thank you. So is that the same as chat, I mean kind of sort of okay. All right has has claudia, been made a co- host not yet, who said that I did Claudia yeah. I can't I can't share my screen yet oh yeah Chanel and can captain Freeman Mute? Maybe there we go now, I'm co- host okay. So here we go. Let's see, let's make sure this works. Sorry give me one second here, oh dear okay, that should work now, sorry, this is being difficult. Let's try again here we go okay. So, first of all, I just wanted to thank you so much for including us today and especially to Steve Simon for hosting the noise pollution hearing on August 4th and bringing all of the necessary resources and agencies to the and policy makers to the table. We are extremely appreciative of this effort and it brought much- needed hope in the multi- faceted problem of noise pollution that we've faced this year. I wanted to take just one quick second, to acknowledge the extraordinary and unprecedented times and the noise challenges we've had this summer. As a result, they've been augmented as never before Kova drastically changed. How all of us work play. Travel Connect and unwind this year has also brought the deep and necessary soul searching on how law enforcement should be conducted and conversations around de- escalating conflict. We need to think outside the box and in a multifaceted way, to properly address the challenges of noise pollution. We need to address everyone's need and right to sleep tonight and also seek smart and meaningful long- term solutions moving away from a complaint based system. These solutions will help us thrive and take care of each other as a community. In May, I founded my group Washington Heights and Inwood for respectful decibel levels which has since grown to over 800 members and has a parallel spanish language group as well. Among these 800 members, we have many dedicated volunteers who are working hard on these smart solutions and initiatives, and I'm confident that by working together with the Community board and the people in agencies, you compel to the table on August 4th. We can resolve our collective concerns in caring and equitable ways. As we spoke with the people who joined the group, it became clear that high decibel levels are not merely quality of life issues. As they have been characterized in the past, but are actually health and safety issues, Dr Arlene Bronsoft, a renowned noise expert who spoke at the hearing on August 4th and has been offering us advisement. Her groundbreaking study from Ps98 in inward showed that children consistently exposed to the loud noise of elevated subway tracks next to their classrooms, fell a year behind their peers in reading ability by the end of elementary school Dr Bronzaf, followed up on her work by collaborating with city agencies resulting in the subway tracks being coated with the material to become quieter so that all the children could succeed in school as we go back to school now, and children additionally need to be able to study at home more than before the need to address the loud sounds in the neighborhood is more prevalent than ever. In my group we have stories of parents putting their children to sleep at 6 pm so that they can get a few hours of sleep before the amplified. Motorcycles and stereo systems begin on the street at night. Noise has many health effects, including cardiovascular disease, and a link to diabetes. Of course, the most well- known effect of noise is hearing loss, as you can see from this chart. Anything over 85 decibels, which includes the motorcycles and blasting music, can cause damage within just a few minutes, and the fireworks, of course exceed any exposure limit and are loud enough to cause instant pain. Noise is also used in noise, torture by the Cia to psychologically break prisoners. I'm sorry claudia. What was the last thing you said about fireworks fireworks, as you can see on this chart, they're at 145 decibels and the daily exposure limit is zero they're loud enough to cause pain and hearing loss immediately, wow. Okay, this here is a breakdown of noise complaints in CB12 in the last three months, as you can see, street and sidewalk noise vehicles and residential noise comprise 96 of all the complaints. These have been our focus and I believe that we can collectively solve these. So would you so the fireworks would sit within street sidewalk complaints. I assume, to be honest, I'm not sure if this, if the fireworks are registering as noise complaints, the 311 or if, since the 311, had people calling 911 if they're a separate thing, that's something that we could try to find out. Yeah. Okay, we should try to find out okay go ahead as we look at these complaints. These ones come in from three one, which is the current way to file a noise complaint. However, the three, the three on one app is not currently available in spanish, and this creates a barrier towards noise complaints being addressed equitably the summer. We have also had many reports of 311 complaints being closed within 10 minutes without any action taken. Although the ticket may say that there was using data that we collected in the respectful decibels group, I understand that the CB12 Public safety committee is investigating this issue. Many thanks to Curtis Young for being so responsive to our concerns at the August 4th Hearing Mark Levine also expressed his support for investigating and mending this broken system. With great thanks to the energy and initiatives of our volunteers, we formed several working groups that aim to solve noise pollution at the source, balancing the need for quiet with our shared community priorities of outdoor socialization and recreation, businesses, thriving and the minimization or elimination of police contact. Our outreach group is committed to community building connecting with community members and helping each other take care of our health with respect to noise. Our initiatives include a public health campaign around healthy levels of sound and harmful levels of noise. Alongside raising awareness of the noise code which exists in order to protect hearing and health, we aim to increase awareness of now readily available decibel measuring apps such as the CDC developed, one called niosh, which enable anyone with a smartphone to check how loud their stereo or muffler or surroundings are. We are also engaged in community outreach and have an email and phone number by which non- facebook users can contact us we're additionally reaching out to members of housing networks such as supers landlords, Tenant, Association and hopefully also other housing such as nursing homes, which we understand that noise has been an issue at isabella as well. Here is a bilingual flyer that we've developed in collaboration with about 10 of our volunteer members. We have quite a talent pool of artists, writers and designers. There have been many ideas around this flyer and we may make other versions, but this is an informational one that we can distribute widely to parents at laundromats and doctor's offices. If CB12 is willing to partner with us on this, we would certainly be grateful for printing and distribution assistance. I would change the heading. I think not enough people understand what decimals are so, I would say something like maybe noise levels or something, but I think the decibels is just not a common term for most people. I think that's something I would like to change, but yes agreed. Thank you all right and then so our transportation safety group is focused on reducing noise emissions caused by speeding, drag racing and Doughnut, making, I guess, and modified mufflers, which has been just rampant. This summer we did a survey in large group in the large Facebook group identifying hot spots such as Sherman Ave, where residents have been suggested to dangerous driving all summer and have been in touch with the CB12 transportation committee and other offices to promote expedited installation of speed, humps and cushions to help deter this kind of dangerous driving speed cushions are temporary rubber installations, which have also been used in the city of Buffalo. Under the mayor's traffic calming initiatives, speed cushions can be installed even along bus routes. In Buffalo the program was initiated after a child was killed by a speeder. So I sincerely hope that we can do it here before such a tragedy occurs. We are also calling for increased red light cameras and support residential parking permits, as we are aware that much of the noise we've experienced this summer has come from outside of the city and often also outside of the state. Metered parking would, of course, still be available for business customers, legislation, enforcement and alternatives. Our aim is to move away from a complaint based system and minimize the necessity of police involvement. One main way to do this is to link noise to license plates and vehicles rather than to people. This is already being done in the Uk, where noise, so- called noise cameras, are being used to measure decibels of vehicles and record license plates in the same way as vehicle speed is measured by speed cameras. It is a way to address vehicles without mufflers, and the boom car is blasting music to wake up the whole neighborhood the license plates are then ticketed, and these these tickets can be linked with points on the license rather than going the other route. We're also aware that the current system of ticketing for noise is not working. The equitable solution is for tickets or warnings to lead to confiscations of the noise making equipment. This needs to be supported by legislators and the enforcement agencies. We are also interested in what collaborations can come from the department of environmental protection parks enforcement patrol the NYPD and other partnerships. The parks we cherish here in northern Manhattan, unlike central park and other city parks, do not have the same funding to hire private security guards as it's done there, because we do not have a conservancy. Often it is sufficient for a person with authority to ask a noisemaker to lower the volume. Similarly to how simple police patrols have helped with some noise in the neighborhood. Claudia, let me just say you know I work for the Parks Department. I do not. I do not know of any park that has private security guards. You know with any public park. Central Park does not have private security and no city park actually has private security, maybe I've. Maybe I've expressed it in incorrectly. I listened to the CB12 parks yeah before yeah, so I think I made the same point at that meeting. I think we talked about servants yeah, well they, but they do not have their own. You know I mean there are conservancies that that pay the parks Department so that we hire additional parks enforcement patrol officers that are assigned to those parks, but those are not. Those are those are parks, department, employees, they're, not private security right but they're getting an allocation of additional staff which we do not have access to right, but you know that's in very limited cases and it's but but but you know, but I do not. I do not want anyone to think that we have private security guards that are that are patrolling our parks. Okay, I'm sorry go ahead. My apologies. I mistook that. So on the next point on data, I just wanted to say that our group has an exceptionally dedicated data team. The goal is to gain insight into the sources of noise pollution and pinpoint hot spots to prioritize remediation. I've already mentioned the week- long three- on-. One study that Jen Donna, who did and presented on here at CB12 in July. The study is helping shed insight into how to fix 3-, 1- 1 and the tracking of complaints into the board stat system we've also begun, collaborating in collaborating with beta NYC, which was a result of the August 4th hearing. The speed Hump cushion study was also put together by this team. They're ready, willing and able to collect and sort data on anything we need to figure out. One more area we are working on is signage. The goal is to determine how and where signs may be placed in order to prompt noise reduction. Our aim is to collect hot spots for signs and partner with local businesses and buildings and parks. Senator Jackson already expressed his support for this at his senator in your corner meeting, we realize that we need partnerships and collaborations to succeed. Our goal is to share information and resources with agencies, officials and organizations who have a mutual interest in mitigating noise pollution. Among other things, we have reached out to Nyu's sounds of New York, City or Sonic for short program, which is aiming to mitigate noise pollution in New York City through technology. We have shown up for meetings with elected officials, some of whom have taken an interest in our initiatives, claudia what are these noise sensors, so they are similar to what's being done in the Uk. They are able to detect decibel levels of sounds, but also classify sounds, and so what the what Nyu is doing is they're partnering with communities to put the sensors up and help them get help the machines get smarter at recognizing the noise source and what happens with that information? How is that? How is that utilized? It looks like very they're in the development phase at Nyu, but the goal is to use that in enforcement. Yeah I'd like to hear how that worked. Okay, yeah, I can send a link about that. Okay, it's it looks like they're still in the development phase, which is perhaps interesting since we could help them develop. So in conclusion, I just really want to thank Cv12 for taking our concerns seriously and providing the forum, the communication and connections towards having the conversations that can create lasting and meaningful change. We have a lot of work to do, but I'm confident that we can do it well. Thank you for your presentation. Let me ask you one other thing: did you say earlier that there's a that is a program you could put on your phone to measure decibel levels? Yes, absolutely so the CDC actually put out an app called Niosh Niosa that allows you to measure decibels. That particular app is for Iphone only because the iphone apparently has a better microphone, but it is CDC approved and it's very stable and there are other apps for android as well one. I wonder if anybody's recognized using that in any kind of legal actions, whether you challenge there, I'm sorry who's speaking. This is Natalie yeah. We have constituents, use those apps yeah. If I may interject here, yeah go ahead in sites where there's been really long- term extended construction and that information you know that these community groups have put together has been dismissed, but it can not form the basis of a violence, intriguing. The research that you guys have done into something that someone could install. That is recognized. You know and has backing of research and it's kind of a uniform ins. You know tool that that's installed in various corners. I think there's a lot of potential with that. Yes, and I should just add about the niosh, I do not think we were seeing that as a way to enforce things, because we understand that needs the the proper decibel meters that the Department of Environment environmental Protection has, but the niosh app would be part of the public health campaign where we measure the decibel levels around us, and so you know, one of the things that happens is when people are around loud decibels, all the time they lose hearing, and so people who are making noise may not realize how much noise they're making because it does not sound as loud and so by empowering everyone to check. Well, how loud is the noise I'm actually making? It helps us come to a more standardized discussion. All right are there committee members with any questions. All right, there's a hand that's raised by, for is it Karen or Joel Akur I may not be. I may not be pronouncing the name correctly, but is there a way in which she can speak? Yes, you can promote her to panelists Chanel. Can you do you see her name, Karen Jalakur J-, O-, l-, I-, c-, o-, E-, U- R hi there. Thank you. Can you hear me now? Yes, are you Karen? Yes, I am. How are you steve, okay and thanks to claudia for her vision and founding the group, so I would love it if someone on this committee could take on as a related issue. The three one calls getting closed out without attention. I think that is something that needs to be addressed on a systematic citywide level. We should not be seeing 311, which is an amazing resource if it functions as it should be functioning just decimated right, so 311 calls are being closed out with no attention and being we're being told either that situations have been addressed and mitigated or situations have been found to be unfounded, and we know that this is nonsense, and so one of our fundamental tools as a community to address our noise concerns is being you know, relegated as useless. Can anyone on the committee address this since the last meeting when we identified this as an issue? I think the relate also related. That Karen are the calls that, because of Jen's study were not even making it into 3- 1- 1, the call would be placed. We would have a record of it. You know the caller would have a record of it, and yet it would not appear on the system and that seemed to affect. I can't remember what the percentage was, but maybe a third of the calls we're not even making the board stats so there's two exactly so boards. That was something that was new to me since the founding of this group that there was a comstab version of something for 311 called Boardstat right. So there's a couple levels of this: why are we having three one calls closed out as unfounded or addressed when, clearly it's not the case, and why are three one calls not properly populating board stat which it seems like it should be a purely mechanical process right. These things are not okay, so we've addressed these things in the original meeting a few weeks ago and have we learned anything? Is anyone accountable to reporting on these things, so I yield back. Thank you all right. Well, you certainly raise a a legitimate point and it was my understanding that this question is being looked at, at least by Councilmember, Levine and and maybe by one of our other committees, so I'll check on that I'll put. It mark seemed to like Hone in on this as an issue that he could dress and he seems like the kind of guy who could take this on, but where we come in the last four weeks right, I know good, it's a good question all right, any other any questions from our committee members. So can we move on now very good? Thank you, Claudia. Thank you. So much all right, tanya the floor is yours, questions. What is that your hands up? Oh I'm, sorry! One second is that Richard he is okay. I thought that was an old hand. I thought yeah. I thought you were an old hand. What a perfect description yeah go ahead. Richard very brief. I mostly comment because I appreciated the depth of research and other issue work that went into the presentation that was just made, but I also want to make sure we do not leave this issue without at least an acknowledgement, heavy lifting that our colleague, Johnny Bonner, has that our colleague, Tony Bonner has done on this issue, both in the community and especially within the community Board, to see that our committees are aware and that there's an awareness throughout the board double thanks all around all right. Well, that's a good intro for Tanya to now speak hello! Oh hello! Kim! Can we can we pick wow rich flow? Can you hear me yeah go ahead? Can you hear me yeah go ahead tanya. You can hear me now. Yes, oh I'm sorry yeah, it's just getting late. I want to say thank you so much richard for those kind words. I really appreciate it because it has been a long haul. As a lot of people know, there's been a lot happening on this issue for years behind the scenes. So thank you for that. I you know really appreciate that. Also I just wanted to just touch base about our what we what we talked about, what I brought up at the August fourth of noise pollution hearing was the idea of the task force to come together to bring all these entities together to begin to talk about solutions, because you know it's important that we start bringing people to the table to start to talk to each other talk, acrosss departments to talk acrosss, you know communities and community groups, and things like that to sort of come up with these. You know to talk about what the possible solutions are, what the ideas are and then to begin beginning to figure out how we can implement some of these things in our community to make this community to sort of mitigate a lot of the noise pollution. That's been going on, and so with that I wanted to say that you know we are there's a group of us hardly working on trying to you know working on the structure and everything of the task force, our group as a whole. You know we did temperature checks and the group definitely felt strongly that the you know what the task was to be community- led while we're bringing all these different entities. We want to bring all the different entities together, but we feel is important that this is something that is coming out of the community in terms of leadership on this issue. I do not know if I can share my screen. I hope I do not. It does not knock me out Steve, but I wanted to share our mission statement. A few of us worked really hard on looking at. Oh thank you Chanel. You were right on top of that, one, I'm going to hope that I can do this because yeah I can okay all right. So here is the mission statement that we've come up with, as people can see I'll read it out loud for those of us who might have hearing difficult. I mean site difficulties, mission statement and, of course, this is going to be translated into spanish before we put anything out officially, but it says the Wahi Inwood task force on noise is a broad community-, led coalition of neighborhood groups, local residents, small businesses and public health experts. We're dedicated to working proactively to address the long- running public health impacts that threaten the well- being and livelihoods of residents in upper Manhattan. This group seeks to accomplish this by unifying our diverse neighborhood and elevating black and brown voices in our leadership and direction. The task force seeks to achieve these goals via holistic approaches that are not limited to, but include engaging agencies from acrosss government, elected officials and community leaders, as well as advocating for effective policy- based policy based on the well- documented scientific studies that show excessive noise is harmful to public health. Our goal is therefore to positively transform the health and well- being of everyone in our neighborhood. So that's our mission, our mission statement that we have and, as you can see, our goal really is to make sure that we are bringing all the relevant parties to the table. We want to create a space for people to dialogue, to talk about potential solutions and work together to identify what the priorities will be, what people can do, monetarily what roles people will play where the accountability will be on certain issues, and so we think that is an extremely important role and we also, as I said mentioned, that we really want to make sure that we are including voices of the diverse voices in this movement, making sure that those voices are represented in anything that we do and we could tell that's important, especially being a predominantly hispanic community. I also wanted to say one of the other things that we did since the hearing is we started. Looking at, just people have been suffering a great deal, so a lot of things have been coming in. One of the things that we did was look at parks issues because it seemed like a lot of the complaints were coming from there and so Steve. I did send you that information, but it's not a scientific thing, and it's okay, that it's not, but we did ask people to contribute areas that they felt were problem areas in the community and they did identifying inward Hill Inwood Hill park as one of the major places where people were doing activities. Illegal activities are against park, rules and also city rules, and we also identified several other products like folks, Fort, Tryon, Mckenna, Square and love this playground even and a number of others. Most of the complaints were coming from Inwood like 70, though about another 20, not 30 percent were coming from Washington Heights people listed the following activities happening loud, music, loud parties, drinking illegal drug use, large gatherings, fireworks were all happening and there were other outlier things that people were talking about, such as motorcycle riding things like that, but those top five categories or top six. We are really concerned about because you know these things can also there's a connection, as Dr Bronza also mentioned at the public hearing between optics and crime and lack of enforcement on these sort of quality of life complaints. And so that's why I thought it was very illuminating. People do we're following three one complaints and, as was mentioned earlier in Claudia's presentation, these things were, people were saying: nothing happened as a result of following those three one complaints, and at this point, when it comes to quality of life, that's the only avenue people really have to take. People sometimes tried to contact their police precincts directly, and some people felt that did not lead to at all lead to any sort of solutions, and people did not realize that the Parks Department has an enforcement unit like about half of the people, and I thought that was pretty telling. So I think what this, what this tells us one of the things this tells us that we need to bring people together, because I think a lot of people do not know about all of the different agencies and entities that could come to the table to bring some really creative solutions to these problems, and I think it's important that we provide support and I would love to have everyone's support who's on this call. We're going to be. You know, trying to bring all these community partners together to really come to the table to do this, but we really think it's important that the community is really a equal partner at that table to make sure their voices are heard in that their interests are, you know, are considered in this and, as we said, we want to make sure that we are valuing it and listening to minorities in the community about how they've been impacted by all of this and also their leadership and voices on this. So that's where we are. We are at the point we do have some support as well from for this task force from some of our electeds, and we want to really over the next month, convene our first meeting to begin to have these dialogues and conversations and we really love to have you know, Steve. Your committee really support that effort. As we're really saying this is a public health issue. I do not want to go on because it's late, so I just want to- and I know people are, you probably have other things on the agenda as well. So I just want to keep that short and anybody have any questions you know. Do you have any questions steve or why? No, I well. I I'd like you to mail me and mail. Me email me the mission statement, so I can quote questions for them. It's a it's a very good statement. No I I do not have any questions. Does anyone else have a question and thank you Richard again. I really appreciate that because I want to say this has been a hard road. I have been dealing with this issue for 15 years and I have been fighting for this issue for since I've been on the community board, which is almost three at this point and doing this work around my professional life, my personal life, and also not getting any sleep for months, because Annoyed has not been easy. So I really appreciate that and what you said. Thank you so much right, very good. Okay, can I ask something: yeah? Well, yes, Mr Cochran, you can ask anything you'd, like oh just a couple things from the two things from the Chat. One said regarding Karen's question about three one: not showing up on board stat. There are people at beta NYC, actively working on this question for washing heights in wood for respectful decimals, so that was fun, and then someone also commented that you know Inwood Hill park is out of control as it relates to this. I was- and I was wondering from that too, like is there maybe like a top 10 or 20 lists of hot spots in the community that you're focusing on, or I guess I can answer some of that. No one. Second, I think this is a. I think, that's a good question. I'd like that. He that either and or both claudia and tanya perhaps should respond to and that's I think you meant it for them. Is there a? Is there a top ten? Do we have something like that? Is it possible to put together something like that? Based on the three one calls and other information we have well three one I can tell them. I can say that our boardstat could give us that pretty easily. It would just be a matter of running that information, because at one point you know I had going to the 33rd with that type of information absolutely several years ago, but actually last year. I believe it was last spring with the similar data with them about some of the hot spots around, where I am so showing that so you can pull that pretty easily yeah and also I'm sorry and also I was going to say with the with the parks we do have that information, because people in the group identified the problem areas. You know, and we do have the ones that show up the most and we had. We had more than 10 we had. We had at least definitely had 10 of those, but we have. We have identified some of the more areas in the police in that area depart hello, yeah. I think it would just be good, you know, maybe to help people focus and help them daryl. Thank you for that more activity. Can you hear me? Oh no. I agree. I totally agree yeah. We can hear you Karen, okay, so just in case I just want to disambiguate a little bit. Thank you for the response on the three one calls not populating boards that right. That is one question, but separately from that we have the situation where three one calls are getting closed by the precinct, as you know, 33rd or 34th, as unfounded or as mitigated. So these are different issues related, but not the same thing they actually are. They actually are related because people are they are related because- and we've talked about this at the at the public hearing very extensively about three one calls being closed out. People indicated that so when people are filing 311 complaints, that's the th, that's the tool that we are. The community is giving right. So if those complaints are not being are being closed out without being investigated, that is the same issue and we do need to, and I do not think that no one anyone was against. Looking into that, I think what needs to happen is we need to bring that issue to the table when we have our task force and have the parties. That would be a part of that. I encourage you know Steve, thank you so much for bringing beta NYC to that hearing and we were able to coordinate that and bringing the police department to that conversation so, and Mark Levine obviously expressed interest in this issue, so bringing all those parties together to be able to figure out what is actually going on and what you know. That's really the answer I mean you know, so that's why I agree that they're. I agree. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I was I was speaking so yeah so yeah. I was just saying that you know that bringing these people together to the table will really make a difference. You know, instead of taking it piecemeal and keeping it. You know, I think, there's a way to do it. That will help us to get closer to the solution agreed to. I was speaking as well, so the factor of the related issues does not diminish the fact that three one calls populating boards. That is a mechanical issue right, so we have the issue of things being closed by human decisions, right things being closed by human decision as unfounded or as dealt with when they maybe have not been, and then there is the mechanical issue of things populating boards that are not populating towards that and they are related, but potentially not the same, potentially related. Okay, Karen. I do not quite understand the this latter issue is, it is not bordstad based on data from 3- 1- 1 calls. I do not understand it completely, but the fact that there are issues that are being put into 3-, 1- 1 that are not then populating board stat seems to be that. There's a flaw right so there's the human flaw where a police or whoever is the arbiter of I close- this 3- 1- 1 issue as unfounded. I closed this three one issue as we showed up and we did dealt with it or did not deal with it but separately or are not separately, and we need to understand right. Okay, so 311 calls are supposedly populate board sets wow if I could so I'm not making it into board stuff you're, basically saying that there's under reporting happening here. Yes, there is not some mechanical right issue with the under reporting. That is separate, right, clock right, claudia right, tanya. This is a dress apart from okay, if I could too yeah at the Parks Committee meeting earlier this week, we got a little off topic, but this was addressed in some fashion that this was addressed at the at the public. Hearing beta NYC did address that yeah. Well is it is not this something that you know so the basic, but basically like one of the things that our board member Barbara brought up was that Precinct Community council meetings have not been happening. Okay, but that's not that's, but no. It deals with the issue of closing out no yeah. Okay, oh closing out the calls yeah closing calls closing calls and the mechanical population of Florida are separate. Okay, yeah Karen. I think we have the point. Thank you. I'm sorry. If I could just move on to the chat, real, quick or to the Q&A yeah go ahead, please we are taking to the anonymous person. We are taking questions. So if you have a specific question, please feel free to type it in and just also identify yourself for the notes. Thank you, okay, a claudia, are you still with us? Yes, how many people have joined the spanish language, social media site? We have over 50 now over 50. Mm-, hmm, all right. That was a very good move on your whoever came up with that idea. Very good, okay, all right, so I did. I did want to have a resolution tonight on the fireworks issue. It's taking me more time to put it together, so I do intend to bring it up at next month's meeting. I've spoken to curtis young and the intent would be to have both I'm sorry. The intent would be for it to be a joint resolution from both committees, public safety, as well as health and environment, and- and I certainly want to highlight the situation with the fire that occurred at 180. I think it was 184 nagel and I believe I'm told it was another fire not as severe at 551 west 157Th street, and I want to bring up the case of the woman. I believe her name is Mrs Pirelli, who passed away after suffering. A heart attack which her daughter is believes, was brought on after having an anxiety attack from the fireworks. So I want to have a specific resolution just dealing with the fireworks issue. I think it's important enough to deal with it as a separate issue, so ex expect to see something on next month's agenda I'll try to get it done early enough, so I can send it around to people beforehand, we're now passing 10 o'clock and I think we're going to just junk the rest of the agenda. We're going to discuss the budget priorities next month. Anyway and I've sent out to everybody the latest reports on the DEP service request and the update from Ddc on the water main and sewer installation projects, the big News there is that the water main installation work in Inwood. It has been completed sally. Is this brief? Well, it's I guess my question is with what's been addressed by claudia and tonjes how to move most quickly forward to address these problems, and I understood that CB12 at the hearing committed to doing a task force. I just want to make sure that we're not doubling efforts of replicating efforts, but that you know we're moving towards the solutions in the fastest way, and I guess the you know you and curtis have the ability to get these agencies to show up. I mean they sort of have to that's your responsibilities chairman and that's their responsibilities, agencies they have to report back to us. So I just want to figure out how we can. We do not have to discuss it now, but I think it needs to be a discussion. How can we most quickly move to address these concerns? Steve? Can I can I respond to that yeah go ahead. Yeah. As I said, I was the one who actually brought up the task force at the hearing and said that we should go forward with that. So that's what we're doing, but it's going to be community. So that's exactly what we are doing right now is doing a community- led task force that will bring all of these people together. We have had support reach out to us from who are willing to who have the capacity and the connections to from to help us to move this, to get these bodies to the table. So I have full confidence that they will be able to do that as they are highly positioned to do so, and so that is the solution. We have already offered the solution that we will have the task force. We are working on that we have our. As you saw the mission statement, we have people committed to working on that and that's what we're going to do and so yeah. I think that is the best way forward is to bring all these people together to the table. To talk about to come start becoming to come up with these priorities of in terms of how to tackle these things as Daryl was alluding to you know, looking at things like in terms of what are the most, you know the top things and what we can tackle right now and sort of creating that kind of priority list of the things that we need to deal with so yeah. We have that. I do not know if anybody heard what I said, but we did have that and we are moving forward on that task force and, as I said, Community Board, 12, of course, Steve and all these people will be able to be a part of that. But we want to make sure that's coming from the community that is representative of the community, that the voices in the in the needs are being that are that the voices of the people of community are being heard and being heard fairly. And so that's why it's important, but those so yeah- and I you know we obviously have support here. Steve- is allowing us to talk about this and deal with this. So we have that support and so we're ready to move forward. Does that answer your question, sir? Sally? No! But okay, I'm sorry just thought it was a couple of things. Okay, I do not want to have a back and forth on this. I just had a couple things from the Chat Steve. Sorry yeah go ahead down from the Q&A one, just kind of pointing out a spot, that's bothersome for motorcycles and cars with their mufflers around Broadway and seaman, just pointing that out, Broadway and seaman. Do not intersect. That's what I thought, but around 204 cooper. Okay, in that area, yeah, better yeah and then also you know. I saw a very disturbing video a couple of weeks ago, of some crazy car speeding all over that neighborhood and I could not believe it. He did not smash into anybody. I'm sorry go ahead. Darryl, that's okay and the other is just really kind of pointing out the urgency of this. You know. Obviously, what we're doing is a process and time consuming, but you know folks want it done now so or want solutions yesterday. So keeping that in mind, I just want to write okay. I I just want to point out that that we can work on more than one track, and you know the this committee can still do work in this area and should continue to do work in this area and, as I mentioned earlier, one of the things I want us to do is to deal with the fireworks issue. Okay. So unless I hear differently I'd like to adjourn the meeting, it's a 1008 question, who is this Naisa? Oh go ahead. I just have questions about the selection process for this committee, because I do hear that we want the community to be heard. I hear that we have diverse opinions, but aside from community board, how are we going to ensure that our community is part of this committee or how are we going to ensure that the people that are being directly impacted aside from the community board are included in this committee? Because I have I'm sorry in this in our health and Environment Committee? Oh, we were just discussing the committee correct the task force. You mean yeah, the task force. Sorry, so how are we going to ensure that people are on this test, like people outside of the Community Board and people that are directly impacted, are on the task force and that we're just not driving the rhetoric, that's reinforced by one group versus another, and we actually have diversified opinions and we're reaching out to the community to be part of this task force? Okay, what is this well, this task force is being formed by well. I mean Tanya should answer the question. I would like to just speak on this for a quick moment, because I did found the group Washington Heights and Inwood foreign. This is not not really a question for you. This is a. This is a question specifically about the composition of the task force and tonya is the only one here who is involved in that process. I understand yeah. Thank you, yeah, that's why we wanted it. That was the main reason why you know I brought you know the different scenarios to the group and people really want this to be community- led, and that was the reason. Why is because of the fact that, in people's experience that when task forces are formed, unfortunately, through our board, that there is not that representation of the community that it does not represent the interests of the community and the voices that really need to be a part of those particular task forces? And so that was the concern that came out of it and was the reason that people really wanted this to be community- led not saying that the community board will not be a part of the task force itself, but they are not forming the task force, nor they would be leading that task force. That would be something that the community would work in tandem with other community stakeholders and that's why we're all coming together to really talk about what who some of these people could be in terms of the community stakeholders? Of course, we know we have to include all of the electives we're, including the community board, but we're also including small business. As we said in our mission statement. You know this is a process as it would be, even if we had it is a process to really find out. You know, go to the people, go out to people and really and really see their interest in being a part of this conversation, but we, you know by having this community led, we are. The community is leading at that discussion in terms of identifying the people. You know deeply entrenched in these issues, deeply from the grassroots level they're coming up with these name and with these potential people and potential participants, and of course, that would include all the city agencies. So that's not that you know they're already there but yeah. That was the reason that we wanted to do it. That way is because we really have learned that it it's important, especially with an issue like this dealing with quality of life issues. That's impacting people on a very personal level in our communities in our residential communities and our business communities and other communities that we bring all of these people that we, the community, are really identifying the people that should be on it. You know, and so yeah. It's not you know, this is not totally scientific, but it's definitely something that you know by having a community conversation having this being open, it's fluid it's something that you know is part of a discussion, and it's going to take a little bit for us to really you know, figure out all of the different entities that you know would be interested in and being a part of this conversation, and but you know, I think this is the best myself personally think it's the best way to go. Okay, all right in terms of making sure and they're bible yeah. I was going to say too: there are models in the community where this has actually worked, like we've had models in the community where this type of process everywhere has worked really well in addressing issues see we just we, we have a hand up. I just want to point out and then also I have an announcement whenever it's time for that natalie. Is that your hand? Well, it's my hand, notionally my hand is not small and blue, but I had a few announcements to make. If I can rub a few seconds after your discussion is done, and I did not want you, okay well, are we up to an is? Are there any other questions or comments? Can we move on to? Can we move on to announcements? I just need to make one one comment. So I'm coming from the respectful decibels group, it seems like we're working on two tracks. There is a group that's doing the task force and respectful decibels is a group of it's a Facebook group of 800 members who are free to choose as they wish, and we definitely do want to partner with the community board all right all right. Thank you for that. Okay, one thing, sorry, one more thing! I just thank you tanya for answering my question, but I just want to emphasize and like urge everyone that is involved in the task force selection process to reach out to people that are not voluntarily displaying interest, because I think there are parts of our communities, like my grandmother who are affected by this issue, but do not have the time are not aware enough or like this we're not. These are not the populations that we're targeting when it comes to this, and I think that it's important to include to be inclusive aside from, like varying perspectives, race and gender. I think we should think about their age groups as well and just ensure that there's like diversity in all senses- oh absolutely we're right there with you. Thank you, my dear okay, all right are we ready for announcement Natalie go ahead. Thank you, Steve. I am going to limit my remarks because it is late and I did email you as the meeting was going on a few things, including presbyterian's response to Gail on the allen psych slightly different from what you read that had been addressed to the senator, but along the same impact and there's also an email that I shared about volunteers being recruited again for the mask volunteers for MTA that sally mentioned they're doing another set of dates next week. The only announcement that I do feel compelled to make out of our out of our Covid-19 newsletter today is the just you know hearing the reports, especially from our Ems friends. There is. The application is open to nominate an individual organization doing outstanding urban public health work for the Joan H Tisch Community Health prize the nominations close in December. This is something through a hunter at CUNY. The link to the nomination form is on Gail's newsletter and would be in her announcements on the borough president's website and then, of course, today is 20 days, t minus 20 days to fill out the census. So all of you who are doing this incredible work of reaching out to the community about noise and quality of life and testing and tracing might as well. You know mention, while you're at it make sure people have filled out the census. Sometimes a familiar face with an affinity on a certain issue like the ones you guys are reaching out on will be what convinces someone to complete that questionnaire, and even though Washington Heights Inwood community district 12 is doing better compared to the rest of Manhattan at 69 percent self- response, because this district has twice double the population of the next populated district. In fact, the number of non- responders represents more bodies that are not being counted. So do not let those statistics fool you, although it feels nice to be beating the next district over. There are still many people not counted here and then overall, we want to make sure that Manhattan numbers are up because who wants to be beat by Staten island in five minutes? Oh god, no, greater shame, and if I could piggyback on her report, okay, you can well that's really that's really up to Natalie. I can't I can't give you approval to do something like that. It's well, it's related to her office as well. So, okay, all right, fine, absolutely, and I am done. Thank you. I yield to daryl. Thank you. Thank you in my other role with the city Commission on Human rights, and this is for the board members. We started a series through the borough president's office on various topics of diversity and inclusion. We had we're doing a workshop next Monday, the 14th for all Manhattan community board members about working with transgender and gender non-, conforming communities. We already did workshops on race and color, as well as understanding muslim communities and Islamophobia, but we'll be doing all of those again one more time later this month. So if you have not signed up to do one of those yet to participate, please do. Are you recording this daryl? I we're it's the borough president's office. I do not think we are recording it. No, it's a yeah, so anyone can ask whatever question in a safe space. Okay and then there was one last question in the Q&A. I'm sorry, maybe folks know is the sheriff's office a resource for these. The noise issues that we that we've talked about a quick announcement. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know what I'm working. I have a quick announcement, it's really quick yeah. Could you just hold a moment? Okay, the sheriff's office evidently has a role to play in terms of the enforcement on mask wearing in pub and at the at in the open streets, restaurants and and social distancing. I do not think it has a role to play in terms of I could be wrong. I think Fabricio said it has a role to play in terms of dealing with the illegal distribution of fireworks, but in on general noise issues, I'm not so sure that it does have a role to play, but that might be worth looking into. I mean there are not exactly that many sheriffs, but we should find out what it is that they do. Nation go ahead. Nation yeah! I'm here sorry, so I just wanted to say kind of related to what we were just talking about in regards to the task force. The assembly woman carmen De La Rosa, is having a environmental justice day of action as a way to culminate our community cleanups, but instead of just focusing on littering and pollution, we're going to incorporate other environmental factors, including noise pollution. So we're having city agencies come in and discuss that which we're hoping to plant treat like plant flowers throughout the neighborhood, we're hoping to get city harvest and other organizations that work on food deserts to come into the district and possibly provide healthy food. And if you all have any suggestions, I would be happy to take them, because I am the one coordinating the event, but also I just wanted to alert you all to that, because I think it'd be important for us to take part and promulgate it as appropriate. It was supposed to take place this weekend, but we decided that it'd be best to wait until after the jewish holidays. So we have a couple of weeks to continue planning and solidifying. So if you all have any suggestions for organizations we could partner with community groups, that would be interested in participating. I'm happy to take those. Do you work for carmen? Yes, I do. I just started with carmen. Oh very good! Now what did you say just a moment ago that there was there would be something involving the city agencies discussing noise pollution yeah. So we, instead of just focusing on litter and picking up garbage and the issues that have come from that, have like rose to the surface or been exacerbated by the quarantine, we're going to make it more broad and talk about environmental justice overall, which includes noise pollution, transport like adequate transportation, access to healthy food, stable housing and like displacement. So it's so more broad about the environment and like the impact that it has in our community, and we thought that it'd be. This was the most appropriate time to do that because has exacerbated a lot of those issues. So this would be like a zoom event, a public forum. Oh it's going to be still community cleanup. It will be in person. We anticipate that it's going to so the first hour or so, which is where the workshops and the distribution of items are going to happen is going to happen on 185th between audubon and Amsterdam, at yeshiva's plaza and then from there. We're going to break off into groups like that people have chosen to do the activity of their choice. So there'll be an open discussion on these environmental justice issues, including noise pollution, at that at that event, outdoors yeah, that's what we anticipate will happen and did you did you say what the date is or has that been determined? Well, I will get back to you with the exact date we're aiming for the first sunday in September because of the holidays, but we have not done Friday yet the first Sunday in October in yeah October. Sorry, all right yeah definitely get us that information, and maybe, if you, if you have it by the time of the the board general meeting, that would be. That would be a good announcement to make then too, okay, all right. Anything else, all right, very good, all right! So we're going to it's 10:23. The meeting is now adjourned by unanimous by unanimous consent. Thank you, Steve Chanel, I'm emailing you, the Q&A stuff good night.
