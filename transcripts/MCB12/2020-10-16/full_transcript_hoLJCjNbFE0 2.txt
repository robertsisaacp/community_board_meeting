Because I can not, we can not afford to have you go. You know, since we need quarrel, yes, so how was your day so far my day was pretty good. I had school and clubs and stuff so pretty packed, and I have something after this: what a school, what a school are you going to? I got a beacon and I'm a senior huh right. So just to tell you briefly, because I know you knew so all we're going to do is today is we're going to review I'm going to be reading, basically the priority for like every year. We had we go through this process and we propose what we want to advocate for what are the items we want to advocate and we come up with a list of things we review what we have requested last year, the year prior to and then from that. What we do is that we review what has been granted and what has been denied or what remains neutral. So we come up with a list of proposal for the year. In this case, this is going to be for the year 22., and you know this is the time where we're going to be voting. So I'm going to I'm going to try to explain everything very concise as much as possible, but for you and your case, the most important thing is that you vote on the things that you know. You think that you that you consider we usually the committee as a whole they're, usually an agreement because also the things that we agree. You know, I think, all the things that we agree, of course, is just for the for the benefits of the community, but you can decide whether or not you want to support a particular item. So we're going to be we're also going to be ranking then like among the things that we are going to be voting, so we're going to say which one is number one number two. For example, we have in India I I'm going to be proposing several items, and one of them would be like providing funding for new classroom doors to be in compliance with the ADA, which is you know, meaning I do not know if you're aware that and for example, in your house- and this is besides the classroom so in your house- any door that is not there for that. It's any room that it's in the on the fire escape can not that door can not have a lock. You know, because if there is a fire, so that would be a problem, so download can be sued or people you know can may not even escape so in classroom. So they have doors that they need to be sure. The principle the school need to be sure that those doors are in compliance, especially the kind of lack that they use. So there is a particular school that have problems with those doors and their classroom, meaning that if there is a fire, kids can get stuck and they can not exit the the room. So, just to give you an example of the kind of things that we you know we're going to be advocating voting. Actually, while we advocating we also going to have, for example, asking for camarader to be installed in a particular school, we already have a request a few years ago in different schools, because it's important that a school have cameras you know, and unfortunately, in the years that we are, you know witnessing they are a school that they do not have cameras and that's a very sad thing. You know so things like that, but you will hear more. So I hope that by the time you have to leave, you know you will be able to to vote with us anyway. So we have Maria hello Jonathan, we have wildy, so we have one two, hey guys. Yes, thank you so much man hi, I'm here! Yes, hello! Thank you. Let me see my friend is coming.

Let's see, I know our county Paradise has to leave at 755, so let's say 750. so going on the year and the audio of the agenda. So today we're going to be discussing the online item that we have, which is basically the discussion, the annual budget, priority discussion and then we're going to be discussing the the general review and recommendation for the physical Gr21 and fiscal year 22.. Once we discuss our budget priority, we are going to immediately go to when the new and all business in case that anyone may have any announcement on the budget. Precisely, I would like to give you a heads up exactly what to expect how the discussion is going to take place so well. The first thing that we are going to do is that we are going to review the budget, the capital and expensive budget for the fiscal year, 21, meaning all the requests that we put back in October in 2019. It's mirroring 2021.. So today, while we review what we exactly requested and we're also going to find out what the city agency, what the responses are to those requests, once we do that, we're going to be moving to review. What is exactly what we wanted to be advocating for fiscal year, 20 looking at the 22, so we put in the requests on the on the year, 20 October 20, and then it's going to the effect that we want to see on those requests is going to be 22.. Now, while I will review those items, I wanted to tell you- and this is to try to expedite things very fast so in I wanted to say that in the previous year, which is the first thing we're going to review the let's start with the other, the the expensive reviewing the expensive for the expensive and the and the capital for fiscal year 19 last year. So this is what we have. We have several requests in the expensive volume we have four requests and out of those four only two were approved, and then the and the capital we have nine requests and out of those requests, only four were approved, meaning that those that were not approved. They were either need to be resubmitted or they or they were simply deny they were not approved. Now, since I do not know if you had the time to go over the the list of priority, but I want to start with the responses that we have quickly on the expensive budget. For example, let me look at my nose, so we can go quickly over this, so we have on the expensive the priority number 10, which is a request that we put to Increa to increase funding for education for the individualized education plans and the four or five plans for a student that had learning disability and had difficulties. So we actually that request were granted. So the second request that were granted was, I can tell you- was also a funding that needed for comprehensive testing for lead and for lead in water and pain in all these three six. That request also was granted on the expensing iron. Now, on the there was another request which is number three we asked for, which is a priority number 18 asking for funding for class. I reduction. You know that we've been always asking for you know for that particular much needed. You know input. We need the class to be reduced. We do not want 30 kids in one classroom so that remain pending. So the details on that, it's already you know in your email, as I share with you, so the next was. The item number 25 the priority and that also what this is this is. This was asking providing funding to increase support for social, emotional learning skills. They say that we need to contact with the with the border field support office, so this is something that we have to do later on to see exactly, but we can not give up on this because, in particular with the time that we are living, we all discover. You know that the emotions are very high. It's a lot of stress among families. The kids are having problems with the Wi- fi and you name it. You know, kids, that they do not have computers. So this is the number four expensive budget item that will remain painting now remember. This is what we are discussing right now. This is for fiscal year 21 next year, which it's the request that we put last year. Now, that was the expenses let's go to the capital budget, also for the same fiscal year, request that we put last year and they're going to be granted next year in 2021, so the out of that. As I said, we have four and I that was one of the number priority number 16 and that priority we were asking to build a biotech lab at the in research facility for all students in George Washington High school. Unfortunately, they say that needs to be that need to be more a study on this before they granted that so this is spending. So next to that priority we also have priority number 17 and then that's in that priority. We were asking funding to build science, technology, engineer and math, which is also known as a STEM. That's the acronym for that particular item or for that request that was granted out of the nine iron, and this is also for the George Wash for the George Washington. What do you mean? A state library? No excuse me not judge Washington within the district states, so many schools you had to have been able to take advantage of this, because this was approved. The next item was, or priority was 18 priority 18. this one remained neutral because the requesting here was to install green infrastructure such as a bios well to diverse a stone water from the worst system in our community. You just give me one second, actually, that priority. No, I need to apologize this. I mark it, but this is not a word just the last one that I want. I want to go back to the last one, which is the 17 that was approved. That was the Ds-10. Let me go to 1722 priority, which that's exactly what I meant to share that was to provide funding for new elevator at George Washington this. If you've been in George Washington, you know those elevators. This is trouble. It's the people rather walk. Fourth floor, whatever floor, they need to and not take those elevator because they can stop in the middle of nowhere and you get luck in there, so that particular request was denied and remember. These are the capital. Now, following that request, we had the request number 31, which is. We were asking also for George Washington School, a discussion on campus that they renovate the gym that was built in 1969. This still like. Oh my god. This is all that many all the other. Many of you guys. This request unfortunately, was denied as well, so the next two, which is a priority 34 renovation of the interior for the science lab at health and careers and science, which was basically the school that they wanted to shut down. So that was granted good and the next item, which is priority, number 35. We actually were asking funding to expand computed the computer lab at the same school that was also granted. I think we're doing our homework guys, and the very last is the item number for priority number 43 in which also for George Washington. We asked for the h B a c which is the air conditioning to be upgraded, but that request was not granted. Unfortunately, it was denied now, among this all this item that I just share with you. They are one two three. There are four items that belongs to prior, I think, is belong to fiscal year, 18 that we were continuously Putin or how do you call requesting over and over and over so at least the the one that is providing funding to renovate an upgrade classroom at that school. That one was granted the rest, which was let's see here. That was the only one that was granted among those that we are pending. The rest, 43 did, I say, no actually 44. That was the last one. Yes all right, so, as I said out of 9:4, where capital out of nine capital requests, four were granted and beside those that had a number a number assigned. There were also other four that belongs to prior year, 20 nine 2018 two of them were granted. So this is about what we did last year now, let's review here. I wanted to touch base very briefly about something that Maria brought up at the meeting on Tuesday and Maria. I wanted to tell you that I, when I went over in detail about the ranking that the committee did for you, know in our priority. So I wanted to tell you that when it comes to the expensive item, for example, I find out that many of the ranking some of them they were sort of a kind in some instance, for example in the social and the emotional request that we put we've ranked that number four and the board ranked number 25. in class size reduction. We we with ranking number two and the board rank it number 18.. So that's not so bad it. You know, and very last one just to reason, to bring a few example and the ranking for and the and the request for the individualized education plan that was, approval was granted. That was our number one item in the expensive last year and they rank in number 10. So it was not that bad all right. So. Finally, before I go into the next set a proposal for the foreign capital, expensive capital and expensive budget priority for fiscal year, 2020 2022, do you have any questions so far of the things that I have discussed it? If you do, please feel free to do so. Can you hear me yeah? We can hear you no questions, no question. Okay, Jonathan Maria, no questions! I guess all right questions, hey miriam hi, say hello Millian! This is our cali million, so million just say your name and your last name. So just for the record, Mariam James, Marion James is present. Thank you. Museum. You're! Welcome! Wonderful! Thank you all right, so I was saying if anyone has any questions so media, since you did not join since the beginning, or maybe you have, but I have not noticed you yeah, I was. I was here- oh great, so my apologies for not acknowledging you before that's okay, but thank you for definitely for being with us. Okay, you're welcome. I wanted to say that I'm trying to see if we can pack everything by eight o'clock, because one of our cali have to leave by 7.50 and I'm trying, since I already and along with the boa, sending all this information, I'm sure that you have review it all. So all I'm doing is just basically to reinstate what we already know publicly, because this is probably record and of course we need to do our homework so, but I do like to ask you then, before we go into the new section for the for the for the new priorities that we're going to be voting on? Hopefully so do you are you? Do you have any proposal? Any item that you would like the committee to consider it? No, I do not. This question is for everybody. If you have it, because I had several that I wanted to propose. I do not know if you have any item that you, if you do not have any iron now, but I do have and the probably hearing that the boy is going to have so you can also come up with any new. You can add it up anything that you may not be ready to to share with us tonight, so you will have that opportunity as well. So I have something to ask you. Maybe please not. Maybe you do go ahead. You said that you have additional items that you want to add, but we do not have many members of the you know of our committee online that I can see. So how would you propose to you know to get support for whatever items you want to add? I think we have enough unless the ones that you are talking about are super priorities. So, let's maybe you can tell us what are you talking about and then I'm about to, but I I'm about to, I need to leave. I have another meeting I can not say for until a I you know I need to cut off. By being, I understand. Okay, I'm wondering if we have a list, yes of items already and now you're saying that you have something else, and so I would like to hear well when I explain to you, everything is going to come crystal clear to you. Okay, when I, when we communicate via our email, I exactly ask you that feel free to bring any item that you may want to add for this year. What I just already discussed with you it's what we requested last year, that has been some of them has been granted or not so those that need to be that we need to put it again or request it. You know we're not going to give up on those, but we're going to inquire about the or we're going to follow up on the suggestion that, on the response, based on the responses that the agency gave us, but considering that this is a new year and new additional needs have just arrived, those need some of them. I send it to all of you in an email, but all that I'm asking right now, if you have, if you, if you want to propose any item, fine other than that, I'm going to tell you what I wanted this committee to consider it, and those and based on those proposals that I that I wanted to share with you is that we're going to be voting immediately. You got it Mario yeah. Well, I'm listening. I just wanted to know what are the ones that you want to add, because let me just get you a question about the class size reduction. Yes, that was already approved right last for last year class size reduction, which is undispensed. The number two I have to. Let me see. Let me go back to this. Yes, suspension reduction school district said. Yes, I think that was one of the one e no actually no class size reduction, Class Sas reduction. What well. Basically this is the. What the let me, let me read what the agency said. So this is the island. Let me see this is on page 259, plus I okay. This is what the agency said. Omb supports the agency's position as follow. The ddoe provides all schools with funds to maintain class size class side as specified in DOE dash uft contracts and the Chancellor of regulation, meaning that the budget that between the the union and the Deloitte received this is a matter between them. Basically, and then they add principles have discretion within these limits and function provide to establish class. I, which best serve the student population, meaning this is a matter between them. The agency can not decipher the school. This is something that the D- o- e okay, so I understand no, I get I get that so why are we keeping that in first of all, with the pandemia, the classes, these the classes are going to be reduced, no matter what we say, and it should be at the discretion of the principle to you know to, as I said, whatever class okay. So what I want is no need. There is no need to go again. That's not going to be included on our list exactly okay, exactly okay, exactly maybe I explained in too fast, but no I do not. Another thing is that on the the spin side, you're saying that for Ps 128, you need to provide funding for 100 new ipad. Now, how many students do we have in that school? And what are you referring? Who is going to get? Let's say that they do come up with a hundred. You know what good is that going to be when we have about 600 students on that at school? Well, this is one of the principle that I was in contact with, among many others, and this are there a specific needs that they have for their students? Okay, no, I okay! So if you have a discussion, but then I have a problem with that, how are they going to pick and choose and that? I think that what by having us saying going along with students or the principal saying, I need a hundred more or 100 additional. Is that going to be sufficient for the for the school? So I think that we can say we need. You know we need ipad enough. I Ipod for the you know to cover whatever ps128, but nobody else do not tell them a hundred. Do not specify a hundred because they're going to come with a 55 only. So I think that we should leave that up. Well, I think that is a short it that you say showed it and not. Well, they can't say anything and remember they. This is what they need. They need funding to buy those things. I have a problem when the school have more than 100, you know students and how are they going to okay? Let's say that there is a lot because they are short. That is a short that is a shorted on that. No wait! A second listen to me. This is not it yeah. My problem with that is that there's not going to be enough ipad for everybody, so the the teacher arbitrarily could pick who does she or he you know, give the ipad to so. There are some students that may need it and they are going to be overlooked and there are the students that do not need it and they may get it. That's my point, so I do not okay, 7:30 7, 30 and one on our member have to leave. But let me it's a good point because I understand you have your doubts. You have your concerns and that's fine. Now this is what they say that they need the reason why they need it. I can not go. I can not right now give you an answer. All I know, and the way they explain to me is that these are these are the items that they need. They need funding to buy those computers, but I might my problem fee is the number 100 I do not think we should tell them that they need 100. We should say all right. Okay, we can. We can all the way go. Okay for that particular school, all right, but here's the thing we have the freedom okay to shape this, because when we're going to, as for this funding, we do not have to necessarily specify a hundred. This is what he say. The principal say that they need, but we can't say that we asking for funding for them to buy the computers that they need and the chromebooks that they need, because these are two things that they agree, that the 100 number is going to be left out. Yes, we agree if the majority agreed on this, I have a, but I understand I had a problem with the 100 and that's it so well that you alone that has problem, but you know that's what they specify. All I do is take. No and present it to the committee, I can not take it, I mean I can. I can not take any of this word. I just precisely write down what they tell me or what they told me and then pass it to you if you do not want to say that they need a hundred ipods and they need a hundred Kron's book. I understand you have all the right in this world to these believers fame. What is the difference before between a hundred and unknown numbers? I want to be clear: yeah we can not get stuck in this conversation. We need to move, but I understand- and I respect that, but we're going to definitely we can. We can elaborate more on this. Now. Let me ask you something: when the time to vote, would you agree that they need funding? Can you at least know that they need funding to buy computers, but this is just to cut the discussion. What I would like to say suggest to you to leave the number 100 and said: okay, we need the 100 for now, if, depending on the rest of the committee saying because it's not yes but at work- alice, our colleagues when the time of voting comes we're going to specify that that's actually an amendment without even we do not have emotion yet on the table. But this is something that you are looking into it. Let's see what the rest of the cali have to say, because I understand what you might be in disagreement. Maybe the rest of them are not, but that's what they said and I understand you have a valid point and you know you have all the right to be in the sub women, because this is your opinion, but this art, you know, information that they gave it to me. So, but I understand Malia, and I thank you for that now Maria and I wanted to repeat for last sign, so anybody else has anything to suggest for the for the other option. Do you have any item that you would like for this committee to consider it in advocating for the fiscal year 22? No, I have said: oh no go ahead. Paradise, you want something you have something to say. I do not know. Oh no, I was just saying I did not have anything. Sorry go ahead, so I have a suggestion. I actually think that we should request. If I do not know if it's possible, I can't remember if it falls on the capital or expense, but I believe it will fall in the capital. Is it looks like capital, but maybe expensive, it's potentially to try to get to give Wi- fi or something like that or stipends to like all the district, six families? Okay, yeah, that's very important because that has been one of the yeah. We can request service for that. The kids have access to what five funding for wifi, so they parents do not have to pay, for which actually was something that very much worried. Then a lot of parents they liked. How do you call the services they could not pay and that's why? All over the summer DOE and many folks, even ourselves, our committee, we were advocating for a spectrum and verizon to kindly you know, give them some kind of incentive for providing Wi-, fi free, of course, at least because of the pandemia and the situation that you know, many students or families found themselves a lot of parents. They are unemployed and they can not. They can not pay. You know for the Spectrum service. Yes, I think we. I think that would be a good item to add. So, yes, I think that should be on the expense yeah. That is expense. Yes, asking for funding for Wi- fi right. I'm writing Wi- fi service. You can you can. We can only restructure this request, but so far, I'm writing that requesting funding will increase funding, because I already receiving funding DOE for to provide Wi- fi services to students in districts in industry. Six: okay, yes, yeah regarding this Wi-, fi or internet connection, so I also hear motion from t- mobile where they say that they will provide one. Let me see a hundred thousand free internet connection, but all around United States, but I do not know what is the criteria to pick those person but the option. I think I can inquire on that. Yes, we can inquire on that yes and find out. That would be very helpful because it's a lot of students that need that you know services or local services huh, it's good to know what is the criteria they have to select those. What would be the requirement right? Yes? Well, that's one of your area, I'm sure that, for you would be a piece of cake now that you brought up that you know on the table. Yes absolutely so that would be pretty much something that you may want to inquire. I'm willing to do so, but definitely knowing that this is one of your expertise. That would be great if you can. Actually, since you brought up the subject, maybe you wanted to also go into this. What did anything else? I really like what you just brought up. This is very important. We need this, and if we can get what Jonathan has said, that would be been fantastic because we can send we can if we can find any offer for the students to have assets either low cost, I mean low or lower cost, or even free. That would be much better. Anybody else, all right. So I'm sorry Jessica on the spend side from last year from the budget last year and the number one from this list that inclusion for individualized education programs for tutoring students with learning disa difficult difficulties is not that mandatory that it's called you know the department of education provides them. Do we have to ask for them to provide one? Can you set again Maria the item and the expensive students with learning disabilities? Yeah? That's the iep, yes yeah! So why are we having that here? I think that was. I think that was granted okay, so that's how okay that was granted. That was one of the yeah that was granted all right, good. That was granted and let me, let's see, let's see, I think that was granted- that was from the school increase of 501c testing. Also was granted yeah that was granted money and that's priority number ten and the tracking number is the one ending in two and one ten. Yes, that was granted okay good all right, so we only have 10 minutes to go over the the remaining discussion for the 10 minute, because Paradise has to leave and without her we will not have Quorum. So now I would like to propose. There are several schools that have serious problems, and this is the one that, besides other, of course, that their problems actually resemble the entitled districts. As you probably remember, the problem with cameras, we have a school that they do not have camera, and this is something that is highly important and one of the school that is having that problem is the Ps128. So I wanted to share with you, at least among the problems that I found, and this is my proposal for you. I have a list of few things. Listen carefully. What I'm about to say, I would like to propose or for your consideration that we that we as funding to increase. Let me start. Let me start. Let me start for yeah providing funding for new classroom doors in compliance with aid with ADA this ps128 in the classroom, the door, the the door locks or the handles. They need funding for those doors. Those doors are not in compliance with the estate mandates and they need funding. This is one of the item that I wanted to provide, and I think this is very important. I was telling what is her name paradise about. Cal is that this is like, for example, you know if you and in a regular apartment, if you have a room where the fire escape is located, so that particular room you can not have a door with a regular lag that do not have to have just. How do you call the lag has to be the handle have to be without any lag, so you can have assets opening and closes anytime, but you can not lock it with a key or use key to. I mean that particular door, so the same thing happened in classroom, so I do not specifically know more about the problem with the handles. But what I know, which is more important, is that those doors lag handles are not in complying with the estate regulation and they need to be changed. How many of them are then? No, they just told me the classroom. I do not know it because it's the wall or I do not know the reason why so this is one of the items that I wanted to propose. I also looking into that. They are. There is a cafeteria in Ps28. 28 is the school that is located in 120 and 150 fifth street and that particular school. What they asking is funding for air conditioning they also, they also are asking what is the other item that they were asking? Okay? Oh. They also mentioned that if we can add providing for a asking for funding or to increase the funding for parents that our english language learning, which we call the E L E, S, l and even as well as other for s, I mean E, S, O L for other. You know english learners. So if we can ask funding for those folks, so they can, they can have access to classroom or they can take classes, because many schools provide esl classes, but if they, if they can provide, also follow the languages, for example, people who speak italian or who speaks Chinese and they want to learn English, so they wanted to they say. Maybe your boy should consider asking funding, so they can provide Cbo's organizations and even in the schools you know for the so the PTA or the parents Association can actually and decide. They can request all that. So what I'm saying basically, is that that we should ask for for funding, to provide to implement more programs or increase the programs where parents and many folks that does not speak English, so they can they can they can learn. That would be too. I also wanted to george Washington Judge Washington, one two. They asking for the library to be to be remodeling so needs to be remodeling, so we would like to ask for that one proposing that the same school, let me see well, they also mentioned funding for the lab remodeling, but I think that this I'm going to leave it, I'm not going to I have to I have to. I will consider that to review this, because I am not really sure now. The following is a list that I have for Ps 128, which is the school that is in front of cougars. That school has a lot of problems, and some of the problem is that they need funding to. They need their bathroom to be renovated. They are in a very bad condition. They also need funding for security cameras. They need cameras in which part of the their school- I do not recall, but they need cameras to be installed. They also need to upgrade the auditorium seating, the sitting and that school are really broken and they're falling apart. The same thing is happening with Ps28 the Wright Brothers school, which is 155th, so these two schools are having the same problem. Another item will be for the 128 is to provide funding, to give me just one second, to upgrade the lightning at the stage the estate lining and also the exterior lining in the auditorium. They need the lightning to be changed another. They also are asking for to provide funding for a condition, and that needs to be upgraded. That's will be capital and they also need funding for, let's see here, provide funding for electrical upgrade in the entire building. I do not know how possible that is going to be, but the things that is happening within is that the light goes soft constantly, and sometimes they have to restart the other computers. They lose informations, and you know how it is when you are working in your computer in the ligos off. Is that happening ever happened to you have to start all over again. So this is a problem that they are phrasing constantly yes, Maria on Ps128. I know for sure that they built a part of that school. So you are telling me that when they were building the back side of the school meaning facing what is the Autobahn Avenue and what they think they did not go around and check all the needs of the others, the other side of the school, and I think that we should condense all this requirement. There's too many little scenes here when they should be doing an engineering study of the entire school ps128 that will take care of the air condition, the security cameras and the auditorium, and things like that. Instead of you know, specifying line by line who is going to scare the life out of the people who are going to vote on that. So I suggest that we condense the needs for the schools, because these are capital you're talking about capital budget, that they should do a study, a of the entire, the building, the Ps 128 buildings and comply with whatever requirement engineers requirement for the entire school as opposed to, because that school is two parts you remember they used to have like a parking space acrosss the street. They have some classrooms and the other. So I you know I'm trying to just make it a little more easy for them to say you know yes to us as opposed to saying no to one two, three four or five. I do not know if the other members agree with me, but I think that we should be. You know: tithing tighten their responsibility instead of giving them an opportunity not to go over the auditorium, the door. You know the handles or the doors is like that. Those things should be an engineering study that they had to make you know. So I do not know. I do not know what you think about it, but you'll think about it. For a little. You know a few minutes or maybe all the members can chipping on this thing, but I think that remember we're going to prioritize these things right, but that's what I know so basically Maria you're, trying to say that you want to consolidate, like all the all of these asks into one kind of like budget item. You know, because I mean doing like line by line you know auditorium. The seats are broken. If the auditoriums I mean is the entire auditorium, they have to look at, they have to look at the doors, all the doors, not only few doors, all the doors they should be upgrading exactly air conditioned. Everybody should be able to have air condition, not just few rooms and the others are not yeah. I mean, I hope, that you follow what I'm trying to say. No absolutely, and let me tell you my Mariah some of these items, that's what I said at the beginning of this conversation that the problem that one school has is also mirroring other school as well like the problem with the camera. I remember that I won. I do not remember the fiscal year, but I remember clearly that I was at the cec at that time, where we request the camera to be installed in the entire. You know school district pending that you know the DOE will do an assessment and find out exactly which a school has no camera, which I provide that information, because I went to school by schools- and I spoke at that time. You know with principal and that's when I requested that I requested I put the request in both the cc and also the at the board that the school must be. You know to install camera in your school, but yes, what you just said Maria! I wanted you just to conclude or re- estate, basically that some of these problems not only the same problem, one Ps, 120, Ps 128, has is also the same problem that Ps28 another school in the district has you know I may have so. This is something that since I, since I, while I'm sitting here, know that what I am telling you is happening, this particular school- that I am that I am proposing for your consideration. You know so I'm sure that at the end, when it comes to the final public hearing, there's going to be iron and there that perhaps may have to have to be, how do you call revise it because of the information like, for example, with the 100 laptop and then chromebooks that we just discussed it so things like that, it has to be probably revised, although we might going to be voting in those things, but I I'm planning to promote when I call the motion that definitely on those priority we're going to just specify that not the number. If the Kalis, you know decide that we should leave the number out, but just asking for funding for the particular needs, which is they have the need of chrome's books and also ipads. So what I am proposing here is see we I'm on, and I actually I have a list of 15 capital items and I wanted to read all of them and then we go into if it's possible. I do not. I do not think we're going to have the time. It's only six minutes to eight o'clock, but I wanna also at least for the record, because this is going. This is going to be, I mean it's been recorded and we can always go and revise this conversation so, for example, and Ps 28. They also are asking for to provide funding to start to install 14. Look how specific they are forty new air conditioning and conditioners for classroom. So that means that they have 14 classrooms, that they that do not that do not have that they do not have air conditioner, and this is something similar exactly like the ipad, like you just mentioned, they also Ps28, is also asking for funding to upgrade the light and the sound system in the auditorium. Let's see what other, let's see, what other all other requests these are. The these are basically actually not 13, not 15.. These are only 13 capital items, but I just read to you. I know we may not have the time to to vote to go over the priority, but if we can pick at least two or three or five priorities, it will be fine. Now do I have any question before I move to the these. Are the capital item that I am proposing this community to consider for the school ps128, Mps, 28 and also looking at some of this item, also are looking to do the entire district in the case of camera. I think still, that is a lot of school that they still they have no camera. We can revise that particular request and asking that Canada be installed in all the schools that still do not have camera. You understand. Are we together on this all right? So so you are going to put the whole thing together and then the day of the gender meeting. Or do you want us to vote on the concept? I think that we should be able to vote on the comp set that you are explaining to us and then at the general meeting I mean you your ranking for us and then at the general meeting we can go. You know take a few seconds few minutes to approve fully our rankings because we do not have you know you do not have you know that much time to no, we do not, but I think that we can do something here that is going to be very important. Yeah. Okay, I'm just going to quickly read this the expenses budget. I do not go priority. What is the pro the proposal? So let's go on the expense quickly, because I know, let me see Paradise you're about to leave right yeah. I do have to leave soon. I'm sorry, let's see, if we can, we can. We borrow 10 minutes from you. Maybe no. If it's not it's okay, I guess that we have to do it. No, you did more than enough and I truly apologize, but we should be. We should be done in 10 minutes. I really hope so just quickly, but again, if you have to leave you just exit and I will stay for five more minutes. Okay, let's see if we can practice quickly so Maria, so we're going to just prioritize quickly. Let me read to you and the rest of you not to you about the rest of our calories, exactly what I am proposing in terms of the expensive item and the it's the capital that I just read to. You are a total of 13., but perhaps not all of them. We might be able to prioritize them, but we're going to just highlight few of them and just vote on it now and the expansive. What we, what we are asking is to the suicide prevention asking for funding to prevent the increase of suicide prevention among kids and teens and shelter experiencing isolation and dealing with grief, I'm not sure if our Kali Steve Simon have something similar I have not, but as since we represent the youth population students. I think this is something that goes with us at the general meeting. We can always change this now. We also, I also wanted to suggest if we can possibly ask for providing funding for, to help the Lgbtq youth to cope with anxiety and stress during this copy pandemic. I think this is something very important to you know to advocate, for why are we so? Why are you selecting the that specific group of people as opposed to all the kids? All the students are going to the 636 yeah. All the students are going through the same trauma today because of the coverage. So I, if I were you, I would not vote just for having the Lgbt group. I will advocate for all the students that are realistic. Okay, all right, we never does that. Let's move forward. Thank you, Malia all right. I crossed that all right and keep that in mind we're going to be voting on that, so the nets that we have so individualized we do not have to we do not have to. We do not have to go to the that was granted individualized education funding. So that's out class I is it's: are we willing to continue with class size? There's no need for that? Okay, so the next is going to be funding for a comprehensive test that was also granted, and this was from previous year now. What I wanted to what I wanted to ask is for provide funding for mental health programs to help families and children in district 12 affected by coffee, but again that request mental health programs, mental health programs meanings one needs a psychology, psychiatry funding should be available for this kind of population and very last, as I said, I really wanted to the Esl program, which is expensive but expensive item. So now, among those things that I mentioned, I wanted to rank him then quickly should we ranking, then we may have to rank in Dango. This is something that we may Maria. Well, you know, can we say the camera might be like yeah? Well, this is yeah, but I think I think the mental, since we just heard on the news that the issue with the pandemic is growing, it may come back in a different way. We have to make sure that we get the funding for those programs that we need for mental health yeah. I think your mental health should be definitely not sure yourself could go to the bottom. You know it's not a priority, but the emotional, the learning and the you know the assistant to the families and the things should be priority number one or two, but the other members of the you know are here: they can, you know say so they can just say guys what Marian's saying that we should give priority. Well, they already heard you do you consider that what Maria is saying everything that has to do with the stimulate or at least help the mental stage of you know our families, young people? It should be like priority. What did you say? You proposed priority number one Maria. I would say that I was. I definitely think that we heard the number, so it's about mental health, providing funding number one. Yes, okay, is this for expenses? What expenses? Yes! So are we all mutually agreeing right now or are we? Are we doing that's what I'm asking discussing got we're discussing? Personally, I think, though I would, I would say, though, the Wi- fi would probably go first, but that's just me and then mental health will go second, but that would be my take. To be honest, but I do, I would say, yeah before no go ahead. I'm sorry waldy! No, it's fine! I would say I think I mean again as Maria mentioned right like if things are increasing and things are spiking and you know school would then would likely remain virtual. So, therefore, if the school is remaining virtual, then access to Wi-, fi and things to that degree are necessary. So, okay, but well my mind. I think the Wi- fi should be number one. So Wi- fi number one. Okay! Let me let me tell Paradise something Paradise. I know you have to leave right now, but maybe what you wanted to suggest would you agree and can we take at the time of voting? Would you agree with the recommendation that the committee is going to decide or you wanted to just remain, like neutral abstain on the decision that the community take as a whole? Oh well, go ahead! Parliament! Sorry! No! It's fine! So the committee's agreeing that Wi- fi should be first or second yeah. What I'm trying to yes, yeah what I wanted to say since you have to leave we're going to agree and the rest of the the priority we're going to rank him then, and we're going to vote. I wanted to know if you will be willing to go with the what the majority goes. Oh, you rather esteem in and you know so we can yeah yeah. No, I! Yes, I would be willing to go with what the majority is saying. What am I going to say all right, you know I will consult then this. So what you are saying is definitely you agreed to go with what the majority with the decision that the majority takes yeah. Okay, so I will consult this also with our parliament, Parliamentarian James, so to make sure that if we can count your when at the time of voting, although you not here- but at least you have said it- you have expressed yourself in advance that you will be in agreement with what the majority, what the majority and you know, of the quality side as a whole for her information before she leave Paradise. You still have the choice of voting ranking when we go to the full board. Your number, you know whatever priority you have, you have to go through. Whatever we decide today, we are just sending a message, giving the information how the committee you know, discuss about it. So you are right to make a decision at the end you know see, but what happened is what happened is that I'm not sure. I think that we are good in terms of the courtroom, but because it's miriam actually it's with us and I think it's still with media and we can have quota, but if she exit at the time of voting, we may not have borrowed it's just that. I do not want her to go away. Thinking that maybe I should not have done this and that she still has no. I explained to her, I explained to her and I gave her choice and I said also that we're going it's not that we're taking this as a face value. This is something that we're going to discuss is with Jane Berlin just to make sure, but we are still whoever is. He is going to if we have Quorum, we will have Quorum if we do not have Quorum, but you know at the general meeting. This is going to be the final. That's the final conclusion, but let's move forward because we need to move: go ahead, buy Paradise. I know you have to go. I know you've been trying to leave. Okay. Thank you. So much situation, you know, so I got ta move, go all the place at for another. Yes, so I also pulled on this on this first modder put in the internet connection through Wi- fi on first play all right and on the other, Google play. Okay, good, okay, right, you know the other questions and orders. I will go with the majority decision. All right and if I have a show, is during my meeting, so I will also fix anything okay, so let's say then that Wi- Fi is going to be. We all agree that it's going to be number five and then mental health or related mental health would be number two like, for example, programs. What about this is this is the expenses that we are looking at of course, so, let's see do not forget the ipad. That would be well the ipads. Let's presume that this is going to be expensive. Yes, the ipads, so I passed. I guess that would be number three. They really need this and chromebooks. I think that should be number three yeah he's priority, all right and Maria or the rest of you. What else should we consider? Let me see funding increase for emotional and learning social and emotional learning. I think that was granted well, that would be. Maybe we can consider. Should we consider emotional learning number four, maria and Talis, but I think that may be taken care within the program for the mental health, mental health. Well, that may go along with it yeah. What do you say? Media medium? Yes, I'm I would say my opinion is mental health should be first because if their mental health is good, they can't it's not good. How can they use Wi- fi? How can they? How can they learn if their mental health is bad, which I'm seeing a lot up here? A lot of the mental health here up indictment in the dyches area is not good at all, so I'm going to I'm going to throw I'm going to throw one back at you. Miriam that's cool, but, like my take, is that like to even get access to mental health services, you're likely going to need Wi- fi, you know what I mean, because you're likely going to do stuff through telemedicine and Telehealth and Et cetera, Et cetera. So I think- and I think what you're saying yeah it's like yeah and I get what you're saying too. But if a kid is really going bonkers and their parents are doing the same thing. They're not going to be their capability of signing on to Wi-. Fi is not good at all. I've seen it I've, I'm working my butt off here in this community since March, and I have seen it trust me now. I feel you. I feel so basically like this tool to keep in mind like these. Are. These are just our like right, like suggestions right, so we do not all have to like agree to each perspective like line item and like how, where they fall, I mean. Essentially, we should have built consensus, and this is what we're doing right now and then, ultimately, like the board at large later, would agree to all these budget request items and so like, and I hear you completely, I kind of, and you make you make all this sense. I just. I just think that, if like, if we have, you know like, I think that we know that these first two items go top two we just have to. I guess you know yes, really, maybe through a popular vote like decide whether which one would go first, which won't go second and that could yeah, but you also want to consider that kids may be disturbed. You know if they do not have the white fat, they can get sick. It's all very, like it's very connected. They will not have mental disability, knowing that they can not do their homework or whatever. But you know yes, I think you both can. I have a point: can I tell you what I've seen visiting houses at my own risk? Yes, throwing chromebooks against the wall? Well, that's a mental health problem. That's a mental issue! Yes, all right, all right! So guys what the majority said we go. So, let's just re- estate, we said at the beginning that Wi- fi should be number one and anything related to mental health is going to be priority. Number two chromebook ipad. That should be probably number three. I do not know if you wanted to revise or go back to what our cali you know, Median is saying, or the majority want to keep your position in which we say that number Wi- fi is number one and mental health is number two. May I say something, and I agree you know I I'm sensitive to the issue that miriam is talking about Wi- fi for the entire system, those that have mental problems and those that are. You know, you know, okay, they need the Wi- fi. So I mean that is really a. I mean for me. That would be a priority. The mental you know issues have to be dealt at a different level and I think that we have to go step by step media. So just I just it's not I'm not disagreeing with you totally, but I think that Wi- fi is really it's imperative that we all our students. I have it okay, and I, and I, and I hear what you're saying, but all right a lot of the people. A lot of the people have not had mental problems until the until this Covid-19. It's not all these people. All the people do not have mental problems all the time. This Covid-19 is driving people to this right. All right. Let's not dwell on this issue because we're supposed to you know, move forward. We have more to come so one day. I want to give you the last word and turn off this. So should we continue on Wi- fi number one health number two and ipads and chromebook number three or we should just reverse it as a result of medium comments. Number four is for the esl: did you agree Esl and E- S-, O- l? I should be number four number: four: okay, yes! Well, what exactly esl remind me so you're trying to extend bilingual services outside of Spanish so like other languages, yeah Esl, for example, in this history, because this receives most of the besides English? It's a spanish so, but we also wanted to looking in the overall picture that not only the DOE provide funding for Esl, but also for other people that they speak, perhaps Chinese or Italians, and so forth. We have a choice that we can advocate for other people, language, besides spanish or just esl. You know you know for non- english speakers, so okay got it got it, but we have to specify that is for district six. Okay, so maybe if we wanted to be industry, sixteen, because the needs is everywhere yeah and we wanted yourself for families with you know: children in family and children. Let me repeat that to you: yes, families with children in school, not just for adults, because now we're going to the aging and the senior committee. No, absolutely it's! In fact. It's one individual! If for individuals lacking the language, yes Esl, but let's be more specific, as you have provided families and with children, families with children, families and children, no without children, we do not want any only foreign families all right, because they all learn together in these three six should we should. We add it up and specifically industry six, because if we specify this research, that means that the Cbo's and in this reception, family, okay, all right, okay, so esl, okay, additional funding for or increase funding for, Esl programs for families, youth and children is that has is. Did you agree with that? That's what I said. Okay, so that's what I wrote while you're good with that yeah I'm! Okay! With that, I had another suggestion. Actually this is an added suggestion. Is there anything or can we advocate around, like kind of like, I would say, day, care or something day care slash after school care or something to that degree after school programs? Right, because I know that there's a lot of funding cuts towards. I think that after school program, they already provided funding, but we can continue asking for the coming years and all this also that goes on there under the estate mandate, we are doing a part of this city malia, we won't be able Jonathan have to leave. We have to do me two of me too, but I'm you know. Thank you very much. For that, can we can we okay, so we have so what was the last one that we say what after school program, we already have funding for after school yeah? I'm thinking like the daycare type thing right like I do not know if it falls. This is I mean it's youth per se, but like it does not fall necessarily under education, but like kind of providing funding towards families that need access more access to like daycares and stuff like that, because as people good all right go back to work like child care programs right, yeah, child care, that's very important: okay, child care, after school program and child care. Well, these are two different things after school program and child care, but I think you could lump it in one if not and there's a summaries point right like if it's a state thing for after school. Let's make that number fine sure, okay yeah! Well, they related because Barry who may work late, you know who have probably scheduled they may they may need extended. You know child care service, yes, so, and while they have that extend in child care, for example, kids can have us after school problem as well. Yeah. To be honest, I think I would put that above the esl. But that's just me. I do not know how everybody else would yes, all right, so, okay, so that would be being our number five. Is that it that's fine, that's fine in Jonathan Media, yes, child care and after school program number five. Yes, all right so, and the okay! These are the the expensive. So can we then, let's see we have not actually in the in the and the capital? Yes, which priority? Are we going to give to the to the camera into the auditorium and to the ADA? You know: funding for classroom doors, engineering study for all those, because that's what they had to do, that in combination. They had to go through that school and look at everything in instead of individual one by one and now they should take care advantage that the schools are not being used all the time they can. They have the time to go over and do an assessment until they can. You know correct all those you know problems that they have and it's not only ps2 128. They should do it to all the schools all right. So what we're saying thing is that we are going to be voting okay. What about? Can we consider at least the the ADA? That really worries me, the the complaint about the door locks handle that's very important, because this is about ADA complain. I mean compliance. It's called this is very serial things. I think that they really. We really need to look into this and the issue with cameras as well. We need cameras, so may I give it back. I really want it I want I really wanted to. I do not know about the ADA compliant, but if someone walks into a school with a gun, I would rather have a lack. That would be that I could. This is a compliance maria, whether you like it or not, this these are compliance they have to. I do not know how this is the classroom. These are the classrooms, but they're George, all the schools, it's not only in one school. It should be in all this that discussion we need to. We can not further elaborate much on that, because that's a matter of opinion here. All of what we want is whether we wanted to ask for funding or increase funding, so they can correct that problem, so they the classroom, can be in compliance. That's all we ask in here I understand and how you feel yes, absolutely I'm saying that it should be all these schools. My point is that in all the schools, noting only one well, this is the school that happened to tell us Maria all the school. I do not know what other school we can say in district. Six, but you know okay, I do not know how other people feel, but I think they all should be in compliance with everything, you're right. Okay, I have to leave okay. Let's call this promotion, then Maria, okay, this is what is going to happen. We're going to vote on our expensive priority, the capital we're going to. I guess, to take a range check on this because we're not going to have full room. No, I do not think we had a man that many disagreements. It's just that. I want to make sure that we are. We advocate we lobby for all the schools equally, not for some and not the others. That's my point. That's great! No! I understand I will abide by the rest of the members. I do not want to monopolize this thing. You know with all due respect. No you're, not you know to all the everybody has a voice here. You have your strong opinion as usual, but that's okay, you're entitled to that. That's what my mother said. That's what my mother said. That's my mother's day! No we're good we're good! So anyway, unfortunately, we do not have that time, and I promised my cali that we're going to enter this by either club, but anyway we already have the priorities for the expensive and let's call it for now that if you agree, I think the the ADA compliance. In my opinion, that should be number one, that's my opinion and I think the camera should be number two. If you agree with it remember at the general meeting of the public hearing, this is going to be something different. This is our priority and we can always vote again over there and change this. I for one will say I will. I will assert your recommendations, do what you were ranking and then you know and that's what they committed. You are the chair of the you know the committee. So we have to give you that respect. Well, it's mutual, but I appreciate it all right. So can someone call a motion submission second, okay, Maria? Second, so while they call the motion- yes, okay, what they call the motion and Maria Ii okay now so what we are going to be restating is that they are one two three four five six island that has been ranked priority for Wi- fi number, one: mental health number, two ipad in Crown's, Chrome book song, it's number three esl number, four after school program is going to be. I joined with the with child care and that would that would be our priority number five. We also discussed all the capital item, but we only went able just to label for now at least voting on Ps128, the ADA compliance door lacks handle number one, and also the cameras is going to be item number two, all right, of course, all in favor, all in favor, aye, all right. All right billion, favor yeah stay floaty among eye, okay, any member of the public. I mean board member. Do we have any board member family? Favoritis Sally was in the Q&A, but she I asked if she was still there, she did not respond. Sadly, oh my god- oh my god, all right. So one two three of 4 and 5: yes, we have Quorum, okay, so the yes has. It is 5, yes and no is zero, so motion pass. I want to thank you guys very much. I know this is a great effort. We will continue. This is yes. Let's say that this conversation will be revised by the board at the general meeting. So, and- and should we say basically that, should we agree since our cali paradise also say that she will go with the with the general with what the general with the rest of the committee with the committee recommendation, I guess that would be another year for us, so we're going to be fine seats, so all right charlize, I want to thank you Malia. Thank you so very much. I know this is what is it for you and I know you're a woman of very strong opinion. I feel the same way a time, not all the time, but I like to speak when I had to go to another meeting, I'm late for my other meeting goodbye. Why did Jonathan? Thank you. So much. No problem have a great one guys by the way, by the way, Maria guys well, whoever is still in there. I just wanted to say that in the new business we need to remember that on November, 9 is going to be our forum and youth homelessness. This is the discussion that is coming next on November 9., so meeting then, and now is officially. The meeting is adjourned at 8:20, a pm, waldy Jonathan and the rest of you. Thank you so much.
