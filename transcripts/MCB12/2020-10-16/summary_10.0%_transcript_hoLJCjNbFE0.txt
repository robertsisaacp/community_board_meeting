Several items, and one of them would be like providing funding for new classroom doors to be in compliance with the ADA, which is you know, meaning I do not know if you're aware that and for example, in This is besides the classroom.
There is a particular school that have problems with those doors and their classroom, meaning that if there is a fire, kids can get stuck and they can not exit the the room.
Just to give you an example of the kind of things that we you know we're going to be advocating voting.
Actually, while we advocating we also going to have, for example, asking for camarader to be installed in a particular school.
First thing that we are going to do is that we are going to review the budget, the capital and expensive budget for the fiscal year, 21, meaning all the requests that we put back in October in 2019.
Now, since I do not know if you had the time to go over the the list of priority, but I want to start with the responses that we have quickly on the expensive, budget.
We have on the expensive the priority number 10, which is a request that we put to Increa to increase funding for education for the individualized education plans and the four or five plans for a student that had learning disability and had difficulties.
Let's go to the capital budget, also for the same fiscal year, request that we put last year, And I- that was one of the number priority number 16 and that priority we were asking to build a biotech lab at the in research facility for all students in George, Washington High school.
I think, is belong to fiscal year, 18 that we were continuously Putin or how do you call requesting over and over and over so at least the the one that is providing funding to renovate an upgrade classroom at that school.
You said that you have additional items that you want to add, but we do not have many members of the you know of our committee online that I can see.
I send it to all of you in an email, but all that I'm asking right now, if you have, if you, if you want to propose any item, fine other than that, I'm, going to tell you what I wanted this committee to consider it, and those and based on those proposals that I that I wanted to share with you.
The ddoe, provides all schools with funds to maintain class size class side as specified in DOE dash uft contracts and the Chancellor of regulation, meaning that the budget that between the the union and the Deloitte received this is a matter between them.
Why are we keeping that in first of all, with the pandemia, the classes, these the classes are going to be reduced, no matter what we say, and it should be at the discretion of the principle to you know: to, As, I said, whatever class Another thing is that on the the spin side, you're saying that for Ps 128, you need to provide funding for 100 new ipad.
You know what good is that going to be when we have about 600 students on that at school?
When the school have more than 100, you know students and how are they going to okay?
Might my problem fee is the number 100 Okay for that particular school, Okay to shape this, because when we're going to, as for this funding, we do not have to necessarily specify a hundred.
The principal say that they need, but we can't say that we asking for funding for them to buy the computers that they need and the chromebooks that they need, because these are two things that they agree, that the 100 number is going to be left.
If, depending on the rest of the committee, saying, because it's not yes, but at work- alice, our colleagues when the time of voting comes we're going to specify that that's actually an amendment without even we do not have emotion yet on the table.
Let me start for yeah providing funding for new classroom doors in compliance with aid with ADA.
If we can ask funding for those folks, so they can, they can have access to classroom or they can take classes, because many schools provide esl classes, but if they, if they can provide, also follow the languages, for example, people who speak italian or who speaks Chinese and they want to learn English, Maybe.
Your boy should consider asking funding, so they can provide Cbo's organizations and even in the schools you know for the so the PTA or the parents, Association can actually and decide.
They also mentioned funding for the lab remodeling, but I think that this I'm going to leave it The following is a list that I have for Ps 128, which is the school that is in front of cougars.
They also are asking for to provide funding for a condition, and that needs to be upgraded.
You know decide that we should leave the number out, but just asking for funding for the particular needs, which is they have the need of chrome's books and also ipads.
I think that we should be able to vote on the comp set that you are explaining to us And You know, take a few seconds few minutes to approve fully our rankings, because we do not have That is going to be very important.
I know you have to leave right now, but maybe what you wanted to suggest would you agree, and can we take at the time of voting?
And then, ultimately, like the board at large later, would agree to all these budget request items and So like, Like, I think that we know that these first two items go top two Yes, really, maybe through a popular vote like decide whether which one would go first, which won't go second You also want to consider that kids may be disturbed.
I think that after school program, they already provided funding, but we can continue asking for the coming years and all this also that goes on there under the estate mandate, we are doing a part of this city.
They had to go through that school and look at everything in instead of individual one by one What we're saying thing is that we are going to be voting okay.
You know, okay, I do not know how other people feel, but I think they all should be in compliance with everything We're going to vote on our expensive priority, the capital.
