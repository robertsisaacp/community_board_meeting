I am speaking: oh wait, I hear you right now. You hear me right. Yeah there seems to be a delay. That's probably the glory of Webex public safety is on zoom. We only have one application so one we have to alternate because there's two committees on one day: otherwise you guys will have zoom if New York, City, weren't so cheap. We would have two zoom accounts instead of the gym. Why don't you introduce yourself? I'm Jim Berlin I've been a member of this committee since the beginning of time I've been a member of this community board even longer than that I vague by the way. You're. All aware that the Rko Coliseum is now gone. It is now level so and I've got yeah I, remember seeing trolley cars on Broadway and on 181St street when I was a little kid thanks, Jim Vivian, my name is Vivian Ducat, I'm the public member I. Think I've been on this committee for 14 years. That I was on it originally as a full member of the board, but now I'm just on this committee. Thank you. Vivian welcome I, don't remember: Charlie photos, yeah and Juan Guzman Good evening everybody, I'm Juan Guzman and I'm new to this committed this year. Thank you, Juan Omar, Juan, Cormar, Tejada here and Rosie everyone. This is Rosie. I've been here since, like I would say maybe February and I'm happy to be here, so you got here just in time to Covid-19. Is that it that's exactly it? Okay and I. Think I saw two board members who are not committee members. Although one of them is gone, I thought I saw Domingo, but I don't see him anymore and Michelle. Would you like to introduce yourself just muted I know, but she couldn't find herself okay. So you know with that. We have two agenda items and then we have at least one item of old business. I, don't know if we have any items of new business. Actually, at the November committee meeting we were supposed to have a an updated conversation with Diego rodeo from the historic robaya, rather from the historic District Council, to talk about promoting historic preservation from a cultural perspective in underrepresented communities, which is a rather interesting topic. Given some of the things that we've been talking about and then the Department of City planning is presenting to us a proposal for our journey for coastal flood resiliency and I, this is probably an update if I'm not mistaken, presentation that was made to the committee a few years ago. So with that Diego welcome good to have you with us this time, thanks so much for watching. Thank you so much Wayne and hi everyone. My name is Diego I work for the historic districts council. We are an organization that works to preserve the architectural and cultural heritage of New, York, City and I work, with mainly with the Spanish-speaking communities and I, wanted to talk today about my work in the Bronx and use it as a case study to explore possibilities on how underpresent underrepresented communities in upper Manhattan can be more engaged in historic preservation. I was trying to figure out how to share my screen, but apparently I'm not able to I think payola has to give you permission to share your screen. Okay, I'm waiting for that permission. Okay, hi Paolo! Are you able to give Diego the ability to share a screen? Well, it's okay, I! Think I, I'm just gonna talk, then, okay, give me a second I'm trying to figure it out. I! Don't like you guys, I'm not too familiar with Webex. Chanel knows a little bit more than me. So give me a second right now we're not familiar either. So we wanted to talk about. My work in the Bronx is specifically the Bronx border landmarks committee, which is a committee that we started at the beginning of the year. This committee is a coalition of Bronx residents from all neighborhoods to share ideas and concerns about preservation of historic buildings in the Bronx, and this group has focused mainly on the cultural heritage of the Bronx, and this is because, if we compare Manhattan to the Bronx bronze, we can see that there are more cultural landmarks in the Bronx. So what we've been focusing on in the Bronx border, Lamech Committee, is on identifying these places that have cultural relevance and find ways to highlight them and learn more about them. So far, we've had around 7 meetings in the Bronx. All of them, via soon and we've had a speakers from all neighborhoods for most neighborhoods in the Bronx, and they are residents who are passionate about preservation who have been living in their neighborhoods for decades, and they want to share their passion about the historic buildings of their neighborhoods. We've had some interesting characters in the Bronx like Mike, Amadeo, Elena, Martinez, Boys and Audia, who are people who have contributed to the cultural evolution of the bronze and they've. Given us some presentations about historic buildings, historic places that they feel passionate about, and usually in these meetings, we have around 20 to 30 people and they serve an educational purpose. People attending meetings to learn about the historic treasures of all of other neighborhoods in the Bronx and we've had a very positive outcomes. Our ultimate goal with this group is to engage hispanic communities or communities that were not very familiar with historic preservation in activities that are going to you know help us attain landmarks throughs for specific buildings. So, for example, a few months ago, we had a couple of people from this group densify favor of the designation of Manitoba Street. In the Bronx, which was one of the latest historic districts to be designated in New, York City, so that's our ultimate goal. Through this Bronx group, we want people to be more engaged and talk about the historic treasures of the Bronx. So I was talking to my boss, Simeon Bankoff, and we thought we could start doing something similar for upper Manhattan, including community districts, 10:11 and 12, and what we are thinking about is creating a platform for people to learn more about specific historic buildings. So that's what we were thinking about upper Manhattan. We are. We want to create a similar group to the Bronx world landmarks, Preservation Committee for upper Manhattan and specifically community boards, 10:11 and 12, because those community worlds have a lot of underrepresented communities, hispanic communities who traditionally have not been very engaged or interested in historic preservation and that's what we want to obtain in upper Manhattan. So what we were thinking is for December 16 to have our first meeting and in this meeting we want to invite someone who is knowledgeable and passionate about history in upper Manhattan and invite residents of this community board and other the other two community boards that I mentioned, and so the reason why I wanted to talk in this meeting is because I wanted to first of all, to communicate this and to invite you and to ask for any possible communication channels where I could use that I could use to reach out to residents in community board. Invite them to this event, which is going to take place on December, 16. well, I mean I, would say, you know, first of all, community board 12 and the land use Committee for the time that I've been on it. I've been very interested in and supportive of landmarking, and you know historic preservation, and you know we have argued- and you know less than an hour ago, we're arguing that you know there are certain communities that just don't seem to get the attention and recognition when it comes to. You know landmarking and preservation and we're one of them and I would say that it's not you know just a matter of engaging. You know the you know hispanic community there are. You know when I worked with Harlow with CDC. There were, you know, African-Americans, who didn't see the value in you know historic Harlem. So there are lots of you know: community members who don't quite know the history and the value of the buildings and the place they see every day and when they learn about it they suddenly become advocates for those places and that's terribly important. Yeah I think that's a wonderful point, because that's what we've seen in the Bronx like these committee members, were previously not interested in landmarking or history, but we've engaged them. We've told them of the historic treasures of their neighborhoods and so far their interests have increased a lot and so yeah. I'm sure that in your community board there are many communities who are not very familiar yesterday in the historic treasures of 12. So our outcome- our ultimate outcome for this, would be to make those communities more interested in their historic and historic heritage of their neighborhood. So I think it's going to be very important for us to be successful in this project to be able to reach out to the people who are going to connect us with those communities that are underrepresented, those communities that are not familiar with landmarking and that's what I. One of the things that I wanted to ask during this meeting is how can I reach out to those underrepresented communities? How can I get to them and invite them to these type of events? The that we are planning on having I mean if you have informational flyers on the event that you can share with us, I'm sure the Community Board office. Can you know e-blast it to the folks on their mailing list or you know, add it to social media. You know just as you know, this is a meeting. That's coming up. It's unfortunately happening before our general meeting, otherwise you could also promote it at the general meeting but you're bringing it to the attention of the land, Use, Committee and the extent to which you know you can share that information with us. We can give it to Paola and Ebenezer and they can, you know, help get the word out also sharing it with some of the community-based organizations that are, you know on our mailing list. So they can. Then you know reach out to their constituents and share the information as well so I mean. Do you have information offline? Yes, I'm gonna send it to you and I appreciate that I think that's gonna be very helpful, so yeah I think that's a great start. I'm gonna send some informational material, inviting people to this event that we're gonna have on December 16 and if you can disseminate that material I think that would be extremely helpful and I think it will be a great start and will that event will it have like simultaneous translation house? How what are the logistics going to be yeah? We could explore that we could have a simultaneous translation if there is gonna be many spanish speaking attendees. We can definitely simultaneous translation. Yeah well, I mean you have a you know a diverse community, and you know some folks, including you know. Members of the this committee are bilingual and you know are comfortable in attending the meeting in English and Spanish. There are others who may be more comfortable having the information in Spanish and I. You know: I attended a community board, 9 event where you know they set it up really nicely so that you had. You know two links and one link was basically a breakup room where you were getting the information in real time in Spanish, so you didn't have someone speaking and then stopping and then translating it was an even flow, and so with the technology set up right, you can, you know, get all that information to the audience in a rather seamless way, yeah I think that's a wonderful suggestion and everything we're gonna have any spanish speaking. People I think that's something that we can definitely do. Vivian is the purpose only to look at latino potential sites, or is it also covering the ethnicities covered in these three, which are diverse beyond Latinos yeah? We are. We want to cover everything, so the reason why I'm saying Latinos is because traditionally the Latinos are the ones who are not very much engaged in landmarking and history preservation. After the Berliners committee, we initially focused on inviting Latinos, but the theme of every presentation was about any type of history, not just latino history, because what we want to achieve here is to make these latino communities interested in the history of their neighborhood and that history may or may not be in related to latino culture. Other questions comments from community members and I can only see two committee members. So any committee members who have questions or comments I guess you have to speak up or show your face. Let me start with the committee members hearing: none I saw a hand from Peter Green, Peter, you're, muted, okay, yeah I, think this is fantastic, Diego, Vivian and I, and we were just talking with Wayne and Leslie lost was on this call, and we were just talking about half an hour ago or so about another landmark to an ethnic minority in New York, which is the a house that was built by an abolitionist who created Navajos colony here in the 1850s in Washington Heights, and the summary rejection that we got from the Landmarks Commission, because the building's architectural integrity wasn't fully preserved and Wayne is really a huge proponent. A very eloquent one of landmark's need to accept its legal and historical charge to preserve the cultural and historical landmarks of New York. You know, even if they're, not in perfect architectural condition, I mean they did actually landmark the housing project in the Bronx where hip-hop started, and it would be really hard to call that a piece of you know brilliant architecture, so I think you're onto something here and if we can help and we're trying to get this house unmarked and get them to reconsider what they're doing here, but let's definitely talk offline and how we can join forces because Simeon's been very helpful to us and we would love to support you. Thank you thanks. So much yeah I think that's wonderful, yeah! So yeah, I'm gonna send some communication materials and you can disseminate. That would be wonderful. I'm going to send you in the chat, my email. Now I'm going to meet myself. We actually have Assemblyman Al Taylor on the line, but I don't know. If he wants to speak, are you able to could even use him? They would have to mute themselves these all on their side. It's not on our side. They will have to remute themselves hi good evening. Can you hear me yes good evening? Everyone Wayne Peter, all you all I, really just joined to get some insight. The letter that I saw the double whammy I'll call it the double whammy. The landmark I did send that over to the mayor's office and I hope to have some conversation about that tomorrow. Great, that's the landmark decision and I know I'm on with a letter that Gail put together our president, so I hope to give you guys some updates, maybe by Friday just in terms of what feedback I'm getting from the mayor's office, because I think they did that too quickly too fast and they need to come back and revisit that decision. Race right. It's really wonderful and assimilate in terms of the effort that Diego and the historic District Council is doing to outreach the upper Manhattan community on landmarking. If they send information to your office, can you also help get the word out absolutely. Thank you. Absolutely. Whatever I can do, I want to help move that and change the narrative. Absolutely please feel free to call upon us we'll walk the streets beat the drums whatever we need to do to keep that community intact. The way it is right now thanks so much so is there an email that I should email you to? Yes, Wendy is on and she'll drop it in the chat. Thank you hi. How are you and Al I just wanted to say? Thank you so much. We really appreciate all the help you can give us on the house and the abolitionists. This is it's a really important story and hopefully we'll be able to tell it for hundreds of years to come with your help thanks. Well, I'm hoping that we're going to be victorious and if it were not for the scratching and sniffing, we had this jewel in our community all these years and no one knew about it. So exactly definitely it's a fight and I love to be the underdog, so I look forward to it and thank you underdog Victorious. Sorry, a great song underdog victorious ascendancy. Absolutely that's what makes America so great I mean look. We have a jewel in our neighborhood and nobody knew it. We walked past it around it and we probably said a lot of unfavorable things when other people live there, but it's right there in our backyard. So I'm excited about the process looking forward to it. Thank you again and let me step back all right. Thank you very much. Do we have any further questions or comments on this agenda item the promoting historic preservation from a cultural perspective and under resentment, underrepresented communities, hearing none and just to be clear. In this particular platform, the individuals have to unmute themselves. It's not the office doing it. So you know with that I would say Diego. It was great speaking to you, please be sure to send the information you know my way I will make sure that gets shared with the office, but also you know, I will pass it along to the our president's office and to mark Levine's office. Basically, the elected officials who represent up Manhattan eudonis Rodriguez, asked them to all. You know help to get the word out so that you know we have a good amount of attendees on the 16th for you Wayne. I'm sorry is there at some point that we want to do a presser regarding this. Will that help jumpstart? Are you talking about? Are you talking about the 867 building? Yes, you know we were talking about that an hour ago or so, and I would say absolutely I would say interesting is on I think it was Channel 4 news last night and I, don't remember the person's name, but it basically it was in Brooklyn, and there was a building that the you know community is advocating for preservation. It looks like it's, you know in danger of being demolished, and you know their argument is it's in a community of color, the building's historical and cultural significance is tied to that community and they can't get any attention or traction from LPC on getting the building recognized, and we were saying you know just an hour ago. There seems to be a pattern where, if it's you know, architecturally important LPC has no trouble. You know accepting that as the reason for designation, but if the primary reason is historical and cultural and it's historically cultural guide to communities of color, it's going to get lots of questions of what is really that important and it seems to be a clear double standard. Yes, I'm sorry to interrupt, but anyone who is not speaking must turn their microphones off. You know mute them, because it's all this background noise and it's getting impossible. That's absolutely correct! Thank you! Okay! So once again, thanks Diego the next item on the agenda and as Jim Berlin says, if you're, not speaking, please mute your phone, your computer, whatever it is because we're picking up the background, noise, Rosie and Pat. Please turn your microphones off mute yourselves. So the next item on the agenda is presentation by the Department of student planning. I. Believe it's going to be led by Annie White, although I see Ryan Code is also with us, but Department of City planning on zoning for coastless flood resiliency plan and I. Believe you also need to share your screen, but from what I can see, at least from my sky is the bottom of the screen. There should be an area that says share and if you click on that the share content, so you should be able to control it. If you have that, but in any event any Zion the floor is Europe miners. They don't have permission to share so that pushing that button does nothing well. If they need permission, then, once again, you know we pointed out to Paola earlier that they would need to do that. He has no and everyone. That's on. This call has access to share screen without me having to do anything it's part of the component. So let me know, is everyone seeing a slide from me saying towards resilient land? Use? Yes, okay, great, then we're in business. Thank you all. Yes, I will be presenting this citywide text amendment today. Thank you for having Us Ryan Cody is technically a little holiday delayed holiday, but he is kindly tuning in just to sit to stay privy to our conversations. So this is a proposal led by the city for a zoning text amendment to article six chapter, four related to flood resiliency I will just say that this, if you've seen the materials, it's quite a dense text amendment- and this is also quite a detailed presentation- I'll be giving I will I am trying to be both comprehensive and concise, but I do anticipate that there'll be some questions that come out of this as it is a city-wide text. Amendment Ryan and I are not the primary project managers on this. So there are my colleagues at the department who are much more familiar with the text and we'll be better at answering questions. So I'm happy to take any remaining questions that I can today and report back to you so I, I'm sure I don't need to explain to this group the widespread and devastating impacts of hurricane Sandy, but I think it's important to kind of frame. The conversation today around this as to underscore the importance of the work that we're doing around coastal resiliency throughout the city. Sandy resulted in the death of 43 New Yorkers 90,000 buildings were inundated with water, and 2 million people were left without with increasing risks of floods. It is even more imperative that the city take action in a multi-pronged approach to ensuring resiliency and disaster preparedness. So when we talk about flood risk and climate resiliency, that can mean a lot of different things. Oftentimes well, today, we're really focusing on coastal storms is that presents the most significant flood risk and in terms of compromising human safety and property damage, and when we talk about, you know the flood plain, and what we're talking about is what FEMA has designated the flood zone. So if you take a look at the map on the left, I'll often be referring to the one percent floodplain, and what that means is that there is Ev every year, a one percent chance that we're going to be seeing floods in this area that is considered kind of high risk. Flood plain, there's, also a moderate risk, flood plain, which is the 0.2 percent, and that is going to take into importance throughout this presentation. Now, while we say that 0.2% might not seem like a high risk, we know that with the hurricane Sandy that storm surge did reach into that two percent area, which is what that map is showing in the yellow in the middle and then there's an additional need to think about the longevity and the changing nature of these floodplains. So the map on the right is showing what that one percent flood plain will look like or is projected to look like in 2050 and I wanted to highlight that a little bit further, because it's important that, when we're doing our zoning and doing our planning we're not just planning for what the floodplain is today, but what it's pretty in the future. So you can see that it is projected by 2050 that almost 800,000 people will live in that one percent flood plain and just for scale. That is a hundred thousand people more than the entire population of the City of Boston. So it's a significant portion of our city residents and buildings that are in danger by this 2050 floodplain and also just to zoom in on Meet board. 12. Specifically, this isn't looking at that 2050. This is going back to that one percent and 2 number just to give you an idea of the designated areas that we'll be speaking about. As you can see, it's largely kind of a lot in that northeastern corridor along the Harlem river, the one percent being the light shaded yellow, but you can see that two percent area does extend into kind of the heart of the Inwood core. Many areas that were also part of the inward zoning area can I ask a quick question before you proceed. Is anyone else seeing a gray hatched box and a section of the presentation, yeah I can confirm I'm experiencing the same okay, I, think that is okay, minimize the bit, but it's still there. Okay, I think it's what is coming up with my the self-view in okay yeah. It is okay, but there's no information. It's just blocking part of the slide. Now that's gone, but now it's blocking the title of the fly. Hmm I wish I. Could I'm also not quite as familiar with I, still see something blocking out most of inward? Oh yeah, it's getting worse, yeah, I'm looking at options on my right now, I'm having some I'm looking at some options on Webex to see. If I can minimize this like header, that is up at the top. Let me see not sure, okay, how is that better? Okay, yeah, but it's there's still some a shaded area over much of it at the very end. That's why we need another zoom account instead of fighting with this crap. Well, we can't deal with that. Right now, unfortunately, needs commenting and I just commented. What, if is it better or worse? If I? Is it too small? If I do it in this view, so that you can see the entire slide that works? For me, okay, yeah! This is better. Okay, all right thanks all! Hopefully we can make this work. Okay, so there's just many different entities that regulate the floodplain, so FEMA, which of course, a federal organization, creates national wide standards for what's in these floodplains with the flood insurance rate maps and those are then translated into the New York City Building code, which is implemented by DOB, and they take FEMA standards and implement it into the building code. In the zoning resolution, which DCP addresses is accommodate those regulations, but through zoning, we're also thinking about neighborhood character, urban design and the long-term planning of our neighborhoods. So it's important also to note that zoning specifically deal end zone and building code deals with the built form, but there's many different aspects, and it's only one piece of a larger pledge of coastal resiliency. So there's gonna, there's other coastal resiliency strategies that need to happen a focus on infrastructure such as transit and energy, and also kind of the more interpersonal direct support of residents and businesses. But today we're specifically going to be looking at flood proofing. Buildings also caviar, that the floodplain is very large 520 miles of coastal area and diverse. And throughout this presentation you might see areas that don't necessarily correspond with what you know about. Inwood we've tried to focus this presentation on Manhattan and wood, but this is a text proposal. That's going out to 59 community boards because of that we're taking. We can think about resiliency across our coastline in this spectrum of you know, where is it appropriate to really limit density and limit growth and then areas that are more protected, that it's so that it's appropriate to encourage density and growth in those areas? So the text- amendment that's in front of you today- is kind of the culmination of a long process that started during Hurricane Sandy with the executive emergency order. They were supple, supplem, subsequent text amendments in 2013 and 2015. They were done quite quickly, but we knew that we needed to get something on the books immediately and those purposely were given sunset clauses or expiration dates. Knowing that we wanted to engage in a larger study, engaging communities down the road and that's the process that we've been engaging in since then, we've briefed more than 3,000 stakeholders across all the boroughs in various different forms. Hopefully, people in this meeting were able to attend those, and the goal was both to educate the community on flood risk, but also learn from people about what's working with the current zoning text and what should be changed and we had many different takeaways and lessons learned from those meetings. I won't read through all of them, but as an example, we will. Overall, we realized that a lot of our flood text was very focused on low density areas such as single detached homes and not enough was thought was given into our high density and mediums, so they assisted with buildings that were able to physically elevate. You know truly lifting out of the flood zone, but that's not possible for many of our attached homes and multi-family homes. Also businesses and the success of businesses wasn't addressed enough. Knowing that certain uses need to have you know street front sidewalk access, so there's also a component of commercial focus to the proposal now and a few additional things. A lot of our proposal is regarding allowing owners to relocate uses that were below the floodplain above, so there was kind of some inconsistencies and loopholes that came from the ability to increase height to do that. Relocation and also some of the streetscapes, had unintended consequences. So we both want to ensure that we're being we're designing resilient buildings, but also designing buildings that you know, have good urban design characteristics and don't just form a blank wall against the sidewall. So before I get into the proposal itself. I also want to make sure we understand what the current building code requires and as a reminder, the building code is what would be required for any new construction or existing buildings that are doing a large renovation or construction project. It's we are not forcing existing buildings that aren't doing any other kind of construction. They wouldn't have to comply with the building code and, as a reminder, we're gonna do a little bit of reading. As this is a little bit dense, but the building's location and requirements are based on their location within the flood zone and also what we define as the design, flood elevation or dfv you'll see that throughout the presentation, as this blue DOT noted DFE, and that DFE is the height, the flood waters would be expected to rise plus an additional elevation for some protection. So this means is for residential buildings all living spaces. So all dwelling units must be completely located above dfv any area below it must be floodproofed, which means that floodwaters can move in and out safely, but and that area can be used for things like parking storage and access in and out of the building. But no residential units are allowed to be wet flood proofed and that image you can see on the left for mixed use or commercial buildings. You can, you know, wet flood proof and move all uses above, but you also have the opportunity to do dry flood proofing, which would mean that in a flood that area would remain completely dry. This is very expensive, but can be beneficial for property owners that want to keep that first floor. So this is, you know currently, what's in the books that zoning will continue to address, but we realized that, with our last flood text in 2013 2015 that there were some conflicts with what the building code requires and those related to the location of uses, the size and shape of buildings, the bulk regulations that zoning requires, and also let that public realm interaction and how buildings interface with the street so now I'll be getting into the nitty-gritty details of the city-wide zoning proposal. Zoning for coastal flood resiliency. So throughout this process of studying the floodplain further and engaging with so many stakeholders in our community outreach, we came away with four overall arching goals. Those are outlined here and just to save a little bit of time. I'm gonna get into those more specifically one by one and not go through them here. So the first is to encourage resiliency throughout both the current and the future flood plains. What we heard is that addressing what's the one percent flood plain now is not enough: if property owners are going to be doing significant financial investments in their crop building, we want to be planning for the future. So, due to this, we would expand the applicability of our flood tax to a broader set of buildings that extend beyond the current one percent. So, as you can see here, this is including the one percent and the 0.2% of those annual flood plain areas so to zoom. In again, this is the same image that I showed earlier in the presentation of CB12, so the image on the right, the map on the right, shows that 0.2 that this flood text will now be applicable towards so goal. 2 is a you know: there's five parts of supporting resilient design of all building types and I'll go through these strategies, one by one. This is where it gets a little bit complicated, so I'm going to do a little bit of reading. The first is regards to the building envelope, so the goal is to create a more streamlined rule for how height is measured in the floodplain to allow property owners to safely physically elevate, habitable and occupiable space to areas above the floodplain. So in the existing text it allows the building height, which is regulated by zoning, to be a variety of heights above grade ranging from 10 feet to 12 feet, and this is very variable across the city depending on where what zoning district they are in and where they're located and it's very complex both for owners to figure out and for the city to regulate. So this proposal really is supposed to stream like that and making it more consistent and equitable throughout the city. So what the proposal is saying is that heights can now be measured from a new reference plane that is either 10 per 10 feet above grade at the one percent flood plain or five feet above grade at the 0.2% flood plain. So you know, say you have a zoning district that allows 60 feet building height. That's now in the flood plain, that's being measured from either 10 feet or 5 feet. One important aspect of this, in addition, is that the proposal is removing an existing loophole in our previous height allowances. So today, property owners can get that additional 10 to 12 feet, but they don't actually have to ensure that the structure is being future proofed from flooding, so they can get the additional height, but they're actually not doing anything on that ground floor. So this proposal is actually requiring that height relief, that additional height is tied to flood proofing of the building. So they're now would be required to put the first floor at that reference, plane and flood proof below next couple. Slides are going to go through some additional ground floor requirements, and this is related to areas that need to be wet proofed. The proposal would allow floor area exemptions for spaces that are wet proof to apply to both existing and new buildings so floor. Air exemptions currently exist, which means that if you provide wet proofing, which means you're allowing water to come in and out in a flood, you get a floor area exemption which is zoning floor area. That's given back to you that you can then use elsewhere. This is an incentive to have property owners, relocate important floor area above the floodplain and allow that space to be you know, parking or storage or other things that it's okay, if they experience a flood. So this is extending that allowance to both new and existing buildings to further encourage property owners to relocate important space above similarly with drive floodproof spaces. We also want to encourage that property owners invest in drive, floodproofing or relocating the areas on the ground floor. Some of our previous dry floodproofing floor area exemptions had some unattended consequences, which property owners previously were creating. What we intended to be true seller spaces, but they were squeezing in commercial floor area and what we were defining as sellers, but were really just shortened, floors or sinking in the first floor, so that they it was below the flood elevation so that they could get a floor area exemption. So this proposal would modify these regulations to reduce the amount of floor area that can be exempted to only the 30 feet within space of the sidewalk. So this is to ensure that we're really we're pushing occupiable. You know retail or commercial floor area up to the sidewalk, while also reducing the kind of incentives of creating a whole seller level and, having you know, poor quality and not marketable space below grade just to get just to allow the developers to get that floor area exemption. In addition to this there's additional streetscape urban design requirements that improve the design and have different, you know requirements to ensure that we're not just getting a blank wall at the street front. Ada access. As you see here, the third goal was to address what we heard from many owners and residents about the need to adapt over time and incremental retrofits. So, typically, when you have to bring a building up to code, once you trigger a large construction project, you immediately have to completely comply well. This was actually disincentivizing owners from doing any retrofit work because just of the large financial requirement of bringing something fully into compliance, so these efforts are to allow them to make incremental moves to encourage resiliency, while also not you know making it financially infeasible. So we learned that raising mechanical equipment is often you know extremely important and the most cost effective first step in making a building more resilient, especially on these large campus type buildings, as you see here, so this proposal would continue to allow the relocation of mechanical equipment on either on top of the roofs or in a separate structure and consider any mechanical equipment a permitted obstruction. Additionally, we heard from many small businesses and industrial businesses that they would like to be more resilient, but they are just not able to completely elevate or dry flood proof all of their operations, either due to cost or just the operational requirements of say, a manufacturing space. So this proposal would allow them to select priority areas and move and relocate them to higher ground without completely relocating the entire first floor. The next proposal would enable different types of flood protections to be implemented, so this includes allowances for different types of a variety of panels or landscape firms. That would be considered permitted obstructions and it would also allow for spaces within buildings that are meant that are used for storage for these panels to be exempted from floor area to encourage property owners to store deployable plant panels on site. So, lastly, we are looking at our waterfront areas and currently, through our various waterfront requirements, many yards individual corridors are limited and how they can be raised to account for flood risk, they're required to provide public access using specific design standards and often have little flexibility. And so this proposal is offering more flexibility on the grading or topography of some of those waterfront sites to ensure that we're allowing for resiliency measures such as soft surfaces and soft shorelines and finally, the fourth goal is a little bit different in that it's relating to us, the city-wide text, not just specifically within the floodplain. So all these would apply city wide beyond that one percent and 0.2 percent floodplain, so Sandy certainly showed us that the effects go beyond the flood plain of storm surge, especially regarding the energy grid. So this would the proposal is allowing power systems, including things like generators, solar energy and other energy storage systems to be considered permanent obstructions on a zoning lot within open areas on the zoning lot. In addition, this is kind of broader than just flood resiliency, but the proposal is would ensure that the city can provide ADA access across zoning lots, so it would classify ramps and lifts is permanent, permitted obstructions and open areas to provide accessibility across the city. Another important aspect is the how we protect certain vulnerable populations, especially those that require you know certain medical needs and are and would struggle to evacuate during a flood nursing homes that are licensed to house populations that require continual medical care are strained when they either have to shelter in place or evacuate. Therefore, the city is proposing that is appropriate to limit growth, specifically of nursing homes in high risk areas. The proposal would prohibit the development of new nursing homes within the one percent, floodplain and other kind of particularly vulnerable geographies. Existing nursing homes would still be able to enlarge up to a certain point and do improvements, especially those improvements that would encourage increasing resiliency measures and finally, Sandy showed us that the lengthy process to upstate zoning can really slow and hinders disaster relief. So the proposal would make certain recovery provisions available, so they would exist in the text that could be quickly and temporarily enabled following disasters for immediate disaster relief, and some of these provisions are actually specific to address Covid-19 and its associated economic effects. So I'll end on the timeline. This was referred out on October 19th. It's currently out to all 59 community boards and the Euler Community Board clock ends on December 28th and from there it'll go on to the borough president and then back to the city. Planning Commission for a public hearing and I will end there and happy to take any questions. I actually have a question about where you ended, because I mean we're December 2nd, and this is a lot of information and our deadline is, you know just after Christmas this month. Have we gotten this at least to review in October I? Think we'd be in a better position to do that, but at this juncture that's kind of tough yeah. We totally understand. You definitely should have received this after the referral in October. So we apologize, there was a lack of material sharing that happened, I think I, don't know. If Ryan talked to you directly, you know the deadline is December 28th, because this is over the holidays and kind of, and it's such a dense zoning proposal. The chair, Marissa Lago, has stated that she is going to be accepting community board recommendation letters after the deadline of December 28th I know some of the other upper Manhattan community boards are already planning to do so. We're of course, encouraging community boards to get in their recommendations as close to the deadline as possible, but we understand with the holidays. It just might not be feasible, yeah well, but it's more than the holidays and we've actually addressed. We meaning CB12, has addressed this to city planning and other city agencies in the past, where the timing of getting materials does not work with. You know the schedule of the Community Board Committee meeting. In the past we received a number of referrals in you, know late June, knowing that community board doesn't meet in like July and August, and the deadline is sometime in the summer. You know in this case the October 19th referral was clearly after the October land use committee meeting at probably the executive committee, but had it been sent, it certainly would have been something we could have touched upon in the November meeting and I could have asked the committee members to review it in detail and be ready for. You know more questions for this presentation. You know in December and frankly, I was only contacted by Ryan about this meeting. You know a week ago. It's a very tight time frame and I think you know the referral date you know is something that merits some thought but I think. More importantly, there should be simply a general extension of the due date and not just that. We're accepting comments after the due date, but the due date is just you know. It's too short, all things considered well Wayne. Are you saying that we didn't get anything before our November committee meeting I? Don't even have this presentation? I was contacted I think last week, or maybe the officers contacted to say that you know city planning would like to make this presentation. Can they can it be added to the agenda and I said it's fine, but we weren't safe. We learned something after October, 19th, ah Steve I just said: I do not have this presentation well. I would say that this presentation is not what would have been referred out. It would have this was created by you know our internal team. You would have received the zoning text proposal I. You know. I was working on this for the past week, but typically you should have received the referral package and yeah. We apologize for the if that didn't go through, as this is kind of an issue where you should have received that from our central office. Would that have been a package that was sent by mail or spent by email, I, believe everything is digital currently, but it probably would have. It would have gone to probably not to me probably have gone to the office with CB12 can't hold her responsible. If it wasn't forwarded to us well, I Steve, at this juncture, I, don't know who received what so we can certainly check. I will touch base with Ebenezer and out to see if they receive anything, but I would think if it were referred out on October 19th, then sometime, you know before a week or ten days ago it would have made sense to contact. You know the land use chair or the board to say we'd like to present. That would have been a heads up to do something: okay, Wayne. Let me ask something else: I think what I heard Andy say is that and I think I remember this is that there was a previous zoning amendment along these lines back in 2015. Maybe Annie. Is that correct? We yeah we look. We had that presentation. We looked at it and I believe we passed the resolution supporting that initiative. So it's not something that we are opposed to or against it's just that you know I mean there's a 46 page right. You know presentation and the actual document is probably denser and it's right. You know it makes sense for us to understand what we are looking at if we're going to support it. If we're going to comment on it, no I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm just wondering whether our previous resolution in 2015 might have contained some recommendations and I'd like to know whether or not those recommendations might now be reflected in this new proposal. Well, whether we need to reiterate those recommendations, I don't think Annie was with city planning, I, don't know if she was with city playing at that time, but she was not our representative. We can certainly look at. We can pull up that resolution and see what it said. I think and at this juncture, at the end of the presentation, we can probably pull it down. So I can see the other committee members I think there are a couple critical things that would be useful. It would be great to get to have this presentation emailed so folks can have it as a reference document. I will have to coordinate with Ebenezer at out to see what, if anything, you know we received I, don't know, I, don't think it's reasonable for us to try to rush a resolution. Remember our general meeting this month is one week earlier than normal. So that makes it even tighter, so I think the best thing that we can do is to have is to aim for the land use committee to have a resolution to pass at its January meeting and to have that acted on by the executive committee. So that'll be something Annie that would be ready in the middle of January as opposed to the end of January. But at this juncture, I, you know having something by the 28th would mean having something ready for the general meeting this month of the general meeting this month is like a week before Christmas. It's not a lot of time right, yeah and I. Think your concern about how this material was relayed is very well heard. I think there's a little bit of growing pains with doing these referrals electronically, so I'll follow I know some other community boards had issues. So I'm going to follow up on that. I think that I do just want to say that if you get us the recommendation in January that's going to be okay, I think the borough president always wants to see me board say which would be. You know they might be interested to hear from you before during their time, but I know there's boards throughout the city that are also looking at a January submit submission time. I would like to make two comments. One of them is that, based upon this presentation and obviously nothing more I find what I have seen to be very reasonable and thoughtful, and although I agree that it might be, you know hasty to act on it tonight. You know based upon what I see, but again there may be stuff we haven't contemplated. Yet I'm very happy with this and there's a more general issue which both Wayne and Steve talked about this issue of our board and other boards around the city, not getting things in a timely manner and I think they're being very polite in only discussing the fact that this is disrupting the process. As far as I'm concerned, having been a member of this board longer than some people listening have been alive frankly, I personally find it insulting. You know if you get late notice for something that is not a sign of respect and you know. On the other hand, of course, these are difficult times and it takes longer to do things, but in that case you know get it out a month later, when it's in proper shape or when you have your logistics ready to distribute this stuff. Because and again it's not just you and I'm sorry that you're getting to hear the lecture first or whatever, because it is true of all the other departments with the other committees on this board we never get stuck. We used to get stuff in a far more reasonable time frame months before and now it's like a month, if we're lucky and that's basically not acceptable for a lot of reasons. Thank you. We have other questions or comments from committee members, Vivian, you're, muted, unmuted, I, guess I would have wanted more explanation and to understand better where building heights are going to be affected in order to gain height in order to build more resiliently and how there's any kind of control over that. It's not abused sure so I can give a little bit spend time on this slide. So, basically, what we would be permitting is a kind of straight uniform, I permission across the city, which is within the one percent flood plain. You can measure the height permitted through zoning at 10 feet above grade. In that one percent flood plain and in the 0.2 floodplain you can start measuring your building height at five feet above grade. This is not any more or less than what was previously permitted through the 2013 context. It's just more uniform and it's also extending those extending that into that 0.2% flood plain as we're trying to be projective and plan for that 2050 flood rise that we saw earlier so we're also. We actually think that this is going to cut down on a lot of the abuse of this, because there was no requirement to necessarily put your occupiable floor level at that flood elevation, so property owners were kind of automatically given this height variance, but might not necessarily be completely flood proofing, their lower level. Well, now that height is definitely tied to where that floor level is existing. So that means- and also these numbers are maximums. So if there's a building and that only elevates that first floor level four feet, they only get four feet of height on top and then that's maxed out at 10 feet. I have a quick question on the previous slide. What does the letter r mean and what does the letter c mean? I, residential and commercial? Yes, ah, yes, I was looking all over the slide, but yes, residential and commercial. Ah, thank you Wayne. Thank you. Anything else hold on a moment. I lost the connection. Maybe that's why I can't see, but I can hear you Eddie. Okay, can you hear me yeah yep? Could you show the map again indicating the? What is it the orange areas that are affected yeah? Could you it looks as though the neighborhood where Wayne and I live it might be affected? Is there a way to zero in on the bottom of at 155th street down at the very bottom yeah? What is that orange down to the cemetery? That's the cemetery, oh yeah! The cemetery would be in a flood plain, yeah sure no we'll hold it. Part of the cemetery goes down to the elevation of the river, because remember that the fire's up yeah, but isn't it it's blocked by the vine up no well depends on how waterproof divided all right. So look at the blue line. It's not in our district. We don't care about it, but there is a horrible orange zone. Okay, Wade and I and Vivian I think are concerned about it. So the cemetery is in a flood plain: does it have to take any action to protect itself? No, it's not undergoing any renovation. Okay. Well, let me rephrase that question that Annie. This is something I was going to ask. The cemetery is not flat. Its elevation at Broadway is significantly higher than the elevation as it slopes down towards the Hudson, so the map is actually incorrect when it shows the entire cemetery from basically from its western edge, all the way up to Broadway as being in the flood zone. But the same thing is actually true. If you go to my building, which is a couple blocks over on the building department's website, it shows the building is in a flood zone, but the building is actually several stories above the height of the river. So it's not in a flood zone, but the map looking at it as flat. It appears that it's only a block away. The topography would show you, but it's probably two or three stories above the height of that. So how do we correct things like that? You know we're in Washington Heights south of us, it's Hamilton Heights and these maps don't take into account changes in Topography, so yeah these maps. That's a good question about when you have such a drastic topographic change within a tax slot. These are directly derived from the FEMA maps, but I can ask those that would have these how those delineations are created, and if we know that there is an error, how would we go about addressing that yeah and I? We asked the same question years ago when I believe it was Edwin. Marshall presented this to us. We have the same question about the FEMA map and some of the areas where, knowing the area we know it's not flat and the that are showing as being in the flood zone can not possibly in a flood zone unless you're saying that you're going to have a flood that is the height of you, know three residential story. Yeah, let me go back to Inwood Annie. There are two large scale projects that are planned for the either side of 207th street at 9th Avenue, and it looks as though they would be in the floodplain now. Are they going to be subject to this new zoning amendment? Yes, so the zoning amendment kind of goes across. You know all districts, and you know ongoing projects that haven't been vested. I think that you know I believe that when I took a look at this that they would be in partially in the 0.2 flood zone, so they would be required to or they would be required to abide by both the zoning code and the zoning resolution roles in that area, and they also, you know, have special requirements based on the waterfront action plan that or access plan. Sorry that was part of the rezoning, so this isn't kind of going against what was put into place through the waterfront access, because those were very much developed in a similar vein. It was going at the same time as these regulations, so there shouldn't be kind of any Incon incongruencies there right so they're not like grandfathered in so that they don't fall under this umbrella of this new zoning amendment. Even though the amendment has not yet been adopted, they would still be subject to it. Sorry yeah, of course, I'm saying I'm kind of speaking as if it's already adopted, but you know, of course it's all you know proposed at this point, so they would be able to take advantage of some of their permissions, but also have the requirements of the proposed zoning text so Annie. It would be great if you could email this presentation to me. So I can share it. You know, with the committee I, encourage all of my committee members to review it carefully and I mean as Jim, Berlin and Steve said. You know we have looked at this in the past. We did pass the resolution supporting the prior iteration. If we had you know this information a month ago, we probably could be in a position now to you know, pass a resolution supporting it with whatever comments, but it would be. You know, terribly rushed to do so at this juncture, but Ann. If you could send this to me, we can make sure that we are in position to act in January. I'm thinking that there's a very small chance that maybe we could do something at this month, exec committee, but as I said, that's really pushing it, because this is a short month for us. Everything you know is happening. A little early, I think the general meeting might be in the middle of the March as opposed to the last Tuesday. So it just makes it really tight. Certainly, and if you know, we will certainly plan to come back as well in January, perhaps not you can. Let us know if you want us to do the full presentation again or potentially just focus on the areas that there's outstanding questions or concerns about and happy to take any of those via email. I would think if you send us the presentation it could. You know we may not need to have the presentation again, because we have the information that we can review it at our leisure and can then only forward to you any questions or requests or clarification that we may have. Certainly, okay, thank you and, as I said, I will certainly check with the office to see if they receive digitally any other information, and if so, you know when that occurred, but typically when something comes into the office, I get a an email asking whether we want to add it to the agenda and I did get something, but it wasn't pertaining to this. It was pertaining to something like that. 183Rd street that we will discuss in January. I would also know that I see that there is a so go ahead. Thank you. I have some questions in the chat? Can they be asked? Well sure? Okay, so Maggie I was just reading through those I couldn't see the chat when I was sharing my screen. So will these rules change when the flood maps change? Yes, so they are tied to the updated FEMA one percent and two percent flood plain map. So when those change, the zoning would correlate to those maps, sorry feel free to ask them verbally, but I'm also will these apply to responding with crime? Well, maybe I should ask yeah, maybe yeah so starting at the beginning, damaged by flooding a disaster as a lot of buildings in Staten. Island were why I'm wondering why make it easier to rebuild in the same place the flooding will only be getting worse. A good question I think there are certain neighborhood, specific plans that were addressing very vulnerable communities, so I kind of glossed over that in the beginning of my presentation, but we actually did 10 separate studies that have additional kind of requirements or restrictions for I. Think one in Manhattan that I know we did was you know the lower east side. So there are certain areas where we're looking at growth or density in very vulnerable areas, but I. Think generally, we found that there is a large part of the cities, including you know the areas around CB12. There is a way to build very resiliently to be able to manage storm surge and that's what we're allowing property owners to rebuild according to those regulations. So to that point, so is DCP, considering the flood levels that are going to be rising, all the way out to 2100 and probably beyond, and there are numbers for these by the local I. You know local version of the Ipcc which go out that far and new buildings are often made to last a hundred years and yet I think your time frame only goes out to 2050. So that's only 30 years from now, buildings are going to last a lot longer so shouldn't they be subject to the kind of flooding that's going to happen during their lifetime. Yeah absolutely- and this is something I might have someone in our waterfront division- give a more eloquent answer to, but I know that there's kind of certain legal restrictions as to how we designate flood areas and that's why we're using specifically the FEMA maps of the 1.2 percent. What has been explained to me is that the 2000 or the 2100 projections are very close to the 2050 projections. So we feel that using that 0.2 percent, that over lines very well with that 2050 projection, does give us a much longer span kind of resilient safety. But I can follow up on that a bit more. Thank you. So, regarding the two 30-story buildings that are set to go up in the flood plain at the 207th street bridge, I, wonder why the planning department would consider it a good idea to place new construction there in the flood plain I think this is somewhat related to two questions ago. Is that what we found is that in areas that are in this 0.2% flood plain, we have the building technology and the design technology to build in a very resilient by ensuring that all dwelling and occupiable floor area is above that flood elevation, and you know engineered with all of the flood and storm surge resiliency, that's required via building code. So to balance our need for housing growth well with us our need for resiliency. We found that it is it's a good practice to have these restrictions, but still permit density in those areas so and I I'm going to it's 8:31 and I want to I think we have an item of old business, although we did cover a bit of it earlier. So I'm going to thank you for your presentation. I look forward to your sending me. The information I will coordinate with the board office, see what information we previously received and we will work as expeditiously as we can to get CB12 response to you. Okay, Wayne yeah could I just bear. Could you just bear with me another moment? Annie could I get a look one more time at the map? Well, we're going to get the whole presentation. Steve I know, but I have a specific question. I think it looks as though it covers the Baker field lot with the Allen Hospital, I'm wondering how the hospital might be affected. Yeah the map on the left, the map on the right, I'm sorry, the map on the right, the it looks as though just before that loop in inward hill park there's a an orange. A large orange trapezoidal area looks as though it covers all the Baker field, where the Allen Hospital, among other things, is located. What impact would this have on the hospital? Well, I can look a little bit more into you know considering this has been an area that has had some flood risk for a very long time. It there's certain measures that might have already been taken, but essentially, if they were to do any substantial renovation, they would need to comply with the updated building code and, in addition, would have the opportunity to bring you know their building standards into the. If this proposed text amendment goes through, there might be additional requirements for uses such as hospitals that are such a vulnerable and high intensity use, and that's something I can follow up on. Well, you see the thing that they do. This is another case where we want to check to see if the map is correct. Vis-A-Vis topography yeah, but you see they do, have plans to do substantial renovation inside the hospital and to eliminate some units and create some new ones, and I'm wondering what is the significance of that and what would that trigger, so that would trigger that would certainly trigger them having to come up to the building code. So that would be you know either relocating any occupiable floor area above the flood elevation and wet flood proofing or investing in dry flood proofing, the lower level anywhere beyond the flood elevation, but it would also open them to if they have any building envelope or bulk restrictions. They would be able to take advantage of that minimal additional height and things like that to ensure that they're able to relocate that floor area isn't the trigger a function of the percentage of the renovated space to the overall size of the building. Yes, I think it has to do with how renovations are classified so, like all one versus all two yeah right, I think we're getting too specific into projects for which we don't have information. Yeah we can I can follow up with that. All right. I would appreciate it yeah, okay, so do we have any old business? I know that Peter and Lovely wanted to talk about 857, Al Taylor. To some extent. You know preempted that indicating that you know he also agreed with us that the response from landmarks was, you know too quick with not enough attention, and we were talking about. How did we approach the mayor's office? He's already done that. So that's great anything else on 857 that you'd like to share with us, you have to unmute yourself, Peter! Well, I just wanted, since this is the public meeting. I just wanted to give a very brief update of where things stand, which is that we did submit a landmarking application to try to commemorate the importance of the house in the history of the abolition. The anti-slavery movement, particularly today as America, is really trying to confront the history of black Americans and the wrongs that were committed over 300 years. Unfortunate landmarks rather quickly rejected that and we're going to see if there isn't some way that we can make them think a little more heavily about the importance of overbook landmarks and overlooked populations, much about what Diego was saying earlier. Secondly, the department of buildings issued two determinations, one of which Annie, if you're still here this might interest. You they've made some determinations on the zoning map and this is something I'd love to take up offline with city planning, about who exactly controls these maps and ensuring the accuracy of them. But the department of buildings currently a year ago approved both the bulk of this building, claiming that sliver law doesn't apply, which again, isn't very clear and claiming that there is no park between upper Riverside drive and lower Riverside drive, also not entirely legally clear. So these are things that we're going to keep looking at, and you know we're really disappointed, because this is a neighborhood that has evolved massively since the zoning plan was written, 19 were adopted and zoning resolution was adopted in 1961 and the whole idea of you know. Miami-Style towers along the river is no longer appropriate, and this is particularly true when we realized that upper Manhattan Washington heights, it would have some of the highest rates of Covid-19 now because of the massive density of our neighborhoods and the idea of opening the door with a building like this to creating further density in an area that is already unhealthily, dense and literally people are dying because it's dense. This is the wrong way to go. What we need in this neighborhood is not only a respect for our history, but we need a zoning for this area and the cooperation of zoning Department buildings department, various other people to say we need more, affordable housing here for the kind of people who have made this place different for generations and that's part parcel of what we're trying to do and I just want to really appreciate about Taylor's support. I appreciate the attention that Andy and Ryan have given to this so far and I really appreciate the whole community support and I think that together we can still make a difference here and let's see how we can work together. That's my long-winded state with the thank you so Annie to clarify a bit more. What Peter said and Tim Anderson was on the prior call. There seems to be a question as to why the building department issued one of the approvals, because the question isn't whether basically the question is, what is the width of the street and the zoning? The Zola Map have the dimensions of the street. It's not quite clear why Dod is opining otherwise and I know that when we initially approached city planning with this question, you pointed out that building department's responsibility was to do the zoning review and see what was applicable and one of the documents that apparently they worked on a year ago, but only go through now. Does that? But the other one is one where they are claiming. The land between the two sections of Riverside drive is not parkland, which apparently was news to Steve Simons for the last 20 years, but they also seem to be stepping into city planning's role. Talking about the width of the street and the zoning maps apparently already established what the width of the street is. So we really need city planning to take a look at that to see whether or not what the building department has written is at all accurate and is even in their jurisdiction on which to apply sure yeah, so I think I have one more a clearer description of that yeah and I haven't seen from the last time. I checked in on this I haven't seen the actual approval, that's being referenced from a year ago to see what their determination was. I know that it was a question of how they were interpreting the wide verse, narrow street of the two Riverside drive, but I'm happy to follow up and take a look. Yeah I mean I, think I can forward it to you. I received this p, looking forward to you but I, think and as in the last meeting, someone made it clear that it's like the building department is answering the wrong questions. The question is: it's a matter of fact and measurement. What is the width of the street, and that apparently is already established in the zone of that so and why they are trying to come up with a different way to establish the width of the street is questionable, but I will send you the document and, as I said, I wasn't on the discussion for the entire length. I think Tim was and probably, but in any case would probably give you a much clearer sense of you know what the specific question is that we need city planning to take a look at these are the whether the building department should be discussing it at all. Is there anything other elsewhere old business, any new business hearing, none I, you know hope everyone had a wonderful thanksgiving, a socially distant thanksgiving with not lots of leftovers looking forward to the upcoming holidays, also wonderful space holidays. Is there a motion to adjourn now before you adjourn Wayne, you may recall, like this Steve. What is that was it old business or new business Steve, the new business I was muting. You may recall: I sent you an email a few weeks back about a there's, a new building going up on Broadway, just south of the library in Inwood. It looks like it's an office building and I thought it might be useful for us to invite that developer and get a better sense of what he plans to do with that building. You know: I attended the business Development Committee last night. They also raised this and I. Think Domingo is intent on inviting them to get some clarity on the project, particularly from the perspective of you know. Are there opportunities to ensure that there's affordable space? You know for folks who need it, so maybe we can coordinate with business development and see what their plans are. Okay, all right, because I think what I read in today on Facebook is that maybe it's supposed to be an office building, which seemed a little strange. Exactly that's why business development wanted to get more information? Okay, very good! I'm sorry I just wanted to get some clarity. That is the building that's located in the on the lot next to the inward library. Yes, do you know anything about it? I think Natalie may have some information on it. I'm gonna double check with her tomorrow. So if you have any information on Tim, both land use and business development, we would love to. You know, obtain it absolutely any other new business. Is there a motion to adjourn ocean to adjourn your second charger? Okay, yeah. Thank you all have a good evening. Thank you. Oh.
