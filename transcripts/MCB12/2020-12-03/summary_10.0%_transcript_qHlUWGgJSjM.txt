Actually, At the November committee meeting, we were supposed to have a an updated conversation with Diego rodeo from the historic robaya, rather from the historic District Council, to talk about promoting historic preservation from a cultural perspective in underrepresented communities, which is a rather interesting topic.
Given, some of the things that we've been talking about and then the Department of City planning is presenting to us a proposal for our journey for coastal flood, resiliency and I.
work, with mainly with the Spanish-speaking communities and I, wanted to talk today about my work in the Bronx and use it as a case study to explore possibilities on how underpresent underrepresented communities in upper Manhattan can be more engaged in historic, preservation.
This committee is a coalition of Bronx residents from all neighborhoods to share ideas and concerns about preservation of historic buildings in the Bronx, and this group has focused mainly on the cultural heritage of the Bronx, and this is because, If we compare Manhattan to the Bronx bronze, we can see that there are more cultural landmarks in the Bronx.
So I was talking to my boss, Simeon Bankoff, and we thought we could start doing something similar for upper Manhattan, including community districts, 10:11 and 12, and what we are thinking about is creating a platform for people to learn more about specific historic, buildings.
We want to create a similar group to the Bronx world, landmarks, Preservation Committee for upper Manhattan and specifically community boards, 10:11 and 12, because those community worlds have a lot of underrepresented, communities, hispanic communities who traditionally have not been very engaged or interested in historic preservation and that's what we want to obtain in upper Manhattan.
Well, I mean I, would say, you know, first of all, community board 12 and the land use Committee for the time that I've been on it.
Yeah I think that's a wonderful point, because that's what we've seen in the Bronx like these committee members, were previously not interested in landmarking or history, but we've engaged them.
So I think it's going to be very important for us to be successful in this project to be able to reach out to the people who are going to connect us with those communities that are underrepresented, those communities that are not familiar with landmarking and that's what.
I mean if you have informational flyers on the event that you can share with us, I'm sure the Community Board office.
But you're, bringing it to the attention of the land, Use, Committee and the extent to which you know you can share that information with us.
After, the Berliners committee, we initially focused on inviting Latinos, but the theme of every presentation was about any type of history, not just latino history, because what we want to achieve here is to make these latino communities interested in the history of their neighborhood and that history may or may not be in related to latino.
Was on this call, and we were just talking about half an hour ago or so about another landmark to an ethnic minority in New York, which is the a house that was built by an abolitionist who created Navajos colony here in the 1850s in Washington Heights, and the summary rejection that we got from the Landmarks Commission, because the building's architectural integrity wasn't fully preserved and Wayne is really a huge proponent.
And I know I'm, on with a letter that Gail put together our president, so I hope to give you guys some updates, maybe by Friday, just in terms of what feedback I'm getting from the mayor's office, because I think they did that too quickly, too fast, It's, really wonderful and assimilate in terms of the effort that Diego and the historic District Council is doing to outreach the upper Manhattan community on landmarking.
I think it was Channel, 4 news last night, And I, don't remember the person's name, but it basically it was in Brooklyn, and there was a building that the you know.
You know accepting that as the reason for designation, but if the primary reason is historical and cultural and it's historically cultural guide to communities of color, it's going to get lots of questions of what is really that important.
It's going to be led by Annie White, although I see Ryan Code is also with us, but Department of City planning on zoning for coastless flood resiliency plan and.
This is a proposal led by the city for a zoning text amendment to article six chapter, four related to flood resiliency.
If you take a look at the map on the left, I'll often be referring to the one percent floodplain, and what that means is that there is Ev every year, a one percent chance that we're going to be seeing floods in this area.
Now, While we say that 0.2% might not seem like a high risk, We know that with the hurricane Sandy that storm surge did reach into that two percent area, which is what that map is showing in the yellow in the middle.
The map on the right is showing what that one percent flood plain will look like or is projected to look like in 2050 and I wanted to highlight that a little bit further, because it's important that, when we're doing our zoning and doing our planning we're not just planning for what the floodplain is today.
Okay, so there's just many different entities that regulate the floodplain, so FEMA, which of course, a federal organization, creates national wide standards for what's in these floodplains with the flood insurance rate maps and those are then translated into the New York City Building code, which is implemented by DOB, and they take FEMA standards and implement it into the building.
Hopefully, people in this meeting were able to attend those, and the goal was both to educate the community on flood risk, but also learn from people about what's working with the current zoning text and what should be changed and we had many different takeaways and lessons learned from those meetings.
Overall, We realized that a lot of our flood text was very focused on low density areas such as single detached homes and not enough was thought was given into our high density and mediums, so they assisted with buildings that were able to physically elevate.
So this is, you know currently, what's in the books, that zoning will continue to address, but we realized that, with our last flood text in 2013 2015 that there were some conflicts with what the building code requires and those related to the location of uses, the size and shape of buildings, The bulk regulations that zoning requires, and also let that public realm interaction and how buildings interface with the street.
The first is regards to the building envelope, So the goal is to create a more streamlined rule for how height is measured in the floodplain to allow property owners to safely physically elevate, habitable and occupiable space to areas above the floodplain.
The proposal would allow floor area exemptions for spaces that are wet proof to apply to both existing and new buildings, so floor.
This is an incentive to have property, owners, relocate important floor area above the floodplain and allow that space to be you know, parking or storage or other things that it's okay, if they experience a flood.
In addition, This is kind of broader than just flood resiliency, but the proposal is would ensure that the city can provide ADA access across zoning lots, So it would classify ramps and lifts is permanent, permitted obstructions and open areas to provide accessibility across the city.
I actually have a question about where you ended, because I mean we're December 2nd, and this is a lot of information and our deadline is, You know just after Christmas this month.
If Ryan talked to you directly, You know the deadline is December 28th, because this is over the holidays and kind of, and it's such a dense zoning, proposal.
I know some of the other upper Manhattan community boards are already planning to do.
You know the schedule of the Community Board Committee meeting.
Think last week, or maybe the officers contacted to say that you know city planning would like to make this presentation.
I will touch base with Ebenezer and out to see if they receive anything, but I would think if it were referred out on October 19th, then sometime, you know before a week or ten days ago.
Well, Whether we need to reiterate those recommendations, I, don't think Annie was with city planning, I, don't know if she was with city playing at that time, but she was not our representative.
I think that I do just want to say that if you get us the recommendation in January, that's going to be okay.
We, actually think that this is going to cut down on a lot of the abuse of this, because there was no requirement to necessarily put your occupiable floor level at that flood elevation, So property owners were kind of automatically given this height variance, but might not necessarily be completely flood proofing, their lower level.
Let us know if you want us to do the full presentation again or potentially just focus on the areas that there's outstanding questions or concerns about and happy to take any of those via email.
Certainly, okay, Thank you and, as I said, I will certainly check with the office to see if they receive digitally any other information, and if so, you know when that occurred, but typically when something comes into the office, I get a an email asking whether we want to add it to the agenda.
I think there are certain neighborhood, specific plans that were addressing very vulnerable communities.
Think generally, We found that there is a large part of the cities, including you know.
New buildings are often made to last a hundred years and yet I think your time frame only goes out to 2050.
To, but I know that there's kind of certain legal restrictions as to how we designate flood areas.
Well, I can look a little bit more into you know considering this has been an area that has had some flood risk for a very long time.
And I know that when we initially approached city planning with this question, you pointed out that building department's responsibility was to do the zoning review and see what was applicable and one of the documents that apparently they worked on a year ago, but only go through now.
We really need city planning to take a look at that to see whether or not what the building department has written is at all accurate and is even in their jurisdiction on which to apply sure.
But, I, think and as in the last meeting, Someone made it clear that it's like the building department is answering the wrong questions.
I think Tim was and probably, but in any case would probably give you a much clearer sense of you know what the specific question is that we need city planning to take a look at these.
