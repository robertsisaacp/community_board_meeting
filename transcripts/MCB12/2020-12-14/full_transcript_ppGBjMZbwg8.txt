All you have to do is hit that button and anything that you want to share on your screen. You can share oh great okay, so maybe I should just share right now, like in case you want to have your agenda or any other things as they come up, but I know that I want to make sure that you see it, because that's the same thing that your presenters are going to see when they share their screen.

Thank you all right so good evening. Everyone and thank you, members of the youth and Education Committee for giving amber the opportunity to present today. My name is Veronica Almerina, as Faye mentioned, and I'm the chief schools officer for Amber charter schools this evening alongside me, as panelists, we have Dr Vasya Costa, our executive director, Christine Daney. Our chief communication officer and Amber's Inwood founding principal Miss, Anna Vargas. We look forward to sharing with you the history of Amber charter schools and our excitement in opening our third school in Inwood, this September of 2021. So it's super exciting and we're so happy to be here tonight to share this alongside you all. We're gonna go on to the and I'm just going to share a little bit about myself. So I've taught an education for about six years in the elementary school sector, I taught at Amber Charter schools, I was a fourth grade teacher there in east, Harlem and I began my journey as an administrator by joining the emerging leaders fellowship program alongside Miss Christine Gainey, who will be speaking about it as well shortly and throughout this journey we really found the love to lead and in doing so, I soon became the dean of students at Amber. East Harlem I served there as the assistant principal and then I was the founding principal of Amber Washington Heights. So, yes, we were in Washington Heights. It was bittersweet. We were there for a year, but we found our permanent home in Kingsbridge, and so I became the principal at Amber, King's bridge and so now to be able to share with you all that we're going back to Washington Heights brings us utter joy and I'll share with you a little bit of why, because Emperor Washington Heights really was what our dream was 20 years ago and to be able now in 2021, to say that we're coming back to the community really brings us joy and excitement. So that's a little bit about me. So speaking of the history of Amber Charter school, we were founded in 2000 as the first Latino led charter school in New York state by the Community Association of Progressive Dominicans, also known as Fedepe, which is a community-based organization that was founded in 1979 and has since developed high quality programs that provide assistance to 27,000 children and families annually in the Washington Heights community. So hence our excitement about opening a school in Washington Heights, because our funding organization has deep roots and so to be able now to open, amber Inwood is really a dream. Come true for us in the fall of 2017, we moved our temporary Washington Heights location, as I mentioned earlier, to our permanent space in Kingsburg and in east Harlem. We serve over 500 students in grades K to 5th and in Kingsbridge. Presently we serve over 475 students in grades K-5, so to speak, a little bit about Amber's, Mission, Amber Charter school has not only created a program that produces strong academic performance, but more broadly, it addresses the learning and the development needs of the whole child through enrichment offerings, which Ms Anna will share with you shortly and a comprehensive range of supports. All of our schools pride ourselves in ensuring a rigorous and comprehensive core academic experience. We support students in multiple ways and you'll learn a little bit more in the upcoming slides. We create an educational community that celebrates culture which is so important during these trying times and fosters a love of learning and last but not least, we provide clear pathways to middle school, high school and college. So now I'm going to turn it over to our executive director Dr Vasti Acosta. Thank you, hi everybody. You can read my background there, I'm going to start with the last sentence, and the last sentence is that I was born and raised in Watson, Height and so I am a living breathing Washington Hyper, my father has passed through the church in Washington Heights on 179th street, in Audubon Avenue for 60 years, I taught at Ps 115, which I also attended as a child, and then I went and was a teacher there I also taught I was a leader at Ps210. Together with my husband, we were community activists and even helped to found acetebe as well as Allianza, and my husband was a member of the school board when they existed. He was also a member of the community planning board. I think that Maria Luna can attest to everything that I'm saying is true. A shout out to her she's known me since, before I even had children, when my husband and I were boyfriend and girlfriend, and now I'm a grandmother, so she's known me for a long time. She knows what I say is true. We have deep roots in this community. I live in Inwood I actually live on. Park Terrace East, so everything that's going to happen to that school in that building is going to affect me and I. Am super proud and excited to be able to bring amber to our community and to bring parent choice to this community. So that's who I am and I will turn it over to Christine. Can you get to me? Okay, thank you just working on the side, one! Second, it's okay! We have time that's a good day. Okay sounds good! Thank you for your patience good evening. My name is Christine. Gainey I started at Amber over 15 years ago, as a second grade teacher and team leader in east Harlem, then with Veronica I, attended, emerging leaders, program and joined Amber's leadership team as a staff developer. I am now in my fifth year, serving as Amber's chief communications officer and amber is dear to my heart, and I'm super excited to open our third location. Now, I will turn it over to miss Anna Good evening. Everyone I'm so excited to finally be able to address all of you directly. As my wonderful and esteemed colleagues just mentioned, my name is Anna Vargas and I am the new, the newest member of the amber family as the founding principal of our third school located up in Inwood. On this slide, you will see some things that you should know about me, but more. The thing that I am most proud of is the fact that I am born. I was born and raised in Washington Heights I attended district 6 schools. I did not attend Ps115, even though later on, with the rezoning that would have been my zone school. So that's where my siblings attended, but it's just as a teacher as a leader. It was always an absolute dream to come back to Washington Heights and be able to create, as Dr Vasti mentions, choice for the community, and so with that choice. I am bringing forth my nearly two decades of experience, not just teaching but also leading and founding across K-8 settings. I've also been a graduate school professor, which comes in incredibly handy when trying to develop new teachers or more senior teachers in different areas of expertise. I have a bachelor's degree from Fordham University. My first graduate degree was from pace university and then, lastly, of course, I have a degree from Bank Street University, where I was able to attain my educational leadership credentials. So now that you know a little bit more about me, I'd love to go on to the and let's talk about Inwood in this incredible building that we are going to be hosting these beautiful children in so Amber Inwood is located between park, Service, East and Park Service West on 215th street. The exact location is listed here during our opening year, which will be the fall of 2021. We're slated to open with grades K and 1. The Inwood building will also serve as an incubator for our Kingsbridge building for our Kingsbridge middle schoolers, specifically so we'll also be housing fifth and sixth grade, and that will give bring our total student count to about 400 students for year, one moving forward as we grow the school by. We will be growing it by one grade per year, one at the elementary level and one at the middle school level, and so that this means that we will not be opening to the full scale year, one or even year. Two. It will be an incremental growth over the span over the next few years, please, and so at our school, we're focused on academic rigor and enrichment, which means that our students have the opportunity to both shine as scholars, but also deepen their interests in other areas. So our students spend about 90 minutes of their days. Centered 90 minutes of their school day is centered around literacy and math instruction, and we also offer science and social studies content for 90 minutes of the week. Our students apply their understanding following the station learning models and then also excuse me and those tours. We also ensure that we are working to maintain the cultural wealth that all of our students bring, and so we offer spanish classes to all of the learners enrichment classes for enrichment classes. We offer music art movement and technology and because students come in with a gamut of needs, we also ensure that we are supporting our most neediest learners with sets title one. Reading services we offer tutoring and for students who are acquiring English as a new language, similar to how I was when I started school. We also offer ENL services, please, and so here's just a highlight of just some of the incredible things that our students do within their school day and their school year. So indulge me as I confidently and proudly share some of these photographs of our students that very first photo is our students in their music class playing on xylophones. The second image is our students in an after school ballet club and the next we have our triumphant winners after a spelling bee and the last picture on the right in the top row is our student council. In the bottom, we have some students posing with great pride and as a class, some hands-on science activities, a publishing party and, of course, sports, because we need to move our bodies, please, and so of course, and Faye. You were talking about this before right, the importance of community partnerships and making sure not just that the community knows about you, but that you are actually being an asset to the other organizations that exist within the community and in our two schools. We have established deep partnerships with these organizations. However, we and they support us with everything from our after-school programming, our mental health services, that we offer Sim swimming classes for our students and each year we search for new opportunities, and so this will be no different, as we branch out into Inwood Veronica is going to talk through some additional ways in which we partner with the community. Thank you, miss Anna, so at Amber we pride ourselves in our character traits and one of them is community and with that being said, weep every year, last Friday in may go out as a school community to give back, and so throughout. The year the children participate in lessons to learn about the community. How do we serve the community? How we are a part of the community December 1st was giving Tuesday and our students learned the importance of giving and showcase that not only through their virtual learning but as well. We showcased them on social media, and so part of Amber is knowing the importance of giving back to the community, because together we serve as one. So here are some pictures of our fourth grade student leaders. Our fourth graders serve as our trailblazers in our community service initiatives. We also have pictures here of our students giving back and going out into the community and then, as Miss Anna mentioned, the external partnerships that we pride ourselves in, and we look forward to building those partnerships as we are coming into Inwood in September of 2021. So now I'm going to turn it over to Dr Vastia, I'm Costa cute. That's a cute feature! Sorry, so we're we'll be after our presentation with you. We've been invited to also present community board traffic and transportation committee, and so we wanted to share with this committee what we will be sharing with them as well and to address some of the concerns that maybe some of the residents have. We want to acknowledge that we're always as all charter schools are required to give priority to the community residents in the student lottery system, and we will do that as we have for all of our other schools. We have decided not to provide business because the streets are so narrow in that neighborhood that any school busting would only create more congestion, and we didn't want to bring that. We have already decided that we're going to have staggered, drop off and staggered pickup schedules in order to accommodate the children that will be arriving and dismissing. We will encourage all of our families to make sure that they take public transportation in order to go to come to school and as you see, we will survey the families after we have done registration. We won't have the lottery until April. We won't begin registering children until late April, early May, and so we won't really know the families that will be attending until that time, but once we know the families that have accepted our offer, we will survey them to see what their travel plans are. There is the turnaround cultist that we hope to use to help direct traffic during the two moments of the day that it could. There could be some high traffic in there and we know that the middle school children usually travel in New, York City. They travel independently to schools, so the middle school children will probably not be a concern when it comes to the traffic that may happen in that neighborhood and then. Finally, we will support the community if they want to advocate for a four-way traffic, stop on 215 and park terror west if they choose to advocate for that, we will support the community in that request. All in all, we just want to make it very clear that we will do everything that we can to be good neighbors, that's how we have been in both of our other schools, and we will continue to be good neighbors at Inwood as well. Next we're open now, let's pay for question all right, very good, all right, so let's then go back to the okay, so the title screen all right. Allow me just one second: before we open up the face of questions because I know they are members, but they are that they are not here when we started and I want to make sure that they identify themselves members that arrive late. Please can you identify yourself. My name is Christina. Riches I was on the other side for some reason, the attendees and so I was waiting to be switched over, but very nice to meet you all. This has been a wonderful presentation: I look forward to hearing more about your school and visiting, hopefully once we're open, but definitely nice to meet. All of you guys, thank you for being here today. Thank you. Next member hi, everyone, my name- is Glennis Aquino Gill. Thank you so much for joining us tonight, sorry I was running late. I did get to see your great presentation. Thank you so much for letting us know. What's in the works and what's coming to our community, we look forward to continue working with you. Thank you. Anybody else, Jonathan, are you there Guillermo Median James, I'm here all right, I just want you to identify yourself. Thank you. Okay, I didn't hear you darling, because some of you didn't realize that you are you know new I mean muted, so I'm glad that we all here so okay. So let's proceed then with the questions. Now. This is how we're going to or usually we do, this members committee members had a priority. I mean all day. They asked questions first and then we turned the question to the general public. Okay, who has questioned Maria? Yes, Maria, hi, everybody well, I, don't have a question but I need I. Allow me to make a little a very short statement. I am so glad to see Dr Chobashi Acosta, but for the members of the community board the entire community. Well, not just the youth and Services Committee Bashi is married to someone so dear to us, especially to the dominican community, to the entire nation, because Rolando Costa, who was a member as she said, of our community war, a member of so many organizations I was you know, glad to be part of this election when he became a judicial candidate for the civil court, but most important. He is sitting right now at the presiding justice of the New York appellate court of the New York state. That means that if we could push a leader, we may see him on the Supreme Court of this land. If we get our eye together as dominican as people concerned about what is important to the immigration community, so Bashi, I'm glad to see you I'm glad to see you that asila and Lucas and the kids are doing well and one of the recommendations that I would like to see in the future. Not now is that maybe there will be an opportunity within your school's program to have more than a bilingual community, just spanish and English, but maybe since we Jedis so close to seeing our community, especially in the area that you're going to be operating 215 street, where there are so many jewish people that we like to integrate in our community and to our education system. So put that thing on the back of your head, but I'm glad to see you and good luck, of course and say hi to Rolando. Thank you all right. Next. Anybody else has a question all right. I guess I will post the questions. Okay, yes, I, wasn't sure of whether or not I hear you speak about the specifically about the what type of bilingual education or dual language education, because I understand that same bilingual education is not really well received or perceived. So let's call it dual language education. So if like what kind of program you provide, are you planning to progress? So we do not have a dual language program. What we have is spanish as the foreign language program, which is very different. Yes, okay, well, Bilingual English only Spanish as well. We teach Spanish as a foreign language. We find this different subject, it's a separate subject and we teach it to everyone. It's not a dual language, so we would not be teaching a dual language, usually teaches content areas like math and science in both languages. We don't do that. We teach all of the content areas in English only in one language and then we teach every student spanish as a foreign language. Okay, let me ask you, then this question I understand. Maybe I am wrong, I'm not sure, but I understand. This is one of the requirement of New, York, States and I. Don't know if this is true, or this is not that the state requires school to provide to harvest this kind of program. Is that correct, I think what the state requires is for us to serve children that do not speak English and to provide them with some kind of assistance in order to learn in order to learn English. So we do have English as a new language conference, and we do address those children that come with another language. We have different languages. Besides Spanish we have children that come with very different languages, that they don't speak English in our schools, so we offer them English as the new language classes and sport. Okay, well, I think that may it'll, yes, I, certainly will. Let me just finish this. Thank you Maria. So the next question that I have Anna is the: what is your school specialized? You know what is your specialty and I under and also the numbers grade that you would be teaching I, don't know if it's from six to a or you know sure so, as I was explaining the very first, we are slated to be a k through eight school right at full capacity. We will be k through 18. for the first year. However, we will only have k and one who will be Amber Inwood students, however, because we will also serve as an incubator for a Kingsbridge building. We will also have fifth and sixth grade in the building, but they will be amber Kingsbridge students. However, eventually as we grow one grade per year, amber and wood will be k through 8, okay and any specialty that you want to call that your school concentrate on it like. If you go ahead, Veronica I think Veronica was going to say something: oh Christine or Dr Acosta, which one I think we already shared. What our enrichment opportunities are as well as the fact that you know, as we do have what's called the amber way, and there are five character traits that embody that we teach our children and that we expect all of our staff and faculty to demonstrate, and so there are five character traits achievement, responsibility, community honesty and respect, and those are imbued in everything that we do not just in the classroom but outside of the classroom as well. I see this more like a sortable values, combined with what you're just saying, but what I'm referring is. For example, we have a school that, for example, let's say a George Washington. We have a school that they only specialize in health, for example, other schools specialize in sciences. That's right. That would make sense if we're talking about high schools, but this is an elementary school and therefore we're more focused in making sure they learn how to read and write and have a strong foundation academic foundation so that they can build on that foundation as they continue in their educational career. So there is no special well, which is also why we offer the enrichment classes because early on right, we also want to make sure that they understand that there are other things to explore so that once they do enter the high schools and then later on college, they can continue to deepen their understanding of these areas that we started their interest in. So basically, you have several specialties that are concentration, so it's not necessarily one or two. So you have several so we offer a multitude of engagement opportunities, and this is important because the same way that you're concentrating in so many areas, they are a school that they only specialize or concentrate in one or two areas. For example, we have a school like the whim that specializes only the concentration in music. You know so your school and many other child school may want to just specialize in science. So they may want to specialize in something else. There is a particular area that they like to concentrate, and that was my topic, but I'm glad that you not only concentrating one thing: let's not call it specialized, but you concentrate in seven area. But this is not your specialty constraint. You know what I mean right yeah. Yes, so you concentrate in several areas, but do not specialize in particular area, which is the difference that I'm trying to you know to bring or give you some light. Do I have any. Let's see what is the other question that I may have? No I may come back to you so Maria. So let me allow you to go ahead and ask a question. Besides Maria anybody else have any questions. Okay, actually, I have a question. Yes, okay! Well, let's Mariah go ahead! Thank you, Maria, yes, quality! Please! Thank you! Maria! Thank you! Marin hi everybody I, want to say thank you for presenting for the wonderful presentation. I just wanted to ask well two questions: is this school correct me if I'm wrong, because I'm trying to think of like where exactly it's going to be? Is it like right near Inwood park like, but it's between it's on to 15, between Park Terrace, East and West? Okay, so the park is down the street from us yeah, okay. Now I'm just trying to think no because I over when I heard you guys say that the street is very narrow with regards to having buses and stuff for students. Yes, I'm just trying to yeah that street is really narrow, so I kind of I totally understand why you guys made that decision, but I also wanted what I really wanted to ask was how can if interested or somebody else may be interested in like joining your charter schools board or something like that from that level? How could somebody go about it? Dr Bosti? Would you like to address that question? How would I was looking at the Q&A and trying to answer those questions? The question was: if someone was interested in joining the board, how would they proceed? Oh the board of the School Board. Yes, I think that, in order to join the board of the school, you have to be invited by if there's no application, it's an invitation. It is it's a private board of directors. You can visit our website so that and on our website we have highlighted who are the members of our of the board that oversees the organization, but that's by invitation only okay, understood. Thank you. So much for your answer. Thank you. I also have a question: if it's possible, don't have done. Okay, please yeah, sorry that I wasn't here the very beginning when you started giving such important information about this institution. So I'm wondering how you guys select your population in this school. What is a method you use or anything? Yeah? That's a phenomenal question so similar to many charter schools. We do use a lottery system, so anyone it is open to the public. Anyone who is interested and meets the criteria in terms of the grades is more than welcome to apply we as we grow. Second, third, fourth, fifth, and so on. Those seats will also become available in the coming years for year. One we are, the lottery is for kn1 unless you're interested in looking at the lottery for our other two schools who are fully grown. So it's the lottery which then gets pulled in April and the, and you can actually find the link on our website as well sounds good I was about to ask about darling yeah, and another thing is when you guys moved to this new location on West 215. I'm sorry could you. When did you move to the new location where you where okay, this is located right now, so we are going to open the building to our students in the fall of 2021 right now, it's under construction, and you will very much see that because there was another school in the building, and so we are repairing it and preparing it for all of our incoming amber Scott our amber stars for the fall of 2021. Thank you for your answers. Maria back to you. Thank you, Jonathan Maria, back to you, please, I'm sorry! No! My question was going to be about the building. Did you do you own the building, or are you going to rent or what's happening on that side that wasn't the question I was going to have? Actually so you you're going to buy it, you already purchased the building. We have not purchased the building. We are leasing the building all right. So you have a long. You know oh yeah, we have. Yes, we have I'm afraid to have something static, good and being faced with this reality that we have right now not only up here but all over about you know, keeping in one place for the after. You know you invest so much in a school, be faced with having to relocate or look for another place, and you know absolutely we're investing quite a bit of money in renovating the building, which is in some disrepair right now, and so we plan to be there for many years. Okay, all right! Thank you, Dr across that. So when you open up next year, I got well in so this. The school that is still there are you gonna share the building with them or they just gonna leave. They have already left the building is empty right. Now the building is empty right now we will be starting renovations within the next month. Oh all, right, okay, so, okay, let's proceed to. Let's see who else may have another question anybody else, I'm trying to address the questions that were put in the Q&A and if I missed it, I'm sorry and answer questions. At the same time, I was going to go in there yeah, but I want okay, I want to give preferences to the committee after that, we'll go back to that. So you can see the question so anybody else, any members have any questions. Yeah I do Marion. Okay, your criteria after the child has gotten through the lottery. What's the criteria? Is there a grading criteria? No, there is not. Are you referring to possible screening once students have been? No? So what's the screening process, the screening is you applied to the lottery and you were selected from the lottery. That is essentially the process. Okay. So if a child gets through the lottery and they're struggling, it's a child, that's struggling in public school, regular public school will they still be accepted? Yes, all right, so I believe we don't have another member with questions. So, let's jump quickly because I believe that by eight o'clock you have to be at the traffic yeah. Yes, thank you. So we have a question from Richard Gorman. The question is: what are your plans for recess? So recess will happen inside the building just like we run it in all of our other schools and we would take them to Inwood park origin park down the block, but most mostly because of all that, you know the winter months is too cold. They would probably be the recess would happen inside so it would be between inside or walking them down to Eastern Park. All right! Thank you. Let's see, maybe Anna and Christy want it. Also they so quiet. They want to participate okay. So the next question actually is anonymous is say that this is what they asking. Where do you plan to hold your students, recreation or slash recess, etcetera? That's a very similar question to the question that Dr Vasy just answered we're fortunate enough have a very special building. We intend on having our students use the space indoors. However, we do also hope to take advantage of the nearby parks as well. Let's go to the bottom and see because I, I'm not sure that we're gonna have all the time to answer this question. Let's see Susan Wright, she says your school sounds lovely by the way. It just has a huge amount of students for this small area on top of a hill with very limited street assets and parking. Where will the staff people park or are thinking to park? I think that none of our schools have staff parking. We have other schools and none of our schools have stock parking and the staff figure it out. They will probably use the local parking garages that are on Broadway or on 10th Avenue, or they will choose to use public transportation because we never provide parking for staff, so they have to figure it out and they usually do yeah, okay and I can attest to that after teaching and leading all over New York City for the last 20 years, I drive everywhere. For the most part, there were times that I had to commute on public transport. You figure it out, it's not a novel problem and it's just something you have to figure out, not just as a teacher and leader in New York City, but just as an employee in New York City. We don't always have the benefit of having secured parking. That's correct all right, so the next question is Isiah. Park will be used by 900 students, not Inwood, and let me tell you this use your own discretion. You don't have to answer those questions. If you find that you have the answer or you're not sure so, but we're trying to. If we don't have the answer, we will admit that and say we'll get back to you and find the answer, but we want to answer as many questions as possible, we're coming to a community that we, you know are committed to so for obviously we can not pour 900 students into any into Israel park. Our other schools have, you know close to 500. As you know, and there we you have a schedule, it is stagger. Not all the children have races at the same time and not all the children go to the same location for reasons on the same time or in the same day, it's you create schedule. Some of them are in the gym. Some might be somewhere else, so you create a schedule so that we, you don't bombard any location with 900 students, but you know there would be a schedule and it would never be a whole dumping of children we're responsible for those children while they're in our care. Let me tell you: we take that very seriously, all right, so having only eight minutes actually I would say five minute length, or maybe three minutes left so give you some time. So you join then so I just wanted to introduce our next quickly, our next presenter. So he can briefly tell you know, introduce himself. He already. You know already hear you so I just wanted to say I'm sorry for the rest of the question, but the is upon us, but I want to make sure that I do this introduction when it comes to building relationships. I'm big on that I love it, and hopefully this is something that I will continue, expanding and promoting, and supporting so and I wanted you to know that I might be introducing you with other folks in the community just for collaboration as well. So Giselle, I'm here, yes hi there. So let me just introduce you briefly before we do the official introduction, but at least you want to tell them- and you know about your program and your interests. Yes, hello, nice to meet you all, and definitely it's beautiful, to hear about your school and the your values and everything and I. So many ideas were popular in my head already, because with our organization it seems like a lot of our values align when it comes to what we do musically as well. So I'm looking forward to further conversation with you and getting to learn more about your school and how we can work together, possibly in the future. So definitely, but do you want to do the introduction, should I introduce myself? Well, yes, just tell her what your organization does briefly the discolor me follow. Let me just introduce you so just go ahead and introduce yourself just tell what you do and then all right as well. My name is okay, sure my name is Hasel Montez and I'm the founder and executive director of internal creations, which is the arts non-profit, focused built on a mission to develop leadership, self-sufficiency and life skills through learning the classical guitar right. So you know more or less. We work with schools, we work with community centers and we work with right now with MIH victory clinic with Dr Garcia, which is a mental health and substance abuse clinic. We have a program in there at the moment on 180th and St Nicholas Avenue long story short. Our philosophy is that we teach music in relation to life skills right now. At the moment, we're focused on junior high and high school students and are currently developing our elementary school curriculum for stringed instruments, specifically towards building the classical guitar skill set for young children that will transfer over to their junior high school and high school years as well. So one long-winded training, I guess you could call it so yeah, I'm born and raised in Washington Heights too. So I'm glad to see a lot of community. We probably bumped each other in the street at some point- and you know I just thought, I'm glad to see some faces that were deeply rooted here as well and in a nutshell, that's pretty much. What we do I had a whole presentation ready to go that I'm getting so, but I definitely look forward to speaking with you on a one-to-one I know, fame, couldn't possibly arrange that if you want to reach out to each other directly, I'm more than happy to do so and answer any questions as far as how we can proceed further in the future. If anything, and thank you for everything that you do I appreciate you wonderful to meet you. Thank you, everyone for the time you've. Given us we're sorry, we do have to jump off now on, but we really appreciate the time that you have given us tonight, good night, everyone. Thank you. I'm going to follow up with an email between both of you, so we can continue the conversation thanks again for joining us this evening. I appreciate it and good luck. Thank you. Yes, thanks again, okay, let's proceed with Giselle, I'm sorry that was too quick, no I, don't know, but I really wanted to make sure that you know they get to know you. They get to see you and perhaps any question that they may have. So when I do the introduction it will be, you know at least would be familiar. Yeah can further elaborate into you know the face of the name, yes and I'm sure, since they don't have a like a precise area of concentration. That would be the program that you provide. I think it would be very helpful. You know to their school absolutely and to the surrounding community as well. Definitely all right so moving forward. What you do tell us about. You know your organization. When was creating what you do? You don't feel if you need to repeat what you say just do it so we can digest because I know that was a quick face. You know I'm used to those. You know the what they call the elevator pitches right, but I do have a presentation set up for everybody and everybody who's streaming on Facebook on YouTube anywhere we're streaming for I do have a presentation for you very short. You know I'm very concise and to the point, because I'm very aware of everybody's time and what we have to get done in the agenda so before that I do want to say that everybody who is asking the questions- those are some great questions and I do hope that they are followed up on. So I will advocate for that as well, because those are very precise questions for the previous school very important for everybody to know. I'm going to share my screen now and I will get on with who I was, but so, if I can have the sharing the screen sharing option, that would be amazing, and when that is done, please let me know so that way. I can begin that part of the so I believe you and your screen. You have asked us to share screen, which is in green area, yes, and there you can share. If you have any yeah, it tells me that the host disabled attendee screen sharing yeah. Let me give me one second, let me try to help you out there. Thank you, I'm dragging that parlor paula is actually the host yeah. She can grab your account. We unfortunately also I've been asking, so we can put do the transmission to YouTube. We we're not in YouTube, okay yeah. We can't do it at the same time because there's another committee on it who's the person that needs to speak just so. It's me I got this already. He can share a screen already, I'm there already I told him, but he said that he was not able. Thank you Paula, okay, beautiful is everybody able to see my screen. I know it says. Yes, we can see your instagram beautiful, excellent, so I'll get started right away. First off you know good evening to all of you, my Washington Heights family, whether I know you or not, I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and to introduce you to an organization that I have founded and I continue to run for the past six years and I hope very dear to my heart. I also want to just say thank you Faye for providing the opportunity to speak to everybody in the community, who's watching remotely and who's attending. As an attendee here- and you know for meeting the fellow change makers from the school that we just heard from Ms Vargas at Medina, it's a costume is gaming. So a little bit about me, my name is Hassel montez I am the founder and executive director of Internal Creations Inc, which is a non-profit with the mission to develop leadership, self-sufficiency and life skills through learning the classical guitar as I showed earlier. You know, I'm a Washington has born and raised you know native as well. You know I've been here. 32 years of my life and I have a deep passion for Washington Heights, because that is always going to be home, no matter where I am and also our New York City Youth. The guitar is an instrument that saved my life when I was a young man and it helped me learn what was possible when proper work and discipline was put into learning a skill. So, besides it being a way to stay off the streets when I was out in fort trying when I was on 185th and autobahn and I was hanging out with the clicks, you know it made. It helped me express myself in a universal voice that we all understand, because it's based off feeling and it helped open doors, a possibility that I never thought would be possible with that when I was in college, I went to SUNY, Fredonia and I was studying music education. There I did not understand discipline and what to do when it came to building musical skills or just being having good work ethic believe it or not, and I was almost kicked out twice of college by the professor, who is now the president of our board of directors at internal creations. So once I flipped, the script and I actually began putting in my discipline, putting in the work and understanding that, if I wanted to get good at something I needed to actually do the work. You know it opened up a whole door of opportunities for me that really you know, changed my world and made me the person that I am today most notably when I was on tour in Germany and France were the guitar quartet that I was in at the time, and that only happened because I put in the work. So me a Washington Heights kid never thought I would be across the ocean setting foot in Europe, let alone on tour playing music. That was like mind-blowing for me and a life changer. So that's definitely something there and with that this field, the passion in me to really make sure that the youth here in Washington Heights and in New York City, to understand how and be aware of these disciplines and how they can help expand the possibilities in their world and not just stay limited into what we think or what we are told, is possible for ourselves. So I'm going to move on to the here and you know the name internal creations, a lot of people get confused by this they're like internal creations. How is that musically related well before I get into what the heck is internal creations? I want to first give you a thought in order for something to become reality. It first has to begin with an idea, and that idea is then coupled with passion, which is from the heart two things that are internal, anything that we have comes from there once we take those two internal catalysts and put the action behind it, then it's as simple as writing. A thank you card before you write you think about what you're saying you think about the emotion that you're going to put into the words that you're going to be giving to that person. Then you actually take the action to write it out, and then you become something tangible. You create something the computers were on the phones. We were using the chairs we were sitting on. It all became with an idea followed by the passion that was fueled by actual action, and now we take it for granted every single day. That is the power of what music teaches us, and you know that. That's what music teaches us naturally, and now it's time for us to expose that to the students, instead of overlooking it, have conversations on this and help them understand how to bridge the two together, how music, learning and life skills actually do join together for anything that we choose to do in our life. So again, what the heck is internal creations, we're an arts nonprofit to develop leadership, self-sufficiency and life skills through learning the classroom, guitar the fun part right. How do we do this? We provide free of charge programs to participants as we partner with schools, community centers and, as I said before, and I alluded to. We work with MIH victory, mental health and substance abuse clinic with Dr Garcia, and when does this happen? Normally we always follow the Department of Education school year, so we start September or we start actually July 1st to June 30th of the following year and we make sure to provide services within that time frame. So that's a little bit about us in internal creations. We have different programming. One is our actual guitar programming or guitar education program in which we host in the schools like I, said before at this moment, we're focused on middle junior, high and high school students and beyond. Obviously so you know, we are here to make sure that we teach the life skills through this through as a unit as a guitar ensemble as a community. Our curriculum is based off a family-based community, meaning that each one of those students that you see in this picture is not just learning from me, but that we're all learning from each other. Hence why we're sitting in a semi circle, because if we could do a big circle that we would, but we would probably smack each other with the guitars in the process, which is not always a good thing right liability reasons. So, while we're doing that, if a student is struggling, they help one another. You know we think of it as like the tribal essence of what of community and with this they can be comfortable with each other. They share with each other and nobody's hiding behind anybody. Everybody's always exposed right and as we're teaching. These life's lessons, I'm going to put another thought on your head. Let's think back to a time where we were able to figure something out or do something that we thought we couldn't right. We pulled it off somehow, and you were just wondering how what how did this happen? Something just you know it was great. It could have been that glass of wine we had about an hour ago that make you know who knows what it is, but usually when we do achieve something is because there is a process that was done behind it, whether we are conscious to it or not, and what we do in our guitar program is show them the steps, the conscious stuff that they take in order to get great at playing their instrument. They start off not knowing how to play an instrument and then end knowing how to play not only six ensemble mute songs, but then they also know how to play their guitar chords and be able to write their own compositions at the very end of it all so, I prepared also whoops I, prepared a little short video for you all, because I believe in showing and not telling so let the students here tell you what it is that they think all right and I wasn't really interested into music or like these kind of instruments. But then he said guitar and I was like wow. Let me try and maybe I might be good at it or like I, might use it as my hobby. What intrigued me, the most about playing the guitar, was learning how to play the guitar because, like it sounded interesting and I also wanted to learn something new. Something to keep me like in focus. What made me keep going as I like saw the progress that I was making and then at first, even my mom was like what are you learning like every day you go there like, we started doing songs and I had the recording of the song. They posted an internet creation, instagram and I showed it to her. She was like she was kind of surprised because, when I played my part, it was just like I was guitar number one right, so my part was just like kind of singled out, but with the ensemble when we played it came together, it was such a beautiful thing when I play guitar, it's just a lot more fun because I get to like feel the sound you know, because when you're producing, if you're like me, you have to use your speaker laptops or like really curvy headphones. You just can't really feel it very well, and then you know having the actual live music coming from the guitar. It's really nice like experiencing it with other students, is good because, like me, myself, I'm not a socializer so like talking to other students with something that, like that I know. I, like is good because it makes me feel comfortable coming together is kind of a struggle. That's why we work on it after we've got the whole song down, and then we focus on like the colors of the music and the like the tones of it. They just come to just for fun, but it's not all about the fun. It's all it's about struggle too, like it takes a lot of time to have those fun. I. Definitely do get frustrated, sometimes mostly because I can't reach like it's so difficult for me. So, like I end up just looking at the sheet and I'm just kind of looking over at everybody else, I just you know, do it by ear most of the time, but how I get through it is honestly just a lot of struggling beforehand and I feel in a way. I feel strong because, like it gives me a way to express how I feel and it like to me, it's like I'm learning something new every day, even if I'm playing the same song for like a whole week, yeah I want to keep this like a part of my life, because it's pretty amazing, that's the only thing I enjoy right now, like I, don't really have time to go out or have fun that much but like when I'm in my own space I actually get the guitar. This is something I will take on, because I feel like now. It's a part of me even if, like I, never see him again or that I never see them again very nice. So there we have it. This comes from these student smiles themselves because again, I'm more of a show, don't tell so whatever they said, that's what it means and that it always brings a tear to my eye, but I'm staying strong today. So you know moving forward with what we were talking about. Internal creations has a I, don't know where the slide went, but I guess not. So we go off with what we call the three p's. The three pillars of success is what we call them and within those three pillars we have different. Oh it's right here. Actually so the three p's here are things that we take and we need to apply and we should apply to our lives, no matter what area of work we do right, and these three come with subsections of life skills that we teach too and music naturally teaches us this right, I'm going to start with backwards. You know the perseverance part of it and perseverance. Obviously is this is well as the definition is there is knowing that things are going to be hard, but you're going to do it anyway, right because no matter how much struggle, how much time it takes, you're going to go and you're going to persevere, because you're going to use the previous two p's to make sure you break through that obstacle to that barrier, and obviously patience is one of them and I. Thank you all for your patience, while listening to this presentation at this moment, so you're already applying that to your life. Right now and then persistence just like anything else that we do also known as consistency. If we don't do something every single day, then of course we're never gonna get good at it right. So all these p's work together and music naturally teaches us that, because we have to be patient with ourselves when learning an instrument or doing anything because we're not gonna get the instant gratification that we're looking for it's gonna take time. Persistence is the daily practice that we need to put in order for these things to work, so everything works together and that's the philosophy behind internal creations and what we run as a culture within our organization plus our programming at this moment because of the pandemic, remote learning is possible. I thought it was going to be a very difficult thing to do, but I guess it's working, so the curriculum transcribed itself from in person to actually be remote and still being possible, and, as you see on the right, we also do offer a rock band program for one of our Brooklyn schools that we have so that is always an option there. Another part of our organization, okay and I'm sorry, I'm going a little fast, I'm just being aware of time, another pillar of our organization. Besides our guitar education concerts, is our community concerts and our community concerts is a way to bring people together. Music is a unifier. It's a natural unifier brings people together when we go see Bon Jovi in concert where we go see. Aretha Franklin concert back in the day. You know we would all be there, because we loved Aretha Franklin. We enjoyed her music and we will all sing together right. So the purpose of these outreach concerts are to bring everybody together and then also, you know, bring people together for a purpose beyond themselves and also be the catalyst that brings you. Peace, recall, beautiful memories, show peace, love and happiness and also as a way to get messages across if need be, for example, if the community needs something to address for the community, we know that this is going to be happening. This community concert so now's the time to have a moment to speak to everybody about what it is that we're concerned about in person. Well, when that was happening so moving forward, a part of our guitar education programs is community service, which is where we aligned also with the amber schools. We believe in giving back to the communities that we serve and learning how to give back. It's not just about. Oh, you gave me five dollars. I give you five dollars back it's more about. Oh I, don't have any money. How can I give back? Well, here's some ways and we teach our kids how to give back to the community in more ways than just money and with new skills as well, but it's unified with guitar, because what we do first is that we all the pieces that they're prepared in class they perform for whatever group that they're going to be volunteering with. So we have some examples here on the left. Is the soup kitchen that we volunteered with and the students performed for the actual attendees of that soup kitchen, while they were waiting for their meals and then they rolled up their sleeves and began helping to pack the meals as well the pantry and so over. Here in the middle picture, you have students helping each other on the train on the subway. You know so they're trying to figure things out last minute when I told them to practice but they're helping each other anyway, and then, if you see on the bottom over here and then to the right, they performed at a Montessori school in the Upper West side and the kids nev, who have never seen a guitar, were just enthralled and was going crazy and like slapping the guitar strings and experiencing something new for the first time and then obviously, during their educational hour, our students help them also learn what the students were learning at that time. So moving forward, I'm going to give you one. Last video before I adjourn this presentation, and this is from an actual principal from one of the schools that we work with. Currently it's a one minute, video and I hope you enjoy. Thank you. My name is Tom Mullen, I'm the principal of leaders, high school I've been working with internal creations for years and I know that it is an incredibly powerful program. It allows our students to express themselves through music and allow them to build their confidence, and, most importantly, I noticed that when they're in the program creating music they're happy, it changes the whole feel of the leaders community to have this group of students who are committed working hard, creating this wonderful music and then sharing the music with the community. They really own the internal creations program themselves. They are in charge of organizing the instruments they're in charge of making sure the class happens. It just shows you how much they care and the pride that they are taking in their experience here. My name is sorry about that and then to end this, you know I always like to pose a question of. How can we serve you? How can we serve your community centers, your schools? How can we serve your students, your kids, anything I'm always open to have a deeper conversation on how we can serve your kids through music. My contact info is on here in case that you want to reach out to me. You know one thing: I always love to have is a one-on-one conversation to you with you all and listen. We have two years in one month, so we must listen twice more than we speak, so whatever your concerns are whatever your needs are and now, however, we can definitely help through music, I'm all ears and I would love to have a conversation with you as individuals. It was a privilege to introduce my organization to you all as the community I will end this presentation with this, and thank you so much I appreciate you faith. Thank you so much for allowing this to happen and yeah. This is where it's at so any questions. I'm more than happy to answer. Please take down my information and I, encourage you to look at our website for more. The website is right under here, or you could just scan the QR code on the left side of my virtual background over here. So thank you very much. I appreciate it one more time, mwah! Thank you. Okay! Thank you, Yazel. Thank you. So much. Thank you so much a really wonderful presentation. So Connie's does anybody? Has a question: I: do yes, hi! Thank you, Jacil! Thank you very much for your presentation. I am very excited about your program. Have you been in contact? Oh actually, let me just ask you first, who are you currently working in partnership, especially Washington, Heights inward? Well, right now in Washington Heights we have a program with MIH victory in one avenue for their clinic there and I. Don't know where the background noise is coming from I hear so. Excuse me, I'm sorry who is who's speaking on the background, hello? Oh, it might be Gabriella herself. It looks like no I'm here. Okay, that was your face. I hear somebody speaking in the background yeah. No, it's Gabriela's background. So not that, oh, so to answer your question right now. That's who we are in contact with. We do have funding from the Danish Rodriguez for the he endorsed us for the fiscal year of 2020 and we've got another round of funding for 2021. and before we were also in partnership with high school for media and communications, with the amazing Juan Rosa and then after that program. After that, the school year ended. We were not able to get back into there because there was no contact that we could get with and so right now, that's why I'm introducing our program to everybody, because I want to make sure that we are aware of each other and that we can begin building these relationships and really grow a stronger presence and providing music alternatives to our youth here in Washington Heights as well, because I'm going to race here and live here awesome and that's why I'm asking so yes: I was thinking in Washington, George, Washington, High, school I work for catholic charities, so probably we will be able to contact again. Yes, since that you know Alianza program, which is the one that runs the community schools, both meeting communication and the health and science. So we can catch up. So in a couple of days, I'm going to reach out to you and see. If we can, you know, I can call you can put you in contact with Eddie Silva, which is the director for the Alianza program and we'll take it from there. Absolutely. Thank you so much that was interesting, yeah sure. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, Gabriella. Okay, anybody else, yeah, hey! How are you Jessa nice to see you again? Your presentation was so wonderful. I was I'm inspired by the three pieces myself. So just thank you for that. I was wondering: where do the students get the guitars from? Does the program provide a guitar, or do the students have to bring it themselves? No we're fortunate enough to have a great partnership with this other organization in Hungary for music that we've been to for the past six years since started, and they provide the guitars for us and we do everything in our power to provide the instruments for the students. All they have to do is show up wow, that's really wonderful, and so do the students get to keep the guitar at the ending once they're done with your program, or do they have to return it? They do have to return it. Unfortunately, they're not part of the pro they do have to return it, because then we're going to continue liability, but we do our best to get an abundance of instruments. You know world willing and eventually, if, like a student, really not you know, take one like get one for themselves. We do our best to accommodate. Accordingly, you know, but in order for the purposes of the future programs and future students, they have to return to the my last question is: how long is your course? How many weeks does it last a whole entire school year? So we usually normally begin in October, so 35 weeks, I believe was the school year so anywhere from 35 weeks below normally we begin October, because September is always the craziest time of the year, especially for junior high school schedules and all that change. So we normally begin October and we end in June. Okay, thank you so much and take care of yourself. You too, bye-bye anybody else. Anybody, Maria, okay, please Mariah. One of the things that I like to do as a member of the board of a member of the committee is to make sure that I either ask questions or I listen to the questions by the members of the board. That's why we are in one committee that is important to share ideas, questions, answers and things like that. My question to you, Mr Montes, is that are you teaching, music or just playing music, and if there is a difference in the type of music that you are teaching classical music or popular music? How do you develop your academic? You know program, absolutely I'll, be happy to answer that, so our we do a mixture of classical we do a mixture of well guitar, naturally, is a lot of spanish music, a lot of spanish, classical music, as you can see, and we do also integrate and do arrangements for popular songs in a classical guitar style. So we are teaching how to play guitar and also how to read music. So all the basics and fundamentals of music education they are learning. The only difference is that the focus is on the guitar as opposed to a violin or of yo shallow or any woodwind instruments. So to answer the question as far as what type of repertoire we use is a wider range from anything from Johan, Sebastian Bach, and you know to some a bachata piece and then to maybe a post Malone arrangement. You know something popular or Rosalia like so whatever is out there. You know that can be transcribed to guitar in a very effective and efficient way for them to play at their skill level. And do you have a I hope on the plans for the future to integrate other instruments? Many years there was a plans to have a classical orchestra up here and it just you know we couldn't find the means and the pictures yeah for all the young people to you know to learn to play, especially music. Anybody can play the guitar. It seems that everybody thinks that they can play the guitars or any instrument, and you know well, it doesn't happen, but my I hope my hope that if you have taken this into your hands, maybe you should look at for the future to expand this type of program, because it's especially important and I'm going to tell you something. If you have someone dying in a hospital bed in a coma, the last thing they lose is the hearing and music to then, would be the perfect scenes to listen if they are in that type of situation. So I ordered to continue and I think that the program is fantastic. But let me tell you forget about all those crazy musicians that we have on videos. Good luck to you. Thank you very much, and you know to quickly answer your question there. Yes, in the future, we do hope to introduce more instruments to our curriculum, to maintain the same philosophy, but to just to expand it and branch it out. Our niche is guitar because I do feel like there is already a plethora of choirs, a lot of orchestras and band instruments, like rock bands, even you know, and the guitar is also able to be played as a large orchestra, guitar orchestra and it's a instrument that has been losing a lot of not popularity. I, don't want to say, but the style of playing is something that's become a little bit put to the wayside and just everybody's so focused on just playing four chords, as opposed to the boundaries of that you can push with the guitar. But yes, I do hope. So as we get more funding as we go along and more support from you know our New York City, Community Washington Heights everywhere. We do hope to expand to other instruments and realize you'd pick the young people the better. It will be when you are 25 better if you're rich, no, I'm serious reach out to the young people, or you know, early students in the primary schools, and things like that. You will have a better it's a success on this and your plan. So thank you, Maria. Okay, thank you. Anybody else, Jonathan, okay, so nobody has any questions. Okay, so I do have a question actually I think I have two questions. The first question that I have is: what is the number of students or group? Let's call it, you know to have a class. We you, the majority of the time we like to keep our classes to at least 16 max, and the reasoning behind that is because of the space issues that we encounter and then two also to make sure that all the students get the proper attention that they need as opposed to students, because once you start having more than 16, it gets a little funky. When you have students who are still not understanding something and there's only one teacher to go around for everybody, so even though, when they help each other, it does work, but we like to keep it at a small scale in order to have more effective and efficient teaching as well. So it's kind of like the smaller classroom idea. So what you are saying is the sixth thing is like the maximum that you know that you will work with or the minimum program yeah. So like. Let's say: if it's all, let's say: if a group is split, Monday and Wednesday right, there's 16 students for that Monday Wednesday. Then there could be another set of 16 students for a Tuesday Thursday. You know, and that kind of idea or if there's different time blocks there, could be 16 students from let's say three to 5:30, and then there could be another 16 set of 16 for 5:30 to 7:30. You know so it could be split that way. So if we find any situation that perhaps let me want to put, they may have only 10 students, that's something that may not work like once. No 10 students could work too, like normally we what happens a lot. Is we usually get like 30 students sign up and then, as the programs, because they're after school they dwindle down? Normally we end up with sometimes like the maximum 16 and the lowest threshold is like eight, for example. So we'll have that and sometimes we've seen you know, there's been years where we've seen the student population drop to like four at most you know, and but we still continue the program with them with those four, because with a quartet you can still make a lot of music happen and the other question is: have you thought about, maybe including adult? Well, we do the adult program with MIH victory, because a lot of Dr Garcia's patients are adults, but it's a mixed bag there. They have also adolescents, they also have adults. So we have. We do a lot of this with adults as well, and we have done it before in our transit tech program, which is in Brooklyn, and we, where we had a parent class where we integrated the parents and then also their kids, would come with them. Sometimes who are also in the guitar program and the kids will help their parents learn how to play, and then they will have that bonding together at that moment, but we've had that in the past, so it could be a combination. Let's say that a father and son want to join the class, they might be able to do so they're. More than welcome to do so. Oh do they have to pay any fee nope free of charge for the students. We aim for that because of the fact that we don't want finance to be an obstacle for anybody not to experience music and last is your program provided in another state at this moment. No, but eventually we do plan on opening it up in Florida, where I would I will be moving full time within the next two years. You know if it's something if something comes along, you know, let's say Boston. For example, I can't recommend an organization that one would you be willing to consider that I mean yes eventually, but I do want to hone in first on our Washington Heights and New York City programming and make sure that we're strong enough here before we start spreading ourselves too thin, and you know once organizationally we're a lot more, a lot stronger, I guess you could say with the infrastructure, then by all means we do hope to expand and find ways to make that effective. All right, that's my questions. So can anybody else want to jump? No one, two and three! Thank you! Everybody! Thank you. So much for such a wonderful, you know presentation. We will be in touch soon and yes, we probably may come up with some recommendation for you. If I don't see you before Christmas again. No, you know I want to wish you all the best that I know personally that you deserve. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I wish this thing for you and for everybody on here. Yes, all right now we're gonna move to the section of the let's see community announcement. You're welcome to stay. If you want to, or you may leave as well as you wish. Let's see what is the document that I wanted to? What is the agenda? Okay, here's the agenda. Yes, that's what I wanted to share. So we are in the item number five. All right do. Is there any announcement, anybody listening? Do you have any announcement? No excuse me! I can hear you most of you are you can chew on you like this, so we can have a conversation if it's possible, please I, know you're listening to me, but you know I think it would be nice if I. If we can interact so I would love to hear you. I would like to see your face. I mean I, don't have to see your face, you might be busy, but at least let me hear you because being new doesn't do it for me, I need to hear people. You know what I mean all right, so I wanted to say that the announcement that I have is from DYCD, which is the neighborhood advisory board, but actually Giselle also is member of that committee. He just served as a vice president I believe until March, if I'm mistaken, but they are accepting application for anyone who wants to become a member and that if you want to contact the organization the contact person is his phone number is 646,343 64, forty, nine again Jorge, ah Mendivas Vendiva, Sal numbers cylinder I mean phone number, six, forty six, three, forty three six 6449 in case that you want to contact him now. I also want to provide his email address, which is first, initial J for Jorge and last name Mendez. So this is the announcement. Now, let's go back to our business, one more thing that I wanted to discuss with Callis. Okay, just give me one! Second, let me all right here: it is oh Kelly's. Moving forward next year, I say already, you know specified. This will be our last meeting for this year, so January 11 is going to be our first meeting for 2021 and back in 2016. 2017 I mentioned that I would like this committee to take turns. So each of you have the opportunity to direct this meeting. I think it's going to be very productive. So and what I'm looking for is to have you more engaged, I listening to myself, tiny time, I wouldn't know it again, but I think this would be a great practice if you guys take turn and direct the meeting as well so for January. First I would like to propose that what d direct the meeting I would like to start with him pending that he want to accept the idea and what, if he accept the idea, so I would like to know who will be willing to direct the meeting. That doesn't mean that I'm gonna be I'm gonna go somewhere, no I just wanted to distribute our responsibility and I think that having each of you exercising what I've been doing for so many years, I think it would be fabulous. I think it's a great idea now. What do you think about that? Yes, I love. The idea I think it's a great way to kind of engage everybody and yeah, I'm more than happy to lead on in January, 11th, correct, so you're the man in charge in January, 11 and God willing all right. Let's do it, I'm ready. Yes, thank you now. The next thing is, as you know, directing a meeting a 10 kid minutes. It's really rough I know this meeting are recorded, but the thing is that if you wanted to listen to the record and type the minute, that would be very helpful to keep. You engaged I think that the practice of only listening and selling making a question I think it's not enough for this committee at least that's what I wanted to bring to your attention. I want all of us to be more engaged and take more responsibility. So tonight precisely I hope someone take the lead and right in the minutes. You know all you have to do is just send me. The note I put it on the template, I edit it and I. Always you know, ask you guys if anything that needs to be changed or whatever you have the opportunity to provide your input, but we need to change. I mean change things the way we do this. You know this these meetings, so I really want you to be more engaged. You know along you know for the rest of us, so I guess in February who would like to take the other lead in February Jonathan. You want to leave the meeting on February. Well, February is too far away. Is it yes or no? Well, it's hypothetical! You don't have to things happen, but at least I have an idea when in February you have that meeting it's the Monday is the second Monday. You can always say: I can, or you know this time. I can not commit myself, but at least try to put me try to put me on March because February is not then okay March, all right Maria. What about you would like to go for February Maria? She left! Oh I'm here. Do you want to read direct the meeting on February and in February I can do it I have a commitment, January, 3 and March. So I'm sorry, okay, all right! Would you volunteer to take the minute of February? I'm telling you I may not even be around all right, but eventually, yes, you may want to help us and take me in as well right. You know my the one thing that I can do is I talk a lot I try to motivate all the other members of this committee to you know to come up with ideas, and things like that, because I've been around for 40 years on this boy, even the young people, to take leadership. Okay. So that means that you're not going to take in the entire year. One minute for us well I mean I'm not saying that what I'm just saying that at the beginning of the years, I really have another commitment so but yeah at least one minute that you do would be appreciated. Okay, see Maria, then I can come back and say: I can not make it so I. You know I, rather, don't you rather play by ear well, as of now, I'm just being truthful with all of you. Okay, very last question here: did you see yourself, police, cooperating and directing one single meeting? I always I have hopes that to meet a millionaire to take me away from all this you know also Maria, but your presence, it's just collaboration, I understand how big I understand. I can volunteer to direct a meeting in February I got you but listen. What I'm trying to do is that we all take responsibility. Talking is not sufficient and I. Think it's good. If we all cooperate. That's the idea Maria, because I have to take the minute and I have to also direct the minutes so and I think that if all of us do this together, I think it's a great thing, because eventually somebody else is going to be a chair. You know so, yes, we're not going to join a meeting just to sit in and have world wars that we have Glennis Paradise all these young people. Yes, we do and we have you as well. Yes, we have you yes to talk, that's not fair, all right, guys, Maria you're, gonna direct one of the meeting. I really hope so and I look forward to that, because it's not fair to them. Okay, we have paradise in February in March and January we have wildie. Okay, let's see Christina. You would like to direct me to some time. Let's say in may, maybe I can do after April. You can do April after yes, okay after eight, let's say June, then or may yes, June is good. For me, June is better yes, okay and look. This is not written on a stone. Okay, it's not so granny. What about Marge? Hey excuse me! Do you want to share your screen or it was by accident that you share your screen? Oh I'm sorry yeah, because we're reading all your emails I, don't you want to share right? Yes, sorry! Okay, sorry, yeah March works! For me, much is good for you. Okay, thank you. Just keep still sharing your screen. Let me help you out. Okay. This is good. I'm sorry is that I'm writing at the same time that I am you know this is not supposed to happen. I'm sorry, I'm so concentrating and taking notes. Okay! Yes, now let me tell you this anyone that will be directing the min the meeting or had committed today to direct a meeting not necessarily mean that I have to have that. Prior to the meeting the person with the Cali may say you know what Fred or Kalis I changed my mind. I can't I won't be able I'm ready not to do that, but for not at least I have an idea. Now. Responsibility doesn't end necessarily in there and trust me all I'm looking for is that to have you more committee and to collaborate more because you know just attending a meeting is not sufficient, but I understand also that if you not feel comfortable directing a meeting or taking a minute, I do understand that as well. But it's much appreciated because just thinking this way I've been directing this meeting at the same time that I am being taken. Minutes and I know that in many occasions, while they have helped me but prior when he wasn't with us other folks had but not necessarily consistently and it's very hard to direct a meeting and at the same time take minutes. So we are, you know, a team so and that's why I wanted to bring that to your attention, but I'm glad that you know most of you already are willing to do that. Gabby. If you want to direct a meeting one of these hour meeting, you you're more than welcome to I know you very busy as well. So all I need to know whether or not you will be able to direct, maybe June. If not, what do you think about that? I think I said June? No, yes, April is what I meant yes Gaby. Would you do April she left Abby left got me. Are you there? Well, she left no she's, not online okay. So all right and another things that I wanted to say is that take the freedom to invite anyone that you want to see to present in our committee, please by all means invite anyone that you think it would be. That would be a productive conversation. Our role, one of our main mission in this community, is to keep our community informed and I. Think it's very important that in case that you may not or has occurred you that, yes, you can invite anyone and you know that, but for those like Paradise, that is new, so Paradise. Any idea that you would like to bring someone from any agency or any program or any information that you think that can be relevant of the interest will be to the interests of our community by only please just be free. And yes, while one of you will be volunteering in those months, please don't let me ask you again just volunteer yourself to write the minutes because I notice, I, don't know why. But right in the minutes seems to be kind of hard. For you know some folks I guess they are too busy, but I not only ask you but I beg you please to be. You know more considerate. Just give us a little bit of a time and remember whatever know you put together: send it over and I will do you know I will do the rest as well and of course they invite two to two folks to speak in our community for everybody. So if I have not mentioned any names million, if you want to direct any meeting just let me know that you are willing to do so as well. I'll, let you know yes as well as taking me. Everything is open to everyone. I want to see you directing this meeting, so I can be the co-chair that night and we can do it together, but I want you to I, wanted to see you each of you in the driver's seat. Do we have an agreement on that? Yes sounds good. Yes, we do all right. Yes, I, look forward to that guys. I always appreciate your time, your wisdom and even your constructed criticism, because I know that it's a lot I can learn from you, so I just wanna. You know thank you for everything and I want to say that this meeting is going to be adjourned at 8:49. Do I have a second medium. Second, third gazelle. Thank you so very much again and I. Think I, don't know if there is I actually I apologize. I did not ask if anybody has any comment or anything like that.
