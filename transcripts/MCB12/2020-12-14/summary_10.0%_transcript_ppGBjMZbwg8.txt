Now, like in case you want to have your agenda or any other things as they come up, but I know that I want to make sure that you see it, because that's the same thing that your presenters are going to see when they share their screen.
Yes, because the panelist link, as I explained and on the email, it's just precisely for those presenting which is, and then they all they are all gonna, be speaking, How many are going to be speaking, F4 that that's not what I was told you when I sent the title when I sent for the information I was supposed to be in fighting the agenda, the speaker's supposed to be Miss, Anna, Vargas and also miss Veronica Almedina.
So Anna I wanted to tell you that, at the end of your presentation, I'm, going to be introducing you with the our next presenter I understand that I think it would be beneficial.
Are we going to have the opportunity to hear from community announcement and updates anyone that may have any other incoming or any meeting any kind of event or activity that they would like to share with the rest of the community.
Okay, Let me then, yes, she's going to assist us, but at the same time she was explaining me so in case that you may want to feel a lot more comfortable.
You may want it to you see at the bottom of your screen when it says a sharing, screen, I'm, going to try to bring your presentation.
began my journey as an administrator by joining the emerging leaders fellowship program alongside Miss Christine Gainey, who will be speaking about it as well shortly and throughout this journey we really found the love to lead and in doing so, I soon became the dean of students at Amber.
So now to be able to share with you all that we're going back to Washington Heights brings us utter joy, And I'll share with you a little bit of why, because Emperor Washington Heights really was what our dream was 20 years ago and to be able now in 2021, to say that we're coming back to the community really brings us joy and excitement.
Speaking of the history of Amber Charter school, we were founded in 2000 as the first Latino led charter school in New York state by the Community Association of Progressive Dominicans, also known as Fedepe, which is a community-based organization that was founded in 1979 and has since developed high quality programs that provide assistance to 27,000 children and families annually in the Washington Heights community.
Hence our excitement about opening a school in Washington Heights, because our funding organization has deep roots and so to be able now to open, Amber Inwood is really a dream.
We serve over 475 students in grades K-5, so to speak, a little bit about Amber's, Mission, Amber Charter school has not only created a program that produces strong academic performance, but more broadly, It addresses the learning and the development needs of the whole child through enrichment offerings, which Ms Anna will share with you shortly and a comprehensive range of supports.
We create an educational community that celebrates culture which is so important during these trying times and fosters a love of learning and last but not least, We provide clear pathways to middle school, high school and college.
I started at Amber over 15 years ago, as a second grade teacher and team leader in east Harlem, then with Veronica I, attended, emerging leaders, program and joined Amber's leadership team as a staff developer.
Now that you know a little bit more about me, I'd love to go on to the and let's talk about Inwood in this incredible building that we are going to be hosting these beautiful children in so Amber Inwood is located between.
It will be an incremental growth over the span over the next few years, please, and so at our school, We're focused on academic rigor and enrichment, which means that our students have the opportunity to both shine as scholars, but also deepen their interests in other areas.
However, We and they support us with everything from our after-school programming, our mental health services, that we offer Sim swimming classes for our students and each year we search for new opportunities, and so this will be no different, as we branch out into Inwood Veronica.
We also have pictures here of our students giving back and going out into the community and then, as Miss Anna mentioned, the external partnerships that we pride ourselves in, and we look forward to building those partnerships as we are coming into Inwood in September of 2021.
We've been invited to also present community board traffic and transportation committee, and so we wanted to share with this committee what we will be sharing with them as well and to address some of the concerns that maybe some of the residents have.
We want to acknowledge that we're always as all charter schools are required to give priority to the community residents in the student lottery system, and we will do that as we have for all of our other schools.
We have decided not to provide business because the streets are so narrow in that neighborhood that any school busting would only create more congestion, and we didn't want to bring that.
We know that the middle school children usually travel in New, York City.
Next we're open now, Let's pay for question all right, very good.
Allow me just one second: before we open up the face of questions because I know they are members, but they are that they are not here when we started.
This has been a wonderful presentation: I, look forward to hearing more about your school and visiting, hopefully once we're open, but definitely nice to meet.
Not now is that maybe there will be an opportunity within your school's program to have more than a bilingual community, just spanish and English, but maybe since we Jedis so close to seeing our community, especially in the area that you're going to be operating, 215 street, where there are so many jewish people that we like to integrate in our community and to our education system.
Okay, Let me ask you, then this question I understand, Maybe I am wrong, I'm, not sure, but I understand.
Don't know if this is true, or this is not that the state requires school to provide to harvest this kind of program.
However, Eventually, as we grow, one grade per year, amber and wood will be k through 8, okay and any specialty that you want to call that your school concentrate on it.
There is no special well, which is also why we offer the enrichment classes because early on right, we also want to make sure that they understand that there are other things to explore so that once they do enter the high schools and then later on college, They can continue to deepen their understanding of these areas that we started their interest.
Yes, so you concentrate in several areas, but do not specialize in particular area, which is the difference that I'm trying to you know to bring or give you some light.
Well two questions: is this school correct me if I'm wrong, because I'm trying to think of like where exactly it's going to be.
So we are going to open the building to our students in the fall of 2021 right now, it's under construction, and you will very much see that, because there was another school in the building, and.
Yes, We have I'm afraid to have something static, good and being faced with this reality that we have right now not only up here but all over about you, know, keeping in one place for the after.
You know you invest so much in a school, be faced with having to relocate or look for another place, and you know absolutely we're investing quite a bit of money in renovating the building, which is in some disrepair right.
So recess will happen inside the building, just like we run it in all of our other schools and we would take them to Inwood park origin park down the block, but most mostly because of all that, You know the winter months is too cold.
And I wanted you to know that I might be introducing you with other folks in the community, just for collaboration as well.
And I'm, the founder and executive director of internal creations, which is the arts non-profit, focused built on a mission to develop leadership, self-sufficiency and life skills through learning the classical guitar right.
Definitely look forward to speaking with you on a one-to-one I know, fame, couldn't possibly arrange that if you want to reach out to each other directly, I'm more than happy to do so and answer any questions as far as how we can proceed further in the future.
I think it would be very helpful, You know to their school absolutely and to the surrounding community.
You, know I'm, very concise and to the point, because I'm very aware of everybody's time and what we have to get done in the agenda so before that I do want to say that everybody who is asking the questions.
So I will advocate for that as well, because those are very precise questions for the previous school, very important for everybody to know.
You know good evening to all of you, my Washington Heights family, whether I know you or not, I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and to introduce you to an organization that I have founded and I continue to run for the past six years.
What music teaches us naturally, and now it's time for us to expose that to the students, instead of overlooking it, have conversations on this and help them understand how to bridge the two together, how music, learning and life skills actually do join together for anything that we choose to do in our life.
So you know, We are here to make sure that we teach the life skills through this through as a unit as a guitar ensemble as a community.
And then you know having the actual live music coming from the guitar.
Peace, recall, beautiful memories, show peace, love and happiness, and also as a way to get messages across if need be, for example, If the community needs something to address for the community, we know that this is going to be happening.
We teach our kids how to give back to the community in more ways than just money and with new skills as well, but it's unified with guitar, because what we do first is that we all the pieces that they're prepared in class they perform for whatever group that they're going to be volunteering, with.
Then, If you see on the bottom over here and then to the right, they performed at a Montessori school in the Upper West side and the kids nev, who have never seen a guitar, were just enthralled and was going crazy and like slapping the guitar strings and experiencing something new for the first time.
That's why I'm introducing our program to everybody, because I want to make sure that we are aware of each other and that we can begin building these relationships and really grow a stronger presence and providing music alternatives to our youth here in Washington Heights as well, because I'm going to race here and live here.
So yes: I was thinking in Washington, George, Washington, High, school I work for catholic charities, So probably we will be able to contact again.
Yes, since that you know Alianza program, which is the one that runs the community schools, both meeting communication and the health and science.
Why we are in one committee that is important to share ideas, questions, answers and things like that.
It seems that everybody thinks that they can play the guitars or any instrument, and you know well, it doesn't happen, but my.
If you're rich, no, I'm serious reach out to the young people, or you know, early students in the primary schools, and things like that.
What you are saying is the sixth thing is like the maximum that you know that you will work with or the minimum program.
If we find any situation that, perhaps let me want to put, they may have only 10 students, that's something that may not work like once.
No 10 students could work too, like normally we what happens a lot.
We usually get like 30 students sign up and then, as the programs, because they're after school, they dwindle, down.
For example, I can't recommend an organization that one would you be willing to consider that I mean, Yes eventually, but I do want to hone in first on our Washington Heights and New York City programming and make sure that we're strong enough here before we start spreading ourselves too thin, and.
You know what I mean all right, so I wanted to say that the announcement that I have is from DYCD, which is the neighborhood advisory board, but actually Giselle also is member of that committee.
I listening to myself, tiny, time, I, wouldn't know it again, but I think this would be a great practice if you guys take turn and direct the meeting as well so for January.
The next thing: is, as you know, directing a meeting a 10 kid minutes.
I know this meeting are recorded, but the thing is that if you wanted to listen to the record and type the minute, that would be very helpful to keep.
You know to come up with ideas, and things like that, because I've been around for 40 years on this boy, even the young people, to take leadership.
That in case that you may not or has occurred you that, yes, You can invite anyone and you know that, but for those like Paradise, that is new, So Paradise.
If I have not mentioned any names million, If you want to direct any meeting just let me know that you are willing to do so as well.
I'll, Let you know yes as well as taking me.
I believe it is right, yeah, yes, and by the way, by this Friday, We need to have a meeting.
