So essentially, every year, we're expected to provide the city of New York with a number of budget items that we think are of interest to us.
What, the top three pressing issues are you'll, see that they give a bit of a kind of description about each one, and it usually tends to be based off of really what happens in the voting of the individual items for both capital and expense, which we'll get to in a moment.
The overview statement of the community, district, really, I think I can spare everyone not go through the entire paragraph unless you'd like to spend some time going through it now, but I And, you know, kind of goes into some of even the information that we might collect from the city at different points for the top three pressing issues.
Cb12 of Manhattan also requests that permanent long- term, affordable housing construction, build a high number of these apartments or housing units, with immediate priority being given to non- profit organizations and community land.
What's, been a huge discussion with the android zoning Our district is facing a resulting proposal made by the near well the city of New York, and a resulting application for the inward section of the district that has been submitted to the department of City planning Cb12 of Manhattan requests that the Department of City planning should dedicate additional planning staff to work with Cb12, M and local residents to formulate an implemental zoning plan for Washington, Heights and Inwood, and to provide technical assistance to Cb12, M and local residents to evaluate the inward rezoning proposal, including the draft and final environmental impact.
I. Think in last year's conversations we had put forward some particular items that were focused on increased funding for mental health, services, And I think that it actually ended up getting picked up by health and environment, open environment , I just want to just let folks at least read through what was the summary last year for mental health and substance, abuse, treatment and prevention, programs.
And if there, if it's done and it does not need funding, then we it drops off right and then number two become And we've given a deadline, so, That sort of you know, availability, there, and once we've been able to hear from Martin, then I can also just establish.
What we would do is have the tracking numbers so that we can easily have the city's response right next to the item when we're considering so that we know what they said, about, why it was or was not or how it was funded, and we could just like see the line items straight across and figure out versus having to keep going back and forth.
We can input it as we're discussing it, but I just wanted to go through just what the items were right now going through the statement of district needs document and then switching on over to the register.
A, permanent long, term, affordable, housing, construction, building, a higher number of 100, affordable units based on community AMI, with immediate priority given to non- profit organizations and community land trusts, slash land banks that are partnered with non- profit, developers, though, for this item, I'll, actually just mention I- was What's.
The current bill that allows for people to have a essentially right to counsel and also an attorney, be provided for housing court matters and it kind of goes through 2022.
In, all zip codes not currently covered in Cd12, ah, okay, I do not know if you were proposing to move that to the capital side, if that was the proposal, but it seems to at least some format of what we were just discussing is in the line item for the expense.
It's, a local law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York in relation to providing these services, and it pretty much just goes into saying that the bill would amend local law number 136 of 2017 The housing court right to council law by requiring the immediate implementation of access to legal services for tenants facing eviction proceedings in housing, Court, city, wide, And I can actually just open.
It's, stating subject to appropriation coordinator, shall establish a program to provide access to legal services for covered individuals in covered proceedings in housing court and ensure that no later than July 31st 2022.
As is predictable and all income eligible individuals receive access to full legal representation no later than their first scheduled appearance and a cover proceeding in housing, court or soon thereafter, as is practicable, and you know, kind of just goes into establishing a number of different.
My understanding is that we're seeking to increase to increase that threshold, so more people qualify for the full legal representation and they're, not they're, not out just because they barely you know made the income eligibility is that is that a good summary What, the cover person is, because I think Janet was asking about a covered person and there's like a distinction between covered person and then income eligible persons.
This was roughly about 2015 when really just what was the covered areas were presented by the city of New York to You know both that information of their income, as well as their household size The item that we were focusing on previously in regards to expense was to ensure that people had attorneys.
If ever they you know, have a housing court issue arise, but Do. You maybe feel that the wording of that expense item needs to go.
The second item was funding for supportive housing construction for Lgbtq Eu I'll just mention that the reason why we had discussed this and actually sorry, let me go back and share my screen, so the public can see as well.
Those were referring to programs that specifically are doing either enforcement or specifically the kind of rehabilitation that might be needed through HPD, the city's housing preservation and development agency, and then the last item is provide more housing for at risk and transitioning individuals.
Really what's been the past few months or something just personal interest in the previous year , I believe we have discussed providing Wi- fi in public locations for people to be able to access the internet when they're doing their business, especially in the human services areas where people are spending hours, sometimes the entire day in those spaces and oftentimes need to communicate in order to handle the things that they need to handle so, but it did not get re- entered when Barbara was doing.
But basically figure out what are the spaces like the welfare office, where that type of support can be provided to basically have internet when people are in waiting, rooms, gotcha and just so as to know, I'm, noting it specifically as Hra service centers.
So I think that item would serve as a an expense, item, and I can include it here as the providing of or right rather providing for the creation of a fund to aid in upgrading electrical systems to inspecting you know basically inspecting.
So is it that you think that there needs to be some like a different line item that might not necessarily fit with funding for HPD Housing code violation, inspector.
I guess, in the desire to not go through all community boards of the city of New York and read each and every individual one's items not have them be But you'll see so, for instance, the first line item there of the increasing funding for legal representation.
There is a housing hotline that is staffed by attorneys and staff members of various legal service providers throughout the city.
So You know so that in a way can impact you Any old business that folks wanted to bring up And, actually I'll, also just ask if perhaps members from the public, janet or danny in regards to one of the things on in our budget request is in relation to the community land Trust, and this is just an example where we voted near unanimously in support of the creation of a community land trust in our district.
That is doing the work in this case specific to community Land Trust, but I mean in all cases in the you know.
