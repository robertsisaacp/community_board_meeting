And let me just see where we are. Let me just make sure nobody is sitting in a 10 DS that should not be you. Okay, you hi Natalie, all right Chanel. Do we are you helping us tonight on any recording? Are we not doing that tonight? How does it work? Yeah, it's going to be live on YouTube and it's going to be recording yeah the same as the rest of the meetings. Okay, all right, well, I think we can get started if you want to all right. It's goodbye you, let's go so traffic and transportation special meeting, it's July 6,703! Thank you, everybody for being here tonight. We're going to pretty much go straight to our agenda item with the MTA I do want to provide an update before we get started, though, on 181St Street bus way. So this is not a an update as to substance. It is an update as to process, so the Community Advisory Board, which is do teas sort of first step, is bringing together both members of CB, 12 and representatives from elected office and other you know, organizations, etc. D- O- T has convened that group I think they're still inviting people. The first meeting is tomorrow at 3:00 and after tomorrow's meeting, I expect to have a lot more information about what the process is going to look like. So things like. When would it come to see b12 how quickly there is even going to be a plan? Are they going to get right into collecting feedback tomorrow? Yes or no? We do not know anything now, except that there is this invitation and that's what I got on that. So I would say that look for an update from me tomorrow, late in the day or earlier on, Wednesday and at that point hopefully I'll understand more about what happened. What's the impact on this committee because clearly will be part of that process and anything else a salient for you guys. So that's what I've got on 181St Street bus way with that, let me pass it to MTA Howie Levine and we have Al. Is it rough I and do we need to get you set up to have the screen or you do have a presentation you want to run through I'm, going to share my screen now with everyone. If that's all right, okay, great all right, can everyone see my screen and see the PowerPoint slide? Yes, I can yes great! So for those of you who do not know, my name is Howard Levine I work for government relations at MTA, New, York, City, Transit, I'm joined today by Al Rifai I was a senior project manager on our a line, elevator replacements and can go into the technical knowledge that I may not know offhand. So we have a short presentation and then per usual we'll take any questions so 190Th Street, you know the station opened and the elevators were first installed in 1932 the old station elevator travels 137 feet from the station house down to the mezzanine. It's historically designated station, it's a beautiful station, I think as many people know and the elevators you know. The key point here is the elevators have not been completely replaced since they were first installed in 1932. There's been a number of kind of rehabs and things of that nature, but never a full tear everything out and build it all back brand new and that's what we're doing with this project. So the scope of work for this project and similarly from me first, is really to increase the reliability of these elevators by, as I mentioned, replacing everything really top to bottom. Everything in the elevator shaft, the cab, the mechanisms there and everything else- in the machine room above the shaft as well, and what we're doing is well is going to rip. Do some repairs to the shaft itself, because, where there's been some water penetration and the other you know work that we find will repair. It should not it's not quite as extensive as the work at Hearn 81St Street, where we had to build kind of an additional shaft within the shaft to make sure there was no future water penetration. Thankfully, that's not here we're going to be installing a new lift net system. With these elevators, the lift net system is what communicates with us about the elevators, how they're doing what their status is? Alerts us to any, you know needed maintenance, hopefully before anything, you know takes an elevator out of service. It also communicates a lot more information with us and it does now. So, if anything does happen, we'll be able to know exactly what it is, what kind of crew and parts we need, and so we can respond a lot quicker additionally, we're adding a backup battery system that will allow passengers to exit the elevators if there is a loss of power, while people are in them and, lastly, communication systems upgrade most notably including two security cameras in each elevator cab. So there's no blind spots in terms of what might be happening in the elevators just to remind folks of the layout of the station. There's two entrance and two access points, one at Bennett, Avenue and through the tunnel and the other at Fort, Washington, Ave and Murray curve, and certainly the elevator entrance. We are working on for this project I'm additionally below that I have the ridership figures for this station on the left are the if I would say normal times. Pre- pandemic ridership figures, where you have ten and a half thousand people using the station every day about a third of those people are using the elevators to get where they need to go so about 3500 people right now. We only have about 2,000 people total using the station on any given day which, if you're, assuming that the percentages of elevator versus tunnel User are roughly the same. It's about 600 people who are using those elevators every day which to give you some scale, is about three full subway cars under normal times. That's up. We train some weight cars so ridership, certainly down at this station as it is acrosss the system. So for this work, as at a hundred eighty first Street on the a there's no station bypass required, the trains will still stop at this station, as they normally would. Of course, access is only going to be from Bennett Avenue the mark for Washington market Corbin circle. Elevator entrance is going to be closed during this work for 12 months. We bet that we have that and have had that scheduled to begin in September for quite some time. We're looking at potentially accelerating it into late August if conditions permit right now, we're still on schedule at 181St, Street, on the a to wrap up in August and additionally for those for winter, brawls are still on schedule at 194 eat on the one, although that's a little farther into the future, but we're very happy that you know we've kind of been able to keep ourselves on schedule and catch up when we follow a little bit behind over the last few months, and so we're pretty happy with that. So for our 200 alternative travel options for customers. While these elevators are out of service, we recommend people use the 181St, Street Station and specifically the elevators at 180 4th Street, which will be newly reopened. You know as a kind of inherent part of this project. Those will be back open before we close the elevators 190Th Street additionally from the elevators 180 4th street. You know either going to there or back from there, local and for buses operate and also M 90's m-98 buses operate specifically during rush hours in the peak direction and provide a bus connection for those that need it between the two stations and just to kind of hammer it home. The Bennett passageway remains open throughout every part of this work. Additionally, during this work, we're going to have some material staging in the parking lane up on for Washington kind of a rough estimation of where that will be in blue on the left. This will just be on Fort, Washington Avenue, there's not going to be any storage needed on Bennett and, of course, during the work you know we'll have personnel going up and down these stairs, but the Serkis will remain open to the public to access the park. So. Lastly, this is just the schedule of all of our projects that we've had up here before, and so you might be familiar with it. 160 a street is being completed under a 91st Street on the 1 is ongoing, should wrap up in February of next year. 181St Street on the a is ongoing right now and hoping to wrap up in August just next month, which we followed by under 90th we're discussing today, which were also overlapped with the last elevated replacement we have uptown will come back in the future to present on 181St Street on the 1 and following all of these elevator replacement projects, we currently have planned the escalator replacement at 181St Street on the a as well so that those are our slides for tonight. Of course, we still have our dedicated web page for this project, which the RL is right here and that has not changed and has a few links to more details about specific projects, although not this project quite yet, and with that I'll turn it back to Debbie and I'm going to stop sharing my screen just for use, but I'll always bring it back. If you want to consult it. Alright, thank you. So much Howie and Al will open it up for questions I, just I'm having a little bit of internet glitchyness. So, if I go silent in any way Omar, if you could just step in I, just two very quick questions before the committee, just when you say that this project could be accelerated into very late August rather than September, can we infer then that would mean that the hundred 84Th Street elevators might be up earlier in August rather than later in August, or is the MTA willing to communicate a date yet and then also when we hear about and funding theirs, I presume that's about very forward capital projects and won't affect the escalator project, but just clarify that I'm correct about that. So the city answer your second question. First, the funding issue, the elevator projects are all part of you know, there's one counter for the one elevators and one for the a elevators that's already been awarded. Everything is all set right, we're not at risk. The escalator projects I would have to double- check is also part of a larger contract. That I'm not sure, is worried yet, but I would have to get back to you on that. Specifically, okay, remind me of your first question. Debbie just is there? What's the estimated time of completion, 184th, Street elevators, because I'm sort of getting that, maybe it's the beginning of August? If you are thinking you might accelerate this project into the end of August yeah I do not have anything on in terms of timeline yet and even I. Think if we were trending ahead of schedule, we're still always I think during these times little cautions. This will be the first time I think during in the middle of a pandemic, we're bringing a new elevator back, and some of that is, you know, done a little differently, given the circumstances. In terms of you know, personnel and everything after you with that. So I think you know we're hopeful. We can bring it back as soon as possible, but we're a little we're so little cautious about everything in terms of wrapping up the work there making sure it's you know perfect and ready for customer using it all right. Well, as soon as you have a date will of course be eager to hear it. It's the first time a to go: Debbie, follow- up Debbie and, of course, with any with any specific date that we would be closing a hundred and 990 a-- the on the a we would so be communicating that you know these 30 days prior to you elected and customers right all right, so I have joined anybody from the committee and welcome state. Senator Jackson's here with us. So I see Natalie's hand up to have anybody from the committee so Natalie, why do not you go ahead? Yeah I did want to follow up with Debbie's question, because I think it was our understanding that no two station elevators on the same line would be out at the same time. So I just kind of really want to reiterate that if you are shutting down 190th it would early, it will be because the 180 first stroke 184 is done. Correct they'll never be any overlap, as we've said previously. That's still the case. There would never be any overlap between two stations on the same line. All right so we're just going to infer what we're going to infer Howie I'm, just going to say that all right, so just looking through it's anybody from CB, 12 I know we have Maria here, hi Sally's joined us Oh eat it. I did not see you join nice to see you we have because we do have. Is that Kathleen is that Kathy Diaz, that's Kathleen! Colley! Sorry, no problem I'm, just I just want to do a quick scan of whether we have any board members, but it looks like we are clear so Kathleen. If you'd like to go ahead, please do and if you could just repeat your last name as well, so we have it for the nodes. Sorry, this is Kathleen. Colley I live in Castle Village Hi James I have a sort of tangential question. It has always been my understanding that the MTA is trying to achieve a situation where every other station is handicap accessible. At the moment we go from 170 v to indictment without an accessible station. If 198 could be made handicap accessible. That would bring it into compliance with the tá policy and I am by no means an expert in this. Obviously, but I have gone and looked at it. I can see, there's already a rap from the subway platform to both the street at Bennett and the mezzanine level, and it seems to me again I'm not by any means an expert that it might be possible without undue expense to put in an elevator on the downtown side, in which case the remaining piece would just be a ramp of some sort or possibly elevator extension from the upper mezzanine to the street and I guess. My question really is: have you thought about that, because I think there would be a lot of people who would like to have a handicap accessible station there? This is I, think everybody knows the deepest single station in the entire system. Sorry I did not mean to shut you out, no, so Kathleen it's definitely. We we've commissioned a study of the entire system in every station to look at how they can be made accessible, and you know that's something that we're always looking at in terms of the a- line were generally for the next for our 2020 to 2024 capital plan. As part of that, we have planned to make 181St Street on the a accessible and that would be fully accessible. Both directions, uptown and downtown 190Th Street is not included in that for the moment and of course, our capital plan is in a little bit of financial trouble right now right terms of what, in terms of what we had laid out as our priorities for the stations we made a DA accessible in the next few years, 180 first read on it on the a was made declared one of those stations. Well, that would certainly be an improvement. I had to move to 190 it's just because again, I'm ignorant, it seemed easier to do it. There. 109 first is well, maybe with the new L Vader's at 184th. It works better. I do not know that the escalators plus the platform seemed to be complicated. There are yeah and 190th. There are certainly a number of other factors in terms of the elevators, as you mentioned, not going fully to the street level as it does down or 84th Street. That certainly need to be dealt with. In addition to you know, making that ramp, ADA accessible and changing the turnstile configuration at the ramp, but it's definitely something that we are looking at in terms of just expanding accessibility, acrosss the system overall, especially when it can be done more easily. Well, I. Think that's great! Thank you and I wish that the budget were in better shape, but do not we all do not. We all Thank You Kathleen and thank you Howie Sally Fisher. You had your hand up. If you want to unmute yourself by handing me to myself there, you are and I'm, given that I know nothing about the work and what the capital plan is, but my I do live near 207 Street and that elevator seems to be going out all the time and it seems like I. Remember that Upper Manhattan elevators are. We had like 5 of the 10 worst elevators at one point. In terms of outages, what are you doing to correct those kinds of problems? Uptown like I, think like fixing 207, is set out forever or are there plans to address repairing yeah? So to answer your question in terms of elevators overall in Washington Heights, you know this replacement project is I, think, probably by far the largest piece of that and expanding those deep station elevators, which I think are probably you know most problematic when they go out and when you know anything you know negative happens to them. It's less problematic, but in terms of 207 is, you know, was scheduled to be replaced also as part of kind of a regular cycle of a DI elevators throughout the system, but I think that's also. Currently, you know on hold because of the capital plan and when you say on hold how long should I expect it to be unrolled I, unfortunately, I do not know that Debbie you're, muted, sorry about that I mean like I'm, stirring every level in every community board is talking about this, but this certainly at CB twelve. The accessibility up here has been a hot topic over a number of years. We sorry about that. We were relieved to see you know the capital plan, that included- and you know, incomplete, but a big start on some accessibility and stations and to see the budgeting. Obviously, for the capital plan in Peril is I just feel like we were so close to getting something and I really I, really hope things change, Maria Luna had her hand up and then and then Edith sorry I'm, just seeing you now so Maria and then to eat it. Yeah these elevators are going to be automatic. You do not have an agent there. Are they going to have an agent on the elevator? Yes, okay, the agents that are still are there now will be returning. Yes, okay, so there is 24-hour 24/7 or OSA the ages are going to be. They have 27:24 hour two and seven days a week, there's no change to the hours of the agents. Another concern that about the LD. When you mentioned about the battery, you know to be there in case. That is a you know. It's a problem. How often did you check make sure that the batteries work in case? Something happens, something you know the battery is not functional, sure I, you know, I do not know technically, I do not know if I'll know specifically but I. Imagine that's. Part of the lift net system is constantly checking that and making sure it still is. You know fully operable and would be able to. You know, take the elevators to you know the top of the bottom. If there was a power outage, okay, is it possible? We can start doing something about the accessibility making sure that by the time the elevator is in operation. Also, the accessibility is because there is like cobblestone around the area with can W look into. Maybe the expedite, making sure the people that are you know your skeins and you know walkers and we'll share will be able to use. It are not to wait for another facet of our. You know, Rick. You know this requirement by the community world. Can they can they start doing that? At the same time, enough the two questions, one I'm in terms of expediting this station becoming accessible. Unfortunately, we can't do at the same time just because of the kind of lead time for it being a capital project, and you know having that happen. Unfortunately, we can't do that, and especially right now, given the state of the capital plan, that's not really something that's on the table at the moment, but if there's specific cobblestones I'm, not sure where the cobblestones are you referring to that, I could, because I could for watching time that you have to you know you have to go like a little to the to the right, and then you turn left to get into the station Wow. What's our like break, you know like red break or something like that. I know the material that they are so just kind of the stability of the stairs there. All right go right. Okay, I can take a look into that. It might be something we work out with parks, the parks Department as well. You know that's a fantastic place. The closers are there before you know. We need that. You know people not only for the local people, but also for tourists that comes on. You know I'm busy that area, which you made sure that you know everything is accessible to an end today. Thank you, mmm-, hmm, Thank, You, Maria, all right, Edith, Prentiss and just eat. It do not forget to unmute yes I'm here I'm here great hi I define the right box a couple of questions: where does the elevators to the platform at 184Th fall into this time frame? There's not there either there's not currently a time frame for those projects that will be a number of years in the future. In all likelihood, yes, you somebody has to be designed and then awarded, and then you know you're done during design build. The timeline would still be a little while, yes, okay, because before you left Andy had said that they were. You know they were in the plan. So I am concerned about that. We come back to the issue of the vertical gap from the platform to the Train with the lower utilization. Since the pandemic has rolled out it has you know and having fewer people in trains in the trade? Does it sink a little? It has become a significant problem, even when you're getting on at the exact position where we are told to get on, there remains a vertical gap. What, if anything, is happening with that? So you just let me clarify so that even under normal circumstances, there is a vertical gap: patient yep, every station, I think you know every station, you have a vertical gap yeah anyway, we once took the TRC through, and people were saying. I do not know, there are no gaps there, no gaps, I'm like we're at City, Hall and I, said just watch it come in and, as you come in, the level of the train goes up. It comes down and creates a situation where, when it's particularly I, people's people can not necessarily get on to the Train, so I know it stations where we do has been remediated already. We've had two times on some of these stations where they've raised the platform and it remains a problem. So you know I know at stations where we do. You know, build a DA, whether it's elevators or ramps, to certify it as an ad, a accessible station and label. It as such, we do line up the platform and that and make sure those gaps are ad. A compliant I just know that, from some of my other projects, I've worked on in terms of doing it at stations that are not otherwise a DA accessible I'm not are a DA accessible stations, one seven, one, eight one: seven: seventh Street 168Th, Street, 207, etc. These are stations that are all edges, be accessible, so eat it. If you want to communicate, you know specific stations that have this issue to the board and they can get that to me and I can follow up and see what we can do about them and we've addressed it to Alex right well, let's just if you guys can just connect and make that happen so that the vertical gap issue one 71- 68- should not be connecting external to the committee. Well, I, just cuz we're just we're. We were having it back and forth. So if the next step is that he's saying send it so that so that how we can have it from us, then, let's just do that- has to come through the committee, because otherwise you'll then say we have not said to him we're giving it to them. Okay, do you want to write it up and send it to me and I will go to Howie? I should not be the one having to do. This is the issue. We all know it's a problem. Okay, we know it's a problem, it's not new. So how is that? If we get you information about the CB 12 stations with vertical gap issues, including 168,175 in 207, you could get a little feedback to us on outside of a accessibility capital project how that might be addressed or if it might be addressed. Certainly, okay, great. Thank you. Alright, just scanning I think that is it for I have not just leave me Mom for questions on this item. I think Robert is waving his hand, hi Robert, Hi, Debbie I gather up David, baby I just have a simple question. Why always the bosses in Fort Washington says not in service I strode to hear that Rob? What was that Boston for Washington's I always says not in service, always one behind the other saying not in service, not in service the M4 or the or the in for the shuttle bus shuttle. Bus has not been running for a little while during the pandemic, but well. The M4 is always there for I was seated in the restaurant over there and 193rd McKee Mishima and three Baz is the same time pass by and this and northern service, not inserts people waiting for the boss, yeah I, you know I can't say exactly what was happening at that moment, but you know generally. Sometimes we will, if punches, if bus and start to Bun, we will take one out of service and you know send it down to the end of the router somewhere else on the route where there is a larger gap in service. That's why you would normally see and out of service sign or a bus, maybe going between routes where it's the you know, bunching on one round on another route. You know there's a lot of flexibility with buses in this regard, but in terms of seeing three in a row when there's people waiting- and there was not necessarily one that you saw that came soon after that- you know is not what we'd like to hear and you know I can you can get me in the future more specific details, but like time, you know day a possible any bus numbers. It was this right. It was this Friday. Last Friday did you say our countdown about going downtown: okay, Friday around 3:00 341 there, okay, yeah, there's a there's a way for you to check if we like, just sort of what the performance was heading downtown like was this like? Was the schedule met on scheduled buses going down? Is there a way to check that? No, you can generally look at that general. Usually so yeah I can kind of check in with those general parameters and see if there's anything that looks unusual last Friday and that was a Saturday service and on Friday or what service was running on that federal holiday on Saturday I'd have to double- check, but it was, you know, probably a Sunday service, probably as soon as oh, okay yeah, you know. As you know, the m4 is like the endless source of frustration yeah. We always want to know how we're doing there all right, Jim come on. Yes, no I appreciate you, though state Senator did you want to share anything with us. This person, thank you, Debbie and the committee for having an update on the MTA situation and that's good thing to how we obviously the concerns that I had were raised and answered, and the only thing outstanding is what Edith brought about and I. Just think that you need to address other than that. Thank you. Thank you for stopping by Hi, Bruce and Richard. Hallman are waving at me. Okay, go ahead, Richard and then Bruce. Sorry, not you Debbie, senator I was just thanking know what the picture at the photograph is not behind him who's. That Oh, like you, get to see everybody's art yeah, yes to go! It's going to find out. Yes, ask his wife right, I'm! Sorry, no problem! Richard almond! Do you want it well we're waiting for the senator. The other is sure one thanks for the update, I'm glad to hear 184Th is coming back soon and hopefully would be fantastic. Italy he's somewhere between fantastic and adequate and both are good. I want to add an exclamation point to what Robin said about M4 buses out of service and the series of two three or four them. That's a long term problem. Maybe there was an incident evidently on last Friday, but over the years that I've lived up here, it happens time you know, probably deserves a little more of an investigation than just what happened on Friday, perhaps I'm speculating there may be routes that need to ended 135th instead of ending up here at this end of the route so that when they turn around they're going somewhere, I do not know. If that's the answer, it's a speculative answer and finally, a question on something: that's not on the agenda tonight now be brief. Howie. Can you tell us anything more about this world war? Two boat? It was evidently excavated in part or in whole, in conjunction with the work being done on the 207th Street yeah read an interesting story and I have no idea what the story is sure. So, I'll answer the mm4 question. First in terms of importance of chance, especially it's definitely something we're aware of and I believe, and certainly something we would hope to address in the Manhattan bus network redesign when that you know comes about those are also on hold right now, just because the difficulty of holding you know, in- person, feedback sessions and moving forward with those that we have active currently in the Bronx, the Queen's in Brooklyn, as well so I think when we get around to doing Manhattan. That would certainly be the M4 will be a hot topic of discussion and how we can improve. It will be a big part of that project uptown in terms of the PT 59, both that so as I imagine many of you are aware. We are doing sandy resiliency work on the 207 Street train yard, over on the East River on the Harlem River. As part of that, we have to kind of clear out some debris, some muck to build the flood wall around the exterior of the train yard, and in doing that, we discovered what it kind of I think been rumored to be there for a little while, which is an all the remains of an old boat. That, through examination, was determined to in fact be the in all likelihood. I guess, I do not know how precisely anyone can verify this after a boat has been set on fire and sunken feet of muck for decades, but it is believed to be the former pt 59, which JFK commanded after the PT 109 in the Pacific Harbor dream, World War two. When we kind of discovered this, we contacted a few museums to see if I would be interested in this and how we kind of preserve the pieces of this that were worth preserving and turned over some of some of the boat that was desired to a museum in Massachusetts called the battleship Cove Museum. That has a PT boat museum as part of it as well. So that is a little bit about that and, of course, now there's a few press stories about it that going a little more detail, but that is generally what was the case so we're happy that we were able to kind of find it and preserve it, get into a place where it can be appreciated for the into the future, all of it real, quick. All of that sounds great. Maybe there's a Department of Education contact too over how some of this might be made available to local students, its history, teaching, Mm-, hmm I, do not expect us to resolve it's a suggestion. We do not have to resolve that here tonight. Just if Sally or Edith had an additional question, just unmute yourself and let me know or otherwise just take down your raised hand I so I can barely yeah. Sorry I did have a couple questions to come up in various committees that are MTA related, but I'm, not sure I do not know the gentleman who spoke with her. It would be under him, but there was a question in the AG committee about people needing accessibility to buses that were not allowed in the front door of buses because of the roping off for something for co- head, and there was also an issue with subways. There's a lot of complaints about people MTA requiring mass to ride the subways, but mass not being available or people not wearing them and I know that there are mass dispensing machines in some of the downtown stations. Have you considered adding dispensing machines in Uptown stations or maybe or distributing the free mass which I had read at one point? They were going to be available from the agents, but I'm not sure that's posted anymore. People are getting on the subway without masks, so Mary, Anderson and Edith have both we've covered in this committee in prior meetings. Sort of the subject of you know continued cases of people being denied boarding via the front door and how he's sort of responded to that in terms of how to bring forward bring that forward to the MTA I? Is there anything marry or how he would like to add to that? Otherwise, I would sort of refer to the minutes and let's deal with the second part of the question, and is that you know that's important stuff, yeah Mr. briefly and through that and more to what I said last month, you know there's really so, as we no questions asked, you can use the front door if you've, you know, Express the need to the driver. I mean cases where the driver does not allow you to use the front door for any reason. Please take down the bus number, which is usually kind of on the back of the bus. It's just a blue number on the white bus and just send that to the board and it conforte it over to me and I can report that and have the drivers spoken with and make sure they fully understand how this policy is supposed to work. But that's been the policy, since this first went into effect many months ago. At this point no one said anything: no I have not had any disabilities I'm. Sorry I, just I'm glad to hear that and then and then how? If you could also then speak to the and Maria I, see you, let's just finish up on Sally's question about the availability of PPE and Howard. You know we do not have an uptown distribution site that shows the case in Midtown. As you mentioned, Sally masts are required for those using any MTA motor transportation and we've seen you know. We've been kind of monitoring and we've seen almost a 95 percent compliance rate with that which I think we're pretty pleased with. We wish it was 100, but 95 is not too far off the mark in terms of getting masks. If you forgot one, you need one in terms of you know, someone being asked to put one on the station agents, as you mentioned, do have masks in the booths that are available. You just have to go and request them. They are free to million masks that have been distributed throughout the system to our station agent booths. There are you if you wanted one of the fancier much more expensive masks. They do have those vending machines at other stations, predominantly in Midtown at downtown and those stations, I believe were determined by just overall ridership at those stations and I. Think that's kind of part of a pilot for now. I do not know what the status that is going forward if there will be more machines installed, but in general the best way is to just go to the booth and ask for a mask and that's at all stations, uptown or anywhere in the system. I prefer. The free ones because are not neighborhood does not have a whole lot of excess money to spend. Could there be signage or something that specifies that they are available because they've not seen signage I? Can definitely has that feedback along sure. Thank you all right, I'm a little bit of a stack now Edith. If you had another question: yes, I'm, Maria, Luna and then I have Natalie. You know, I would just come back to the m4. There is an m4 on a schedule that goes down empty at about 3 p.m. in addition, there are M Force that are that are out of service at about 6:45, which are confusing because there are also m-98 going down at a service at that time. So it's a little hard to say which bus it is that's going down out of service. I was refused service yesterday by a driver, I'm sundae, I'm, sorry at 168Th, Street and I went over and made a complaint to the supervisor, but this the problem continues. The driver had said you were in here close the door and pulled the bus out. Whole thing was documented, etc, and you know we come back to the fact that there are station I mean there are stops. They have a multiplicity of buses in them. The problem continues where the driver just drives has to bus stop, because an other bus and other route bus is in the bus stop. This has been well- documented. It's been happening for years, probably since before you know, when the dinosaurs were pulling buses and there needs to be that addressed again, I know you guys have done training I know, you've got you know, the disability community has participated in trainings, etc. It's still not getting through and I would just really wish that there would be a little greater emphasis to bus drivers over their responsibility to do that. There are also problems with social distancing, because you end up at the situation where you are fewer seats and less space available in the front of the bus, and a lot of us are being left behind on the sidewalk, because the buses do not have you know: you'll have two seniors on the fold up seat and the driver says I'm full and drives away. These are problems that need to be addressed. Thank you. Thank you. Edith Maria. You had another point, just very quickly right, a question for the accessibility and station that are accessible to people to have either which way around and so on. Some and 157 C number one line going noise going uptown. There has two exits to the station, and is it possible that maybe we can take a look and one side? One of the eighty could be made accessible and the other could be left the way it is right. Now the steps is a wide, very wide area that people can just go right into the stage you know the station and into the subway. We sound, really major, you know, work I mean thing had to be done properly, of course, but I'm looking at there, because it's not just elevators I, think that particular station could be made accessible and it's a you know the commute there is like thousands and thousands of the people. So maybe what do you suggest out there be that we can do a presentation to the committee on some plans on how to you know and recommendation from you know to make sure that is it's a possibility. As you know, at least on the Uptown side, because then we're going to have the next stop is 1:6 Th Street. Now we have elevators there so being fantastic. There are people can connect. You know just a you're, not a few minutes away from each other right. You know correct me if I'm wrong, how I mean the next is it to capital plans or that just the 22:24 I mean there's the capital plan that adds accessibility to the system through the fast forward plan, etc. All of that is in peril, so anything sort of for additional accessibility after that first round of the 22:24 stations that is also contemplated, but we know is after 2024 is like what's the what's, the best way, how he to get feedback on sort of, because the fast forward you said, looked at every station. So if we wanted to understand to Maria's point like a better understanding of like for those of ours, that did not make it into that plan, because you're saying only the 181St a made it into that one like where do the rest of our stations land and are there any other programs that do like she said like okay? But you maybe there's an opportunity on one side, but not the other side like how would we get that information, because I think that's already exists in the sense that it was all looked at? Every station was looked at so that you know there's not so to your first point: Debbie, that's correct that basically, everything that is going to be accessible, that requires a capital improvement, whether it you know, elevators, that your bigger investment compared to ramps. This still goes through the capital plan, and right now we still have stations that are, you know, not been completed yet from the last capital plan, which is the night 2015 to 2019 capital plan, and then we have the seventy stations we've announced as part of the two hundred 2028 is 2824 capital plan as well, and so kind of future. More stations beyond that would be part of any following capital plan, which would be a number of years into the future. At this point in terms and then just to clarify in terms of CB 12 stations, I was just mentioning underneath first tricks. It was on the a, and that is a station that is in the current, the 20:22 24 capital plan. 100 168th on the one is also in the 2020 capital plan, as is Dyckman Street on the one which is I believe going to be ramps, not elevators as well, yes, great yep, and so when that was all previously announced, and so in terms of why we pick certain stations over others. There was a there were some community meetings to solicit feedback on stations run by our system- wide accessibility team within New, York, City Transit, but generally the goal is to have stations that are that you can't be anywhere in the system where you're more than 2 stations away an accessible station. That was the goal with these the 70 we announced, and then additionally, you know we take into account ridership at these stations and those are the main criteria. We've looked at in terms of you know, there's another number of other factors. You know if there's any specific facilities nearby that are, you know and a big demand by people who might need an ad a station. Things like that are generally taking to effect, but into account, but I think that large answers the question Mike. Thank you, yeah and I. Think to Maria's point, though, like accessibility, we always come back to it on this committee and I. Think all of us again picking up on something Maria said earlier as well that maybe in the fall we could sort of get a better understanding of like let's say it's, not a full accessibility, but there are improvements to address some factors within the station that are making it difficult for people with. You know like she said, like a cane in the cobble stone like there, sometimes things that can get done that improve things when it's not on the list for a DA. So maybe we can sort of have a little bit more time on this subject, because it's really important up here, as you know so, Thank You Maria for raising that Natalie. We have you'll finish up press I, so yeah I just did not want a footnote first eat. If this remarks about the platform be wheelchair, that I often push it is borough- wide that I have trouble getting it into the Train from the platform without Good Samaritans coming out and picking it up. So that's something that needs to be looked at borough wide and we will follow up with you guys on that, but my internet garbled when Sally was asking about masks so I do not did not catch if she asked about the mask vending machines that you guys rolled out and whether or not they're going to roll out for uptown and so I wanted to know if that was in the plan sure so the so the vending machines are primarily at Midtown and downtown stations. As you point out largely they were selected because ridership, but that is just in addition to the fact that there are masks available for free at all station agent booths acrosss the system, including uptown, of course. So that's generally what we're pushing- and you know it's more. The people who you know might want one of the really fancy more expensive mass at one of these vending machines. But you know I would go with the free mask myself if I forgot a mask when headed to the subway, so they'll bench, the question Natalie I, yeah I, just think that I do not I have not seen the free mask so I do not know if the preference for the ones in the vending machine is that, in addition to any fashion statement, they may be individually wrapped in a different way. So yeah and I just was curious. You know I was perplexed about ridership being higher there, because my understanding is that those are hubs in districts in the borough. We're not a whole lot of people live, so it seems that there's a lot of it would seem that those people begin their commute points elsewhere. All right with MTA I mean how, if you maybe stay for a couple minutes, I'm just going to make a few updates. I know they do not apply, but just in case anything else, pops up but obviously need to head out. We appreciate you being here and we're looking forward to new Outlanders as fast as we can get them I, just a neglected. One update which I wanted to give for whatever reason, I'm not clear on why we get we get regular updates about DDC projects that affect our streets. We do not, however, get regular updates from either content or DEP about projects that affect our streets at Cabrini and 181St. There's been work, that's been going on all year. It is a DEP project. We are hearing from people just wondering you know when we're going to get the sidewalk back, there's busy those restaurants they're trying to serve, who can't set up tables, that's affecting a whole strip of restaurants. 181St we've lost a whole bunch of parking, and it just seems like there's. Never any end to it. I did get an update from Con Ed who's. Actually, even though it's a DEP project, they have to move their underground, relocate their stuff and I. Think one they. Whenever you dig a hole, you do not know exact what you're going to find what they found were more problems than anticipated and more work in the relocation they hope to be out of there by August. First and as I understand it. The DEP work does not take that long, like the actual DEP catch base and work won't take that long, but it is they. So it's been going on all year and it's going to continue through the summer. Clearly, that's the update there. The next thing I wanted to bring up and I really did want to keep this meeting sort of focused on just the MTA, given its a special meeting, but one thing and I'm sure everybody on the committee has been seeing and it's something Oh, Maura and I have talked about is over the past I mean certainly all through June we're seeing a lot of stuff about rebel scooters gone wrong, meaning not obeying traffic laws being ditched in inappropriate places and the only appropriate place is in a real parking spot in a drop- off zone. So it does not include, you know a hydrant a park and all these things are happening so I we're not going to you know, there's nothing. So what I spoke to Omar about and I'm going to sort of present to the committee is like I think we need to get some answers on this and it's not like citibike, where it's like D- O- T has a hand in it. They do not there's also a traffic enforcement aspect of this that I think Curtis will be picking up on, but I just want to say we need to get smarter about who does have jurisdiction besides a traffic cop being able to say you're, speeding, you're going the wrong way on a one- way, street you're on the sidewalk etc. But it's like there's got to be like who owns this like. They just landed here and it's hard to see, sort of who's sort of has a piece of regulating them being here at all being on the street. So I want to say September agenda roughly like that we target having it on there, but it's a single biggest thing that at least I see I'm sure I do not know about the rest of you, but, and so if anybody else has I make one brief comment on that yeah. One of the issues that came up is that the scooters are also not supposed to be on the pads in the park. Now it turns out- and this is just something we should keep in mind for the future. These scooters obviously all have gps's and in fact, if the man, if the operators chose to do so, there could be a wall, an electronic wall and the second the scooter went into a park, it would beat and stop working. They could do this whether they will, but that is the reality of what they can do at this point. So we should keep these things in mind. Thank you, yeah I mean one thing is they do have license plates, so you do have an ability to report that, but as far as I know, the only thing you can do at the moment is report it to the company. But- and that's presuming you got, you got your eyes on the license plate and you were able to. You know, get all the information together. That would allow them to sort of like discontinue somebody Omar and then I see Joe yeah, Omar yeah, maybe who's just going to second your sentiments here because again, as you mentioned one day, they were not here and then one day we turned around and they were everywhere and not in a great way, because I do not want to say it's every day then I go outside, but more often than not I do see someone on a rebel bike and they're, clearly disregarding a red light going right through a red light like God forbid some but someday somebody gets hit by a car which actually has a green one. The light the greenways are right- of- way. So it's not the first time I've seen greville users completely. This will be traffic light and it's unfortunate and I see it everywhere. It does not matter what it could be on for Washington I'm singing it on for Washington yeah The, Cloisters I've, seen it on St. Nicholas down by a hundred seventy of street. So clearly, there's no regulation and my feeling is that the rebel bikes are being treated kind of how dirt bikes were treated by the NYPD in the past that for them it was it's much more dangerous for them to go after them and chase them down than to actively try to stop them, because it causes a chase down with a vehicle. That's sometimes much more nimble than an automobile is so that's part of my feeling as to why there might not be they're not being regulated as thoroughly as we would want them to be. But I do equity sentiment. We need to know who's responsible for it, and who can we talk to about the park issue because it does come up in the parks, meaning. Why are not they GPS locked out of Park environments as James mentioned, because that is an ability that can be had so I could make one additional comment. It turns out again with the technology. If the cops identify one of these things, you know they could actually contact the they have to have it in the software of course, but they could contact the company and it would just shut down the scooter and it was close to a stop and then the cops would go up to this thing and deal with you know they just have to report it. You know all of these things are positive. Now the company's not going to want to do any of it. But again we have to keep these things in mind when we, maybe we can even invite a representative hand up Gerard, yeah, I'm, so Jim just touched on it. So my ask is that Revell should absolutely be asked to be at the September meeting. I have two s: I mean these bikes have licenses and they actually do not disappear. They have insurance, they have some general liabilities. I have to believe that Corporation Council of the city of New York knows that they exist. Somebody knows from a liability standpoint that they exist. They've been ready to do. This I think that they've to it my to SR, they should present at the meeting. They should advise Community Board twelve regarding Revels pedestrian protection mitigation plans, because they're obviously putting us all at risk, the second they should have to advise Community Board twelve regarding rebel Covid-19 nineteen mitigation plan to protect the public from the spread of carbon nineteen via the scooter. Our restaurants and businesses had tremendous restrictions placed on them. There was no reason in the world why rebels should not have restrictions at least equal to that thanks, Gerard, all right, I, just I'm, sorry, Sally and Edith. Once again, is that a new hand and if yeah I guess Edith go ahead? Okay, first issue: this is a technical question. Is this not meant to be silly? My chair has a gradient of Twitter. Do these vehicles? They someone was whipping down from 181St over the Amtrak tunnel in the Revel and it was creating a problem. They almost hit a baby carriage because they could not control of the live whatever you want to call it on the gradient number. Two I would like to ask that whenever we discussed CitiBikes, we also discussed the fact that CitiBikes in violation of federal or are not accessible and there's a lot of money in those things do T should be dealing with that we've had discussions with the commissioner and nothing seems to be going. There are love localities that do have accessible bikes, equivalent to CitiBikes and I'm, just asking for the same courtesy too, the community all right, Thank, You Edith. A couple questions, sorry, is that Sally, yes, okay, go ahead, wait I'm! Sorry, Sally did you have Sally. Is that Joe sing her hat she's on mute right now? Yes, okay, great Howie, you said you would take back to the MTA the possibility of having signage talking about the free masks that are available from the station agent. Could you also, at the same time as an alternative they could install the mass dispensers that are in many hospitals, etc, said there would be a dispenser visible to people who walk in without a mass, and they could then take a mess without having to interrupt a station agents. Those are not too pricey. Sally I heard the first part was. The second part was that there we could install like mask dispenser, like containers for like the walls of stations or something like that was that correct yeah, the free masses, I actually price and they're not very expensive, and you can do that too. Then a person without a mask does not have to bother station agent, but they're visible there, and it's like if you like science, it says you can't get on without a mask and then someone looks over season mask machine. They know they can get a mask and get on the subway yeah. So yes, I will follow up with our marketing team about any signage about the free mess we have. You know put it in our videos that we've put out in our press releases and things of that nature. Try and get the word out as widely as possible, but I will follow up if there's any efforts about signage in terms of installing those mass dispensers that you mentioned I think there's. Definitely some concern about I would guess abuse and overuse of those in terms of people just grabbing a handful of those and then disappearing quite quickly and I. Think that's why they've been kept with the station agents where you do. If you go through a little bit of effort to go, ask the station agent for them and they can give it to you. I guess. I just feel like if someone's abusing something like that to make all of us safer, it's a kind of abuse. It I do not worry about that. Much I did not quite hear that Sally yeah in terms of abuse I can see that. But if a mask dispenser is like right by you know, it's installed on the front of the station thing. I think maybe that won't happen as much, but in terms of the abuses that can happen in this world, someone abusing to get more masks that will be used to protect more people from spreading the virus. It's not I do not know if the concern would be about taking as many masks as they need for the next week as much as people. Maybe vandalizing or taking the mask from the reason and throwing them away and all surgery I think unfortunate, behavior that we still see in the subway, unfortunately, as we're as much all right, all right, wait. Sally! Sorry, we've had a lot of back- and- forth in that. Let me just because I have a few. We have a few people that have been waiting to ask questions and then we can circle back, but we did have one question in the queue a that from Amber John. That, for some reason, is tagged as answered so Amber, just in terms of the CitiBike expansion that was presented at the TNT meeting on June 1st and as well as a general meeting on June 23rd. And if you go on to the D- O- T site, New York City do T bike shared, you can see the map and that should be the 181St to 190Th, will start rolling out I think shortly very shortly, and you can see the map. What we are waiting to hear was that map is a pre final plan and the Community board responded on June 30. With our comments about Houston. We had two stations in particular that we had some comments on and one we really did and all that went in from the community board on June 30 and that sort of concluded they had done do Tia done various outreach, so they will sort of from that create a final plan and then and then roll that out. So our hope is obviously that we had comments for just a few stations and we're hoping that was sort of recognized, but just hop on the D- O- T DOT, NYC gov, and then it's under Bike Share and you there's a place. You can go down to see, B-12 and see everything and it's kind of cool. We have a question from Nancy Preston and let me just get you oops. Okay, all right, Nancy I think you can go ahead now. Yeah! Thank you hi, so I just wanted to acknowledge what Jim and Gerard suggested on the Revel issue and because what I'm hearing from all of my contacts you know, I live on. Semen indictment is how dangerous it's been in the parks with the rebel scooters all over the place and the streets driving on sidewalks all different ways. Even writing. There's even video of them writing shooting off fireworks over the weekend, and is there a way for the committee to turn that around and make the company itself responsible for this from what I understand now, the only thing that can be done is: if there is a problem, they can suspend the user right. But how long does that take to happen so coming? You know the I thought this was great about. You know having a Geo zone where it just turns off if they go into parks- and you know having it where, if bad behavior, if illegal behavior is observed, that they could be turned off and just turning it down so having them come and starting a conversation with them and also with the legal entities of New York City to have a little Everage on this would be great and just letting people know because I'm here, it's a really hot topic of discussion and we're lucky that nothing serious has happened. So far, but I've heard so many close calls have happened. So thank you, Thank You, Nancy, it's so true, I mean so again. We'll have this on the agenda. I will certainly investigate if there's something you know raise it with Ebenezer so that it, you know, sits with him as well and then Natalie. Maybe you can give me a little help. I mean obviously, as a community board, we have an ability to sort of raise issues as a board with city agencies, or you know, public entities, a private entity raises something else, but I sort of have an idea that you know. Can we do something through the mayor's office, so Natalie, maybe well? What I would what I would bring back are the conversations that we were able to put together for the publicist board. I should not say we because at the time I was a member of the Public Safety Committee and not of the NBP or staff, but in regard to those kiosks that they call them those obelisks where you can plug in and get Wi- Fi, and there were some controversial hot spots for some of them and actually bringing in the External Affairs and legal representation for the entities in addition to whatever city agencies had partnered to facilitate that enterprise and have them answer the questions to their community. So we will look into that and get back to you right all right, I mean I would love there to be something that we could get started. You know sooner rather than later, but sort of realistically it's hard to see how we do this without sort of having them and then being able to do a resolution. Or what have you so yeah if you could sort of give a little guidance on how we might be able to influence this I know, they've had a number of personal injury lawsuits against them already that's happening, but and on the only other tidbit I have. Is it at the new year at New? York State includes them in a like. You do not need a license. You do not need a motorcycle license, so motorcyclists actually think this is wrong because they're like that's, that you just can rent one of these things and get on and you do not you're not trained you're, not really licensed, but as far as the state is concerned, because they're Max speed is 30 miles per hour, this very low bar to Brent one and get on one exists, so maybe we can get at it through the state in that way, maybe there's an opportunity, so I guess the last thing I will say is that people and I was hoping to do it in May or June. But you know things got a little hectic, so it did not happen, but that we should all be thinking about when we're in the budget exercise next fall. You know that obviously comes up right away every year and just to give some thought to how we might approach that in these really bad budget times all right. Let me just I'm just taking a look through the Q&A, okay and I, see Barbara woods had a comment about. In addition to the reckless driving of the rebel scooters. Is it possible to get a few strategic speed bumps check as traffic calming that's a excellent point and Omar? If you can just make sure we're capturing that from Barbara woods and then to wrap in D- O- T when the time comes about sort of do these having this additional vehicle racing around and does that make us look at certain streets for traffic calming that we may not have? You know had reason to let's say: okay and then we have oh right: Oh Rob, senator Jackson, meaning I, know that I know that I've been in my office has been in contact watching on Chittenden Avenue. You know where people come and they park, their vehicle is in a setup, and some of them are playing music, hooker and other things, and the people are very upset about the fact that they're being disturbed at all times of night and they are asking whether or not they could have parking of cause on the side where people come and park. Even though it's a no parking zone, they come and park there and then open up their car and a little table and they sit there and what- have- you and they're drinking making noise, smoking, what-, have- you and disturbing the basically the quality of life of the residents that lived there and, as you know, Chittenden is only this big and so I'm asking the Transportation Committee to. We adhere to their request to put in a request to see whether or not we can have that parking on the other side of the street. Where is no parking now right to be evaluated and I apologize that is Senator Jackson's office did bring this to me two weeks ago and I should have raised it. So thank you and I apologize for that gap, and you know because right now, what happens is also. It gets parked by placard people. So as long as it's going to be parked by placard people, you know we could kind of get a handle. So we either it's okay to have parking there or it's not okay, to have parking there. So what do T had said? You know that may be an issue as far as vehicles and the residents of that area basically says even with cause on the other side that may have placards trucks can come by there. So it's not like a fire truck, can not come by there and then they do a possible option and the week discussion I have with people, okay, maybe where they will put talking on that side and no parking on the other side, because that may be. That may be better, because it's basically on the side of the people where buildings live and that's interesting and you have a driveway or two driveways for buildings that have basically a driveway. So basically, they want to explore or options in order to give them a quality of life that they're used to having that's an interesting approach, because you'd also then pick up a few spaces, because a lot of that is either hydrants or garages. So interesting, I Debbie for the for the notes of what is the location again I was having internet problems so Chittenden Avenue, which runs from 186 to 187, and it is one block. It's like a one- block, Street west of Cabrini Boulevard between 186 and 187th, and it is one way southbound. Oh yeah, I. Remember this not so it's like a yeah, so there's just a lot of people always assemble there, and so there's like there's two issues. There there's I mean there's an enforcement issue of just a lot of hanging out and perhaps noise issues. I do not know, but then there's the issue of parking both as it relates to sort of people's ability. So people just end up parking in a no standing zone and there's and then hang out and, as I said, there's a lot of parking a lot of placards done. It's it. Then Avenue I want to say it's ch, I tte, nvm I've seen people yeah exactly congregating there. Sorry I just have a Gerrard's your hand still up. Oh no sorry, yeah no problem and then Maria I I'm hearing her over about the issue of the noise working and all that singing I. Think that would be fantastic. I think we need to educate people that they have to respect our community. They can they just you know, just see the brown until two and three o'clock in the morning drinking and carrying on. We do not have enough police officers to go around I'm, making sure that is. You know that they have to be under some control. Eliminating some of the amenities that we have in our community is no Djoser around here on Riverside Drive, the same thing is happening, and it's just people. We need to get people to understand on the street, that to working and to things like that, but not to have entertaining whenever they feel like that. I mean just imagine that what we suffer with the firecrackers the whole thing we just like it crazy sing all over the city. So I think that we need to make sure that the people who are using becoming rubber from another area and just entertaining themselves and their area are just people from the immediate community. There is it's bothering me because it's we are suffering this situation all over, need people to go to bed early and children to go to bed at ten, o clock or maybe lie, and you know getting a glass of milk and put it to bed and since like that, but this situation is much running all over all over us, and people needs to have some quiet time for themself, so I just do not know about the you know, did not park in the parking and since like that, but it's just like it's a pain. What is happening all over? You know our communities I just wanted to bend haha thanks, Maria it just want to capture. We had somebody in the queue a was saying: how do we recommend getting a speed bump that their recommendation is on seaman Avenue between Dyckman and Academy, or at least serving the community with their interest in it? So speed bumps if I'm, remembering right- and perhaps one of my colleagues on the committee can straighten out my recollection, if it's not right is that it used to be. You know, we'd ask for community input and if there was enough support- and then you put the request but I think that D- O- T changed its policy two years ago, such that they're, just putting in speed bumps like we kind of just need to ask, but I I'd have to find out the process, but it's not the same they're not involving us in the same way that they used to well there's a secondary issue since you asked- and that is that we are in this reduced speed zone for school safety. So they put in all pretty much on the streets that have the speed bumps like Cabrini and like cement already. Does they have these speed bumps as far as this safety program? And you know you can't put in a speed bump every two feet that would drive people crazy so well, we can certainly ask but yeah I. Remember that the reason we have all these speed bumps is because we're part of this safety initiative this seeking zone. Thank you so, but I will I will sort of get clarification, I, just sort of remember, Lyle, saying something it must have been like in 2018 about like they're, just putting them basically everywhere now and I do not even think there used to be, and this might have been the issue in vitamin Academy. If there was an incline, there was a certain level of incline that you could not put one down but I think even that sort of changed. So let me let me do a little digging on what I do not think that would have changed since that sort of a safety thing, but in terms of putting in more of them you know yeah. Thank you all right. Sally, did you want to finish this up or just something really quickly with the D- O- T, the open streets initiative for the for the open streets like Dyckman, where the restaurant thing is all self certified, obviously they're very popular I'm glad that restaurants have an option of making money but a lot of the guidelines in terms of having the facemask during the social distancing, limiting crowds, etc. You know I'm this past weekend. It was basically a breeding ground for the spread of Kovac and I'm, trying to figure out what's the best way to both allow the restaurants to make money but make sure that we're not killing people all right, Julie noted I, mean I, think that's sort of a the big, the bigger question and also how we're dealing with hot spots like of a hot spot emerges. Then a whole set of things happens right and things start to get shut down. So we have a you know you can sort of say it did not look like there is something but right now. That means that if it does come, does worse comes to pass and we start to see then there's all of a sudden, a hot spot created, and it was identified as having to do with that kind of congregating. Then there's things that happen right with tracing and shutting down, etc. So it's sort of like I think it's a little bigger than the TNT trouble and you know maybe we should just wrap them out to the governor because they, you know if they people do not follow rules. The whole house of cards going to come down again and we'll have to find them up his mountain all over again, and none of us are in the mood for that right now, on a related also in the QA somebody's at Amber. John was also asking if we considered a partial shutdown of Fort, Washington Avenue for outdoor dining purposes and so I think we have not considered it as a committee because I do not. You know I, think people have suggestions. I got one over the weekend about 187Th, Street I will say generally. It is right now above 181St and Fort, Washington, Cabrini, etc. We have so much coned, it's going to be coming back and getting started with their gas main replacements. We've got all that work at the corner of 181St and Cabrini and as it is we're not on the street grid right. So there's not a lot of egress and you know it's hard to get in and out sort of regardless and I. Do not think you can do that on bus routes. So that also is a Fort Washington problem. So I think we need to keep the ideas coming and feed those to do tea and people can do that directly or they can come through us and we'll get it to do tea because everybody's you know, they're continuing to expand open streets and the open, dining etc, but I just I think it's tough right now in the neighborhood, because we have a lot going on and some of it has been on hold and is going to be restarting and it's been very hard to get around for a year. You know a solid year and it's not about to get better. Alright Debbie I have a question about the outdoor dining you or does anyone know if there's a rule regulation in place as far as distancing of the tables, there is rules about that. I spoke to Debbie. Briefly, when we had a conversation earlier that when I returned back about a week and beacon and the city had gone back into its next phases, reopening I walk down Broadway and there is they have very specific rules and regulations in terms of the distance between the seats. The one part that I was very concerned about is the fact that they're supposed to be eight feet from the first set of sidewalks seating to the curbside seating, because they are allowed to use parking spaces as outdoor seating. So the problem that's occurring all in a lot of the businesses up here. Is that not only are they putting the seats on the curbside, but then they're putting seats adjacent to the curbside and when they do that, the eight feet between the sidewalk seating, Butts right next to the business and then that additional curbside seating that they've added on top of the parking spot seating is now reduced to less than eight feet and it's. It becomes an ABA issue from my understanding, because that eight feet is needed to provide additional enough space. So if people want to go, you know north and south or East and west, on that Sidewalk they can do it freely, especially if somebody's in a wheelchair or on crutches. So we have an issue with a lot of businesses up here, not about by these rules. So, like the reason why my hand up, is we really need D-, O- T? Who is the regulator on this to come to our meetings and really tell us besides, since telling us call it in because I'm seeing it a lot and as some of you have mentioned, some of these businesses look like it's a club outside I'm, just going to be honest with hookahs on the table and zero social distancing occurring as Sally had mentioned. Well yeah. There are rules to this right, but my question was not about the eight foot. I know that rule I'm talking about the tables. How first have how space- themed they're supposed to be because the poi we're going to you know, do social distancing and it seems to me the tables need to be six feet apart. They are that's required, yeah! That's why I thought. Let me I'll pull down. There's a thing on the New York City site or Natalie. Do you have something that you can send over is not there a one- pager on the New York City site about the restaurant stuff? Yes, I just did actually put it as a panelist, like I, can't actually initiate a question in QA, but I pasted. The link to in response to Nancy Preston's remark that the rules are a do t. So it's the do. T open restaurant page and, as you know, they rolled out a set of rest of a set of open streets in New, York City, 22 total. You know that are a combination now of the open, Street and that was closed off to traffic and then some dining as well. But there are none in our district. Yet there was one in East Harlem from that initial rollout at the Uptown Grand Central area. So the idea is that other folks would be able to apply where your restaurant is near. An open Street, and sometimes it is an entity like a bid or some of their organization. That applies as an agrees to be I, suppose some kind of a supervising entity. The rules are very often in flux and remember that it is self certified. So when folks are applying and saying that they have X amount of space, my questions that are press to do T at some of these meetings are: do you have a record somewhere where you can actually see a map and check their math? And there really was no clear answer on that, but D- O- T is the agency that has taken responsibility for this. So they are the ones you know when you send in your 301 complaint, and there is even if you use the online 3- 1- 1, there's a dedicated portal to reopening violations, and so theoretically that ends up with do t, but we yes, it is a challenge. It is a challenge because, from you know, from the very basic idea that you know, pedestrian traffic is still going so pedestrians who have no relationship to the diners on either side of them. You know have to kind of hold their breath because then the diners clearly, because they're eating are unmasked. Sorry it creates it creates some. You know some noodles here in the recipe, and you know we just go kind of one step at a time with it, but in my neighborhood here, I have not I have yet to see tables that are six feet apart from each other. You know, if anything, when people sit at the tables they're back to back on top of each other, and you know unless I see something in writing. I am reluctant to call 3- 1- 1, because I do not know. You know. I want to be sure what I'm talking about yeah. We have a clarification on the QA saying and that six feet between the sides of the table not from Center to Center, so that should theoretically create more space, not less I'm confused about what the center of the table. What's the differences you want to measure from edge to edge, or else it would end up. People would be closer but to your, but it does not mean to your point that then, when the chair with the chairs in and if they've cut, if they cut a foot or two and then you've got the chairs and people are sitting on each other's laps, right and I'll say happening in my entire neighborhood I know all the restaurants that have tables outside yeah I think you know, I think it also has to do with the seating configuration and, in theory where the diner is facing. So it's sort of like the regulations about an elevator writing that, for people can be an elevator that is only about five feet acrosss as long as all four are facing a different corner. So the idea is it's not that the virus can't move side to side is that you're supposed to you know, keep your mask on and be you know facing that corner until your elevator you know opens up. So the idea is that, as long as the diners on one end of the table are six feet away from the ones facing toward on the other side of the next table, then that is sufficient distancing. But it's not the tables themselves. The entire area, surface area of the table that has to be six feet apart, yep, that's not that that's not happening right. Alright, thank you. Mary! Thank you, sorry and then just think we're getting ready to wrap up Nancy Preston. Did you have another something you wanted to say, or is that an old hand? Yeah? Yes, I do! Thank you so they're, just three things. I have to add to this. First of all, the D- O- T their website that we put in, has very clear illustrations of the saw of the distances and the open. The restaurants that have opened on Dyckman between Broadway and seaman from day one opened using the open streets, they're still not listed as an open streets. They took over the whole street, okay and what that has created. Of course they took away tons of parking, but like certainly we want to have the businesses out there and there's. That is not an objection, but what has happened in a traffic perspective is cars and people coming now double Park belong seemed in several blocks, belong between Seaman, the gas station and Seamon and Riverside, and then also a long Riverside. So there is a really big issue and of course, people hang out in these cars picking up on what Maria was saying and then because the restaurants have to close at 11 o'clock right they clean up now it has become a party place. That's open like this is just a party place and everybody hangs out, and you know, neighbors are just going crazy with this because it goes on all night and so that's created another issue. The other issue is the egress, the traffic. So when you close off that hard emergency vehicles can't get down, they do not have access, because we do not have normal one- way streets there, and so it's very difficult for emergency vehicles to get to that westside of the area. So that's a traffic issue. I think needs to be understood and also another, as people are talking about. The businesses that are doing outdoor dining I find and people have been reporting that often the son, the cross are blocked, they're, not adhering to the clearance for crosswalks. So that's and VOT is the agency. The community has been in touch with G ot, but they, but you know this program- is to help the businesses and there's really sort of stepping back I, think Natalie said influx right and fluidity. You know what's going what they're doing to support businesses during this time, but the first protocol, of course, that Sally brought up is the safety of our community as well, so I just want to bring those three points off. Thank you all right. Well, thank you and you know, there's aspects of this at our public safety, but you know rest assured that you know Curtis young is on these matters and we are connecting on the various things that are touching on both streets and the public safety aspect and may add it was Curtis. That said, that I should bring this to the committee because we know I think yeah, because it thinks there are some things that are a little fuzzy. I'm not saying do not bring it here. I'm just saying: there's aspects: it's a traffic enforcement. We have this heard this thing about seamen in the double parking, etc and I did not know about Riverside as well, but stands to reason and then there's a lot, that's under D or T's jurisdiction. So no so it's much appreciated and, as I always say, we're only as good as what we are hearing from you all. So but then you know, but then it comes back to like there's. Also then the aspect of the late night, which then is not about the open street or the open dining program. And then it's just the general issues as Maria outlined anyway, with that I think we're going to wrap it up for the summer, and you know I still have some follow- ups with MBP and with ebony, czar, etc. But I appreciate everybody being here tonight and our special meeting and wishing everybody a great summer, but certainly keep in contact, because it is feeling very active and the issues that we're seeing right now and trying to balance are not are going to be. You know this is it. This is these are programs that are running for the summer and so we're going to have to be a little. You know stay engaged to some extent and with that anybody want to make a motion to adjourn Newton's all right and thanks to Senator for being here and I, saw Evelyn creado and Chris Nichol and everybody take good care. Okay, thank you have a great summer. You.
