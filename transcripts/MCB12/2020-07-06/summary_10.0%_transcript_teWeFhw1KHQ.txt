We're, going to pretty much go straight to our agenda item with the MTA I do want to provide an update before we get started, though, on 181St Street bus, way.
It is an update as to process, so the Community Advisory Board, which is do teas sort of first step, is bringing together both members of CB, 12 and representatives from elected office and other you know, organizations, etc.
Let me pass it to MTA Howie Levine I work for government relations at MTA, New, York, City, Transit I was a senior project manager on our a line, elevator replacements and can go into the technical knowledge that I may not know.
If anything does happen, we'll be able to know exactly what it is, what kind of crew and parts we need, and so we can respond a lot quicker, additionally, we're adding a backup battery system that will allow passengers to exit the elevators if there is a loss of power, while people are in them, and, lastly, communication systems upgrade most notably including two security cameras in each elevator, cab.
You know either going to there or back from there, local and for buses operate and M-98 buses operate specifically during rush hours in the peak direction and provide a bus connection for those that need it between the two stations and just to kind of hammer it home.
Of course, during the work you know, we'll have personnel going up and down these stairs, but the Serkis will remain open to the public to access the park.
Just when you say that this project could be accelerated into very late August rather than September, can we infer then That would mean that the hundred 84Th Street elevators might be up earlier in August rather than later in August, or is the MTA willing to communicate a date yet and then also when we hear about and funding theirs, I presume that's about very forward capital projects and won't affect the escalator project, but just clarify that I'm correct about that.
We're, so little cautious about everything in terms of wrapping up the work there making sure It's, you know perfect and ready for customer using it all right.
My question really is: Have you thought about that, because I think there would be a lot of people who would like to have a handicap accessible station.
You want to unmute yourself by handing me to myself there, you are and I'm, given that I know nothing about the work and what the capital plan is, And. It seems like I.
It's, less problematic, but in terms of 207 is, you know, was scheduled to be replaced also as part of kind of a regular cycle of a DI elevators throughout the system, but I think that's also.
That's, why you would normally see and out of service sign or a bus, maybe going between routes where it's, In terms of seeing three in a row when there's people waiting- More specific details, but, like time, you know day a possible any bus, numbers.
, there's a there's a way for you to check if we like, just sort of what the performance was heading Downtown, like I, can kind of check in with those general parameters and see, if there's anything that looks unusual last Friday and that was a Saturday service and on Friday or what service was running on that federal holiday on Saturday I'd have to double- check, but it was, you know, probably a Sunday service, probably as soon as oh, okay, Yes, no I appreciate you, though state Senator did you want to share anything with us.
It was evidently excavated in part or in whole, in conjunction with the work being done on the 207th, Street Read, an interesting story, And I, believe, and certainly something we would hope to address in the Manhattan bus network redesign when that you know comes about those are also on hold right, now, just because the difficulty of holding you know, in, person, feedback sessions and moving forward with those that we have active currently in the Bronx, the Queen's in Brooklyn, as well so I think when we get around to doing Manhattan.
There's a Department of Education contact too over how some of this might be made available to local students, its history, teaching, Mm I did have a couple questions to come up in various committees that are MTA related, but I'm, not sure I do not know.
It would be under him, but there was a question in the AG committee about people needing accessibility to buses that were not allowed in the front door of buses because of the roping off for something for co- head, and there was also an issue with subways.
Sort of the subject of you know: continued cases of people being denied boarding via the front door and how he's sort of responded to that in terms of how to bring forward Bring that forward to the MTA Otherwise, I would sort of refer to the minutes and let's deal with the second part of the question, and is that you know that's important stuff ,, you know there's really so, as we no questions asked, you can use the front door.
They do have those vending machines at other stations, predominantly in Midtown at downtown, and those stations, I believe were determined by just overall ridership at those stations and I do not know what the status that is going forward if there will be more machines installed, but in general the best way is to just go to the booth and ask for a mask.
You had another point, just very quickly, right, a question for the accessibility and station that are accessible to people to have either which way around and so on.
100 168th on the one is also in the 2020 capital plan, as is Dyckman Street on the one which is I believe going to be ramps, not elevators, as well, There were some community meetings to solicit feedback on stations run by our system- wide accessibility team within New, York, City Transit, but generally the goal is to have stations that are that you can't be anywhere in the system where you're more than 2 stations away an accessible, station.
If she asked about the mask vending machines that you guys rolled out and whether or not they're going to roll out for uptown And, so I wanted to know if that was in the plan sure so the so the vending machines are primarily at Midtown and downtown stations.
All right with MTA We. Do not, however, get regular updates from either content or DEP about projects that affect our streets at Cabrini and 181St. There's been work, that's been going on.
We target having it on there, but it's a single biggest thing that at least I see I'm sure I do not know about the rest of you, One of the issues that came up is that the scooters are also not supposed to be on the pads in the park.
We need to know who's responsible for it, and who can we talk to about the park issue because it does come up in the parks, meaning.
I do not know if the concern would be about taking as many masks as they need for the next week as much as people.
I mean obviously, as a community board, we have an ability to sort of raise issues as a board with city agencies, or you know, public entities.
You can just make sure we're capturing that from Barbara woods and then to wrap in D- O- T when the time comes about sort of do these having this additional vehicle racing around and does that make us look at certain streets for traffic calming that we may not have?
As long as it's going to be parked by placard people, you know we could kind of get a handle.
We need to get people to understand on the street, that to working and to things like that, but not to have entertaining whenever they feel like that.
Right- and perhaps one of my colleagues on the committee can straighten out my recollection, You know, we'd, ask for community input But I think that D- O- T changed its policy two years ago, such that they're, just putting in speed bumps like we kind of just need to ask, but I I'd have to find out the process, but it's not the same they're, not involving us.
Let me let me do a little digging on what I do not think that would have changed since that sort of a safety thing, but in terms of putting in more of them you know Sally.
You, know I, think people have suggestions.
Because everybody's you, know, they're, continuing to expand open streets and the open, dining etc, but I just I think it's tough right now in the neighborhood, because we have a lot going on and some of it has been on hold and is going to be.
How first have how space- themed they're supposed to be because the poi we're going to you know, do social, distancing, And. It seems to me the tables need to be six feet: apart.
There is a really big issue and of course, people hang out in these cars, picking up on what Maria was saying and then because the restaurants have to close at 11 o'clock right, They, clean up, That's open, like This, is just a party place and everybody hangs out, and you know, neighbors are just going crazy with this, because it goes on all night So that's created another issue.
