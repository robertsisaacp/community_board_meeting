Let's go so traffic and transportation special meeting , pretty much go straight to our agenda item with the MTA I do want to provide an update before we get started, though, on 181st Street bus, way.
That's what I've got on 181st Street bus way with that I work for government relations at MTA, New, York, City, Transit I was a senior project manager on our a line, elevator replacements and can go into the technical knowledge that I may not know.
You know, Work that we find will repair It's, not quite as extensive as the work at Hearn 81st Street, where we had to build kind of an additional shaft within the shaft to make sure there was no future water.
You know either going to there or back from there, local and for buses operate and M-98 buses operate specifically during rush hours in the peak direction and provide a bus connection for those that need it between the two stations and just to kind of hammer it home.
During the work you know, we'll have personnel going up and down these stairs, but the Serkis will remain open to the public to access the park.
Just when you say that this project could be accelerated into very late August rather than September, can we infer then That would mean that the hundred 84th Street elevators might be up earlier in August rather than later in August, or is the MTA willing to communicate a date yet and then also when we hear about and funding theirs, I presume that's about very forward capital projects and won't affect the escalator project, but just clarify that I'm correct about that.
My question really is: Have you thought about that, because I think there would be a lot of people who would like to have a handicap accessible station there?
You want to unmute yourself by handing me to myself there, you are and I'm, given that I know nothing about the work and what the capital plan is, And. It seems like I.
It's, less problematic, but in terms of 207 is, you know, was scheduled to be replaced also as part of kind of a regular cycle of a DI elevators throughout the system, but I think that's also.
You know specific stations that have this issue to the board: Right well, let's just if you guys, can just connect and make that happen so that the vertical gap issue one 71-68- should not be connecting external to the committee.
Bus hasn't been running for a little while during the pandemic, but well, the m4 is always there for I was seated in the restaurant over there and 193rd McKee Mishima and three Baz is the same time pass by and this and northern service, not inserts people waiting for the boss, Sometimes we will.
That's, why you would normally see and out of service sign or a bus, maybe going between routes where it's, In terms of seeing three in a row when there's people waiting- More specific details, but, like time, you know day a possible any bus.
It was evidently excavated in part or in whole, in conjunction with the work being done on the 207th, Street Read, an interesting story, And I, believe, and certainly something we would hope to address in the Manhattan bus network redesign when that you know comes about those are also on hold right, now, just because the difficulty of holding you know in-person feedback sessions and moving forward with those that we have active currently in the Bronx, the Queen's in Brooklyn, Well, so, I think when we get around to doing Manhattan.
Maybe there's a Department of Education contact too over how some of this might be made available to local students, its history, teaching, mm-hmm It would be under him, but there was a question in the AG committee about people needing accessibility to buses that were not allowed in the front door of buses because of the roping off for something for co-head, and there was also an issue with subways.
Sort of the subject of you know: continued cases of people being denied boarding via the front door and how he's sort of responded to that in terms of how to bring forward Otherwise, I would sort of refer to the minutes and let's deal with the second part of the question, and is that you know that's important stuff.
100 168th on the one is also in the 2020 capital plan, as is Dyckman Street on the one which is I believe going to be ramps, not elevators, as well, There were some community meetings to solicit feedback on stations run by our system-wide accessibility team within New, York, City Transit, but generally the goal is to have stations that are that you can't be anywhere in the system where you're more than 2 stations away an accessible, station.
If she asked about the mask vending machines that you guys rolled out and whether or not they're gonna roll out for uptown The people who you know might want one of the really fancy more expensive mass at one of these vending machines.
We are hearing from people just wondering you know: When we're gonna get the sidewalk back 181St, we've lost a whole bunch of parking, and it just seems like there's.
It does not include you know a hydrant a park And I'm going to sort of present to the committee.
N't there's also a traffic enforcement aspect of this that I think Curtis will be picking up on, but I just want to say, like you know.
We need to know who's responsible for it, and who can we talk to about the park issue because it does come up in the parks, meaning,?
Don't know if the concern would be about taking as many masks as they need for the next week as much as people, maybe vandalizing or taking the mask from the reason and throwing them away and all surgery, I think unfortunate.
I mean obviously, as a community board, we have an ability to sort of raise issues as a board with city agencies, or you know, public entities.
We need to get people to understand on the street, that to working and to things like that, but not to have entertaining whenever they feel like that.
If I'm, remembering right-- and perhaps one of my colleagues on the committee can straighten out my recollection, You know, we'd, ask for community input But I think that D-O-T changed its policy two years ago, such that they're, just putting in speed bumps like we kind of just need to ask, but I I'd have to find out the process, but it's not the same they're, not involving us in the same way that they used To. Well, there's a secondary issue since you asked- That is that we are in this reduced speed zone for school safety.
Because everybody's you, know, they're, continuing to expand open streets and the open, dining etc, but I just I think it's tough right now in the neighborhood, because we have a lot going on and some of it has been on hold and is gonna.
They took away tons of parking, but like certainly, we want to have the businesses out there What has happened in a traffic perspective is cars and people coming now double Park belong seemed in several blocks, belong between Seaman, the gas station and Seamon and Riverside, and then also a long Riverside.
There is a really big issue and of course, people hang out in these cars, picking up on what Maria was saying and then because the restaurants have to close at 11 o'clock right, They, clean up.
That's a traffic, issue, I think needs to be understood and also another, as people are talking.
It was Curtis that said, that I should bring this to the committee, because we know I think yeah, because it thinks there are some things that are a little fuzzy I'm, just saying, there's aspects: it's a traffic enforcement.
