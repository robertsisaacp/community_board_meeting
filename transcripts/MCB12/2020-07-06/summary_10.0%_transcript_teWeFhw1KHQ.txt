You know needed maintenance, hopefully before anything, you know takes an elevator out of service If anything does happen, we'll be able to know exactly what it is, what kind of crew and parts we need, and so we can respond a lot quicker additionally, we're adding a backup battery system that will allow passengers to exit the elevators if there is a loss of power, while people are in them and, lastly, communication systems upgrade most notably including two security cameras in each elevator cab, There's two entrance and two access points, one at Bennett, Avenue and through the tunnel and the other at Fort, Washington, Ave and Murray curve, and certainly the elevator entrance We are working on for this project.
So for this work, as at a hundred eighty first Street on the a Of course, access is only going to be from Bennett Avenue If conditions permit right now we're still on schedule at 181st, Street on the a to wrap up in August and additionally for those for winter, brawls are still on schedule at 194 eat on the one, although that's a little farther into the future, but we're very happy that you know we've kind of been able to keep ourselves on schedule and catch up when we follow a little bit behind over the last few months, and so we're pretty happy with that These elevators are out of service.
We recommend people use the 181st Street Station and specifically the elevators at 180, 4th Street, which will be newly reopened You know as a kind of inherent part of this project.
Those will be back open before we close the elevators 180 4th street You know either going to there or back from there, local and for buses operate and m-98 buses operate specifically during rush hours in the peak direction and provide a bus connection for those that need it between the two stations and just to kind of hammer it home, The, Bennett passageway remains open throughout every part of this work.
Just when you say that this project could be accelerated into very late August rather than September, can we infer then that would mean that the hundred 84th Street elevators might be up earlier in August rather than later in August, or is the MTA willing to communicate a date yet and then also when we hear about and funding theirs, I presume that's about very forward capital projects and won't affect the escalator project, but just clarify that I'm correct about that The city answer your second question: First, the funding issue, the elevator projects are all part of you know, there's one counter for the one elevators and one for the a elevators.
We can't do that, and especially right now, given the state of the capital plan, that's not really something that's on the table at the moment, but if there's specific cobblestones I'm, not sure where the cobblestones are you referring to that, I could because I could for watching time that you have I know the material that they are so just kind of the stability of the stairs.
We will, if punches, if bus and start to bun, we will take one out of service and you know send it down to the end of the router somewhere else on the route where there is a larger gap in service That's, why you would normally see and out of service sign or a bus, maybe going between routes where it's, You know there's a lot of flexibility with buses in this regard, but in terms of seeing three in a row when there's people waiting-- and you know I, can you can get me in the future more specific details, but like time, you know day a possible any bus numbers.
There was an incident evidently on last Friday, but over the years that I've lived up here, it happens time you know, probably deserves a little more of an investigation than just what happened on Friday, perhaps I'm speculating there may be routes that need to ended 135th instead of ending up here at this end of the route so that when they turn around they're going somewhere It's a speculative answer and finally, a question on something: That's not on the agenda tonight now be brief, read an interesting story and I believe and certainly something we would hope to address in the Manhattan bus network redesign when that you know comes about those are also on hold right now, just because the difficulty of holding you know in-person feedback sessions and moving forward with those that we have active currently in the Bronx, the Queen's in Brooklyn, as well so I think when we get around to doing Manhattan It will be a big part of that project, uptown in terms of the PT 59, : Maybe, there's a Department of Education contact too over how some of this might be made available to local students.
On the sidewalk, because the buses do not have you, know: you'll have two seniors on the fold up seat and the driver says I'm full and drives away A question for the accessibility and station that are accessible to people to have either which way around and so on.
That are, you know and a big demand by people who might need an ad a station, though like accessibility, we always come back to it.
Let's say it's, not a full accessibility, but there are improvements to address some factors within the station that are making it difficult for people with Maybe we can sort of have a little bit more time on this subject, because it's really important up here, as you know It is borough-wide that I have trouble getting it into the Train from the platform without Good Samaritans coming out and picking it up.
Oh Maura and I have talked about is over the past, I mean certainly all through June we're seeing a lot of stuff about rebel scooters gone wrong, meaning not obeying traffic laws being ditched in inappropriate places and the only appropriate place is in a real parking spot in a drop-off zone It does not include you know a hydrant a park and and I'm going to sort of present to the committee.
The light the greenways are right-of-way, so it's not the first time I've seen greville users completely This will be traffic light and it's unfortunate Nicholas down by a hundred seventy of street Clearly, there's no regulation and my feeling is that the rebel bikes are being treated kind of how dirt bikes were treated by the NYPD We need to know who's responsible for it, and who can we talk to about the park issue because it does come up in the parks, meaning.
They almost hit a baby carriage because they could not control of the live whatever you want to call it on the gradient number and there's a lot of money in those things: the community all right, Thank, You, Edith, They could install the mass dispensers that are in many hospitals, etc said there would be a dispenser visible to people who walk in without a mass, and they could then take a mess without having to interrupt a station agents.
So speed bumps if I'm, remembering right, and perhaps one of my colleagues on the committee can straighten out my recollection You know, we'd ask for community input but I think that D-O-T changed its policy two years ago, such that they're, just putting in speed bumps like we kind of just need to ask, but I I'd have to find out the process, but it's not the same they're not involving us in the same way that they used, and that is that we are in this reduced speed zone for school safety As far as this safety program?
And, you know you can't put in a speed bump every two feet that would drive people crazy, so well, I, Remember, that the reason we have all these speed bumps is because we're part of this safety initiative this seeking zone Let me let me do a little digging on what I don't think that would have changed since that sort of a safety thing, but in terms of putting in more of them, you know The open streets initiative for the for the open streets like Dyckman, where the restaurant thing is all self certified, obviously they're very popular I'm glad that restaurants have an option of making money, but a lot of the guidelines in terms of having the facemask during the social, distancing, limiting crowds, etc.
So I think we need to keep the ideas coming and feed those to do tea and people can do that directly or they can come through us because everybody's you know, they're continuing to expand open streets and the open, dining etc, but Be restarting I have a question about the outdoor dining you or does anyone know if there's a rule regulation in place as far as distancing of the tables?
