If you could not tell who the workers were, because their badges were so small and there were thousands of people in line that could not tell you- could not find anybody right, but that was that's a last- minute jobs that they came up with because they usually have like a door clerk, which is the person who you know but outside on the street.
I. Think from you know, just what went on earlier this year after George Floyd that we're where we are here is sort of a good area.
I think that you know the result of this election is, is going to make us a little more conscious about the things that we are doing and since that we should be doing and things that we have not done, and we need to communicate with each other.
The committee made out very well on the capital budget, with the board voting votes, system- wide upgrade of CB12 area to improve access to connectivity and Wi- fi.
Budget, too, provide funding to construct, affordable, accessible senior housing, the board ranked number three.
You know the things that we want for the seniors in the community.
You know pull this in for the following year and things like that on the expense budget.
I will give you the rankings again, but I'll increase funding to expand services at senior centers in city 12 m to include hired hiring additional social workers and program coordinators to create culturally competent programs, adding meals, extending hours increasing per male per meal reimbursement, rates.
Oh no, I did that one increase the expansion in the program expanded in home services for elderly persons, funding to provide affordable home care, including sliding skill reimbursement, ranked number fifty ranked 15 by the board increase funding for transportation for seniors by restoring prior City Council funding and expanding access to access and outreach, ranked 25 by the board.
Currently, unfunded mandate for nursing, hours, ranked 29 by the board increase other than personal expense, personal services, funding for replacement, furnishings, non- capital and senior centers that as needed, ranked number 44 by the board.
And. You know one whole area of CB12, which would include because youth and Education Committee wanted it to include the schools kind of thing.
Does not mean that the funding is going to be available for those things, but we will keep pushing and hoping the connectivity, for, and Wi- fi for the entire CB12 area was made more global because youth education wanted to have it also in the schools, and you know that sort of thing.
Reason, I'm, saying that there's going to be more of a problem, there, I think, is because now, okay, everybody inside there has their masks off whether it's social, distancing or not, and most of it's not because the tables are on top of each other and the outdoor dining, but all those droplets that are being let out of everybody, that's sitting out there in those dining areas now is enclosed and confined there's no way out for that.
I think that the people should be doing something similar not to let anybody just walking from the street, because you do not know what you're carrying and things like that and try to.
I just do not know how to maybe pass it away to the senior centers to inform people to be careful not to allow people to even home.
You know health security for the people, who are they going to be taken care of so what we've been doing for the for, because we it's not technically part of the senior center, but we have a program called safe at home.
That works with you know, seniors in the community, and one of the services that it offers is.
If people feel like they need either someone to talk to or want a referral to some sort of services that might be able to you know, provide some sort of support.
You know, get to them and as far as communicating with their membership, but no not all the senior centers are open.
They sent out a communication to us asking us to answer a survey as to what our reopening plan might look like and asking us to provide a tentative date for, at which point we might feel willing to reopen, and they would they wanted that date from us, because they were not requiring all the senior centers to say that they were willing to reopen, and if only some were, they wanted to know whether they could pick up some of the slack for those that were not ready.
You know not just necessarily members of senior centers, where it's kind of like friendly visiting by phone.
A lot of people will read the book and come and enjoy they like they need that social interaction.
You know people from the senior centers and Julie.
There's been a problem, for you know some people in our community to be part of a senior center.
But I think that the once we open up these senior centers they may be because of experience that people have had during this.
They would like to join the senior center and they come out and participate, and things like that.
For you know, seniors, are housing and things like that, a protection.
You know, people who ran senior centers almost present to each other.
I mean there's nothing that says that if you're a senior in the community, whether you're a member or not, or even you know, if you're living in staten, island or Brooklyn, you could go on to have programs.
