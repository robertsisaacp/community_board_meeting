You could not tell who the workers were, because their badges were so small and there were thousands of people in line that could not tell you could not find anybody right, but that was that's a last-minute jobs that they came up with, because they usually have like a door clerk, which is the person who you know but outside on the street.
Think from you know, just what went on earlier this year after George Floyd that we're where we are here is sort of a good area, I, just sort of feel that once the final you know result comes in there's going to be a lot of unrest.
You know, disturbances, I, think, there's going to be some in some areas.
Think that you know the result of this election is, is going to make us a little more conscious about the things that we are doing and since that we should be doing and things that we have not done, and we need to communicate with each other.
Other thing is also that the numb, the sheer numbers of people who came out and people I heard you know like interviews with people who never voted.
So I, think you know, people were really feeling regard regardless of what side people were feeling energized and maybe there's some way to make sure that this there should be.
I have to find out if she's still around or whatever, but here every elation she will walk to the table, again, sign in and then go and vote because she, you know she says the people on her.
Okay, actually, I want to talk a little bit about the budget, results.
So I really did not respond to the budget, which is you know first time in many years that I have done something like that.
The committee made out very well on the capital budget, with the board voting votes, system-wide, upgrade of CB12 area to improve access to connectivity and Wi-fi.
You know the things that we want for the seniors in the community.
Let's hope this city comes up with the money now because you know it takes like his sons.
You know pull this in for the following year and things like that on the expense budget.
I will give you the rankings again, but I'll increase funding to expand services at senior centers in city 12 m to include hired hiring additional social workers and program coordinators to create culturally competent programs, adding meals, extending hours increasing per male per meal reimbursement, rates.
Increase access and outreach to healthy, culturally appropriate food for seniors, with medical needs, ranked number 19 by the board.
Increased funding for naturally occurring retirement communities to support, currently, unfunded mandate for nursing, hours, ranked 29 by the board increase other than personal expense, personal services, funding for replacement, furnishings, non-capital and senior centers that as needed, ranked number 44 by the board.
Did we put in anything about technology and access to technology under the in the capital, system, system-wide upgrade of Cb12 M area, because we wanted to make it more in discussion with the full board wanted to make it more inclusive than just the senior centers.
And. You know one whole area of CB12, which would include because youth and Education Committee wanted it to include the schools kind of thing.
You, know commitment, also and to make sure that you have the link with all the other committees, because I mean it's a.
Yeah, so everybody's really putting in a lot of effort into this committee, and you know that makes me feel good that I'm working with such a great team.
You know that kind of thing I was going to say: I, do not I'm seeing these places.
I think that the people should be doing something similar not to let anybody just walking from the street, because you do not know what you're carrying and things like that and try to.
I just do not know how to maybe pass it away to the senior centers to inform people to be careful not to allow people to even home.
You know health security for the people, who are they going to be taken care of so what we've been doing for the for, because we it's not technically part of the senior center, but we have a program called safe at home.
That works with you know, seniors in the community, and one of the services that it offers is.
You know all kinds of precautions if they're going to go in, but I think also a lot of stuff.
You know sending the wrong message, but I think that we need to be local for our local people just to urgent to be a little more careful and that we.
Know, provide some sort of support and I do not mean like we're going to be taking care of everybody's finances or anything, but just you know some sort of community effort to kind of now that we're.
You know something like a community event, perhaps I'm just going to throw that idea.
You know that sounds like a good idea, and you know perhaps the health and Environment Committee would want to do.
You know, get to them and as far as communicating with their membership, but no not all the senior centers are open.
They sent out a communication to us asking us to answer a survey as to what our reopening plan might look like and asking us to provide a tentative date for, at which point we might feel willing to reopen, and they would they wanted that date from us, because they were not requiring all the senior centers to say that they were willing to reopen, and if only some were, they wanted to know whether they could pick up some of the slack for those that were not ready.
You know not just necessarily members of senior centers, where it's kind of like friendly visiting by phone.
A lot of people will read the book and come and enjoy they like they need that social interaction.
It's you know interesting how much the senior centers are actually doing in terms of reaching out to the clients and providing well.
Oh for a Community board organization for organizations, community-based organizations in the community and board offices asked for suggestions for about those community-based organizations and who people think that the money should be going to so.
You know people from the senior centers and Julie.
There's been a problem, for you know some people in our community to be part of a senior center.
But I think that the once we open up these senior centers they may be because of experience that people have had during this.
They would like to join the senior center and they come out and participate, and things like that, but that's going to be.
We did well when our ranking, for you know, seniors, are housing and things like that.
You know real well, as a committee within the community.
Everybody is really you know, working very hard to provide services to and not to leave the seniors.
You know, people who ran senior centers almost present to each other.
I mean there's nothing that says that if you're a senior in the community, whether you're a member or not, or even you know, if you're living in staten, island or Brooklyn, you could go on to have programs.
If there were, you know to list all of the different websites or places where seniors in the community could go.
Is there a comprehensive calendar for CB12, because again now that things are on zoom, you've really opened up so many opportunities for people who I always go to this center and they do not think beyond.
Well I mean I'm a member of Waikoloa Senior Center, also because I represent community board 12, because I'm on the it, because I'm the chair of the aging committee, so you know.
