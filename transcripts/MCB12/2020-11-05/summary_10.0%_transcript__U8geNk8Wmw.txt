Just one second, we're waiting for Graham, just texted me that he's joining 20 now The chair of Manhattan community 412 public safety committee today is November 4th We'll start by having you introduce yourself, I'm, beginning with our assistant chair, who just stepped away from our computer and please enjoy, and after danielle, please feel free to just jump in if you're on the committee.
If, you want to stick around and hear about the legislation, furious Act, I think it'll be great to get your perspectives and dispute here and understand what's happening and how this, how the state is responding to the excess number of complaints for speed, racing.
And, that's actually related to the resolution that I'm going to just discuss, later, which is related to parking, but one question I had for you was related to guns.
So, if using your example, if somebody were to leave their car double parked running on Saint Nicholas Avenue run inside to the store, real, quick leave, their vehicle running, and my officers happen to come.
The bill that Senator, Jackson and I have introduced would allow them to be operated overnight and on weekends in areas that the city has identified as hot spots for street racing, and we actually in the bill, seek specific input from community boards through a public hearing, and so the goal is pretty simple Drivers, who you know, are often racing late at night and on the weekends, with no cameras to enforce or track them down, and we also think it's going to bring you know: law enforcement somewhat out of the picture and just make this an automated ticket.
I'm, going to drag race, you down the west side, highway, which we think is happening more often, so We know that speed, cameras, work and that data shows that when you get more speed, speeding, tickets, there's a reduction in drivers.
You know that are speeding and thanks to a new city law,, that's going into effect in February drivers that repeatedly receive speed, camera or red light.
You, see them driving real fast, which you know, people think that that's what they need to do in your city, one of the most crowded places in It's 25 miles per hour and the city speed limit and up in Inwood, it's 20 miles per hour and up in Washington Heights When you're coming into the neighborhood.
You see the sign that says 20 miles per hour, speed, limit, but I just think that people that are driving speeding- One block from you know, from where, from Broadway to post Avenue, just that little maybe 400,500 feet.
You know, I do not have money to give away, so we just have to drive a little slower and I have not gotten a ticket since, but I say to you even with I'm, watching so many of the scooters, the motorcycles, the delivery people with the with the with the the bikes that have the battery they're, going on sidewalk they're, going up and down the wrong street.
Why should they go 30 32 33 miles per hour when the speed limit in New York City is 25 and those you see so many of them running around without helmets on still, even though they say that before they take off they're supposed to take a picture with the helmet on, So we just need to clamp down on all of this eating loud music, excessive driving, going every which way in which.
I want to know what assembly, member or Senator in New York City is not going to support this bill, they'd be in big trouble.
Is there any discussion on how we can you know include language to maybe solve that issue at the same time, But it is a good point that we need greater enforcement around people who are disguising their plates and trying to evade speed cameras and other types of camera enforcement.
So I understand that the goal is to put these in places where there's been drag racing, but they just feel very paternalistic to me the idea of just having a camera flash when you're driving, potentially you know five or ten miles over the speed limit, feels paternalistic And, so I think that's a concern for me That's just a neighborhood, street, and You know these cameras just being sort of all over the entire neighborhood, from Post to the West side, highway to fort Washington to everywhere, and: We've had some shootings and some issues in the neighborhood.
So, we would be using existing school zone cameras at the suggestion of local community boards and allow them to be turned on during off hours to try to catch some of these racers.
The thing about the thing about Cameras is that you know they're, pretty Nobody gets a ticket simply their age or what they look like, or you know, for you know for another reason that you know we may find repugnant so that that's the other thing that I think is kind of you.
I think we'd have to you know, make certain that there was appropriate signage in areas just like there is now around school, camera, zone.
So you'd want people to know that they are there through signage, okay, And, I also think that, from a social media point of view.
All due respect, I do not know where a lot of people from the Community board live, but I'm just going to tell you that, where I live, on, West, 165 and Broadway has been like the Indianapolis 500 and all I'm hearing Is these dirt bikes.
Oh committee, members, all in favor, aye I, definitely support this And I understand the issue that we've been having and the number of noise complaints in the way in which it's affecting folks health, like Cheryl, mentioned it's a very real issue, and somebody mentioned that noise pollution is a public health issue which I totally get.
Manhattan supports efforts to mitigate you know they We come with some language there and to in support of the furious act to work in coordination with the community boards to determine locations.
It's, going to allow cameras in hotspot areas which currently exists in school zones to be turned on okay, So, because somebody had, I, think Senator Jackson had mentioned the West side highway before so.
I, look forward to you know: Please feel free to join us for the general meeting, where we have our full vote on this resolution and without further ado We're going to move forward in our agenda.
And I've observed many tickets on people's vehicles in no standing zones who are double parked, sometimes in near fire, hydrants and so I've.
This will this will basically, I guess, refund anybody that was ticketed during the start of Covid-19 up until the end of September and let's see also , we have a bunch of no standing zones in our district that I thought could potentially be converted into parking, but I think this might be actually a traffic and transportation issue, and then I guess.
Should I read those off, I think we want to open it up for questions and comments from the committee first Are there any initial questions on this issue?
So I was thinking that one of the potential resolves can be to encourage the fbny to actually paint these areas, but also, I was thinking that perhaps the NYPD could not ticket if there's no yellow line, but also if the person has made an attempt to park at a reasonable distance, because I know I personally have gotten a ticket where it said that I was like eight feet.
You know, I think that people should be able to park closer, and I.
I like this issue, because I think it is I think a lot of people are ending up paying a lot of money for things that you know for in times and places they should.
Is this a public safety or traffic and transportation issue, and I've gone back and forth, and we've been in conversation with Debbie who's, the chair of traffic- And, you know, since it is an enforcement issue and the traffic division or the people enforcing it, comes under NYPD.
Think a lot of them number of them do not look like they are The fdny actually is required to flush out fire hydrants.
It's really kind of a thorn in my side, because it's like picking you know picking the low fruit the people in the neighborhood that trying to get out there I often see I, see fleets, I've, seen police of tow trucks during times just taking the cars away- You know you want to be reflective of the needs of this community, because you know as much as there's much controversy over having a car in the city.
So I, just I'm trying to you know, raise some of the issues that those folks address, because I think we do not really talk about car owners.
I've observed people getting tickets in fire, hydrants and I've just been trying to think of ways to reduce.
We would never advocate for decreasing public safety, To. Do you want us to take it Offline and focus on making contact and getting those data points from fdny on the numbers of hydrogens in operation and getting a kind of idea and maybe trying to work within the agency and then come back to to the committee with Rep for something that can happen?
We, have a joint meeting with Tran with tnt, because so many of our public safety issues we have are intermingled with traffic and transportation and actually Community board.
Think people put that in the chat- I like the term about parking and mystification, because that's true And I'm, not sure if mythification is the word I just wanted just to share something quickly with you all, not necessarily related to public safety.
