So let's go on a very important face of this agenda. That I think is at the core of this entitled discussion. Let's discuss our purpose for all of us to be together in this evening, so I wanted to say that there are several reasons why we are meeting so and before I go into those details. I wanted to share with you that this is not the first time, of course, that we got together to discuss the this problems of homelessness and mental health in our community. The crisis that the city in general you know is facing so and what the Community board has done so far is basically call upon those members of the panel that actually join us on the first time and I can't thank that enough again for coming around this time, when and especially in this special time that we are experiencing, you know as a community. So here are some of the things that I wanted to, or the objective that I wanted to discuss it with you, so we're going to hopefully learn today and hearing from you know your expertise, you're going to be describing the existing crisis, I'm a crisis during this pandemic. I also hope to that you will be able to spotlight programs, resources and literacy efforts. You know- and this you know during this time and yes of course, we hope to provide an opportunity to the to the community and not only for this receipt, but the entire New York City, because remember this is something that is being and will say, and you too, as we are speaking right now, and people can go and ask us this and look at what did looking this conversation later on. So, yes, we have to provide an opportunity for the community, like Cbo's as well, and healthcare providers to learn and discuss critical needs and a strategy to support our youth living under these terrible conditions or circumstances. I should say now. This is at the core at the center of this discussion and before we do this, please allow me and help me to welcome our chairman of the war, who actually may have few words to to share with you Mr Chairman Eleanor. Would you have please join us and say a few words and help me to welcome you know our team, our panelists hi. Thank you fay. Thank you for an invite. Thanks to each and every one of the 43 participants on this panel and I'm sure that you guys already know that homelessness and mental health are serious problems, sometimes for some of us, because we're lucky enough to just stumble upon some of these issues. But to some of us is a real issue, especially minori in communities like ours, which are disproportionately brown black and brown populated, there's a lot of distress in our community and thank you to the finalists for coming in and providing some light and trying to help us guide us and understand how to best mitigate these problems and these issues. The importance of this of this meeting tonight I am sure that each and every one of us within their circles, friends, is to spread the word and start a conversation and I. Think faye and Ariel did a tremendous job at putting this together and, of course, lieutenant members who have contributed to make this make this possible and again I like to stress the fact that to some of us, the homelessness and mental issues are more directly impactful than others. So hopefully, our take away will be that we all take this as serious as possible and come up with some guidance and some solutions that we can later on discuss on that on another chapter of this story. Thank you, faye again for the opportunity to speak. Thank you, Mr chairman. It's really a pleasure. You know having you and I deeply appreciated. You know the fact that you took the time to join us and share a few words on this important event. So I also wanted to reiterate my appreciation for the members of this panel and I wanted to oh and that no I should say that I would like to introduce again and in the next phase of this agenda, to my colleague, Mr Daniel Amiranda, who is the chair of the housing and Human Services Committee, as you can see, or what you should expect from this event is or from this discussion he is going to be called moderating. Our conversation and I think at this point, I am ready and willing to conceal him, the flower, so he may continue with the moderating of this event. Mr Miranda. Thank you again for your willingness of your committee. You know to join us, so the flaw is yourself so again. Thank you. So much I can not say enough just what it means to me to specifically be co-moderating this event today. Thank you again for everyone who has joined us to be here and request this matter to begin. What I would like to do is give each of our panelists now about roughly between one to two minutes each to just give us a brief background about yourselves and I hope. You know what about the work you've been doing, that you really have been engaging with throughout these past few bumps now so and of course, I believe that you were referring to the panel I understood yes for our panelists so well. If we are going on the order of the agenda, perhaps we may have Miss Holy Hope Meister first introducing herself, yes, sure thanks so much everyone and for for having us. Some of us on the panel know each other pretty well, because we work together. So it's nice to see everyone kind of in the evening in a different in a different setting, but my name is Beth Hofmeister I work at the legal aid society in our homeless rights project. As everyone knows, legal aid is huge. One of my colleagues that I know is on here as well who works in our housing practice, but we do a lot of different things from criminal defense to immigration, housing, health law, employment. We represent children and family court, and then there are projects like mine, which are relatively small, but our job is to help individuals and families who are running into kind of issues related to getting into shelter or staying in shelter or staying there safely. We also work on policy kind of issues as they come up, including the legislation at the City Council and in the state level as well, and we also do sometimes bring lawsuits on behalf of usually class actions on behalf of large groups of people to make changes to how some of the city and state and other government agencies are implementing the services for homeless families and individuals. So, thank you thanks again for having me here today. Thank you. Thank you and can I have blanca introduce yourself hi, my name is blanca battino and I am an educator and I have been working in Washington Heights and for approximately 40 years out of my 47 years as an educator, I have been a retired principal and as well as an Rti specialist at another school and presently I am working to support the social emotional learning through training through ethics and education network at different agencies. I am an advocate and on the lover of our community, I believe in its resiliency and I am always ready to state, whatever needs to be done in order to help our community move on wonderful, thank you, and next and I have Daniel hi. Thank you. Everyone and thanks for having me on the panel senior vice president at help USA we're national nonprofit provider of homeless and housing services. Our largest footprint, although is in New, York City, about 80 percent. We run homeless, shelters about 16 of them in the city, homeless, prevention programs, permanent and domestic violence programs. We also work closely with legal aid and lisney lsny legal services of New York, especially in our homeless prevention programs. Home base, specifically in the Bronx I, have a portfolio of about 20 programs and near and dear to my heart, is our homeless prevention and aftercare portfolio. Our number one job, of course, is to prevent homelessness and when it does end for our clients is to make sure it does not reoccur. But while people are experiencing homelessness at one of our sites, just to make sure that they're comfortable they're safe and that there's a quick pathway out of homelessness. So thanks again everyone. Thank you. All right, I just realized. I'd not have the Mu button on. Thank you! So much may we have a randy introduced himself. Andy. Are you there yeah Randy's there randy yeah? Can you hear me? Yes, okay, great, so I just wanted to say it's a pleasure to be here again. I participated in this Panorama a few years ago, so it's always good to come back and share with you, some updates that have occurred since then, but my name is Randy Scott I am the assistant. Commissioner, for vulnerable and special needs youth with the Department of Youth and community development. I've been in this role for a little bit over 10 years. However, I've been in the field of social services for over 20 plus years. You know it's with experience in administration, homelessness, child welfare, domestic violence and so on, and so on, especially working with city state and federal governments, with the role that I play at DYCD, I oversee the runaway and homeless youth division, which is about 60 contracted sites within the New York City region, which includes street Outreach, drop-in centers, both on daytime and 24 hours, as well as short and long-term residential programs. So that's, basically a little snapshot and I look forward to giving you more information as we move throughout the agenda. Thank you. Thank you. Randy yeah and can I also have Sharon, introduce yourself. Yes, hi. Everybody really glad to be with everyone in this space. Once again, and for those of you who do not know me, my name is Sharon Kim and I direct, the uptown hub, which is a unique hub initiative that is funded by the Manhattan district attorney's office and is currently housed at New York Presbyterian Hospital. So we had launched back in 2017 as a youth development and drop-in center for 14 to 24 year olds, where our young people can connect to different resources as well as opportunities such as educational support, employment readiness, health services and other recreational activities. So we repo we provide that wraparound support to our young people, actually through a network of existing youth providers that are in the community, particularly uptown, and they work alongside our internal hub staff, which is comprised of program staff psychologists, as well as youth advocates, who actually provide individualized, mentorship and case management to all of our hub members, and so definitely in these last few years, and certainly with the pandemic. We have seen the growing issue of homelessness as it relates to mental health with our youth population. So I'm very much looking forward to this conversation tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so to get ourselves I, guess just a bit more acclimated to the environment that we're working with what I want to start with on my end, right now is to go through a bit of the facts regarding: what's happened with youth homelessness as well as really a mental health crisis, that's been going through been really just. You know, dealing with a lot of issues. Throughout these past few months, I collected quite a bit of data that you'll hear from me. Now that really captures information collected from the Shelter census reports, the New York City Department of Homeless services, the Human Resources administration, NYSTAT american community survey, the U.S Census Bureau, the homeless, Outreach Population estimate, New, York, City, Furman, Center, Bowery mission, the coalition for the homeless, the City Council and the New York Times. So you know quite a bit so to begin homelessness in New, York City has reached the highest levels since the great depression of the 1930s and the largest demographic within the population that are homeless is children. As a result, the number of students that are homeless has increased nearly 70 percent over the last decade. According to the Department of education, over the course of the city fiscal year, 2019,132 660 different children, men and women slept in the New York City Shelter system. This includes over 44,300 New York City children in August of 2020. There were 57,660 homeless people, including 12,866 homeless families with nineteen thousand and six homeless, children sleeping each night in the New York City shelter system, there's many reasons for families to experience homelessness. But in most cases multiple factors are involved. Common ones include mental illness, substance abuse, untreated medical issues, traumatic events and difficulty sustaining employment. However, the most immediate factors for many are the lack of affordable housing eviction, doubled up or severely overcrowded housing, domestic violence, job loss and hazardous conditions, oftentimes path, the prevention, assistance and temporary housing. Centers are where homeless, families in New York City go to apply for shelter and where they also go to reapply if they are initially found, ineligible or if they are logged out, essentially after missing check-in at their shelter for two nights in a row. In order to qualify to be placed in a shelter, a family must document all residences from the pres. Two years and proved to pass the fraudulent awards, they can not return to any of them if families become homeless because of domestic violence, they have to provide each police report and restraining order when they first go to path centers in 2018. Only 40 percent of families who apply for shelter at path met all requirements and gained placement when arriving at path. Families too often wait too long, wait long hours to potentially receive a housing assignment by midnight or later and are required to enter with their children present, which often forces children to miss school. To note here last year, 43 percent of the city's homeless students were chronically absent, which is defined as missing 10 or more of the school year. If families do not receive an assignment by midnight, at paf, centers, they're bused to a temporary overnight placement for some sleep and then return to path the following day to continue awaiting their assignment. The Department of Homeland Services says when giving out assignments. It takes into account the neighborhood where its youngest children, where a jungle child will attend school in its placements. However, only 50 percent of city shelter placements in 2019 or in the same borough. This is partly because the vacancy rates and shelters are so low. It is hard to make precise place precise placements. In addition, forty percent of all homeless families are fleeing domestic violence and are not supposed to be placed in a shelter in the same borough. At the end of last year, New York City reported that 114,000 school-aged children met a federal statute, known as the Mckinney-Vento homeless assistance acts, definition of homelessness, which essentially entails that they're lacking a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence in New, York City in 2015 to 2016. Only fifteen percent of third to eighth grade students, living in shelters, specifically read proficiently and only twelve percent met state requirements in math. Only sixty two percent of students who are homeless graduated from high school last year in comparison to 77 state city-wide research from the University of Chicago, showed that the inability to graduate from high school or earn an equivalency diploma increase the chances of experiencing homelessness of young adults by four and a half times the coalition for the homeless state of the homeless. 2020 report shows that the state of New York has been failing to address homelessness most disturbingly by allowing thousands of individuals to be released from hospitals and jails directly to shelters. In 2018, more than 3,400 individuals were released from state prisons directly to shelters in New York City between 2015 and 2018. More than 15,000 such individuals were sent to city shelters by the state in March of 2020 single adults between the ages of 18 to 29, made up 16 of single adults, sleeping in New, York, City shelters, the majority of whom had entered shelter after being released from state prison. Moreover, the state did not adequately address housing needs as psychiatric centers like that of the island pavilion that is close by and local here were closed, leaving many vulnerable people to homelessness, and shockingly one in every 100 babies born in New York City last year, was brought home from the hospital to a shelter. Furthermore, the public assistance shelter allowance by the state has been historically inadequate, leaving those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness without permanent, affordable housing options. Family homelessness, like homelessness among single adults, disproportionately impacts people of color among family heads of households, 55 identify as black non-hispanic and 38 identify as hispanic. Just four percent of family heads of household identify as white compared with 32 percent of the New York City Population altogether at least 94 percent of families in New, York City shelters are headed by people of color. The city is required by law to provide shelter to everyone who needs it and to accommodate this, they have been relying on finding options such as hotels for some time now, since the pandemic hit, thousands more people have gone into hotels, to reduce the spread of the virus in dormitory style, shelters and homeless. Advocacy groups have been pushing to expand the program further, although previously, before the pandemic, many had been pushing to stop this practice. Given the greater cost associated with the usage of hotels, the coalition for the homeless estimates keeping a family in their homes saves taxpayers 68,422 dollars per year in shelter costs 60 of new yorkers say they do not have enough emergency savings to cover at least three months worth of expenses like food and rent, while nearly 20 percent of New York City residents have already lived below the poverty line, earning less than twenty four thousand three hundred dollars for a family of four. This was this was back in March of this year that data was found, and, lastly, I'll just make two more points. According to data compiled by the New York City by the New York University, Furman, Center, 239,000, very low income, renter households are at risk, are high risk of becoming homeless according to Christine Quinn of Wynn, and also our former City Council speaker, who runs now 11 family shelters in the city, the ending of the current eviction moratorium could be catastrophic or even a small fraction of the expected families will begin entering shelters come to them. So clearly, this is quite a bit of information. It sets really a background that I think is it's incredibly important to understand. What's going to be affecting our families, what's going to be affecting many of the children and specifically many of our of our young adults right who are likely to be in these sorts of situations. So with that I'd like to now open up this portion between both, you know the youth and Education committee, as well as the housing and Human Services Committee to now go pretty much back and forth with our good friend fay here and her committee asking questions and with that being said, I'll go ahead and pass along I. Guess the mo the virtual mic to my good friend, faye: hey: are you there? I'm sorry I do realize that I was not you, so what I was saying is thanking. You know for such a wonderful. You know information which is so much in concert with this discussion. We really and deeply appreciate it, and I'm sure this would be at some corner. You know around this discussion we're going to we're going to find way to associate or bring discussion that actually relate to that. To that information that you just share with us. I believe that we are in the we find excuse me. We find ourselves in a face of the agenda in which our we really wanted to ask our panel, so if they can kindly wanted to brief us basically and providing all some kind of background or the views around, you know that you know around the other subject or homelessness and mental youth crisis. So during this phase, each of them may have at least three minutes, so they can share with us the view about this particular subject and once they all have the opportunity to provide their views and, of course, their personal opinions. So then I think that it would be a great idea to go into the questions, but let's allow them to give us some kind of background or whatever the information they wanted to volunteer. That is speak to precisely about the subject in discussion today. Thank you, Ariel again, thank you so and yes, we may want to start in the same order that we have the agenda or whoever is ready to volunteer and share that. You know that brief I guess, discussion or the view on the on this subject. If you want to just raise your hand who wants to volunteer and go first among the panelists by all means just do so Beth you want to start sure, I'm happy to start. Thank you. So, thank you so much for the that detailed explanation, because it does help kind of frame the conversation without us having to go into it, which is great I. Think one thing I want to point out is that when people think about homelessness, like the average person thinks about homelessness, to be honest with you, when you ask most of the time they think of folks who are unsheltered, who are living not in a shelter who are perhaps living like rough out on the street, sleeping in parks or maybe are doubled up, sometimes or couch surfing, but in New York City, we're unique in that we have the right to shelter, particularly to go into DHS shelter. But it's important to note that DHS is just one of a kind of a larger shelter system. Even within New York City HRA runs the domestic violence shelters, which is the Human Resources administration, where Randy works. As he's already talked about, we'll talk about more DYCD, they run the youth shelter system. Hpd runs a shelter system for folks who are displaced due to fire, or you know, emergency to their home and then there's a whole group of kind of private shelters, run primarily by religious organizations and churches and institutions so, and that's not even including sros, which is entirely separate or people who live in Hossa placements. So it's just really important to know that. There's a lot of options and a lot of groups of people who may you know, define themselves as being homeless and that's by the way, not even counting all the families who are doubled up like you talk about Mckinney Vento, which is the educational act that gives all these rights to homeless students. You know, their definition is very broad, is the broadest definition of homelessness. But a lot of other definitions are much smaller and it's just important to note that when or like know that when someone might come to you and talk about a living situation, they may not even define themselves as homeless, but legally they may be or may not be, depending on which setting that they're in it's just it's just a good thing to know. There's a lot of a lot out there in terms of I'll just touch on briefly kind of mental health related issues. I'm there's a lot of people on this panel who work directly with clients and will be on these issues, because I am a lawyer. A lot of the work I'm doing someone's mental health needs are very important about sixty percent of adults and in shelter or a family unit in Shelter. Have someone who's disabled within their unit. That may or may not include mental health, but it often does and part of why it's important to always consider mental health as a disability and something that may need an accommodation or to be considered. Is that being homeless itself and going through the process of eviction or escaping domestic violence or being rejected by a family member? The reasons why people become homeless and have to enter a municipal shelter system, that's traumatic in and of itself, even if you had not been diagnosed with any mental health issue prior to going into shelter, sometimes just that process can be very traumatic and can and can cause there to be a need for a mental health intervention and often the experiences that you might be having there just kind of dealing with kind of the process of like recognizing yourself within this newer community of people. You know sometimes people do not get along who live in shelter together and so you're. Trying to you know, you've lost, maybe your connection, particularly if you're escaping domestic violence, as Ariel said you're not going to be placed in the same borough, so you could have a family in Washington Heights, that's way out, maybe in Brownsville and so like they do not have any of their connections anymore, like they're people that they saw every day right so and that's for their safety. But there's also a lot of mental health impact that has, as we've learned, even during the pandemic, when you're separated from people that you care about, and you know in life, so I just I'll leave it there because I think that's about three minutes but yeah. Thank you! So Ariel you can continue. Yes in the order of the agenda so and whoever's want to volunteer as well yeah if this is your place. So if there's a there's, no quick volunteer, may I suggest me with me: I always since I'm the lone government person I always allow the other folks to talk before I speak, so I'm deferring to Daniel and Sharon and then I'll go after them. If they do not, they do not have anything. Then I'll go all right. So since they're not talking that means I'll talk, but with DYCD. We definitely can you guys hear me yeah. Okay, we definitely have a focus on mental health in our programming. You know, and it's one of our key indicators that we you know, expect our contracted agencies to focus on you know. The five key indicators are housing, employment, Education, mental health and basic independent living skills, but with mental health. We have made sure that any program that's contracted within our runaway homeless. Youth division has the necessary funding to you know, bring on mental health professionals, provide mental health services such as workshop case management around mental health issues, because we know that it. You know our youth are dealing with trauma like Beth was saying in regards to the situations that they are facing on a daily basis, so they need services to help them in terms of how to maintain that job that they may have or that housing that they may have and whether and continue to go to school. So we make sure that we have that embedded and we work with thrive. Nyc I know it's gotten a bad rep in the papers, but it's been good to us in regards to the funding that they've allowed that they've given to us and that we give to the providers and making sure that the services are provided and then there's some accountability to those services that are provided and there's like seven key things that the providers do with that funding and again that could be around. You know, workshops that they provide. It could be about intensive case management. It could be about creative case management that they do, and you know, there's many different things, so we definitely have conferences where we provide training to our providers and one of the big ones that we do on an annual basis. Unfortunately, we were not able to do it this year due to the pandemic, is our healing to hurt where we bring in professionals or who you know are experienced in trauma and vicarious trauma and other types of mental health issues to speak to our providers, provide them with tools that they can use on a daily basis, not only for their clients, the youth that they service, but also for themselves, because we got to remember that anything that's happening now. We also have to be a part of it because we too are dealing with trauma on a daily basis. So it's about self-care and making sure we take care of ourselves so that we can pass down and take care of others in terms of the services we provide and we connect with our sister agencies on specialties that they may have. You know something that we do not have a specialty and we may go to DOHMH Department of Health and mental health. We may go to ACS if it's a youth, that's under the age of 17. so these are things that we try to do on a daily basis and work with the community as well as our sister agencies. To do so, you know if you are in need of mental health services for youth and want to know more about what we do. You can definitely visit our webpage as well as you can contact me and I'll help to direct you in the right place, I'm in the area of mental health when we look at where most of our children attend both elementary middle school and high school, we're looking at a great deficiency of services, partly because they're not sufficient enough personnel within the school. Many schools just have one counselor to address the needs of many students and who have been traumatized. There is a strong need within the schools to provide training for teachers on how to identify students who have demonstrated some type of stress or traumatic experiences and behaviors. There are some schools within our district and I'm mainly concerned about the district, because that's where my information comes from, that are having types of programs that support staff, the majority of the schools, what they have is particular programs to address the social emotional learning needs of children, but we are in. This is a crisis time and the number of children, and not only children, but staff and family members who are burdened is extreme, and what we also find is that counselors finding bilingual counselors to meet the needs of our community, who is 75 second language learners, I, said, is even more difficult. So we're looking at a lot of mental issues and a lot of minimal services within schools to provide for that support, as well as in the community. There are other agencies that can support our youth than our children, but many times if we're doing family support, we need also the bilinguals person to be able to provide the best type of service. When we look at virtual counseling, that has become a big issue for parents who have limited technological skills for families that are immigrant families who have difficulties with actually talking to a computer and back and forth. It's not the same I mean it's a little different, so that has also been a challenge. We, when we look at how children at all age levels, are seeing the virtual constantly it has when it comes to counseling. Sometimes this is not the way they want to be able to experience that counseling experience, but I want to thank Ariel and Beth and everyone who's on the panel, because I'm honored to be with such distinguished people here and I want to thank Faye as well for always putting homelessness on the forefront. It is a major issue for me personally and it's a major issue for the children within the community, something that is not going to go away anytime soon and so I applaud all of you who are working to try to make it better. The cis. The educational system has a lot of growth in this area and I think that just talking and discussing and trying to look up for some solutions and also pushing our voice to to stay to the people who are actually listening to this, that we need to have action done for the welfare of the entire community, and that includes every marginalized community within our city. So that's what I think thank you and Sharon or Daniel. Would you like to go next? You are I can jump in briefly Sharon unless you want to go, I'm happy to go last. Feel free yeah go ahead. All right thanks! I do I mean you know it's hard to quantify at this moment in time in terms of in terms of where we are and where we're going vis-a-vis the pandemic. Family homelessness has actually decreased in the DHS system over the past eight or nine months, but we have no idea as to really why it's also been slowly decreasing over the past four years, which is by about 21, which is interesting. I, do not think that's also true for HPD and HRA systems with that, but I do think that I think that this is no the worst kept secret. Is that there's a really there's a looming crisis once the eviction moment lifted assuming it'll be fully lifted in the new year, which is what it seems like there'll, be a flood of cases in housing court and they won't nearly to prevent people from eviction, because so many people are behind in their rents from the supportive housing and when we looked at our rent roles that are tenants who are just unable to pay their rent in the pandemic has just increased by something like 70 to 80 percent. Now many of those folks have a subsidy. So it's not for us. It's not at that series for folks, renting market rate apartments. It's a very big deal homeless, prevention programs. We paid out this year alone well over two million dollars in direct financial assistance, even though evictions are not happening there is that momentarium in most cases, not all but most because we want to settle the arrears now to prevent folks who are really going to be at the cusp in January in February, but there is a tidal wave coming and it's just a matter of size. So true, yes, so I can go next and maybe I'm last and yeah I. Think for us, as we are at the hub working directly with young people, we've come to find that there truly are so many different reasons and situations that homelessness can happen and really varying widely based on the young person and I. Think for us, we really try to have a very youth-centered approach and understanding. What are the reasons? What are the factors that are leading to housing issues and mental health issues, and so, as we've been getting to know our young people more and developing those relationships, we really do find that a lot of the ones who have this particular issue, maybe leaving on their own, leaving their family home really as an escape mechanism in a lot of ways, because they're in invalidating, maybe perhaps abusive or even dangerous home environments. We have also had young people come and share with us, those who are in the lgbtq plus community in particular, who have actually been kicked out by family members, who won't necessarily accept them for who they are. And so we are just seeing a whole array of reasons why this ends up happening and then, more generally speaking, I would also want to say that a lot of our young people- it really is just the simple financial strains of financial difficulties that ultimately lead to the housing, instability or the overcrowded situation which I know Beth had alluded to before as well and then to kind of connect to the mental health piece. Something that I wanted to bring up is really. There does seem to be this cyclical nature about it. It's not one that always leads to another. It can be very bi-directional specifically for different mental illnesses. We have noticed like mood disorders, PTSD substance, use psychosis really can be predictors, then of future homelessness. But then it's the other way around. Vice versa. That- and that was also mentioned before- that we are hearing the stories of having to go through the system go through the shelter or even the application process can be that traumatic event which can be a predictor of then the development of a mental illness which could include suicidal ideation or even suicide attempts, and so you know, given all of these realities, I, definitely think it's so critical that, at the very minimum that providers and staff are aware of and sensitive to, the unique needs of each individual that might be experiencing these housing issues or homelessness, and that is certainly something that our staff is very committed to, considering and being better bursting. So I'll leave it at that, and we can continue the conversation. Thank you, Sharon, okay, so I guess I'll start handing this now off to really fade to take the first question here. Yes, if I may, I would like to kind of in make a parenthesis, because I think that is something that I just noticed and before we go into the question which actually may serve as a break for our panelists I just want to highlight some names that to me it's very important for me personally that I acknowledge their presence. You know in this important event: I wanted to say, for example, I wanted to acknowledge Natalie Espino from the Board of President Office she's, always like a guard. You know faithfully attending our meeting Natalie. Thank you so very much for being with us tonight. I also wanted to thank our boy members, not necessarily they are members of this committee, but they are our colleague because they are members of the Community Board 12. Sally Fisher. Thank you so much sally. We also have marshall Vanderpool. Thank you. Bruce Robertson Leo Jimenez and Dr Jolan Rosa Yolanda Pineda from Connect, and we also have Mariela Ali and, of course, my cali, which I deeply appreciate and love very much Chris John. Thank you so much for being here. If I forget any name, just forgive me, but from time to time, I'm going to be watching. Who is there? Oh also, we have Julio Batista Julio. Thank you. So very much julio is from the previous tyrian hospital in Community Relation Julio. Thank you so much so. Thank you all. So, let's proceed Ariel with our agenda. Did you want to take the first question, or did you want me to perhaps start well? Actually you know I definitely would like to picked on that. Yes, why not? Yes! Thank you for being so kind. So yes, so this the following question is for the panels and I wanted to also tell them that on each of this question you may have at least two or three minutes to answer. You may not necessarily have to answer all the questions that I'm going to be asking on behalf of my committee, but you know feel free to whether answer the question or not answer the question, but you know it's up to you. So here goes with the first question. My first question is: if it's possible, can you describe the existing crisis in our community district? You know this is the school district, six that have negatively impacted our homeless population. If you just raise your hand what it wants to do, First Miss Martino go ahead. Please thank you. I think you have the mute button still on sorry. Okay, thank you for giving me background to what I'm going to say, but I'm specifically talking about Washington Heights and in what community? In our community there are approximately 200,000 residents in the Washington Heights and inward prior to the pandemic, 20 of our community lived in poverty. That's about 40,000 of people. This has significantly increased as a result of the pandemic and the loss of jobs for new immigrants and those that are undocumenting re-entering the workforce is not a possibility at this time or in the near future. 53 of our community was rent burden before the pandemic, so before the pandemic in 2019, they were rent burton. This has doubled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which is about exactly what Danielle had said. Daniel had said, 80 something percent, although there is a moratorium on eviction, parents and single adults are still required to pay rent and landlords can still give penalties for late payments. One of the biggest complaints heard on our community is how landlords are harassing families and refusing to renew their lease, as well as giving them eviction notices that are 90 percent of the time based on fraudulent claims. This impacts the most vulnerable community, the families who feared departs deportation and who already are rent burdened in many cases, landlords are also refusing to accept vouchers to assist family in attaining an apartment because of the lack of jobs. Food insecurity in this community is at an all-time high countries. Cbo's churches and other agencies claim that they have seen a large increase in the number of people online to receive food 75 of homeless children in the heights live in double up residencies. Given the money problems the families are experiencing from lack of work and the high cost of rents in Washington Heights have resorted to join other family members or move into a single unit with a small space. Not only has this increased the level of stress for families, but it has led to an increase in domestic violence, coronavirus infections, transmissions and the death of many families. Members and our schools see children who are all talking about someone in their family who has died or a close friend. Families are also experiencing a high level of stress and trauma from coronavis deaths, fear of being homeless food insecurity and has caused them great depression. Their children are responding by not sleeping changing their eating habits, feeling anxious and hyper crying feeling depressed, showing a lot of negative behavior, and these students fail to complete schoolwork and lack engagement in the learning process. As a result of the pandemic, many of our families chose remote learning because they were fearful that the schools were unsafe. They heard everything about the ventilation issues and about not getting enough support and they decided to go remote. This has created many additional burdens on our families, with the lack of internet connectivity and ipads that need continuous repairs. It has also created another challenge for families struggling to help their children at home with areas of language and tech skills. As a result, students are lagging further behind academically. This is evident for children living in double up, residencies and temporary housing and shelters, who are second language learners or have special needs and live in environments not conducive to privacy, low noise level and support, and what parents of the high school students and middle school students are saying is that they are having a problem controlling the teenagers. These young adults are motivated to participate in school. This is especially true for second language learners and new immigrants that are negatively impacted by the isolation that the pandemic has caused. They are depressed, withdrawn and refused to attend. School absenteeism is much higher level at this time in our middle schools and high schools. All over the city, the largest homeless group that is growing at a rapid rate, is young single adults. They are the least likely to regain their jobs and the most vulnerable for homelessness. They are in our communities struggling to survive in this pandemic, so we have a large population of these children. Our low-income renters, who lost their jobs, are also on the verge of homelessness. Our new immigrant or undocumented population that did not receive unemployment, insurance or benefits from the Cares Act are also at high risk of being homeless. Families that resorted to double up as a result of the pandemic are now counted among the homeless, and that does not mean that schools know who they are, because identification of these children has become very difficult in a system that is a little chaotic, given the situation in which they had to do the hybrid learning when the moratorium ends, there will be, as many of you pointed out, a major crisis of homelessness in our city in our community. We need to be prepared for what is coming and we need to shout out as to what some of those issues are and although I am mainly concentrating on what the community has stated to me, our teachers, our parents and our even our children. It says this is very much part of the entire city where brown and black people are living. Thank you. Vodka. Thank you. So much for speaking to these issues, so I also want to ask because I realize this is a particular group that I think just you know, although they make up such specific portion of the population of our youth that are homeless, it often does not get I. Think I think the attention that sometimes is really needed on such not just the city-wide level, but also the national level, and it's in reference to those youth that are specifically dealing or rather you know, I, would say, having to find their identities throughout such an important period of their life and specifically for those that are lgbtq plus, are going to have specific concerns that are going to rise throughout their developing years. One of the things that has been brought up within our committee, our community board- it's been raised as one of the concerns specifically for individuals that want to enter shelter is really. Where is there a barrier for you to seek out shelter? I, have you know wanted to make sure that people understood what those are, but I also want to ask you all individually what you think those barriers are to lgbtq youth entering and accessing shelters at this time, all right, Miss Martino, thank you. So much I would say very elaborate. Should we go ahead and go next? Yeah I was asking the question to the panelists. I'm sorry, I did not hear it. Lgtb kids on the issue is the feeling of safety and also the fear of being in an environment that sometimes when they are in that environment they're, not sure whether they're going to be safe, based on their own experiences, living at home or living with relatives or living with friends. So the shelter experience is traumatic for everyone and the worst of it is that not only when, when I first became a principal children in shelters were there for maybe six months to a year. That's not the case anymore. I get some children in shelters, go in and out of shelters for about two to three and sometimes five times so you're. Looking at you know, continuous lgbt children also have our young adults or even always, also have difficulties finding apartments or finding places in which they can live. I said there is discrimination, great discrimination, and you have to think of the culture of the community, which is 75 percent or 80 percent hispanic and all cultural issues that deal with the discrimination of these poor students. It is going to take a lot I feel that at least at this time, more people are willing to talk about it. I think there are more organizations with them and that's what they need. They need a lot of support because they are also one of the highest rates of suicides among this type, this community. So we need to protect these students. Perhaps now in the future, there will be more monies in that area to support them, but I would think that would be I mean it's my own personal opinion, but based on what I know, I think that would be one of the reasons why Shelter is not something that they would look forward to. I can chime in also and just add, to blanca what you're saying because I think you've raised some really important points, especially with regards to the safety issue. I think also something that our team has really come to realize with the young people that we've been working with is that if I could speak a little bit frankly, there are not that many options that are out there. You know there is just limited housing that is more for the general population of youth, or you know we have found that a lot of the options that are available come with very certain. You know specific requirements such as you know. You need some kind of severe mental health, illness, disorder or disability at ultimately disqualifies many of our youth, and so it's it has been an interesting system to navigate, and so, if we're talking about barriers, I do think that is just one of the things that we are often confronting, at least for the young people that do come to the hub and are looking for that resource. The other thing that I did also want to mention and hearkening back again to blanca your earlier point of overcrowded apartments, because that is that really has been a huge issue that we have seen where our young people are stuck at home, with tons of family members living in very small one, maybe two bedroom apartments, and that has been a really big barrier as far as mental health access. You know a lot of the mental health treatment has been able to convert to the virtual telephone thing, but obviously, if you are in a very crowded environment with that lack of privacy, it's very hard to have that confidential conversation, and so the adherence to the treatment plan or to coming to those appointments has been rather difficult. So I just wanted to highlight and sort of amplify. That challenge is definitely something that we're seeing on the ground. All right, I mean I'll. Just add that in a I do not know I always try to say like here are the things as they are legally like legally exist, which is not reality. I mean I. Think if there's anything we all have seen in the past. You know when you, when you like see what happened with Brianna Taylor, for example. The law can not fix everything, because the law is still based on. If I'm going to get super political, like the systems of white supremacy that have existed in this country since its founding so like there are things the law can't fix, or there are things that are morally need to be addressed or like that as humans. We need to address that the law kind of can't solve or can't solve all the time so I legally. There should not be a barrier. The thing about the right to shelter for a single person in New, York, City, no matter how you identify whether you're gender non-conforming, you identify as a gender. What have you can go into an intake center and they are required to take you at DHS and also I can and Randy may speak to this too. But there are vacancies in the runaway homeless use system. So during the pandemic, once you kind of got over that, like initial hump, when there was maybe some period of time where, for safety purposes, some of the youth shelters, you know had to restrict some beds due to some spacing related to Covid-19 like you should be able to get into a bed in either of those systems and in DHS there is also Marsha's house, which is a shelter that is focused and set aside just for people who identify as LGBTQIA Tgnc, and you know under the age of 30. So it's like a very specific youth shelter for that now, I will say. All of this, which is blanca, is exactly right and Sharon's, exactly right, which is people's individual experiences and how they, how and where they feel safe means that all of those options may not work for them because of what their individual needs are, which is why having a lot of options is incredibly important, so in a I just want to say legally, there should not be a barrier. We work and help people every single day to try to figure out. If there's a way, we can make them feel safe enough, you know get supports in place that make them feel safe enough, but I would never be one to say that the shelter system feels safe for everyone. It feels safe for on some level. Sometimes I think for a lot of people does not feel safe at all, depending on their circumstances, and so I do not want to sugarcoat it. But you know at legal aid we have a hotline, we take, we literally talk to people every single day and help them get access to where they feel safe. So in theory, there should not be a barrier, even though there definitely are barriers. We should not, and I would like to add to what Beth is saying in regards to services. One of the things that the uicd has done over the years is definitely tried to provide the necessary education and sensitivity to those providing services to the Lgbtq plus Population, and we've done that to the point where we have you know, all of our beds are available to the lgbtq plus we have some providers that specialize in working with the Lgbtq community and such as the Ali Forney Center, you know, is one of our biggest ones in terms of making sure that we understand the resources, understand the language, the sensitivity around providing services. So that's something that we do on a yearly basis. We're probably the only agency that has beds specifically for transgender youth, which is something that you know came to be because that's what the providers talked about needing and when we put out requests for proposals, that's what they submitted in terms of their proposal. So we look definitely to make sure that our lgbtq population community is receiving the services that they deserve about. 40 percent I would say anyway, from like 35 to 40 percent of the youth in programming identify as Lgbtq plus. So it makes important for us to have the necessary results available to them so that they can have that, so they can go to any one of our drop-ins again. We have five drop-ins one in each road. That's 24 hours, seven days a week. So if someone is in need of any service at any given time, they can go to that respective drop-in to receive that service, as well as a referral. The residential programs that we have are not big like DHS, a lot of you know of the think of warehousing when you think of DHS for our programs, we have six bed programs, 10, bed programs and the biggest that we have is 20 outside of Covid-19 house, which was one of our largest ones. That many know from being around for many years. So we try to make it an intimate setting that our contractors have with their residential sites so that people can be close to each other feel they can feel the trust between themselves and the youth there, as well as themselves and the staff and make sure that they're receiving your services. So those are some of the things that we have available for our lgbtq plus community, all right danny you wanted to Daniel. You want to say anything sure you know, since we run so many DHS shelters, our best shelters are the smaller shelters clearly when we opened up help autobahn last year. Actually, exactly a year ago, this month we fought with the city to lessen the amount of beds, and then the city always wants to maximize the number of beds for a particular facility to maximize capacity. We were able to get them down from 200 to 174, which was helpful, but it was not a game. Changer for us what's been a game changer has been, has been, unfortunately, the pandemic and moving about half of our clients to hotels. We have. We have about 90 of our clients at audubon, at one of the upper West side, hotels and they're, doing really well no cases of code, but no positive cases both in Audubon and at the hotels. In the last four months, women are working, they're, feeling safe and secure they're in hotel rooms at Autobahn. I'm there frequently I was there last week, it's a shelter for 174. You know nominally for 174 people, but with about 95 clients there it actually feels freer and more open. We have a beautiful rooftop roof deck garden. It's very nice, but I. Think. The larger point is that when city needs to cite shelters because of the right to shelter, they're only looking at capacity and they're trying to push as many beds into a tight space as what otda the state regulations allow and what the finance actually work for, which I have as a social worker I just have a deep problem with that. Like I said our all our shelters are the most comfortable I read the least amount of incidents. Clients reflect that they feel safe and secure there. But when we have sheltered when we have people in two 250 bed shelters, we often have more problems, as you can imagine, as if you're living in a huge dorm style, shelter and all of that so really I. Think I'm hoping the pandemic will open this Dhs's eyes towards not just a capacity issue. It's about wellness, it's about beds, not being three feet apart, but being six feet apart. It's about not having congregate style, where you have 30 beds or 20 beds in a room where it needs to be. If it's an old, SRO converted, it should be one bed, maybe two to that room and not 304 like it is now, and that's an ongoing issue that the city and the next administration really needs to address. We had homeless services, united, a trade group put forth the paper to DHS, to say this needs to realign in a new normative way, and we need to stop thinking about just capacity. We need to think about wellness when you think about what it's like for the client and we need to help them feel good about not good but feel less bad about being in shelter, so that so we're moving them more quickly toward the exit door and obviously in a beneficial way. Thank you, Daniel. Well, I see that the clock is cooking, so I wanted to move to our next question, because I think the A1S question is also very important. So the next question is: how is your organization or your agency at Sarada, you know, working to resolve and support our harmless population? I think that goes pretty well with you as well than it. You know if anybody want to jump in immediately, should I repeat the question again: no, it's I'll go ahead. I'll start us off all right, just I want to just start by saying- and you have you know: edda is a housing attorney at legal aid, and so you have an expert in your midst all the time, which is wonderful. But if going to something that blanca said earlier, which I think is really important. If you are not sure what is happening to you in regards to your apartment, you should call 311 immediately and you will have access to legal advice, whether it's a piece of paper posted on a wall- that's not even directed towards you that you feel like is harassment or intimidation, whether it's something that looks like the landlord's trying to kick you out it's. There is a legal process that has to exist for you to be evicted, and you may have a case based upon the harassment you're getting. You may have a defense based upon what the landlord is doing, which is illegal based upon frankly, what is a very confusing set of orders and moratoriums from the federal and state level and everything. So the easiest thing to do, because everybody's details are so different, is please call 311 and you will get to speak to someone who will be able to at least give you a sense of what is going on and what your options are, particularly in the next handful of months, as this becomes even more confusing, because evictions have started upstate evictions are happening, people are going to court in New, York City, so the you know, when you hear the moratorium, it sounds like nothing can happen. There are some things that can happen, but again, it's very fact, specific, literally based upon certain dates that things may have happened. So please call 311. If you remember nothing else that I have I said I want to I mean legal aid is enormous, where you know we're. I do not even know how many attorneys we are now over, probably over 1400 attorneys, it's the largest nonprofit law firm in the country. We work on any kind of legal issue with the exception of helping people plan for wills, and we generally do not sue for individual damages on short cases so like if you get injured by something in New, York City we're, probably not going to be able to represent you on that case, but almost anything else we probably would be able to so. If you're ever not sure where to go, you can always call the legal aid main number and the staff there is trained to help you find what you need and that during the pandemic we have a whole Covid-19 page where toxin is updated every day, with updates about different things that are happening related to employment law, and you know, are you able to get certain kinds of benefits? There's an access to benefits hotline you can call that's available to you know. People call our homeless rights hotline if I had a way to like drop that in a chat, I probably would but the link. But you can go there to find out information. I just want to put one more thing out there, which is that in particular right now we're really trying to make sure that any person who is having trouble accessing the internet and, unfortunately, for me and my job, it's related to whether you are in a city, run shelter, so that can be HRA DHS. To be honest with UA. I'm not just saying this, because Randy's here I have not heard about an issue in a DYCD shelter, but if there is one and then HPD you know you can please contact us, because we would really like to make sure young people in shelter are not missing school, whether you're, 23 and you're. Just finishing you know high school, whether your child is. You know six like whatever the age, so please reach out to us and a has my contact information if, for some reason you I can't drop it in the question and answer here right kim you wanted to you know. Chip in you want to say something. Thank you, Ben I think you were talking about me, Sharon yeah, yes, so, yes, I can definitely chime in you know, I mentioned earlier that for our team and working directly with our youth and being a youth development program, I think very specifically with the housing. We continue to work with our team of psychologists and our youth advocates so that they can develop different and appropriate treatment plans and brainstorm the different resource needs, and so there have certainly been referrals that have been made out to different external agencies, some of which have been mentioned here, but also you know, Bailey House Housing connect the door and so that there are certainly options that are out there, and so our team has gotten quite adept at figuring out and helping our young people navigate. That, but beyond you know, I would say some of the more immediate, I, guess or obvious resource needs. We definitely approach our work with our youth from more of a prevention lens, and so, as I had mentioned before, having things like academic support, but also employment, readiness activities, which does include paid opportunities. We really hope to cultivate and support a whole. You know next generation of young people that can hopefully feel empowered and equipped to enter the workforce or enter adulthood and eventually be participating. Members of society avoid financial instability that could then you know, lead to homelessness. So we really do approach the issue from more of that prevention. Lens I would say that we have a strong belief in our young people and their ability to rise up and break through these systems and really establish for themselves and even their loved ones, safe homes, for you know for their futures. So that would be my two cents here. Thank you. Miss Kim! Yes, thank you. If you do not yeah I can add in one of the things that we are looking to do more of, and we've been doing it for probably the last year two years is work with our youth action board. That's a group of youth who have been homeless or are currently homeless, working on different issues that affect them on a daily basis, so we've been bringing them more to the table because we want to hear from them and help you know in terms of building services around what their true needs are. So that's something that we definitely have done. More of you know over the last two years, especially around our youth count where they've provided some key guidance and information on how to do it better. So that's one of the things and I also just put that in a in the Q&A in terms of ways that people can volunteer is to participate in a youth count which is us basically identifying a week after the city. Dhs does their whole count of counting adults, homeless, adults. We count homeless, youth and we do a survey of people of youth who you know in their whereabouts on a specific date. We do it for a full week, so you know we always need people who can volunteer to assist in that. So that's something that we can do. We also you know in supporting our homeless population. This you know for this administration. You know mayor, De, Blasio has put in a great investment for homeless services. You know, since he's come become our mayor. You know the budget for runway and homeless youth services has increased, drastically. I always tell people this when I first started at DYC 10 years ago, my budget was 5 million, and now my budget is about 52 million, and that includes from improving from 153 beds to 813 today having 24-hour drop-in centers, where youth can go at any time. You know if they should have an issue or just to get off the street where they do not have to ride the trains or you know sleep in a 24-hour business, or you know things like that and receive services. So these are some of the investments that we've had. We've also worked with. You know, like I, said thrive to bring services to our programs where they can work around the mental health issues. We also work with the unity project which focuses on lgbtq issues, so we're looking to make sure that we have all of those supports available to youth at any given time in order to address their matters, you know and help them you know with what they need. So these are some of the things and I know I. Look forward. I put my email address in the Q&A, so if people have issues and want to know about things in your respective community feel free to call me feel free to email me and I'll share. You share with you that information as well as if presentations need to happen in your community, because people are not aware that DYCD has a runaway homeless youth division. We can make that known. I know everybody hears about Syep or our you know: cornerstone development or our beacons, but runaway and homeless. Youth is a big thing at DYCD and I want people to be aware of that. So please connect with me so that you can hear about the services and the support so that we can make sure that everyone receives them when they need it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you who is next danny Daniel, and maybe you want to go and share. You know a few thoughts with us. You know the panelists really gave a great synopsis. I really do not have much to add I mean as a service provider like to say we're always concerned with our level of service delivery. I mean we've tried to be creative. We have creative arts programming in our homeless shelters. It's unusual especially the front door, shelter for women that we have the two in New York City, one in the Bronx one in Brooklyn. We hold panels or we did anyway up until the pandemic. With some regularity, we do connect with community partners. I do see in the Q&A there's questions about volunteer opportunities, normally at our audubon site in Washington, Heights I would say absolutely, but we have an organizational-wide kind of moratorium on in-person volunteer opportunities, probably through this spring. Just given the rise in the cases and all of that yeah always looking to consider what we're doing our business a little bit better. You know as a service provider, our you know, I, when I do walk throughs at our sites and still do I've always been continuing to go throughout the pandemic. You know some clients would say to me, you know without us, you'd be out of business, and my first response is absolutely you're. You are a customer and while not every client in our in our shelters, you know we'll rave about the kind of services we provide. We do take hard, looks at the kind of services that we do provide and can provide, and we're often in dog fights with the city, to make sure that our budgets are not gutted to make sure that programming that we can, that we consider essential is not gutted and we're really concerned. As we move forward into this next phase of budget cuts, we offered the city almost demanded that we cut over five million dollars from a number of our sites. We negotiate that down to about 4 million, but we're really worried we're worried that these recreational therapeutic activities that we have at our sites, which includes creative art, therapists, social workers, counselors things that we folks we never had clinical services. We never had before really up until five years ago, up until the De Blasio administration, we're afraid that they're coming after us, the city's saying that we're in such dire straits, we have to cut these kind of programs and we'll fight tooth and nail and consider suing the city to allow us to retain this level of robust programming. You know so we're really concerned, as in the next six months. I mean this is unheard of if I can say that in the middle of the fiscal year we're almost in the middle of it. The city comes to us and says we want you to cut over five million dollars in services, and we go back and as good faith that we say we found four million. It's not going to harm our clients, whether security, food or services, but we're afraid the city's going to come back to us in three months and say you need to cut another four million I think we're going to raise holy hell because we're not we're just not we're not going to do it. We can't do it so we're really concerned about holding that line right now and worried about the financial situation of the city and the federal government's you know. Failure to pass any next cares act as it were, I'm concerned about that, so not to put a damper on the kind of micro conversation. That's going on all the good work, but we're very concerned over the next three to six months. Go ahead! Yes, briefly, because the time is open now go ahead. You have a comment: please subscribe. There's kind of this idea now flowing that maybe we might actually get some further funding coming from the federal government within the next few months. Given this is all potential. This is all thought right now, but, given that you know regardless we're still expecting an uptick in cases we're still expecting the concerns of people still perhaps becoming homeless. What would you say that your organizations will need to focus on within the next few months? You know irregardless of funding, let's just say in the best situation, you're going to be getting that funding. What is what is your organization going to be focused on for the next few months to deal with the upcoming I guess greater crisis than we already have well, okay, I can go first well with DYCD. One of the things that we're definitely doing right now is we're working with our sister agencies, around testing and tracing. We want to make sure that the youth know their status, whether they have the virus or not need to get the necessary medical care. So that's one of the things that we're focused on primarily right now. Second, is we are going to continue to work around those five key indicators? We have not stopped. The services have not stopped by our contractors due to the virus. You know they've been working very hard to make sure that they continue to provide services to you so they're going to continue to focus on the educational piece, making sure that they are attending schools virtually and getting that necessary degree or I need to say something before I turned it to him, saying something: oh, okay, so getting that necessary degree, employment continuing to do those jobs that are available for folks to do, whether it's virtually or in person if things are allowable, you know in dealing with mental health and so on, and so on. So we're going to continue to do those things you know up until it can't be done anymore, and the good thing is that the funding that we currently have is baseline. So it's it's hopefully going to stay and won't be taken away. Okay, where are we so far? So Randy already spoke, Miss Martino? Yes, one going to be talking basically about what schools are doing, to help and support the homeless or the future homeless students. One of the things as Beth had mentioned before is you know the Mckinney Dental Law, which says that all students who have come to the school who are homeless must be registered and must have the same services and participate in the same academic activities as all the students within this field. What is happening now, though, is that identifying these students has become very difficult in the schools. As you hear in the newspapers and other media, the schools are a little on the reorganizational type of mode. So I am fearful that some of our children who are homeless will be going under the wire. We have 21,000 district 6 school students who are supposed to be provided with ipads, and that includes our homeless students and I do not attending the district six schools. However, there has been a continuous problem with connectivity. There have been several plans to support the homeless children, but it has still to be really fixed. This is a continuous problem. In fact, I read today that they're thinking about putting buses in front of shelters to provide them with connectivity. The sad part of all of this is that we begin to realize how deficient our schools are and our shelters are in terms of being built to provide for the next the future generations. So this has been a major problem for parents. The ipads are also not in many cases. Good ipads I do not know what the problem is, but they're always breaking down, and this is a major problem for parents, both in shelters as well, temporary housing and parents throughout the community. It is a big problem, because getting them repaired sometimes means that they have to give up their ipad and that they wait three months for the ipad to be repaired before they can get another. One. Schools have been trying to support these by giving them laptops that they had maybe in their tech room I said, but the demand is great, so this is a help, but not completely. When we look at the New York City Takeout meals for students doing remote, it is offered almost in every school. In the district for breakfast and lunch, however, what is happening? It is. Yes, they are giving meals to the kids, but parents in our community are complaining that some of the lunch meals are not edible, they're, not frozen. In fact, one of the parents showed me a picture of the lunch and the it was supposed to be a cheese sandwich that was frozen and the cheese did not even look real. She could not even melt it to make it a grilled cheese sandwich. So, even though this is being provided- and we know that it is helpful, but it is not. We can't have kids in school, especially kids, who are homeless without food, given that there is such a food insecurity within our communities. So this is something that I guess is helpful, but not incomplete, and our the adult meals that were offered in the summer are offered on from three to five in three schools: junior high school 52, P.S, 36 and Ps48 I do not know many of the parents that were not even aware of this. Maybe the communication, although it's virtual for parents, has to be provided in other ways, so that parents understand that this is something so the school. The city is trying to provide some support, but unfortunately it's not getting out there. Schools are also trying to give to our homeless children, our children, most in supplies and packets, for them to continue to work academically safety guidelines for the student and staff are followed and mandated within the school so that the kids are safe, and this is a part of what they're trying to do for children. However, one of the problems that we're having is that many of the children and families are saying that the kids feel so isolated from these spaces and they only eat in their classrooms. They do not go to the gym. They stay put almost like a prisoner until it's time to leave and I understand it's part of safety, but it's also impeding a child's natural development to interact and to have physical activity in some way so they're trying to resolve this and work out some solution, but I wanted it known and I agree with money has been always the resource that has condemned our systems to give mediocre or at best the support that our families need, and one of the issues that I do want to bring up is the issue of affordable housing, which they predict that by 2022 about 4462 units apartments will be gone. We are in the midst in our community of gentrification, and we are. We have to be able to afford to provide if we're going to not eradicate, but at least decrease the homelessness in our community by providing some type of affordable housing for our children. That is I think the ultimate goal of what the city should be doing, as well as I mean I, believe there is a legislation or law, maybe Beth. You know that says that for now for every 40 houses of 40 apartments 15 has to go for people with less rent capability, so we'll see if that comes to be, but I think that is also one of the areas that we need to push and get some funds for and just to confirm. That's local law, 19 of 2019. oh I, see I, remembered I, see you do not need lawyers, we're not that people I'll just add I mean look, we're we've been transparent about it. We're going to file a lawsuit against the city of New York, to sue about the fact that kids in shelter do not have access to school because they do not have ipads that work. So that's going to happen. Hopefully very soon it's been in the works as soon as it became obvious that they did not have a plan. The city did not have a plan to fix it. So I, you know that's a way that I think. As a lawyer. We try to help to just get them forced to do something. I think there's the short-term help and long-term help with a lot of these issues. I read that article today about the buses too and was kind of like okay like if it does help in the short term. Okay, but I do not think any of us. Imagine that, like school buses, parked outside of shelters is like the way to actually deal with this problem long term. So we'll you know, keep working on that, but yeah, but we'll keep we'll keep I now say legal aid where we've been suing about things like we have not talked about stuff like public charge, or you know how our immigrant, neighbors and brothers and sisters have just been at the you know, attacked from all sides, particularly from the federal government and policies, and we will continue to fight to get people out of Rikers so that they do not catch Covid-19 I mean we're doing trying to do a lot of things as an agency, and a lot of that has involved a lot of lawsuits lately. We do not like to always go there because I think it's more effective and quicker to often be able to work stuff out otherwise, but if you're asking what legal aid's doing, we will continue to be. You know suing folks a lot and coming as much as we can. You can't sue about everything you might want to so. I will just mention too, that the DOE does have a help desk in a form that, if people you know are having trouble with their device, what they're, having to do often is switch out. The sim cards in the ipad, which we'll move them from a t-mobile cellular service to verizon, which for some people in New York, is making a big difference for access, but some shelters, it's not working so again, I'm not sure how I can put it in the chat. If there's not a question related to it, but I have the link and the number I can share. It's. I'm sure also I know that help and other shelters are sharing this information with their with people who live there. So you know please. If there's no one should have to be waiting for three months, like that's, not okay and again, if people want direct help like we are helping people with this every day advocates for children is helping out with this every day, and if people are in shelter, the shelter staff has been helping at most shelters that we've been working with so I'll just throw that out there and I guess. The last thing I will say in terms of homelessness is by definition. Homelessness is, if you do not have a place to call home and so going to Blanca's point and other points that were made. You know finding having enough affordable, permanent housing for new yorkers who live here and want to stay here is the number one thing that everyone should be pushing and particularly pushing the new mayor and the New City council. You know a lot of people are running for a lot of positions in the next year citywide and it's going to be really important to have people in there who understand and can support the efforts to make sure that this is a city where people can live and survive and exist. Without being you know, a millionaire. So the number one thing I would push well, thank you so much and I so I I'm going to try and draw this out quickly now with the questions, but I wanna give time for faye. If you have one last question and also sally I, know, you've been holding your hand up there. Fay do you have a question if not I'll go yes. Actually, one very last question that I have and before I pose a question. I just wanted to tell the folks that I'm waiting, we have I, do not know the amount of questions, but we have quite a few questions, including from Senator, Robert, Jackson, Office and Coach, Dave and other folks, and also I have another question directly for Daniel. So, but let me post my question first so then I will at least share that very loud I want to. Let then, folks that you know we will get back to you. So here is my question. I would like to basically to encourage all of you know, of course, our panels, so if they can voice the recommendation for strategies that can best support and improve our homelessness population in the areas of Housing, mental health, education and new programs, etc, any recommendation that you may have it would be definitely highly appreciated. In particular, you know this will be picked up for our cbo's and other agencies in the community. That can help so by all means. Whoever wants to just go ahead and with that I conclude my question until you know next, thank you, Ariel for being so kind. Maybe daniel I do not know randy who wants to answer the who wants to go? First, should I repeat the question: should I repeat the questions? No I do not think so. I feel like most of us, maybe have answered it in other answers. So I think that's why we might be pausing. Just and if there's other people's questions, we just I think we're happy to answer those yeah. Definitely I know that there's been two people who has their hands raised, so I do not know. If they want to ask questions, I get I will I will give them the floor or the you know whatever it is. At this point, it's a sally, yeah I guess my big concern in blocking you've talked about a little bit, which is the whole identification. How do you identify, especially in the school system, I'm thinking the school right around the corner? For me, where you know the vast majority are remote students. You know teachers have an idea of who's, not showing up who is who seems to even when they show up who seems to be disconnected. But how do we reach out through our teachers, to identify those students most at need? Is there a way? Well, the one of the ways that they do is that they communicate personally through chats with parents, the ones who are doing in remote. The idea is to question to see about their living. You know they talk to the parents and they actually get information about what's happening. Sometimes parents are not willing to open up, and so that becomes difficult because to for them to be homeless. That would be something that they do not want to say for shelter, it's different because we get the information directly for when they go to shelters or whatever. But part of the problem also is that we do not have enough personnel in schools to really talk to parents and to create a bond so that parents are more willing to say what their situation is. We can't help schools can't help if they really do not know, and so teachers are trying to make great bonds with their with parents, but that is one of the one of the issues that has has really occurred on it with the identification of our of our homeless population. So it is, it is an issue, it has been an issue and it is still continues to be even a greater issue, given the fact that many of our families are now uniting in order to not have to pay such high rents, they can use all their monies together. So but that's a good question. I wish it was solvable. I was there, so many things I wish were soluble. I wish I was a lawyer. No I just worry about the double stigma. I mean first, you've got the homelessness and you've got the mental health, and this is the community where mental health is going to be stigmatized anyway. It's like there's nothing wrong with me and it's like you, do not understand what you might need, and so I mean again it's true. It's hard, it's very hard, so the most that we can do is support them at where they're at you know to be sensitive to the needs of the community. I, really appreciate all your help and I appreciate Ariel and faye convening this panel. I hope that it's the first of many. So this is a huge issue in our community absolutely and I'll quickly. I, I'm seeing aisha and I think Christina just raised her hand as well. I should be. Do you have a question? Aisha? Are you still there she's meeting I was muted. Thank you. My question is in relation to what is being done on the case management side, to have people who help parents and children navigate all of these different agencies and where there's overlap, to address some of the pitfalls that occur. I do a lot of advocacy in this area. I have to say that as a community board member at Times, I'm the former chair of housing and human services for the board at times when I have stepped in and made contact with some of the agencies, including legal aid. The response has been very receptive and helpful. I really do appreciate that and I encourage my board members to avail themselves of that opportunity to advocate for people in our district that are being impacted in that way. However, I do see that in many instances there are ways in which the way that the system functions is the obstacle that exists. It's not so much that the program as it exists bars people from accessing my services. I'm sorry, not it's not that the program as it exists, is a barrier, but that the function of the program when there are problems becomes the obstacle and those obstacles. I've seen put people in grave circumstances, even where they could have been prevented from becoming homeless. They end up being homeless. One instance that I can give for an example is where checks for to prevent eviction were sitting on a desk for three months that family was homeless for less than that, which means that the checks existed before they got evicted. That's just one example also within the domestic violence arena, where actions by the HRA office put the family in imminent danger, where the person that the family was living in fear from was given the information about where they were located so and I've had to have the comptroller's office step in to support what ended up happening in that situation. Is they also had a landlord that was waiting to give them an apartment using one of the vouchers? However, the glitch that happened that exposed their address also made it seem as if they had somewhere where they were living and what ended up happening is it they were not receiving the documentations, because it was going to the address that it should not have been going to and their case went into sanction status, and then they were unable to avail themselves of the opportunity with the landlord to use that voucher. So my question is what is being done about those types of circumstances that are putting people in risk, specifically people from our district, because when I'm telling these stories, I'm talking about people in our in our midst right that we as community board 12 members, are responsible to and also I would like to hear more about the specific data where our district is concerned. I know that at one point, I had gone to the new school had a an event in regards to segregation within the school system, which, at that point, I learned of the impacts of homelessness. In our specific schools, one of the schools in our district was highlighted, I passed that information on to move very quickly, and that is how we got the first event about school homelessness, so much credit to faye. For that great work, however, my understanding from a New York Times article is that now we are at where it was 82,000 pupils in New, York City we're at a hundred thousand. What portion of that is CB12 students, what our students are not only going to school within our district they're, going to schools outside of our district, some of which I learned had as much as 50 percent of students that were homeless and that's something that impacts not only the homeless students, but it impacts the students who are not homeless because of those damn dynamics that come into play. This is something that I find very disheartening. What can we do to address the whole situation that many of these people are experiencing many times the dynamics within all the different agencies that they have to work with, become very difficult to navigate when they're all working in silos? What can we do to create systems where the whole situation is being addressed and we take some of this burden off of these families? Thank you. Do the any of the panels have a quick response or I think the siloing is a problem. We actually all talk about a lot and I think someone mentioned actually on the chat. We have not really talked about this either, but always centering. You know the voices and experiences of people who are going through the actual issues is so important, as opposed to always, you know, coming to kind of other experts and I think what you how you just describe. That is why that's so important and frankly why community boards are incredibly important in New York City for getting people help that they need, because it could kind of help break down those artificial barriers that continue to exist, because I agree with you that that's a huge problem, I do not know that I have a good solution for that other than like anything else like good organizing around making like enough voices raising up in unison about an issue. Often is the thing that gets something changed: I mean mayor, De Blasio is obviously very sensitive to what's in the media, so like if it's loud enough that it gets in the media and he hears about it. Sometimes that's enough to get things shifted, but the silo issue is one that I think is going to take someone who's, an incredibly good manager in the like the a good manager in the mayor's seat, to really be able to like break that down, because that's just like I mean I. You know I'm not going to ask Randy to reflect on this because he's like in it, but I think people inside are trying to like break those walls down where they exist, and it's just really hard to do. I think even basic things like computer systems do not talk to each other. You know it's hard to like share data and information, which is we know super important nowadays, so but I think there's a I think there's like a surprisingly large number of people, even in government who would agree with you. That needs to be shifted and maybe there's a way to unite all of us and making that happen and I do not think it's a secret I think it. That definitely is the goal, especially I can speak for DYCD. That has been our goal since Commissioner Chung has come on board is to break down Silos, not only external but internal. You know the prior administrations. Everybody worked in Silos, so this is probably the first time that we're trying to communicate with people, and sometimes it's sometimes easy. Sometimes it's not easy, because you have so many different. You know funding streams, and you know people who you have to respond to that. You have to try to be careful as well as not to break any confidence in terms of information of the young people that you're serving you do not want to make sure you want to make sure that information is not just sent to everybody. So those are definitely things that you know we at DYCD have worked with that's. Why we're doing more work with our sister agencies and we've created many different mous memorandums of understanding so that we can make sure that we share that data amongst each other so that it does not make it difficult for a youth who's receiving services with us to go somewhere else and have to start from scratch in terms of giving all of that information where the systems were talking, it would make it more expeditious for them to receive services as well as sometimes when they're within our system, not having to go into another system to get a benefit or a resource. So trying to you know, order those things so that it can it work. But it's a work in progress. Trust me. It's definitely something that we were working on and pandemic slowed things up, but you know it's. You know we'll see what the next administration brings, but I think if the staff that are in the work now we'll continue the great stuff that they've trying to do and not stop it. So I definitely hear you I wish Iris was here, because maybe she could provide you with some of the information with respect to numbers. She was a DOE panelists, but maybe we can get that your questions about certain data or certain information numbers to her, and maybe she can respond to you later perfect. Thank you and I'll give Christina the virtual floor again. Thank you guys. I'll make this as quick as possible. Actually, my first question: I have two different questions. My first one is in reference to data I wanted to know what are the top three ways that the youth are finding out about your programs. That's my number one question and number two is mental health can be a taboo in many communities, so I'm just curious to know what are your organizations doing to demystify this topic to engage the youth? Thank you I'm in here. Thank you for those questions Christina. So, as far as for us- and actually it's a little bit also answering Aisha's question, because I was really thinking about what you were saying and I'm so glad that you talked about the youth voice because I think for us it really has been a lot of creating the space and the environment where the young people have the power to express themselves right and to feel that they can come to to a place where they're, supported and also exposed to what are the issues of concern and in providing that space. A lot of times now that we've experienced is that they are telling their friends about us so they're bringing their friends to our programs. You know since Covid-19 hit. We did turn everything virtual and, as many I think, youth Cbo's and youth services have experienced getting that engagement up, for you know on the virtual platforms can be a little tricky, but I also do think that there is some beauty in the fact that this is a generation that is quite tech. Savvy are living on their phones quite a bit and I think. This has been a very interesting opportunity that we've been trying to take advantage of making a space that is for them made by them led by them and so in a lot of ways yeah. That has been one of the key reasons why they'll even come and check this out. The other piece of that, though, is you, know, actual tangible opportunities, and so we had the we had the fortune this past summer, for instance, to launch a paid summer. Internship program, you know, I, think there were a lot of different pockets of opportunities that were sprouting up. But for us you know that really was another way in which we honestly looked at the these issues. From again that prevention perspective, of empowering our young people to be a bit more aspirational. To really think that you know their lot in life is not their lot in life that there is more that they can really be trying to pursue, and you know with the supports of mentors adults and also peers and to be able to let them live out that potential that they have, and so I would say that you know in that I think raising up really this next generation of movement makers. You know I think it was said earlier also how critical on the political landscape it will be to advocate for different policies and really demand change to happen with upcoming administrations. I really do believe that it's the voices of our young people that are going to come out loud and proud, but I also do recognize that for a lot of our young people, they do not even know where to begin, or they do not even realize this is an issue that truly affects them, and so that's those are the types of spaces that we've been trying to create, at least with our team. Thank you so much Aaron, you know I'll just say, I'm sure, I'm still looking to figure out where to begin. But, yes thank you so much sharon I realize I have already pushed this panel. Ten minutes past nine I have been asked to just give one person more a question olga. Are you there I do need to Mr Miranda I do need to sign off now, though, sorry about that. But thank you everyone. Yes, thank you. Thank you. All right take care everybody. Thank you. Daniel Organo Habla is so she was just mentioning that she has been looking to essentially get into housing for herself and her child. She received a city, feb's, voucher, I, believe she mentioned it was a roughly around 1300. You know part of the issues with the vouchers is that oftentimes they do not necessarily provide enough funding for getting an apartment that 1300, especially if it's perhaps for a two bedroom. It might not necessarily be enough. The landlords have. You know also been specifically mentioning that. Well, I'm trying to translate everything, I'm remembering everything. She was also mentioned that the landlord did not want to accept the voucher. Typically, you know that's a common case, and so she was asking, if perhaps I would assume. Maybe this might be Las, but please inform me better hear from the panelists who might be able to assist with this sort of situation and, if I made. The typical case here is in which the city is telling this family of this. You know single mother with a child. You already heard that he's. Basically, you know highly depressed in which she applied to be in a shelter because the court has not actually have not yet approved the the foster application that she that she already. You know it's already. You know in court because of the coffee, so she went to she. The shelter did not allow her to stay. Instead, they referred her to an agency. The agency gave her a voucher, the voucher, it's about 1300, I. Think and the agency expects that, for that amount she will be able to get two bedroom apartment for 1300, which, realistically speaking, she has been able to wait to find several apartments, but no landlord. It's having a prime two bedroom apartment for thirteen hundred dollars, not even a studio. So allow me please so then and theory the city. It say you know we help you, but it's up to you to find the apartment. Now. The thing is that she's willing to do a co-payment, but then the agency do not allow does not allow her to do the co-paving. Neither the landlord would allow her to do co-payment. So in between you see the situation here. Yeah theory I can't answer the question and you're not going to like the answer. So I'm just going to preface that up front. Okay and I will also say, like I, can't be giving like individuals legal advice, particularly in a public setting, there's like zero confidentiality. This is a recorded public session. It's probably best to not have individual cases brought up here, but I can speak generally to these issues, which is that, first of all, unfortunately, the way that the regulations work. You can not have anyone in foster care, also in shelter, so you can't be in shelter and a foster parent. At the same time, officially, through the foster care system, that's exists has existed as the problem for a long time and we've been working on it and it has not been resolved in a way. So that's kind of issue number one, because it means that shelter is not an available option. Now, some religious shelters may be an option I'll just throw that out there I do not know you know, there's not an eligibility process, and there are not as many for families, but if you can find someone who's able to help have the family for a period of time. That might be helpful, but with a city feb's voucher, there are set amounts and you can not pay the difference if the voucher does not cover the amount. That's it's a rule again. A lot of us do not like a lot of us, argued against it when they were creating the city, Feb's vouchers, but that's not like just unique to this situation, which is why a lot of advocates are pushing to have the amount increased, because it's not enough and I know that part of what's complicating. This, too, is when you're a foster parent. The child has to have their own bedroom, which is why you need a two bedroom and you can't just get maybe perhaps a smaller place which I agree with Guillermo. Is you can't even find a studio? You know for that amount of money, let alone a two-bedroom. The best advocacy that I know has happened has been where you've people been able to convince a landlord, because, frankly, I think someone else knows the landlord and the communities come together to be like. Can you house this person because they're very close to the amount of money, and it would be you know the things like that have happened, but it's not a I mean there's, not a good answer to this question. You know like it's you to be a foster parent. You do have to live in an independent place and you do have to have both of those bedrooms. It is true now you can be a resource in other ways, but I having worked a period of time with young people in foster care like I know that does not that's like not actually getting to any kind of solution. So I'm sorry, I do not have a good kind of answer generally to give I believe that that this has been shared. This issue with, maybe even this particular person has been shared at legal aid and I- do not know. If there's a way we can reconnect kind of offline to see if there's anything else, but I that we can do. You know brainstorming-wise, because again, I'm not a housing attorney, but that's kind of the this is what I spend most of my day. Doing is giving bad news, unfortunately, about how systems are not working together to make stuff help. This is very, you know difficult if I might jump in really quick. One of the things that she said in Spanish was that she has spoken to landlords that tell her. They will not accept that program that is illegal and in that instance, what she could do is go to the commission on Human rights to report to them that there's discrimination happening where her voucher is concerned, and they may be able to help her open up doors that have been closed for her so, and this is actually basically the importance of us having translators actively translating in our meetings, because that's a very key aspect of the story that she told so apologies in Miami I'm trying to translate. But no it's not it's not your fault, but I just wanted to give light to that. You can repeat that in Spanish for her she's just speak, spanish, so I realize it is 9:20. I I want to thank the panelists so very much for staying with us. We can not say enough about how helpful it is to be learning from the experts to be learning from the individuals that are dealing with. So many of really the youth that are going to be dealing with a lot of the concerns that we've brought up to here tonight. You know again, we can not say thank you enough. I can just do. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, but it's definitely it's definitely more more meaningful than I think we can ever express. So thank you. I need to add it all, because this is not yes for the panel might be yes, basically just the end, but I believe we have also to give the opportunity to the community for any announcement, and you know, but let's then conclude with our panel and in my case as well I joined. You know your statement and on my behalf as well and as well. The rest of my colleagues I deeply wanted to. Thank you for your time for sharing. You know volunteer your time, basically because you do not get paid for this obviously, and I'm deeply appreciative and also I wanted just to say that I'm looking forward to continue this conversation as I already had expressed. You know myself on behalf of my committee, we're going to be writing. Some follow-up and I hope you'll be part of that small report that we're going to share with the community more to come. You know off this meeting so I deeply. Thank you, Beth Randy, Sharon, Miss Patino. Thank you. So very much, thank you all academy and for the rest of the counties good night. All right. Thank you! So much. Thank you good night. Everyone have a good night. You want to stay so we have some business. I do not know if the community may want it to have any announcements. So this is the opportunity to to come up with an announcement that you may have yeah, I'm hoping we did not lose our committee members. It was only for the panelists we were referring to, but so faye and I had been discussing, trying to find a resolution that we could bring together between both committees that are seeking to address many of the concerns that I mean I could only think was going to be brought up tonight. Of course, there are always you know, countless issues that I do not even think can could have been brought up within. You know a two-hour frame or two hour, 20 minutes feeling some time and so I put together a drafting of language that I thought might be aiding to really the concerns that we have heard about tonight, but also potentially put forward some new possible ideas that might address many of these issues, plus some others and if anything, I'd like to just share what the languages that I've put together. Of course, I want to make sure that everyone knows that this is not at all. The final language I want folks to be more than happy to be involved in editing and also adding more language. If possible. Okay, I'm just going to put the draft up on the screen doing screen share. So are you basically bringing a new business? So we can open up the floor. Yes. Is that what it is yes, I say goodbye, you're welcome to stay, I'm going to have to leave, but I. Thank you now. We thank you deeply. You know for your time and your knowledge as well. Thank you so much. Thank you. I want to hear this, but I have to have to sorry. Are you sharing your screen area? Are you sharing your screen yeah, I'm going to share it now with the smoke in here, but thank you. Okay. So are you going to possibly estate the the title of your new business, the business that you wanted to present? Yes, so I'm introducing a resolution or draft draft form of a resolution and what I've just labeled it for now is just the resolution to combat youth homelessness and mental health disparities in the midst of Covid-19. You know: I'll go essentially reading through some of just the language pulling from the statement that was given earlier tonight, as well as some of the items that I've also found through that research, I've written, whereas the state and city is required by law to provide shelter to everyone who needs it, whereas homelessness near Steve. Allow me to interrupt you one. Second. What we need to do is we are going to call for a motion to enter into a debate to discuss this after somebody seconded and then we're going to present the concept, but so far you are presenting or bringing a business, which is a possible resolution to in support to combat the youth, homelessness and mental health disparity is that the new business you are presenting to this committee right? Yes, okay, very good. So let's call for a motion and right now I'm calling for a motion to so we can go into the new business. That Ariel is presenting a possible resolution to combat youthful homelessness and mental health. Disparity in the midst of coffee. So can we have a second I? Can thank you ayesha. Okay. Now the motion is on the table. Let's go into the game: let's discuss! Go ahead. Yell please, and we see the all right go ahead, go through it. I was just going to actually, we could see the bottom, but it looks like you're going to start from the top yeah, I'm going through the entire thing here. So just continuing along, whereas homelessness in New York City has reached the highest levels since the great depression, whereas over the course of city fiscal year, 2019,132 660 different homeless children, men and women slept in New York City shelters, which included over 44,300 homeless children, whereas in August 2020 there were 57,660 homeless people, including 12,866 homeless families with 19,000, six homeless, children sleeping each night in a New, York City shelter, whereas the coalition for the homeless state of the homeless 2020 report shows that governor Cuomo is failing to address homelessness most disturbingly by allowing thousands of individuals to be released from hospitals, jails and nursing homes directly to shelters, whereas in 2018 more than 3,400 individuals were released from state prisons directly to shelters in New, York City and between 2015 to 2018 more than 15,000. Such individuals were sent to city shelters by the state, whereas the state did not adequately address housing needs as psychiatric centers, similar to that of the allen. Pavillion were closed, leaving many vulnerable people. Sorry many people vulnerable to homelessness, whereas one in every 100 babies born in New, York City last year, was brought home from the hospital to a shelter, whereas the public assistance, shelter allowance set by the state has been historically inadequate, leaving those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness without permanent, affordable housing options and whereas sixty percent of new Yorkers say they do not have enough emergency savings to cover at least three months worth of expenses like food and rent on nearly twenty percent of New York City residents already live below the poverty line, earning less than twenty four thousand three hundred dollars for a family of four, whereas the coalition for the homeless estimates, keeping a family in their home saves taxpayers. Sixty eight thousand four hundred and twenty two dollars per year in shelter costs, therefore be it resolved. More 12 Manhattan calls upon Congress to enact the Heroes act passed by the House of Representatives that would set aside 100 billion dollars in emergency rent relief, 10 billion dollars of which would go to New York under the typical formulas used for such programs, be it resolved community board. 12 Manhattan calls upon the state of New York to accelerate the pace of production of the 20,000 units of supportive housing pledged by the governor in 2016, by completing them within 10 rather than 15 years, and fully funding the construction of operation, construction and operation of the remaining 14,000 units, be it resolved community board. 12 Manhattan calls upon the state of New York to implement the home stability support program to create a state funded long-term rent subsidy for households, receiving public assistance who are homeless or at risk of losing their housing due to eviction domestic violence or hazardous conditions, be it resolved community board, 12 Manhattan state of New York to reverse the harmful cuts to New York City's emergency shelter system that resulted in the state shortchanging the city by hundreds of millions of dollars over the past six years and share equally with the city in the non-federal cost of sheltering families and individuals, be it resolved community board. 12 Manhattan calls upon the state of New York to conduct further oversight of hospitals, jails and other institutions to prevent inappropriate discharges to shelters and the streets, be it resolves community board 12 calls upon the state of New York to adequately fund community-based programs, housing programs, sorry for individuals with psychiatric disabilities, be it resolves community board 12 in Manhattan calls upon the state of New York to ensure effective re-entry planning for individuals being released from state prisons in order to identify viable housing options to prior to each individual's schedule.

With that I know it's a mouthful but I hope you you've been able to graph some of these items here wow. We have a big chunk to digest. Wonderful, yes, well I. If I may I just wanted to like in the title: let's go: can you zoom it? So we can see it okay, what it says, resolution to come back, okay to come back, youth! Well, I! Guess! The title you know yes, I was I, saw a question to see resolution in support too okay, but this is fine, but a general assignment that or suggestion that I have is. Maybe we want to or you want to consider it to consolidate several of those you know, whereas and so to make this like more compact I, think that would be very important. So but anyway, let's allow Maria, raise your hands and yes Maria you omir yourself, Maria, please and sorry faith. You can just let me know who has their hands raised because I can't see it in the story: okay, but Maria. We can not hear you ryan, very good. Thank you! Maria, okay, I'm, okay! Now, yes, we can hear you very all due respect. This resolution meets responsibility from the state overall and in the city, I think my recommendation. We will be to split it because we are talking about Cuomo, we're talking about the city and the numbers really I think that our responsibility right now is community world 12. the needs for the people, the children and the families within our community, because no every area there are 50 counties in New York. That Cuomo is responsible for so I think that maybe there's too many whereases and too many being resolved, and no one is going to pay to tell you to someone sitting on the state committee. This goes to the floor of the State Committee and they're going to send it back, it's lengthy and we need to make sure that you know there's something specific seal, that they can be addressed immediately or in short time. I'll suppose that we talk about housing, building housing forever and ever, and you know that we're going to be listening for a you know, elected official saying there is no place here to you know: to build housing because I mean the real estate industry is controlling our political life. So I think that's my recommendation. Let's see how we can you know that could be it's a good resolution, but I think that we need to make a specific sense for our area and then for the overall problem that we have with homeless families and children and then the shelter. That's what I have to say. I have no problems with the resolution, but I think it needs to be split. I need to yeah. You know to be more concise, certain things community what 12th said and then there is all this insane. They stay responsibility and all the serious responsibility of it all if I may, if I may quickly, Maria has a great point. I understand, but I also understand and I wanted to actually share this. Remember that in terms of funding, in terms of which I think is actually what Adiel's intention is basically to create some kind of connection looking at the repercussion that the estate has on the city and I think that bringing all this data from the from the estate in combination with the city he may not, or we may not necessarily acknowledge all these. You know Datas, but I- think that making the estate of making some references to give credibility to this resolution and in terms of what these the estate is saying, I think is highly important. So I do not think that the idea to avoid completely mentioned the essay is necessarily something that we wanted to do. But let's see what the rest of the county have to say, but you have a balance point. You know in your own opinion. Money I appreciate it go ahead, can I add something sorry I just want to provide the point of reference, so it is broken down. So when so you're looking, for instance, if you're looking at this portion here, you're getting the main whereas right and this data is going to be focusing on New York City, you know you can't you can't necessarily get much more specific if you're going to try and ask because again you know this is not going to come out that way, you can't get it by a community district based on the information that you're to find right. Now, maybe you can ask that of a city agency to deliver that to us, but that's not going to be available and in reference to the resolves, I want to point out that they specifically cite who is being called upon for each. So it lays out the state of New York, the state of New York, and then you go further down. You'll see the city of New York, the city of New York, so the specific items that go to each of them. Yes, I'm not sure I can't see. You know very sure, I think that you know you're right I mean is not it's a nice long resolution that we are talking about. Yes, when we are talking about billions of dollars allocated to New York, it's the responsibility of each politician and I'm going to call politicians elected officials have to lobby for how much money is going to come to their district. This is my focus is that it has to be some of the things have to be split, and some of the things also have to go into our budget and our priorities, because we need housing. We can not force landlords to just ascend vouchers because we're telling them to do. They also have some ways of controlling their property, and that's why they put a lot of money. Financial, you know help to elected officials, so you know this is something when we talk about report by 2016 about housing. This is 2020 and still they do not know where they're going to be housing, where they're going to be the money allocated to shelters, children in families and hotels is not the answer. I do not think that long-term resolutions and short-term solutions, so that's it but I, you know yeah, no, that's not what's in here, I know, but that's it. But it's not. There, but it is there because you're talking also now you're talking about asking Congress to announce you know, yeah can I, can I add something how much I'm fake not add. Something who am I absolutely go ahead. Please I'm not sure. If I'm next or not, I can't see the list is there is there a list am I. Fey I think you you're the only one I can't look at the screen to I can't look at it. Yeah I'm looking at okay, yeah, I, I'll, just jump in I, would say: I would say Ariel I commend the work. Is this obviously a great well thought out resolution I would agree with Marina Maria that I think it's important to maybe think of having separate resolutions. Maybe one that's focused on the issue at the city level and then maybe having one that focuses on the state level. I did not see the correlation I understand where you were going with the heroes act reference but I do I think that may be a little bit too complex and intermingling the states. The city, state and federal issue. I said that that's. Why that's my recommendation as well to maybe consider having a resolution that focuses on the issue at the city level and then one that focuses on the state level? Yes, but what I was saying is basically and be brief. Is that if what would be the objection of he bring in some data and do I would say maybe fair comparison, I stay level in city level, because I think the data that he wanted to use at the state level references I do not know. Maybe references about everything that I saw necessarily I mean you do not have to elaborate in the whole resolution about the same concentrator, because this is the city issue that we're trying here to you know to defend, but I think that he can use any data and train or statistic that can be helpful and bring more credibility or more weight onto this resolution from the same level. I do not see exactly why, but anyway, yes, we're all entitled to our opinion. But yes, he, the resolution, should focus more into the city. Yes, I agree, but I also can see his intention and bringing some credibility and kind of bringing some information at the state level. Yeah I do not agree. I'm not disagreeing with that. Not at all yes and look regardless what happened today, we can always bring this to the executive committee and there we also can have you know many opinions as well. But yes, let's see how much we can advance here, because this is very important and carrie. Yes, thank you and Maria. Also for you know for your input. Yes, no go ahead, can you just scroll it down, so we can see the last few resolutions it's hard to see everything on this screen. Yeah, no I understand this is like yeah. Yes, sorry we're going to say: no, that definitely is too long. We do not have to go through. We can consolidate this definitely, but this let's have the rest of the kali to speak. If I might, in my opinion, as Ariel read this resolution, the more proud I became of the work that he's been doing on this board and this resolution I feel like what it does. Is it sets the groundwork for the fact that many of these things are things that have been in place already? They are things that people have been advocating for years, they're things that there are plans already in place for that need to be amended to take into consideration the current situation that we find ourselves. They are things that range all the way from the federal government down to the city level, and that is why they're all included in here I think the beauty of it is. It shows on in a very broad way, all of the ways in which, if we moved in these areas, the impact that can be delivered to the people who that are in detriment right now. The only thing that I would do to change. It is to add to it the fact that this board has also advocated for community Land Trust and the fact that there is a group in our community that has been awarded to be participate in a pilot program in order to be educated and hopefully bring to fruition a community land trust to also afford more housing opportunities to those of differing levels of income. I would just ask that be added to the resolution as another, be it resolved. Thank you. Thank you. Asia, so I mean it's clearly right. There are so many pieces to this well, I think what I think, maybe in terms I guess we should probably just go into I. Guess the individual pieces here to try and I guess get consensus on really the entire piece here, but if perhaps it might you know, maybe it might make sense here to just cut out some of the areas where it's mentioning the larger groups and just specifically focus on keeping that which is you know, furniture children, maybe that might make more sense here to just cut down a bit, and these two whereases and I can keep going down. Just item by item, if you'd like does that make sense? Yes and the good thing is that I'm not sure you know whether or not we would be able to pass a resolution today, but I think that it's a good idea that we before this meeting is over or be adjourned that we collectively agree and whatever amendments or friendly amendments. You know we receive, but you brought the business and you know you tell us: I have a point of clarification. What is the difference between the 132,000 different homeless, children, men, so that includes the men and women? Is that what that larger number is, and then the 40 44,000 is just children yeah and that was specifically I was having like these moments. So, while I was going over all this data, but yes, it's referring to over the entire span of that fiscal year. So, like the reason why I'll also just mention like you'll see like you'll, be thinking about like. Why is there such a huge difference between this one- and you know you're looking at this number here? It's because it's going to be referencing the month, this one's just in that the cumulative over time of different people I think that the 132,000 is an important number as well yeah, so yeah. Well, I'm happy to keep it I mean I I mean yeah. I can just try and cut it down to keep. Did you accept the friendly amendment that she had posed and money as well? Man? Sorry, yes, keep so keeping the hundred thirty! Two thousand, I'm sorry, you said Maria, you wanted to I, think she's referencing, the community land trust clause. Well, I do not. My point has been always to not to dilute the you know the resolution as is written. It's just that I think that we should not meets. You know this is a high number. This is a very high number that we are pointing out. It's extremely important, aisha when you were the chair of the housing committee, I think that you have some resolutions already that would have passed and that was you know, sent down to city council. I do not know what the action that they took an action, but anything that you had sent down that was approved by the board. It's also included on this resolution. I mean that was actually my request. I was trying to recall other ones that may not have already been addressed. That should be another is right now the homes guarantee is also being reviewed in the state legislature as well so I mean I, just want to say, I appreciate the spirit in which Ariel has written this, which is to take a wholesome look at all of the vast efforts that have been done in this field that we are overdue, with considering that we're looking at the amount of people that we see homeless right now and who are being impacted, especially in the midst of a pandemic, and while this may be two pages, we have had resolutions that have been 15 pages. Let's remind ourselves, I do not think that two pages is too much for people to review. For such a crisis. There were there were some numbers in there, Arielle that you mentioned pertaining to formerly incarcerated people being released back into the community, but the data was from 2018 I believe maybe there's a way to add or strengthen that section, because that is that is an ongoing crisis as well, and that's what I believe that perhaps could be. It could be its own separate issue within itself like those who are formerly incarcerated. Coming back to the community as well as we have edgecombe state prison in our community as well, and there's talk of more shelters coming to our community and there's talk of releasing more people from prisons, and so I think that there's so much more. That can be added from that perspective that if there was more time or there was a separate resolution on homelessness pertaining to the prison issue, I also, you know- I was listening earlier talking about young people with homelessness, which is a huge issue. Obviously, but there's like this huge connection with one of your points earlier, you made about those who are who are in shelters are more likely to not graduate from high school, but there's also data. That shows that those who do not graduate from high school are more inclined to enter the prison pipeline, which connects to this whole issue that we're discussing so I think there's a way to maybe fine-tune, maybe break out some of the issues I mean I'm happy to tackle homelessness. From a perspective of you know, public safety in my committee in the future, but I do think, there's more that could be added and maybe there's something that is being lost, because I only saw that one sentence pertaining to prisoners being released into homeless, shelters and there could be so much more. That could be added in my opinion, and I also wanted to add- and this is a good example, the case of the the lady- you have people that you know they've been giving this basically full. You know voucher with the idea that they can get an apartment and they go and circle. You know that's something that I think that we should mention yes, because there is a serious problem with the city giving voucher to people and when, in reality they can do nothing. It's just it's just like advantage that is included in the result. I did not see it. The fact that the yeah I think Ariel is highlighting it now. I'm sorry, so I'm sorry, absolutely raised to market rate is included also I want to say, remind people of standard practice which is at times we vote on resolutions, because the spirit of the resolution is not going to change by us. Updating the data in the resolution and so I feel like. There was certainly time in order before the general meeting. For instance, anything that says 2018 to be updated to the most current date of information that we have so that it can be accurate, and we also change things on the general meeting floor. I move that we vote on this resolution all right. So, let's then let let's prepare them for take the boat, all right, let's call the body. So do we have quarter number one? How many of us? That's a good question. Yes, we need to make sure that we have well. There is 13 participants, we have Maria, we have Asia, we have Christina myself Adiel, we have kenny skelly you're still with us right, I am still here. Yes, I am yes, I actually do not know what is protocol. When we have a joint meeting in regards to well, we just added up. We just add it up like in my in our case, you have to be five people on our side, I guess, and what about yours and your size I mean I, assume that the combination, of course, a combination of yeah, what the requirement of the requirement and my side we need to have five people yeah on mine. We have four and thankfully you have just enough. So on your side, you have quarrel. What about an hour? Christina, let's see, let's see, let me see the list, it's better Dyson, it's better license, paradise. Are you there? Yes, sir okay, we have Paradise, we have Maria, we have yeah. Glenn is still with us, I'm going to say. Yes, we have Warren and my side. Yes, we have Warren and we have guillermo Perez as well. Yes right! Yes, we do have Quorum. So then let's call the vote. Okay, all right! Let's start with your committee area. Also, those in favor say yes, either. No may I say something. Yes, this is a city. This is a resolution, that's going to the city, so it had to be a individual vote by the members of the of the committee by the public members and the community. You know people who are you know, committee, member, first boy, member second, the other, coming. We have to do the same thing because it's a city, it's a Syria resolution yeah, but we're going to call the vote. The members first right, the Community Board member second and public member loss and I will tell you. Let me just point your information. The strength of this resolution is going to be that the members of the committee's voting close the members of the board that are also attending and voting. So that will put a more you know, a strong vote on wait. People will pay attention to this resolution. All right so Ariel can I see the title again. Can you put him on your screen? So I can repeat that while I'm calling the the vote, please and I was actually just about to start counting them down at the bottom. Just want to see the title yep, okay, so now in combination with the youth and Allocation committee and the Housing Human Services Committee. So at this time we are calling the vote for the resolution to combat youth homelessness and mental health disparity in the means of Covid-19 all right. Those in favor raise your hand or say yes, Christina, yes, okay, Paradise, yes, curtis! Yes! Thank you. Are you sure? Yes, okay, let's see who other members? Yes. Thank you I want to see some other names. Can you can you take the out of the out of the screen the the resolution? So I can see it's yeah, other members adios, you already call. Yes, you say yes and let's see who else I just need to make a point of information. Marietta's is trying to put her son to sleep, so she can't vote verbally right now raised her hand. However, so he just fell asleep, so I stepped out the bedroom. So yes, my vote is yes. Thank you. Who was this? Who is this Marielle? Thank you Marielle. Yes, what about do? We have any other board members. How many committee members is Glenn is glenising. Yes, I voted, yes, okay! Glennis! Thank you, ladies please. Yes, gabriella do we have gabriela I do not think so. No anybody else from the Committee board members, okay, public members, guillermo I, can not hear you. Yes, okay, seven, eight, nine and ten. Okay in fact, say: yes, one two, three four, five: six, seven, eight nine and ten and eleven so the yes, okay, the years got it and yes, resolution passed anonymously. Thank you! So very much yes with me. I say: yes, I said yes, 11. all right all right, so moving forward to the next phase is daddy. Any question that you may have before we are joining our meeting. No really quick before we go. Faye I wanted to ask when they were present, but why was there a switch from ipads I mean from chromebooks to ipads, I'm assuming the cost would be significantly less and just from a tech perspective. I know some of the issues that exist with the ipad. That would not be the case with chromebook it's possible that the chromebook does not afford for some of the other uses that they may need, but I'm just curious about why that is because clearly that's creating a conflict for some of the students to where they have to bring a bus just to allow for the connectivity that they need specifically with that device. So if we could find out more information about what's happening with that technology, there was a article that came out in the New York Times last month, which spoke to that issue as well. So well, I can tell you- and you probably saw that reflection. You know on our body requests. There are schools still in our district, that they are still limping with, that they are still waiting. Many students are still waiting to on the delivery of the chromebooks and also you know, ipads. There is a silent problem that you know it's not really. No one is talking about, but I know that many schools are still waiting. You know for the student to get the the look and the ipads as well. Yes, okay and before you post a question I mean to say thank you all. You know for voting on this resolution. Your inputs I in particular Maria, would never go silence. Maria. Thank you. So I need that formula, so I can have a kind of energy. Thank you, I used to have that when I was younger, but you know I really believe in that all right, so any announcement that you that we may have- and you want to share it- I guess so. Yes, I, wish everybody a happy thanksgiving. Thank you. Okay, if I, if I may just address a few things that we're following at the borough president's office specifically related to the tech with the DOE, so just you know, we do collect a lot of the feedback from constituents to bring to them. But you know in the in the case to Aisha's question why they would go with ipads rather than chromebooks a lot of it had to do with availability. There was a point at which a lot of schools acquired ipads, because a laptop was considered, something that was not eligible for the expense funding unless it was in a networked lab, and there was an exception made I believe when Gail Brewer was in city council that allowed for a mobile defined device that all that said, there are so many issues with people, including children in my family, who are being required to use particular websites that are firewalled by DOE devices. So, in addition to connectivity, in addition to incompatible devices, you have just really basic decision making. That is not looking at the whole picture. Why would you require a website to upload assignments or to perform tests and not bother to check first, that it was not firewalled by the DOE, and so it's really basic things like that. Where we kind of sit and said you know the school closed for months, we expected that there were all these things. It was for that reason to do all of that planning to do all of that refining and it just did not happen. So we continued to be on that. We have had the DOE superintendents executive, superintendents Chancellor's offices, at our borough board many times you can look up on our social media channels to re-watch those hearings. We continue to take the task. If you guys have more specific questions we can. We can pass them along. It's very disappointing. It's it's a huge roadblock on top of many roadblocks our community is facing. Thank you. I know I. It's really sad that at this point you know we already in November heading. You know pretty soon December and it's really shameful that you have students that still they do not have their equipment. I personally been in contact prior. Even where we started with the budget requests speaking to different principals and going over, you know the problems that they have and things that they need, because every year I visited many of them asking you know what are their priority, what kind of need you know they want our community to add the case and I know that there are several schools that they are going through. A very you know, difficult situation when it comes to you know, equipment for these students. In fact, there was one of the one of the school that you know was telling us that they precisely were in need of 200 of these screaming between chromebooks and ipads and Maria said yeah, but I'm you know, you know kind of concerned. Quite precisely, you know 200, but you know it's just to tell you that there is the. There is a very you know, problems. You know a very I do not know how to even to describe it. It's an urgent need. You know for students to get this equipment, but you know nobody is really talking about that. It's an urgent need with many consequences because, as you all know- and we keep fighting against this I know here- you've discussed it. We've discussed it in our office, but child protective services will come and do a truant call on a family that is not connecting because they are truant. They are not attending because they can't connect, and so you have the possibility of having children and families pay legal consequences or have things go on record? Because of that- and you have all of these- you know it puts school social work and it puts you know it highlights the need for social, more social work, support, and now you know with the health care issue, more nursing support in schools. But these are the kind of I do not call them cracks because cracks. You can give the excuse that people did not see them. They are giant chasms through which our community is falling. Natalie I was just about to bring that up, because I've spoken with a parent. The parent is in Queens that contacted me specifically to say that their child was being marked absent because they were not logging in, but they never received the device. So I'm curious as to how many in our district have been impacted by that that's a valid point yeah because of confidentiality issues. Obviously, child protective services. You know can't release a lot of information because you know if it's the numbers are low. If they identify a certain school, it kind of gives you a hint of what it is, and you know some of them decided to stop doing it. But we are talking about the potential of let's say a district 75 student being removed from a home and put into a group home with far more risk of contagion. Yeah, because it's not like they can go anywhere else. It is. It is a you know it the potential disasters, especially for communities that can't always advocate for themselves like those who do not speak English or have too many jobs or child care issues that keeps them from being. On top of the you know, the bureaucratic details of the school system- and you know who can keep up with that red tape, yeah and I wanted to add that getting information from the district lately, it's been very difficult because, prior also to the the our budget hearing, I contact the office and I was trying to get the numbers, in particular in the area of teachers. You know how many teachers, you know we have in our district if they can give us at least a breakdown. How many are doing you know in person or in classroom lesson and or you know, and also on the other side like virtual, but you know I, send honestly about four different requests and I never got a single answer for no one, including with the superintendent. Unfortunately reason why I do not know, but everything is being you know very difficult in general. Getting information and I wanted to say. This is just a speculation that maybe because of the atmosphere, political atmosphere right now with all this pandemi they people, for example, principals and even the superintendent. They may be in position that they can not. Probably share information unless the DOE chancellor, you know allow them so everybody is trying to be very skeptical as to what information they share so anyways. So it's 10 after 10, where are my children now so natalie as always, is I appreciate. You know your office supports and equally you know the same you because you are the face of your office. You know when it comes to the community board, but we deeply thank you and we thank you both. You know, president Gail Brewer and Khalees. Thank you. So much for your support. Maria do not change so I! Guess at this point. If you do not have any question I guess I wish you during this meeting right now. Are we we agree second day? Yes, second Thursday! Yes, all right guys! Thank you so much and you have a good night. Okay! Thank you good night, everyone great meeting good night. Thank you appreciate it good night. Everyone.
