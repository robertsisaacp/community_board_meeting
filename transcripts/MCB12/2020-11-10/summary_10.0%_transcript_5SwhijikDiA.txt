I want to thank everyone for being everyone for being here and housing and making all this you know, meaning you know possible before we start.
And I really and deeply wanted to thank each and all of you for making the time to join this important conversation, and perhaps this important meeting I would like to proceed and allowing my colleagues committee, members of the youth and Education Committee to introduce themselves for the records.
You so very much Miss, Kim and I wanted to say this is our second event, which is we call it part two for the homelessness and mental health youth crisis in particular, and this time for Covid-19, which is a special.
I wanted to share with you that this is not the first time, of course, that we got together to discuss the this problems of homelessness and mental health in our community.
The crisis that the city in general you know is facing so, and what the Community board has done so far is basically call upon those members of the panel that actually join us on the first time.
So here are some of the things that I wanted to, or the objective that I wanted to discuss it with you, so we're going to hopefully learn today and hearing from you know your expertise.
We have to provide an opportunity for the community, like Cbo's as well, and healthcare providers, to learn and discuss critical needs and a strategy to support our youth living under these terrible conditions or circumstances.
And, I'm, sure that you guys already know that homelessness and mental health are serious problems, sometimes for some of us, because we're lucky enough to just stumble upon some of these issues.
And, of course, lieutenant members who have contributed to make this make this possible and again I like to stress the fact that to some of us, the homelessness and mental issues are more directly impactful than others.
Oh and that no I should say that I would like to introduce again and in the next phase of this agenda, to my colleague, Mr Daniel Amiranda, who is the chair of the housing and Human Services Committee, as you can see, or what you should expect from this event is or from this discussion he is going to be called moderating.
We represent children and family court, and then there are projects like mine, which are relatively small, but our job is to help individuals and families who are running into kind of issues related to getting into shelter or staying in shelter or staying there.
We also work on policy kind of issues as they come up, including the legislation at the City Council and in the state level as well, and we also do sometimes bring lawsuits on behalf of usually class actions on behalf of large groups of people to make changes to how some of the city and state and other government agencies are implementing the services for homeless families and individuals.
You know it's with experience in administration, homelessness, child welfare, domestic violence and so on, and so on, especially working with city state and federal governments, with the role that I play at DYCD.
I oversee the runaway and homeless youth division, which is about 60 contracted sites within the New York City region, which includes street Outreach, drop-in centers, both on daytime and 24 hours, as well as short and long-term residential programs.
We had launched back in 2017 as a youth development and drop-in center for 14 to 24 year olds, where our young people can connect to different resources as well as opportunities such as educational support, employment readiness, health services and other recreational activities.
We repo we provide that wraparound support to our young people, actually through a network of existing youth providers that are in the community, particularly uptown, and they work alongside our internal hub staff, which is comprised of program staff psychologists, as well as youth advocates, who actually provide individualized, mentorship and case management to all of our hub members, and so definitely in these last few years, and certainly with the pandemic.
There were 57,660 homeless people, including 12,866 homeless families with nineteen thousand and six homeless, children sleeping each night in the New York City, shelter, system, there's many reasons for families to experience.
2020 report shows that the state of New York has been failing to address homelessness most disturbingly by allowing thousands of individuals to be released from hospitals and jails directly to shelters.
The state did not adequately address housing needs as psychiatric centers like that of the island pavilion that is close by and local here were closed, leaving many vulnerable people to homelessness, and shockingly one in every 100 babies born in New York City last year, was brought home from the hospital to a shelter.
At least 94 percent of families in New, York, City shelters are headed by people of color.
60 of new yorkers say they do not have enough emergency savings to cover at least three months worth of expenses like food and rent, while nearly 20 percent of New York City residents have already lived below the poverty line, earning less than twenty four thousand three hundred dollars for a family of four.
So if they can kindly wanted to brief us, basically and providing all some kind of background or the views around, you know that you know around the other subject or homelessness and mental youth crisis.
One thing I want to point out is that when people think about homelessness, like the average person, thinks about homelessness, to be honest with you, when you ask most of the time they think of folks who are unsheltered, who are living not in a shelter who are perhaps living like rough out on the street, sleeping in parks or maybe are doubled, up, sometimes or couch surfing, but in New York City, we're unique in that we have the right to shelter, particularly to go into DHS shelter.
Even within New York City HRA runs the domestic violence shelters, which is the Human Resources administration, where Randy works.
That's by the way, not even counting all the families who are doubled up like you talk about Mckinney Vento, which is the educational act that gives all these rights to homeless, students.
A lot of other definitions are much smaller and it's just important to note that when or like know that when someone might come to you and talk about a living situation, they may not even define themselves as homeless, but legally they may be or may not be, depending on which setting that they're in.
A lot of the work I'm doing someone's mental health needs are very important about sixty percent of adults and in shelter or a family unit in Shelter.
The reasons why people become homeless and have to enter a municipal, shelter, system, that's traumatic in and of itself, even if you had not been diagnosed with any mental health issue prior to going into shelter, sometimes just that process can be very traumatic and can and can cause there to be a need for a mental health intervention and often the experiences that you might be having there just kind of dealing with kind of the process of like recognizing yourself within this newer community of people.
Trying to you, know, you've lost, maybe your connection, particularly if you're escaping domestic violence, as Ariel said you're not going to be placed in the same borough, so you could have a family in Washington, Heights.
But, there's also a lot of mental health impact that has, as we've learned, even during the pandemic, when you're separated from people that you care about, and you know in life, so I just I'll leave it there because I think that's about three minutes.
You know our youth are dealing with trauma like Beth was saying in regards to the situations that they are facing on a daily basis, so they need services to help them in terms of how to maintain that job that they may have or that housing that they may have and whether and continue to go to school.
We were not able to do it this year due to the pandemic, is our healing to hurt where we bring in professionals or who you know are experienced in trauma and vicarious trauma and other types of mental health issues to speak to our providers, provide them with tools that they can use on a daily basis, not only for their clients, the youth that they service, but also for themselves, because we got to remember that anything that's happening.
You know if you are in need of mental health services for youth and want to know more about what we do.
This is a crisis time and the number of children, and not only children, but staff and family members who are burdened is extreme, and what we also find is that counselors finding bilingual counselors to meet the needs of our community, who is 75 second language, learners, I, said, is even more difficult.
So we're looking at a lot of mental issues and a lot of minimal services within schools to provide for that support, as well as in the community.
Think that just talking and discussing and trying to look up for some solutions and also pushing our voice to to stay to the people who are actually listening to this, that we need to have action done for the welfare of the entire community, and that includes every marginalized community within our city.
As we've been getting to know our young people more and developing those relationships, we really do find that a lot of the ones who have this particular issue, maybe leaving on their own, leaving their family home really as an escape mechanism in a lot of ways, because they're in invalidating, maybe perhaps abusive or even dangerous home environments.
We, have also had young people come and share with us, those who are in the lgbtq plus community in particular, who have actually been kicked out by family members, who won't necessarily accept them for who they are.
That we are hearing the stories of having to go through the system go through the shelter or even the application process can be that traumatic event which can be a predictor of then the development of a mental illness which could include suicidal ideation or even suicide attempts, and so you know, given all of these realities, I, definitely think it's so critical that, at the very minimum that providers and staff are aware of and sensitive to.
Yes, if I may, I, would like to kind of in make a parenthesis, because I think that is something that I just noticed and before we go into the question which actually may serve as a break for our panelists.
This is evident for children living in double up, residencies and temporary housing and shelters, who are second language learners or have special needs and live in environments not conducive to privacy, low noise level and support, and what parents of the high school students and middle school students are saying is that they are having a problem controlling the teenagers.
Families that resorted to double up as a result of the pandemic are now counted among the homeless, and that does not mean that schools know who they are, because identification of these children has become very difficult in a system that is a little chaotic.
Much for speaking to these issues, so I also want to ask because I realize this is a particular group that I think just you know, although they make up such specific portion of the population of our youth that are homeless.
I, think the attention that sometimes is really needed on such not just the city-wide level, but also the national level, and it's in reference to those youth that are specifically dealing, or rather.
I. Have you know wanted to make sure that people understood what those are, but I also want to ask you all individually what you think those barriers are to lgbtq youth entering and accessing shelters at this time.
If we're talking about barriers, I do think that is just one of the things that we are often confronting, at least for the young people that do come to the hub and are looking for that resource.
The other thing that I did also want to mention and hearkening back again to blanca your earlier point of overcrowded apartments, because that is that really has been a huge issue that we have seen where our young people are stuck at home, with tons of family members living in very small one.
The thing about the right to shelter for a single person in New, York, City, no matter how you identify whether you're gender non-conforming, you identify as a gender.
Once you kind of got over that, like initial hump, when there was maybe some period of time where, for safety purposes, some of the youth shelters, you know, had to restrict some beds due to some spacing related to.
Covid-19 like you, should be able to get into a bed in either of those systems and in DHS there is also Marsha's house, which is a shelter that is focused and set aside just for people who identify as LGBTQIA Tgnc.
And Sharon's, exactly right, which is people's individual experiences and how they, how and where they feel safe means that all of those options may not work for them because of what their individual needs are, which is why having a lot of options is incredibly important.
One of the things that the uicd has done over the years is definitely tried to provide the necessary education and sensitivity to those providing services to the Lgbtq plus Population, and we've done that to the point where we have you know, all of our beds are available to the lgbtq plus we have some providers that specialize in working with the Lgbtq community and such as the Ali Forney Center.
We're, probably the only agency that has beds specifically for transgender youth, which is something that you know came to be because that's what the providers talked about needing and when we put out requests for proposals.
The larger point is that when city needs to cite shelters because of the right to shelter, they're, only looking at capacity and they're trying to push as many beds into a tight space as what otda the state regulations allow and what the finance actually work, for, which I have as a social worker.
The easiest thing to do, because everybody's details are so different, is, please call 311 and you will get to speak to someone who will be able to at least give you a sense of what is going on and what your options are, particularly in the next handful of months, as this becomes even more confusing, because evictions have started upstate evictions are happening, people are going to court in New, York City, so the you know.
We work on any kind of legal issue, with the exception of helping people plan for wills, and we generally do not sue for individual damages on short cases so like.
People call our homeless rights hotline if I had a way to like drop that in a chat, I probably would but the link.
I just want to put one more thing out there, which is that in particular right now we're really trying to make sure that any person who is having trouble accessing the internet, and, unfortunately.
You know you can please contact us, because we would really like to make sure young people in shelter are not missing school, whether you're.
We definitely approach our work with our youth from more of a prevention, lens, and so, as I had mentioned, before, having things like academic support, but also employment, readiness activities, which does include paid opportunities.
So we've been bringing them more to the table because we want to hear from them and help you know in terms of building services around what their true needs.
So you know we always need people who can volunteer to assist in that.
You know the budget for runway and homeless youth services has increased.
You know, like I, said thrive to bring services to our programs where they can work around the mental health.
We also work with the unity project which focuses on lgbtq issues, so we're looking to make sure that we have all of those supports available to youth at any given time in order to address their matters.
You share with you that information, as well as if presentations need to happen in your community, because people are not aware that DYCD has a runaway homeless, youth, division.
We want to make sure that the youth know their status, whether they have the virus or not need to get the necessary medical care.
You know, they've been working very hard to make sure that they continue to provide services to you.
One of the things as Beth had mentioned before is you know the Mckinney Dental Law, which says that all students who have come to the school who are homeless must be registered and must have the same services and participate in the same academic activities as all the students within this field.
Has been always the resource that has condemned our systems to give mediocre or at best the support that our families need, and one of the issues that I do want to bring up is the issue of affordable housing, which they predict that by 2022 about 4462 units apartments will be gone.
We have to be able to afford to provide if we're going to not eradicate, but at least decrease the homelessness in our community by providing some type of affordable housing for our children.
We're, going to file a lawsuit against the city of New York, to sue about the fact that kids in shelter do not have access to school because they do not have ipads that work.
The sim cards in the ipad, which we'll move them from a t-mobile cellular service to verizon, which for some people in New York, is making a big difference for access, but some shelters, it's not working so again, I'm, not sure how I can put it in the chat.
I know that help and other shelters are sharing this information with their with people who live there.
You know finding having enough affordable, permanent housing for new yorkers who live here and want to stay here, is the number one thing that everyone should be pushing and particularly pushing the new mayor and the New. And it's going to be really important to have people in there who understand and can support the efforts to make sure that this is a city where people can live and survive and exist.
I would like to basically to encourage all of you know, of course, our panels, so if they can voice the recommendation for strategies that can best support and improve our homelessness population in the areas of Housing, mental health, education and new programs, etc, any recommendation that you may have it would be definitely highly appreciated.
Whoever wants to just go ahead and with that I conclude my question until you know next, thank you, Ariel for being so kind.
Schools can't help if they really do not know, and so teachers are trying to make great bonds with their with parents, but that is one of the one of the issues that has has really occurred on it with the identification of our of our homeless population.
My question is what is being done about those types of circumstances that are putting people in risk, specifically people from our district, because when I'm telling these stories, I'm talking about people in our in our midst right that we as community board 12 members, are responsible to and also I would like to hear more about the specific data where our district is concerned.
You know the voices and experiences of people who are going through the actual issues is so important, as opposed to always, you know, coming to kind of other experts.
That, is why that's so important and frankly why community boards are incredibly important in New York City for getting people help that they need, because it could kind of help break down those artificial barriers that continue to exist, because I agree with you that that's a huge problem.
I. You, know I'm not going to ask Randy to reflect on this because he's like in it, but I.
Trying to you know, order, those things so that it can it work.
Definitely something that we were working on and pandemic slowed things up, but you know it's.
You know we'll see what the next administration brings, but I think if the staff that are in the work now we'll continue the great stuff that they've trying to do and not stop it.
First one is in reference to data I wanted to know what are the top three ways that the youth are finding out about your programs.
And, I'm, so glad that you talked about the youth voice because I think for us it really has been a lot of creating the space and the environment where the young people have the power to express themselves right and to feel that they can come to to a place where they're, supported and also exposed to.
I really do believe that it's the voices of our young people that are going to come out loud and proud, but I also do recognize that for a lot of our young people, they do not even know where to begin, or they do not even realize this is an issue that truly affects them, and so that's those are the types of spaces that we've been trying to create, at least with our team.
The best advocacy that I know has happened, has been where you've people been able to convince a landlord, because, frankly, I, think someone else knows the landlord and the communities come together to be like.
You house this person because they're very close to the amount of money, and it would be you know the things like that have happened, but it's not a.
Now you can be a resource in other ways, but I having worked a period of time with young people in foster care like.
I need to add it all, because this is not yes, for the panel might be yes, basically just the end, but I believe we have also to give the opportunity to the community for any announcement, and you know.
I do not know if the community may want it to have any announcements.
And I had been discussing, trying to find a resolution that we could bring together between both committees that are seeking to address many of the concerns that I mean I could only think was going to be brought up.
You know: I'll go essentially reading through some of just the language pulling from the statement that was given earlier tonight, as well as some of the items that I've also found through that research, I've written, whereas the state and city is required by law to provide shelter to everyone who needs it, whereas homelessness near Steve.
And, then we're going to present the concept, but so far you are presenting or bringing a business, which is a possible resolution to in support to combat the youth, homelessness and mental health.
12 Manhattan calls upon the city of New York to greatly reduce reliance on the single one-time assistance for better known as soda program and help families move out of shelters with long-term rent subsidies, including section 8 vouchers.
The needs for the people, the children and the families within our community, because no every area there are 50 counties in New, York.
But I think that we need to make a specific sense for our area and then for the overall problem that we have with homeless families and children and then the shelter.
Maybe you can ask that of a city agency to deliver that to us, but that's not going to be available and in reference to the resolves, I want to point out that they specifically cite who is being called upon for each.
This is 2020, and still they do not know where they're going to be housing, where they're going to be the money allocated to shelters, children.
I mean you do not have to elaborate in the whole resolution about the same concentrator, because this is the city issue that we're trying here to you know to defend, but I think that he can use any data and train or statistic that can be helpful and bring more credibility or more weight onto this resolution.
Yes and the good thing is that I'm not sure you know whether or not we would be able to pass a resolution today, but I think that it's a good idea that we before this meeting is over or be adjourned that we collectively agree and whatever amendments or friendly amendments.
When you were the chair of the housing, committee, I think that you have some resolutions already that would have passed, and that was you know, sent down to city.
Considering that we're looking at the amount of people that we see homeless right now and who are being impacted, especially in the midst of a pandemic, and while this may be two pages, we have had resolutions that have been 15 pages.
You know, that's something that I think that we should mention yes, because there is a serious problem with the city giving voucher to people and when.
This is a resolution, that's going to the city, so it had to be a individual vote by the members of the of the committee by the public members and the community.
At this time we are calling the vote for the resolution to combat youth homelessness and mental health disparity in the means of Covid-19 all right.
You know the problems that they have and things that they need, because every year I visited many of them.
