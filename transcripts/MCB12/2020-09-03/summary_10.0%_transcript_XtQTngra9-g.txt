You know, uncertain right now for the community, What's going to be happening with regards to many of the services that we depend on throughout our community, we're having a bit more of a kind of a broader discussion than what we've already had these past few months between March to June.
I did work for three years here in inwood, as well as east, harlem, specifically working alongside the elected officials as well as a number of tenants throughout the neighborhood trying to ensure that they could stay in their homes, help them get connected with legal services.
You know even past that previous experience of three years working here in the community, with the tenants and with that I want to pass along to oc.
Wow went quickly, so I probably moved to washington heights about the same time that oc moved to inwood about 20 years ago from the other side of town, Heights ended up in audubon park and a great co-op and then was lucky to do that and have since gotten involved with various organizations, including community league of the heights, where I've been working with the food pantry.
That is the reason why I remain on this board so that work can be done, but I have done advocacy in this community for over a decade, probably two decades in the areas of housing, human services, education, criminal justice.
You know we have a lot of a family history in the neighborhood , I'm, still living in the same apartment that he first lived in And I'm new to some of the housing work.
I do look forward to working with all of you And you know, making our community better and making housing in our community, affordable and decent for all glad to have you here , Jimenez I've lived in washington heights, my whole life, so 30 years, Exactly I'm, a community collection liaison on behalf of the department of design and construction.
This is a very, very difficult time for our practice area and obviously for our communities with the pandemic, with a significant number of unemployed people and just kind of figuring out what the situation is.
The staff are not capable of handling the residence and the people who otherwise live in the building are absolutely going nuts, because these group homes have shown that they can't operate according to apartment living and the pandemic has just brought everything to a crisis point and the reason it's one main reason.
We're gonna, try and set this so that we can, you know, discuss the entire situation in the new business section: , that's okay, no open up, but yes, that will definitely come back to this.
Please do feel free to have it brought up once I open up everything for new business at the end , I want to kind of open it up really to our committee first and just following, along with the typical rules of how we do things with the board, we'll open it, then back up to the public.
What the research they've been finding is showing about really the rate of homelessness throughout new york city, and you know, I think, that for my own goals, this year, I want to ensure that we have the opportunity to really actually interact with some of the homeless, service, homeless, shelter providers, because they are probably dealing with really just a huge influx of families either, because some of the very recent I'll call them loopholes that exist that have caused families to get vacated, whether it be because I'm not sure if people have been following new york.
You know the pandemic and we're being a little bit more responsive to the needs of those that particularly are in these kind of home housing situations that really are just not decent and are not livable circumstances, and This is aisha, so I think that in the past, what I've tried to do when I was serving as chair is to focus not only on things within our purview, but also things that could help the board work more efficiently for us in the areas related to our purview and to support business across the board throughout the board.
One example of that is a resolution that we in this committee reviewed to have a safety net fund put forward by the elected officials and for a coalition to be built for people who are undocumented asylum, seekers, etc in the event that they are released from whether it be being detained or whether they enter the country and have nowhere to go that there would be supports for them to prevent harm to themselves or others, and that resolution passed the only one person voted against it, and yet the office never put it in black and white and forwarded it to the elected officials.
The committee had the intention on reviewing what was happening with dhcr, to bring dhcr to a point, to put forward a resolution to make dhcr more accountable to the community to tenants so that there would be visibility about information related to when people's tenants rights right most of what is happening in dhcr is weighted on the side of the landlord.
I'm kind of questioning: How is it possible that the office doesn't forward resolutions to the government officials, as they should well see that that issue is one in a stack of many, not only my own personal experience, but also people in the community have come to me to express certain concerns they have when they make requests to the office that the office is responsible to do also having been a member of the executive committee.
Despite, my asking questions about it and what one of the primary things the primary responses was to send it back to committee, and we almost redeliberated it Of course, they're, still part of the function of the board, but I do want to just try and make sure that we're sticking to the agenda item in the capacity just to bring up many of these concerns, You know.
I can imagine that there's a few different issues that, whether the board members, the public committee, want to raise Okay.
You actually give a little bit more detail about really what this program focuses on, so this program is focused on giving a homeless people an apartment and pay for the rent and give them an opportunity to live in a house in a home that and then that program is also attached to some social services like helping them.
It's, a program that include different things, to lift people up from the street to become you know, to have a house to feel like you know, most of all of us, so, and I feel from what I heard and what I read that it's a very successful, program, and I think this is something that we should push to have here in new york, city, which we don't have.
How, when we have programs, like you, know giving people an actual home to live in that they're, providing the supportive services?
Where do you cite a location for a city agency office oftentimes, you know even going back to what we talk about This is one of the biggest discussions that we had because often times we found that there was disproportionate impact from let's say, having sanitation, warehouses facilities being kept in certain areas of the Bronx right, and that's something that is not.
What has rather, what has not been in their own community for some time, so You know, I think that that's one of the areas that in which we do even within housing, human services.
You know address some of the concerns that we have here for those that really are vulnerable and do not have the opportunity to essentially afford what was the rent or Can we get back to kind of what the agenda that you laid out looking at the fiscal priorities and what we want to take on right?
But I just wanted to take this time to focus in on those individual goals that we, as a committee, are going to focus on throughout the year, got it.
Another thing, I would like I've seen other community boards set up forums or panels where they invite people from- There's a great need in our community right now for clarity about where we stand on.
This is something that the committee might have already addressed in the past year or two, but I am sort of involved with the northern Manhattan community land trust- But, let's think creatively, right now, as far as like, affordable housing and thinking of long-term solutions and bringing that conversation, especially as we're now facing the the 2021 elections, are right around the corner, we're going to see major changes as who's representing us at all levels of government.
And you know, renters rights, I- do believe that we need to have a conversation about supporting people becoming first-time homebuyers.
Just some of the ideas I wanted to share with the committee Is to amend the administrator code of the city of new york that pertains to the right to council and again it's not necessarily changing the law by just kind of expediting it and rolling it out.
Think for many years we've known and heard from people in our communities about applying for affordable housing, Sometimes people who seem to have just applied, maybe the previous month get you know an apartment before someone else, that's been on the list for many years.
This point the so where homeless is concerned, I feel like we talk about homeless, wholesome, but I think that we need to kind of drill down and look at the different ways that homelessness, manifests.
It wasn't previously on the agenda, But Yes, anything that the you know board wants to discuss, or perhaps the public.
Okay, the other just one other report to take a look at just because it's people in our community, but our community board district is number four in terms of number of essential workers housed in our community.
So I think that those are things that need to be looked at, but also that impacts those people in their housing, as well.
What's going to happen once these high-rise buildings get built and the landlords get 3, 500 4 000 a month in rent and other landlords in the neighborhood figure out that they could be getting the same amount of money in rent and start paying people to move out of their rental units or harass them out, and I'm wondering if the committee has any plans for how to go about addressing those situations when they arise.
What typically might happen is that we can either say just to begin the meeting that we're going to put all items for everyone to look at and vote on, or perhaps in this committee right here.
Is that, like I was mentioning before, is that when these items are essentially suggested by their committee members, the individual committees, they go back and they pretty much vote to find out, which ones will come in a certain ranking, and I think this is kind of bringing back to my good old times of ranked choice.
As the committee discusses this, it tends to kind of push up, maybe some new items, every year, If we talk about, let's just say the expense.
It's another example of how work that is done by this board is not followed up on, because in fact those people were out of their apartments, almost 10 years, with the right of return with nothing being done on those buildings, and it took all this time for anything to even start.
I think we should be also seeing what the board voted for what the committee proposed as well like what the final vote was for those items, as well as the the city's report when they returned it to us stating what was funded and what wasn't and how the city is going to handle funding of those matters or not.
We can, but I also want to just keep it open right, because we we've discussed that you know we want to make sure that people can bring in new items too That.
You know you want to be able to vote on as a committee member I'll note it down now, but if perhaps you would want to then wait and review the district needs statement.
You know, perhaps I think, looking over previous items that have been raised, whether it be through that sheet or even the specific district needs.
Here, like let's say for the first item, 40 We as committee members I just only want to present that sheet, just so that you know you know what has previously been raised as priorities for the committee Ever when we're when we're kind of going back and forth about what we think is more important.
This is february 11 2019, but what we're looking for is the fiscal year preliminary budget register so that we can see the responses of the city The same items right, because statement of district needs But on that document there it's just state.
Okay, I'm, really hoping that this committee and the board can help the people in our building, who are really suffering and experiencing a lot of problems because of community options.
What I, ultimately hope for is that the board would be willing to reconsider the previous resolution that it made six years, ago, approving community options to have the two units in our building, because now we have six years of documented experience showing that this has not been a good situation for any of the parties involved, that something really has to be done to change, it, and I'm, hoping that if we had an opportunity to present to you why it has become such a burden, whether that be in a small meeting next month through this committee, whatever you would recommend that, after we presented that information, that you then would be willing to have an open hearing or something where we could ask for a different resolution to be passed.
Does anyone have any response to where you know we might be able to go within this community board with our problem and we might get a resolution on the issue.
What I wanted to point out to you is that, with a little bit of research, I found out that six years, ago, in 2014 community board 11, which I believe is just south of ours, was also had a building.
If I might, I think what the committee should be doing is looking at any status from opwdd, and maybe this is an opportunity to address some of the issues that you're posing in regards to how opd is communicating with the buildings in which some of these organizations are placed and providing services, So that so that we can have in black and white what the dynamics are that are manifesting, but also how opt opwdd has responded or not, and also for us to we.
If it's a concern of what That kind of you know, it falls out of the lines of what we do as a community board.
Right, That's also very active in the community who came by and talked about issues in our building right when there's individual cases like That It's not to what there's the public policy regarding people with mental health, problems.
We community boards are a part of that process of when a unit is going to be proposed or a building that is in relation to the rights of people with disabilities.
The answer to the question issue that you're asking I mean there really may not be precedent because there's probably not too many instances where this has ever happened, But, but it has happened, and you know, as I said, community board 11.
We primarily don't want to have community options operating a group home in our building, because it's untenable, no matter how much money they could pay us, because we would just be they'd just be racking up violations from here until kingdom come so money damages are not really the issue our lawyer, I mean we'll, take them because we've incurred them, but our real goal is to try to find a place where people who need housing can get it, but not in the wrong building or type of building apartment.
That was built a few years later, and, as I said, people are experiencing first-time home ownership, and you know it's bringing life to the neighborhood.
So I think the community should have a state- You know one of the things in the resolution that you guys did pass six years.
Don't think there is any connection, and you know at the time community options, said, We'll do it no problem, but they do not take people who have some connection to washington, heights.
Don't just want people who are in need of housing to be housed, no matter what you know.
Think that's where we come in with really bringing forward a resolution that talks about those issues, right.
I think that's also been a concern for some individuals who have not been as familiar or even been informed as much about it, but that's also one of the areas in which people have been talking about they're trying to raise funds as well, while also not necessarily, you know, outlining what are the reasons for public or public entities entering into agreements with private organizations.
