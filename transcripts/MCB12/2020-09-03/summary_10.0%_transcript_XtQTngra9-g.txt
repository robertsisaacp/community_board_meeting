You know I had mentioned in an email to the committee members already I guess you call community board year, because I want to focus us on trying to establish goals for this coming year , That's a lot more different than what we've been used to the last few months before we went to break we kind of had to deal with just a lot of things going on in the community.
You know trying to get as much resolutions do as possible, and you know I want to make sure that you know, while things are still very, you know, uncertain right now for the community, the city at large, what's going to be happening with regards to many of the services that we depend on throughout our community, we're having a bit more of a kind of a broader discussion than what we've already had these past few months between march to june.
All that's been going on and find ways to try and be even more active in the community in ways in which they have already been previously Still, a community board I still want to develop that sense of community amongst us, even in committee and I want us to all be able to go around What brought you really to the housing and human services.
Social services You know even past that previous experience of three years working here in the community, with the tenants and with that I want to pass along to oc Can. You please tell us a little bit about yourself, hi guys, I actually moved to inwood about 20 years ago.
Wow went quickly so I probably moved to washington heights about the same time that oc moved to inwood about 20 years ago, from the other side of town, Heights ended up in audubon park and a great co-op and then was lucky to do that and have since gotten involved with various organizations, including community league of the heights, where I've been working with the food pantry Lately volunteering trying to set up a business improvement district couple years ago with the vaughn senate, which didn't pan out I'm a real estate residential, real estate broker by trade That oc is talking about, plus mostly resales and in this area in harlem upper west side and so forth.
Even, though I'm not on the education committee at the moment, I love the opportunity to be able to support and represent those that are constituents in our district, but over the last year or two Thank you, aisha and I, will open up So just give me a second got it so we're also trying to familiarize ourselves with you as well, and some of the other sounds good, so hi everyone good evening, so I am new to the community board I work for the uk government at the un.
Of course I want to make sure that we're getting in contact now, on my own end with some of the folks that work with the population that are without a home at this point, You know I've mentioned previously that for this year, I'm going to be reaching out to one of the policy advisors that I previously had connected with what the research they've been finding is showing about really the rate of homelessness throughout new york city, and you know, I think that for my own goals this year, I want to ensure that we have the opportunity to really actually interact with some of the homeless service homeless, shelter providers, because they are probably dealing with really just a huge influx of families either, because some of the very recent I'll call them loopholes that exist that have caused families to get vacated, whether it be because I'm not sure if people have been following new york, one they've been talking about vacate orders just from landlords refusing to actually make repairs throughout this time period that you know it's an unfortunate circumstance that that's a kind of way in which landlords are essentially forcing families out- and you know, You know the pandemic and we're being a little bit more responsive to the needs of those that particularly are in these kind of home housing situations that really are just not decent and are not livable circumstances, and is aisha, so I think that in the past, what I've tried to do when I was serving as chair is to focus not only on things within our purview, but also things that could help the board work more efficiently for us in the areas related to our purview and to support business across the board throughout the board.
The office should be basically mission control for all things on this board and most of the time they have no clue what's going on they're not doing their work, they're not doing their work, and it can be left where the weight of that and the responsibility that the culpability of that is passed on to other people when it's not their fault, that's not appropriate.
So again, those are some of the ideas that I have, but I think that also what we need to be working on is the structure within this board so that the work that we do is not in vain and so that we are taking the positions on behalf of our community, that we should be One of the things that I want to focus on in housing.
I'm kind of questioning: How is it possible that the office doesn't forward resolutions to the government officials as they should well see that that issue is one in a stack of many, not only my own personal experience, but also people in the community have come to me to express certain concerns they have when they make requests to the office that the office is responsible to do also having been a member of the executive committee, there are things like that have taken in executive that the office has dropped the ball on as well as far as making a complaint something that I'm definitely considering, but what I did do first was make sure that work was finally done, but it ended even when I finally said what's going on with this resolution and I had acts a couple of times, That resolution had not nothing was done with it Despite my asking questions about it and what one of the primary things the primary responses was to send it back to committee, and we almost redeliberated it Of course.
You know I can imagine that there's a few different issues that, whether the board members, the public committee, want to raise just my one point that I would like to raise and is the I would like to pass a resolution at some point.
So this program is focused on giving a homeless people an apartment and pay for the rent and give them an opportunity to live in a house in a home that and then that program is also attached to some social services like helping them If. Some of them have some health issues if they need to find a job.
Where do you cite a location for a city agency office oftentimes, you know even going back to what we talk about This is one of the biggest discussions that we had because often times we found that there was disproportionate impact from let's say, having sanitation, warehouses facilities being kept in certain areas of the Bronx right The housing situation is going to affect the very environment, the air, we're breathing The concern that I think has been raised in regards to this kind of fair sighting of where we put agency buildings that really serves the public Historically.
So you know I think that that's one of the areas that in which we do even within housing, human services, we do need to discuss a bit more Can we get back to kind of what the agenda that you laid out looking at the fiscal priorities and what we want to take on right?
so I don't know if there's already some sort of resolution in the pipeline Another thing I would like I've seen other community boards set up forums or panels where they invite people from, there's a great need in our community right now for clarity about where we stand on all the laws pertaining to tenant rights, Again, I'm, a tenant, defense attorney and the laws keep changing.
So people know okay, Who can I follow up with, because I do see that there's just a lot of misunderstandings about what's going on, and also a lot of anxiety surrounding that just a few other, very quick ideas, community, land trusts and again This- is something that the committee might have already addressed in the past year or two, but I am sort of involved with the northern Manhattan community land trust- Let's think creatively right now, as far as like, affordable housing and thinking of long-term solutions and bringing that conversation, especially as we're now facing the the 2021 elections, are right around the corner, we're going to see major changes as who's representing us at all levels of government here in new york, city-wide We want to make sure that if this is something that our committee feels strongly about, that wants to propose that we that we're kind of like that we have something solidified and in writing, because then we can maybe put that out there and just get that conversation and you know, renters rights, I do believe that we need to have a conversation about supporting people becoming first-time homebuyers My father himself he's low income he's lived in new york city for since he was 17 years.
We should certainly protect renters, but also have a conversation about how do we build wealth in our own communities and that's where the community land trust comes in too, but I'm also thinking of people actually owning being becoming homeowners and demystifying like that process for people Those are just some of the ideas I wanted to share with the committee is to amend the administrator code of the city of new york that pertains to the right to council and again it's not necessarily changing the law by just kind of expediting it and rolling it out, On a on a quicker basis, so people have coverage as they're facing potential eviction right, and we would obviously need funding for that.
I want to make sure that we are looking at that and having an understanding of how that's manifesting, how effective that is, making sure that there's no hardship in that area and what the necessity is for that Let's see the census, we're already deep into the census, which is almost done, but I wanted to look at the digital divide and the concerns that I spoke to people at the new school It's, something that I've worked on for many years when the housing act was passed last year.
I would not like to see that continue incarceration reentry for those who are leaving the jail system Previously his office came to speak to the committee It's, basically, so that people who have been renters for decades would be able to get credits for the fact that they have paid their rent on time, just as people who own a house do and are able to have that put on their credit so that those people can be home owners and it probably can be handled in the same vein of what edda is talking about.
But the intention there now that the resolution has gone forward to the elected officials was to build a coalition of the institutions in our community who serve the those who are immigrants to make sure that there's a across-the-board cohesive plan ideas and supports for that community, and it goes also hand in hand with the work that you did last year or before we left session ariel in regards to the impact on immigrants as well.
Sally hi, everybody I've been a member of this particular community world for 35 years, so everything that I've been listening to I have heard many times, but and I hope that you will contribute a lot to our community to our community world mike What's the point of information I would like to know if there is an issue on the new business that we like to discuss as part of our the lower part of washington heights, a new construction, a new proposed building on a57, riverside drive, I saw that was part of the agenda.
So much aria is that if you tell me about the building, 857 riverside drive, I think that you are aware of the issue Is that going to be on the the agenda tonight or maybe in the future, we're both allowing for you know each individual group to speak to us towards the end in the new business.
, what's going to happen once these high-rise buildings get built and the landlords get 3 500 4 000 a month in rent and other landlords in the neighborhood figure out that they could be getting the same amount of money in rent and start paying people to move out of their rental units or harass them out If the committee has any plans for how to go about addressing those situations when they arise, It's, not an if it's a when they arise, and the other comment that I want to make is that the community, washington, heights and inwood has been besieged by noise levels that have been unprecedented in the history of washington heights and inwood, which have always had have always really struggled with noise levels in the summer.
So I, if you were looking previously at the excel sheet and I'm on the capitals crystal year, 20 capital sheet I, always forget the exact abbreviation but essentially meaning that it is continuously essentially trying to be spent on where essentially they're working on that item previously, depending on what's happened with that individual item, let's say that you know the rehabilitation of the subway station at 181st right 'll, give a moment just to make sure we're all on the same page here, but it's also that email, yes, that was shared with the committee Thank, one of our former committee chairs for his work on this They had been focused on trying to ensure that they got the funding so as to rehabilitate those buildings and so and actually sorry, aisha, 20, capital?
It creates a barrier for some individuals seeking service, and so one of the items that we suggested last year as an expense was really putting forward more programming within what was the dwdc shelter that had been specifically set up for youth that perhaps might have left their homes recently, given the kind of environment they were in coming either whether it be coming out to their families as part of the lgbtq plus community, or perhaps you know not, you know not necessarily conforming to a certain identity and I think that was an item that was just a huge concern at the time for I.
Let's say getting that first item the renovation, even though that's technically cs now right or the perhaps funding of long overdue capital repairs for NYCHA buildings If. You know you want to be able to vote on as a committee member I'll note it down now, but if perhaps you would want to then wait and review the district needs statement, I'm hearing the dead silence, so from committee members I'm going to take the sorry, marielle, Yes and again not sure if this is the appropriate way to raise this as a new community board, member?
You know kind of make, take decisions on this as a as a committee, so just wanted to raise that and for those of you who have been doing this for some time if there are any kind of resources or places that I should be looking I think for I mean my first year doing this Again I will be asking the office for the more updated fiscal year.
Okay I'm really hoping that this committee and the board can help the people in our building, who are really suffering and experiencing a lot of problems because of community options.
What I, ultimately hope for is that the board would be willing to reconsider the previous resolution that it made six years ago approving community options to have the two units in our building, because now we have six years of documented experience showing that this has not been a good situation for any of the parties involved, that something really has to be done to change it and I'm, hoping that if we had an opportunity to present to you why it has become such a burden, whether that be in a small meeting next month through this committee.
So I hear the concerns the opwdd office has purview over that and generally, when we are reviewing that in the community, I mean in the community board, yes or no, whether we support it, We have been We, have an attorney who's, also representing us with them What I wanted to point out to you is that, with a little bit of research, I found out that six years ago, in 2014 community board 11, which I believe is just south of ours, was also had a building I think it's 555 lenox avenue, which, by coincidence our property manager also manages that is totally coincidence.
We would really like the community board to back us up and give us the hearing, and then you know, take a new look at your old resolution or make a new resolution that says: there's really saturation in the neighborhood or saturation in the building and two units with three people but before we get the outcome, we have to have a way to present our situation a place and a way to say what we need to say: Oh, if I might I think what the committee should be doing is looking at any status from opwdd, and maybe this is an opportunity to address some of the issues that you're posing in regards to how opd is communicating with the buildings in which some of these organizations are placed and providing services so that so that we can have in black and white what the dynamics are that are manifesting, but also how opt opwdd has responded or not, and also for us to we If you were able to have a resolution.
If it's a concern of what that kind of you know, it falls out of the lines of what we do as a community board right , That's, also very active in the community who came by and talked about issues in our building right when there's individual cases like that It's not to what there's the public policy regarding people with mental health problems.
An example of that is when we vote on the eulip process in this regard for opwdd, we community boards are a part of that process of when a unit is going to be proposed or a building that is in relation to the rights of people with disabilities to have housing.
We primarily don't want to have community options operating a group home in our building, because it's untenable, no matter how much money they could pay us, because we would just be they'd just be racking up violations from here until kingdom come so money damages are not really the issue our lawyer has I mean we'll take them because we've incurred them, but our real goal is to try to find a place where people who need housing can get it, but not in the wrong building or type of building apartment building.
