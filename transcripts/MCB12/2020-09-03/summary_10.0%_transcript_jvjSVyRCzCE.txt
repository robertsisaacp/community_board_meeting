You know at least with some thoughts out of my head, but you know: isidro is involved with a lot of different business organizations in the community and One question about the re:: it's a good idea to do it jointly with the business development committee, but they've already met this month, so it pushes this back.
We come back sort of I sort of have a brazo draft written book here, but you know I was about to volunteer, but I think the appropriate volunteer is to help mary with the work that she's already done.
You know the concept I think mary should read out what she's drafted so that we have some idea of what we're voting on.
I can do that, so I started out with, whereas Covid-19 19 created a hardship for everyone causing businesses to close, whereas when businesses were allowed to reopen, restrictions were put in place for everyone's safety, masks, social distancing, limited number of people inside etc, whereas these restrictions created unusually long lines of people waiting to enter grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, post, offices, etc, whereas seniors and disabled, are unable to wait or stand for an unusually long period of time in lines, creating a severe hardship on them being able to meet their needs.
I was writing this in the park yesterday, when I was sitting in the park that was perfect, The only thing I would think is perhaps instead of skip, you might say something like be prioritized to enter first or something, I was just gonna say that I think it sounds better to say that seniors and disabled people be given priority in the line.
The first question, on my mind, is okay, which is the closest center that we have I've heard about this one, I think, is on port washington on 163rd, but I'm right, Maybe.
If I could get a listing, and maybe especially my building, I, don't think that we're very familiar with that, and maybe I could put up a flyer and just letting people know no idea.
We're not allowed to have in-person meetings right now, but it's good to have the information and the background for when everything does completely reopen mary and that sort of speaks to what you, when you said before, about issues of seniors participating in this meeting.
Coming to the aging committee, I, mean, I, think the issue of technology is just an across-the-board issue and even in terms of the senior centers and people being able to connect to virtual programs, you know one of one of our members mentioned a tablet to me: And it's designed, especially for seniors, so I went on their website.
Can we get devices to seniors and how can we, you know, offer ways and help people learn how to use the devices, So I think that one is an important one that I am working on in several ways, but the other approach is making the phone more usable.
I first found out about it because of friends in israel, but I found out that the seniors use it to call all over the world and it has a video feature It enables people to connect and see each other through the phone without necessarily needing a device that they can't afford to maintain.
You know junior high school You know, there's an additional expense and things like that, What's hopefully, going to be successful mary in addition to the senior centers.
Okay and many are confined to their rooms because of the Covid-19 You know if people have magazines or books to contribute or anything that you think that the seniors might use, or if anybody wants to make a contribution.
Four increase funding for transportation for seniors by restoring prior budget cuts to expand access and outreach number five increase access and outreach to healthy food programs for seniors with medical and health related needs.
You know in the back thoughts of a lot of people that are involved with the norks and Now fairview avenue I mean Ferry, is sorry.
But actually nobody knows right now where the state or city are going to make their cuts.
Then, number, five increase access to out and outreach to healthy food programs for seniors with medical and health related needs, for how was that the food distribution and whatever is going because I know that my was eliminated.
The real question for us, as a committee would be if we want that food issue to be higher up in our expense request, because that's sort of where we can weigh in I It was more about medical and health related needs, but I don't see why we couldn't include right.
I think you know when, in terms of our seniors, getting the get food, those who were registered or those who were grandfathered into the get food program, countless complaints during the course of the whole pandemic, many fewer complaints when we were still able to provide, grab and go, and we were also our sender-- was able to deliver, and it seems that that's been the biggest issue.
You think before mental health, meaning even if you could maybe right, because in other words this is something that's across the board.
It is and listening to all the people, There are lots of people out lots of seniors out there who don't have a friend like mary and the issue is even more isolation there Then it cuts across because you have the isolation and then.
It's, tough, all right, so back to increase access and outreach to healthy food programs for seniors with medical and health.
My my evening, chocolate works for me: okay, [Laughter], all right, new business, I'm concerned about november 3rd and how we are trying to deal with the seniors that are homebound to help them to fill out absentee ballots for the election.
I have a whole bunch of applications and since the senior centers are not open, I just don't know how to reach those people.
The northern Manhattan agenda, as a group has decided on september 17th, as voter registration drive day And We are going to have a table out in front of Our. Three senior centers nimik is going to have a table out in front of its facility on wadsworth and 175th cloth, dwdc They're, doing something, I'm concerned about the homebound, not the people who are walking on the street, and you know up and down broadway and san nicolas avenue.
If you give me a list of people that you want absentee ballots dropped off to, we can make that happen with transportation One day I mean the last monday, the numbers of people that we you know we helped to fill out.
