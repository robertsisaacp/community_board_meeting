We go to a committee that we don't belong to like last night I signed in on boss committee : Let me who's going to give you the name of the people who attended the meeting and they are the attendees for that committee You remember, you know the designing sheet that we have that have committee members and then on the site has or board members that attend.
One is because I've been physically impaired and not able to use two hands to type, because I had total shoulder replacement in my left, shoulder at the end of july As far as the agenda goes today, it's some repetitive stuff, but I've look looked into the question about the long lines: businesses, banks, post offices, etc and, as discussed in our other meetings, I spoke to domingo estebas, who felt that it was important for the seniors to have priority in those lines.
We have business groups, and we have you know, chamber of commerce and since, like apple, how much cloud do they have in all the businesses and not just the business that they are members of well They , don't really have clout so to speak, but they have the ability to get the word out and make it an important ask and I'm pretty sure that isidro had mentioned that there is an inwood merchants association, because I believe he was working with them on some of the bid projects.
The business improvement agency That way I think we have one- is headed by one standard cloth and the other one is up by 207th street or diamond but you know: isidro is involved with a lot of different business organizations in the community and I think- The one question about the re:: it's a good idea to do it jointly with the business development committee, but they've already met this month, so it pushes this back.
The letter you know the concept I think mary should read out what she's drafted so that we have some idea of what we're voting on so I started out with, whereas Covid-19 19 created a hardship for everyone causing businesses to close, whereas when businesses were allowed to reopen, restrictions were put in place for everyone's safety masks, social distancing, limited number of people inside etc, whereas these restrictions created unusually long lines of people waiting to enter grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, post offices, etc, whereas seniors and disabled are unable to wait or stand for an unusually long period of time in lines, creating a severe hardship on them being able to meet their needs.
We're not allowed to have in-person meetings right now, but it's good to have the information and the background for when everything does completely reopen mary and that sort of speaks to what you when you said before about issues of seniors participating in this meeting Coming to the aging committee, I mean I.
Think the issue of technology is just an across-the-board issue and even in terms of the senior centers and people being able to connect to virtual programs, you know How can we get devices to seniors and how can we, you know, offer ways and help people learn how to use the devices so I would say.
You know junior high school You know there's an additional expense and things like that, and what's hopefully going to be successful mary in addition to the senior centers Okay and many are confined to their rooms because of the Covid-19 You know if people have magazines or books to contribute or anything that you think that the seniors might use or if anybody wants to make a contribution.
Do that, let's just one more time review what I have down for c, which is reviewing the capital and expense budget listings that we, the ratings, that we actually did back in June they're gonna ask us to submit these next month, so the capital budget items we decided to re-re-prioritize them number one being a system-wide upgrade of various senior centers That seems to be really critical in terms of connecting people with the outside world We said that should be number one number two renovate existing or build replacement senior centers as necessary to comply with ada and difter regs fern is the expert on those We still have centers in our community that are not accessible, , Number, three I'm, sorry and three to provide funding to construct affordable, accessible housing for seniors.
There were a decrease in available funding, I would say they're, avoiding food, multiple factors, one is that seniors are moving out of the neighborhood, which the newark eligible eligibility actually relates to the percentage of seniors in a building or in an area That funding can be affected, not to mention state and city budget cuts, which are also huge, but I haven't, heard anything specific about norks Thoughts of a lot of people that are involved with the norks and Now fairview avenue I mean ferry is sorry They thinking of combining that services with other services within the senior centers in our area?
The federal government doesn't come up with money to support us, so maybe a letter, a letter be sent to the assembly person from the 72nd, which is like and the one that you are mentioning and for george and the other can be added to our budget, because it's a city and controlled by the city council members But then one was a letter and one is entered as a priorities for one You know for our committee right now then number five increase access to out and outreach to healthy food programs for seniors with medical and health related needs, for how was that the food distribution and whatever is going because I know that my was eliminated Evidently difta is looking at a whole lot of possibilities to bring food back to the senior center's provision, but they haven't resolved it.
The real question for us as a committee would be if we want that food issue to be higher up in our expense request, because that's sort of where we can weigh in I It was more about medical and health related needs, but I don't see why we couldn't include right.
You know we're facing strong mental health issues before the pandemic, You think before mental health, meaning even if you could maybe right, because in other words this is something that's across the board.
She's on facebook, but I know her from the community and from the organizations that I've been in You know she's disabled, but she gets food, delivered, It's, tough, all right so back to increase access and outreach to healthy food programs for seniors with medical and health related issues.
My my evening, chocolate works for me, okay, [Laughter], all right new business I'm concerned about november 3rd and how we are trying to deal with the seniors that are homebound to help them to fill out absentee ballots for the election.
