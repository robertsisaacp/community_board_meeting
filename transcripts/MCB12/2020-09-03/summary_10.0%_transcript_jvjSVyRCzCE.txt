Like last night, Because I heard Wayne Benjamin saying to you give me: Let me who's going to give you the name of the people who attended the meeting.
Isidro is involved with a lot of different business organizations in the community and I think- : it's a good idea to do it jointly with the Business Development committee, but they've already met this month.
You know we're just wasting time right, so maybe a letter from Isidro and you maybe and that can be forward to the to the business organization up here.
You know the concept I think Mary should read out what she's drafted so that we have some idea of what we're voting on.
I can do that, so I started out with, whereas Covid-19 created a hardship for everyone causing businesses to close, whereas when businesses were allowed to reopen, restrictions were put in place for everyone's safety, masks, social Distancing, limited number of people inside etc, whereas these restrictions created unusually long lines of people waiting to enter grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, post, offices, etc, whereas seniors and disabled, are unable to wait or stand for an unusually long period of time in lines, creating a severe hardship on them being able to meet their needs.
I was writing this in the park yesterday, when I was sitting in the park that was perfect, The only thing I would think is perhaps instead of skip, you might say something like be prioritized to enter first or something I was just going to say that I think it sounds better to say that seniors and disabled people be given priority in the line.
Maybe, you like the color, I, like the color You, know future meetings and seniors in the community being unable to join meetings due to lack of equipment, technology, skills, etc.
Maybe you have some ideas since your mother, you said your mother was going to join in on Yahoo or on Youtube So I ideas I'm up here, just to learn the process, but in regards to ideas, I, do see that I do understand that it is difficult for people of the that are older to communicate via zoom and via whatever any other means other than the regular phone right.
The first question, on my mind, is okay, which is the closest center that we have I've heard about this one, I think, is on port Washington on 163Rd, but I'm right, Maybe.
If I could get a listing-- and maybe especially my building, I- do not think that we're very familiar with that, and maybe I could put up a flyer and just letting people know no idea.
Think the issue of technology is just an acrosss- the- board issue and even in terms of the senior centers and people being able to connect to virtual programs.
Can we get devices to seniors and how can we, you know, offer ways and help people learn how to use the devices, So I think that one is an important one that I am working on in several ways, but the other approach is making the phone more usable.
I first found out about it because of friends in Israel, but I found out that the seniors use it to call all over the world and it has a video feature It enables people to connect and see each other through the phone without necessarily needing a device that they can't afford to maintain.
Okay and many are confined to their rooms because of the Covid-19 You know if people have magazines or books to contribute or anything that you think that the seniors might use or if anybody wants to make a contribution.
Four increase funding for transportation for seniors by restoring prior budget cuts to expand access and outreach number five increase access and outreach to healthy food programs for seniors with medical and health related needs.
We could do that with a letter, but actually nobody knows right, now, where the state or city are going to make their cuts.
Then, number, five increase access to out and outreach to healthy food programs for seniors with medical and health related needs, for how was that the food distribution and whatever is going because I know that my was eliminated, so I'm not giving food anymore.
The real question for us as a committee would be if we want that food issue to be higher up in our expense request, because that's sort of where we can weigh in Mary, I or it It was more about medical and health related needs, but I do not see why we could not include right.
I think you know when, in terms of our seniors, getting the get food, those who were registered or those who were grandfathered into the get food program, countless complaints during the course of the whole pandemic, many fewer complaints when we were still able to provide, grab and go- And, we were also our sender- was able to deliver, and it seems that that's been the biggest issue.
You think before mental health, meaning even if you could maybe right, because in other words this is something that's acrosss.
You know, who may be less likely to have other people around or who are not as savvy or able to engage the way.
There are lots of people out lots of seniors out there who do not have a friend like Mary, and the issue is even more isolation there Then it cuts acrosss, because you have the isolation and then.
It's tough, all right so back to increase access and outreach to healthy food programs for seniors with medical and health.
This is for food And I do not think you want to separate medical needs from mental health.
I have a whole bunch of applications and since the senior centers are not open, I just do not know how to reach those people.
The northern Manhattan agenda, as a group has decided on September 17th as voter registration drive day and We are going to have a table out in front of our three senior centers.
If you give me a list of people that you want absentee ballots dropped off to, we can make that happen with transportation One day I mean the last Monday the numbers of people that we you know we helped to fill out.
These are not in senior centers, so Where I mean I'm trying to reach out to anybody that I know.
You know 165 right 165 and for what's in the camera, a lot of people are waiting for the the the bus that they wait.
