There are so many people that we really need to do the right thing, for, and that really means to stay home if you're, sick, we're face covering when you're in public really do not gather in large crowds with people who are not your immediate family members, because we're seeing that this is as a result of this behavior we're seeing significant increases in cases, and We want everyone to go, get tested so that the data is as accurate as possible, and the reason why we want people to get tested is so that we can really go and mitigate and prevent these clusters from spreading into larger community transmission and where we have to revert back to the beginning of this pandemic.
I mean we've got more cases, but the number of people who have died from Covid-19 in all four of our zip codes appears to have remained stable, at least for the last month or so, and if we do not seem to have had any additional deaths which which at least is you know much better than where we were just a few months.
I've been getting a lot of feedback from community boards and community members about why our statistics and our data are based on we're talking about rate based on a number of a hundred thousand per like per population or whatever, because each neighborhood in each zip code obviously does not have a hundred thousand people.
I. Think we've requested to our data team, to like include like a chart, maybe on our website, explain the difference between actual number and rate.
What's caused confusion among folks when they're looking at our data page I have to say that you know I'm going to hear your report tonight, because you're saying that in zip, code, 40 there's a downward trend, because the story yesterday seemed to suggest that we might be at some kind of critical stage with an uptick in in the percentage of reported cases.
Let us know, because that's where we can deploy resources to whether it's educational materials, whether it's actual face coverings for folks to wear, I, would say: important, I would say just one thing: I noticed, and it was like Park is often during the summer.
I, think typically, where outdoor spaces are okay, as long as people do continue to do their social distancing and wearing face coverings around folks who are not your immediate family, members, who've been in the same household with, but if you're having parties birthday parties in the park, I mean that still, you know, could elevate the chances of transmission to that group of folks.
Far up to this point, where we are now seeing these large gatherings we're seeing like venues where having parties indoors with no face coverings- I, do not know if this has already been covered, but in Inwood Hill park, there's been very little mask wearing very little social distancing.
It's, a group of city inspectors from multiple agencies, where they're being asked to do work to go out to educate folks, but also to do you know the indoor, dining inspections, the outdoor, dining inspections, making sure that everybody is following these social distances.
That is creating an issue, because not only do we have resources that the state has had resources allocated for inspections of those industries So for restaurants, specifically there's the power of the SLA and there's you know specific dedicated folks from the state and the city who could be deployed to do inspections and issue fines and do all of that and take away liquor licenses if they are creating a situation where people are gathering And they're, not following any of the guidelines for reopening when it comes to knocking down doors in people's homes.
I. Just do not think that we would have the capacity to go to individual house parties, but what we could do would be to work on educating, specific demographics and so earlier on in the summer when we were seeing young folks going out- And, you know going to sidewalk bars.
Where we're seeing clusters in certain neighborhoods, you know we're dedicating those resources to those neighborhoods and we're really trying to figure out specifically what you know what people are saying on the ground level: And we're coming across a lot of people reluctant to get testing whether it's because they are still afraid of a test and trace and having contact, tracers called them.
You know people are very fearful of law enforcement, and so we want to make that messaging very clear that none of your information will be forwarded to ice.
You know just because you test positive for Covid-19 Does not mean it's going to impact your citizenship.
Hearing on social media goes counter to everything that we, as a public health agency, is saying so like we are trying to combat all of those things, and I.
Certain folks are never going to listen to what the New York City, Health Department is going to say, and so we really need those partners we're not talking about young kids, Either we're talking about we're talking about 30 40 50 year old people right , not they have jobs, they work.
You know they're, like sort of like regular people, but they are on the street not wearing masks close up drinking.
So I would like to know how much would it cost, or could we investigate that the police, the 34th precinct, be so the patrol cars be supplied with effective decibel meters, because one thing that holds them back from actually issuing summons or dealing with this problem is that they have to have effective decibel meters so that they can say well.
If you know the Department of Health is able to do anything about that or work with BLP So I mean that again is being coordinated under the mayor's office of special enforcement.
In, my area, I live in Every single restaurant has outdoor tables You know all of the coughing and breathing and whatever that you're already on top of each other, is going to be exacerbated, okay, all right, anyone else from from the committee or the board.
So, in regards to what pauline was just saying before about elected officials, doing outreach and trying to educate people in the neighborhood So I just wanted to say that I had called Mark Levine's office.
We've been doing this since February now it's time for the local government to enforce, and he said if mayor De Blasio, he did not mention his name, but I know that's who he was talking about if he does not want to step up to the plate.
All of the places of concern, and I will definitely reach out to the mayor's office, and maybe we can work together on a you know, day of action, where there's dedicated resources to your community, specifically, so that we can get that information out there and really change minds and hearts and hopefully get people to behave a little bit.
It's a public health initiative to fight Covid-19 so that where new yorkers can get back to school back to work, so that way the businesses and other organizations can reopen safely.
When it comes to the tracing part, the contact tracer, it's very important that when people see a phone, call, And I know you guys mentioned it earlier when they see a phone call that says NYC Test& Trace, that they pick up the phone because most likely it's a contact, racer calling them to share that they've been exposed to someone who has you know has tested positive for cover, 19.
They we've been having that department's been doing really well with you know, reaching out to people and getting in contact with the contacts, and just you know, making sure that they're staying home so, like I mentioned, take care is the third step during your isolation period.
You know support in general, and it has been like one of the most gratifying parts of our of our job: The tracing you're, doing the follow- up step afterwards, when people are isolated, you're reaching out to the to them to see what they need to make them so they'll be comfortable and have have the ability to to handle being by themselves or being isolated for ten to four You're, not asking them to disclose any private information or there's no reason for them to be fearful of talking to you, because all you're doing is giving them help.
Some people are not open to the idea of receiving help from anyone that they know so.
All right Jenelle is the community affairs Associated Columbia University Irving medical center I will be sending in a follow- up report to Steve, and he can then disseminate the information to everyone in the committee and to the wider board.
Well, I see you actually watch the the debate We're inviting health policy experts to shine a light on the issues that you know: Yeah, so even balanced, helpful and hopefully informative discussion and the public will be invited to ask questions as well.
I do want to point out that you know I've been checking the the state Health Department reports and the latest one from yesterday indicates that, as you mentioned.
We actually talked about this in our committee this morning and we were in agreement to leave this issue on your budget, help, with the hope that you would add a statement, something that we came up with or something similar to it, so that the seniors would be included in this mental health.
I. Think the people with severe mental illness are probably the most impacted because they have not had access to inpatient care, so I would not want to elevate one population.
So I would like to let me try to work on this by the time of the General Board, Meeting or the public.
There are more people impact with more seniors impacted I'm, going to work it in Okay, number.
It's not, but I think, there's people that are going to be suffering from the impact of it for a long time that yeah they need services that do not currently exist, but it also makes you more susceptible to Covid-19, though.
We're asking the city to provide access to healthy food for populations that need, including you know, the elderly, including families, including those without so is that more funding for food, pantries?
I would actually put the pest control above it Has control above Yes, okay, I would like to argue for either the noise enforcement or for the Trash Basket collection.
I, mean, I think, and the noise enforcement has been the biggest issue this summer.
Think you make a good point, because what we're suggesting here is that that the noise enforcement be be provided by DEP, which is not really the answer to our question in our community with what happened under this problem.
My you know, I think, maybe the other side of the broadway wo, not the new rezoned area mean it unfortunately Provided for a a study that was going to point out where new water mains might be needed.
If we're going to declare it Healthcare, Hero's way, we should know how many people's lives were actually saved.
