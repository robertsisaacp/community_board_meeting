And, he said he'll keep trying and hopefully we can get him in, but I do not know if you can start recording because we're going to get started.
You know we can look out for that next month, but the committee business today we're going to hear from we.
Then we're going to hear from Steven Eisenbach, who has been very active and we've been working with him for a while now actually on advocating for the small Business Job Survival Act of Sbjsa, which would you know if it were to pass, would provide some much needed protections for our small business owners and here.
What this program is, what it's doing, hopefully next month, we'll be able to have someone from D.O.T to come and talk with us about that program and anything that our business needs to know and for us to better educate them and any potential you know challenges they may experience as a result of that.
I do not know who would go first, John or pauline, you all choose, and I'm going to prefer to have more for him to give for the update, because I believe he is doing a lot on the ground level.
So just so you know, if we hit, if we hit three percent, then the city and the state, the city, the city of New York, has said that as a as the threshold where decisions will be reviewed in terms of closing schools, closing businesses in certain areas where that is happening.
You know hundreds of city workers to go down on the ground and try to really get in the community, distribute flyers and sort of stay there every day and just sort of be there and providing information ready to answer questions.
Are you looking at different languages to talk to like business in terms of just like how to communicate to businesses, because the concerns that businesses may have my is very different from maybe you know the concerns or the challenges that individuals are having around distancing and things like that, because what's happening is obviously as you as you mentioned, you know.
You know how to communicate with them in a way that sort of addresses their particular unique challenges around this issue.
Then we already we identified and understood that essential workers and essential businesses, you know, were going to be really critical.
What we knew more recently about masks, and things like that, so you know once that changed and we try to make sure we get that word out to people and so on and so forth, but I think so.
I. Think, our colleagues are, for example, at small Business, services, New York, City SBS.
There are some of there's some documentation, that's very specifically targeted towards businesses, small businesses, restaurants and the like, including some of the decals, but I think this is part of the reason why we wanted to be here.
One is to kind of give you the information, the update that Dr Manonda provided, but also to kind of create an opening between us and you that, when you do have ideas like what you have indicated, that you want to be able to ensure that businesses, organizations that are in your in your catchment area, how they can best be provided.
I mean one of the things that we have been doing in some of the other spaces that we have been working with is to get with a business or trade organization, and we kind of make that connection with them.
We've also had this conversation with them, trying to talk target the messaging that we are getting out to them, so they have been helpful, but knowing that I know that a lot of different businesses in front of this committee and you're able to speak to some of their small businesses directly themselves.
You know in businesses like what you mentioned gyms and other places, but some of it is also what they call super spreader events or just events where the virus is able to go from one person to another and to another to another in relatively short order, because people stay in crowded areas, together.
Exercise do not want to wear the mask, but you know for them to be in the gym.
It can't be like how it used to be when every single treadmill and every single you know piece of equipment right next to each other in tight spaces and everyone is and each one of them is being used.
We know it's not always easy, but encouraging the business community that you know, guidance, has been provided in terms of the reopening and some of I knew we've done, presentations to businesses in, in particular in East and West Harlem around the reopening guidance and things like that.
If folks are able to stay in keeping with those guidance and enforce that you know just from the business standpoint, I think you know that there may be.
Most of the time you know, I, think that's where the issue that we're seeing is.
You want to see whether or not there's a lot of individuals that you may know that are utilizing that space.
We just want to just want to warn just as I said, before, be able to open up a means and method of communication between us and the committee Us and the abundant, but specifically that we are able to help as much as possible in terms of making sure that resources are going to the places that they are needed.
So I just wanted to offer our support in terms of gathering together the agencies that deal with business reopening, because I know that we are often here at the DOHMH, often asked a lot of questions about business and restaurant reopening specifically and unfortunately.
You know whether it's department of consumer and worker protection or small business services and the mayor's office of special enforcement.
You know we're hearing lots of questions about whether these structures are legal and how many people are allowed in there, and all of these questions are absolutely things that should be addressed.
I'm, just sort of curious in terms of you know the partner that we were able to work with.
They have to be targeted very specifically to the individuals within that community, so we were able to have grants of a variety of organizations in certain parts of the city, including upper Manhattan, including in the Washington Heights in Malaya, and so there are a few organizations that we have partnered just do not not calling the names at the moment, but it's also to let you know that we are looking to work with other partners.
This question I meant to ask you know the city started a new program about open storefronts, which is for retailers to be able to utilize space outside of their stores.
I, wanted to ask if you know.
I believe that program is going to be in effect, but you know it could get really busy around Christmas.
So now on our agenda, we're going to talk to about the small Business, Job, Survival, act.
We start seeing a horrific amount of empty storefronts blocks of you, know: high-end neighborhoods, like Madison Avenue, empty storefronts, everywhere, and it's all caused by real estate speculation and the problem that we have that the landlords have figured out how to make more money, not renting the storefront than renting it.
Under the table not repeated and, like I said you know.
You know these small businesses and the diversity of neighborhoods that is all being destroyed.
It made the situation much worse, I like to think, of course, that every crisis offers an opportunity, and my hope is to get momentum pad before we get hit, get it back up and running again and get this bill passed once and for all, because now more than ever, New York City needs sbjs.
Let his office know that you need some action, whether it is the levin bill, whether it is the small Business, Job, Survival, Act. So people know who are new to the committee.
I know time is going, but I just wanted us to sort of just be aware that of this program.
In case people on the committee were not aware of the open, storefronts program, so I just wanted to throw that out.
I am working on getting DOT to come before us to answer any questions about that and any implications or any anything that we need to know to educate our businesses.
So I know we already have open restaurants and people utilizing the streets for that.
Things like that, so I just wanted to see what people thought about.
You know is this something we want to engage and address in terms of what the addition of this open storefront will mean.
I was initially a little concerned about noise from businesses, in other words, I'm, putting out speakers to bring people over towards the things, but I've seen none of it.
You know there are any concerns or we have businesses being impacted from enforcement of it as well.
It might be a good idea for if you know, I, won't see what the committee thinks about that.
You know like there are major things that come up, whether it's women's history month or whatever.
You, know just state that we acknowledge that this is what do people think any thoughts.
Maybe we need to vote or something I guess to say if you know to create this proclamation that we're going to do a proclamation just acknowledging appreciation for our small businesses, especially in this time of this current challenge, that we appreciate them and we acknowledge them and on behalf of the Business Development Committee and committee boards.
I want to bring this up in business to me, because we have a strong business, small business representation on this task force to you, know, because they have been heavily impacted by the noise issue and it's good to have their perspective, and.
