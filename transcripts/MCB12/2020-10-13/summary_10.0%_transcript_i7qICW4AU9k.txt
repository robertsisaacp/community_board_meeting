Know: iron pace pyramids with the fountains going, and that was that was the first and only time I've been to Paris The story with this particular chateau, which spans the river one side of the river was in Nazi occupied France and the other part, want to either get invited to dinner or to parties and kind of basically sneak out the back.
You know: I learned after the last lens meeting that the Fort Washington Branch of the New York public library, was added to the national register of historic places.
You know, quite supportive of historic, designation A bit we're going to have an update on the discussion of the 857 Riverside project that we discussed.
So first I'd like to you know, welcome or maybe welcome back because I think HTC has been with us before on a few occasions, simeon Vancouver from the historic Districts Council to speak with us about the Fort Washington Branch New, York public library register, with the listing with the register of historic, places.
But one of the only good things about this ridiculous sort of situation we find ourselves in is that this way, I can actually come to community board meetings and then commute downstairs to my kitchens to make dinner rather than having to get out of a train or something like that at 11 o'clock at night.
We are a not- for, profit, independent organization that works with over 500 neighborhood- based groups throughout New York City, to enhance, protect and celebrate the physical characters of their historic areas and buildings.
We, have worked in your community a bit with vivian and with Wayne as part of the Audubon terrace Historic district expansion, efforts and celebration of that, and also Inwood, of course, was actually our first one of our first classes of the six to celebrate.
A, later class of that was actually picking up an internally generated program of the historic Districts Council, which was the celebration of the Carnegie libraries of New York.
Definitely the last in Manhattan The way the Carnegie system, the Carnegie grants worked, was the city had to put up the money for acquisition of the land, and then the Carnegie foundation would pay for the actual building of the building.
Very beautiful science person knows every religious property in the five boroughs and beyond Did. We thank him for doing the work to get this on the national register?
I just want you and everyone else to know that both the land, Use Committee and the board as a whole has been very supportive of historic designation and have actually passed a couple of resolutions to that.
Unless they, you know just say, National, Reserve, historic places and like a little seal.
Ask Tim Anderson who, as you know, from the September meeting, is the planning Rep with the borrower President's office, who works with CB12?
I. Think Wayne, as you know, with the questions that you sent to us central to what happens with 857, really depends on this wide street designation, and it has been a little difficult to get a response out of DOB and DCP to an extent of what exactly the dimensions of the street are, because I you know, as we've discussed and with the photos that you shared with me earlier, this week, you know there's.
This week, still waiting for her to get back to me on the sliver law question because I, you know obviously like it's a matter of the wide street, and I think we have a meeting that we're trying to you know get in the works to try and figure out what the borough president's office role would be in the discussion on the city, map.
What DLB is saying in its you know, determination of the street, with it's counting, basically from you, know, street wall to street wall, so The lower drive, which is actually a two- way street that was actually built before the upper drive based on Matthew Spacey's research, then there's the upper drive, but between the two is, you know, part of a city park, and last month someone pointed out.
It's not the same as saying you're going to take the park, land and Say. It's part of the street and measure that so I do not know Tim or Steve.
It took that securities route on what we call the lower drive that upper portion- So, the book, the neighborhood, that Manhattan forgot or New York City forgot, and we did for historic, Districts Council a sort of a video discussion that I moderated for him So he's done a lot of research on the area going back to when this was John, Audubon's state and before- He pointed out to me after the September meeting based on his research.
You've got the top of the retaining wall, which people use basically, as a bench, But, then you're looking into maybe the second or third floor windows of the buildings acrosss the street.
Al has been squatting there since he sold the house at the end of last year, but he's been told that by October 15th, that's eight days from now he has to be out We are working right now with Wendy olivo from Al Taylor's office and an attorney to try to make sure that nothing illegal happens because evictions are stopped.
Last month's meeting about you, know, iniquities, inequities and ignoring history of the african- american population in New, York It was built as the we're trying to find out exactly whether it was the home or an additional house built by the fellow who built the refinery, so we're digging a little deeper, but it was certainly owned by him.
Development, history of people seizing on famous names to boost the values of what they're, building on smack and selling Actually in his book, and we might want to ask Matthew had or has a map of You know the houses that were you know, built on the Ottawa, state, and I believe this area was literally like acrosss the street from yeah, The people who live there refer to it as Audubon park as well.
Sometime last year we started speaking with Laurie from Council congressman rather about two initiatives in Inwood, one of which was a Inwood apartment house district Going back to when I first joined the the community board, as well as a non- Contiguous, historic district, that is, you know, related to sort of the history and culture of the dominican immigrants in the area, and we were, I see, Laura Tobias has joined us.
We are looking for better ways to improve what we are doing and what we are doing is to try to create a historic memory of the dominican people in a place where they have recited persistently and consistently for over a hundred years.
It's sort of like show to you, the significance of the dominican people in the U.S, and You know, sort of like a graphic image of the dominican people in the United States, and we go from 1613, which is the first recorded immigrant actually in in New York City, and what is today Manhattan and New York City, and this is Juan Rodriguez and of course you know the story about him and from there from one dominican that we know we go to Ellis Island and the reason why we stopped in Arizona It's, because this is a a part away of a national history.
It happens that a little over five dominicans also came to Wellies Island, and this is one of the things that we are documenting in the United St in the Dominican Studies Institute, some of those people who came to Ellis Island, some of those dominicans I'm going to leave in Washington Heights, and we will show you that and of course, the big picture, the one that you know- We are now a little over two point million dominicans, because this data goes to 2018.
I want to remind you that the this provides say, I think, a little a picture or more clear picture of that growth of the dominican people.
If you look at this table, what you're going to see is that a little over 50 percent of the dominican people in general in general have been living here since 1990 right since 1990 over 20 years.
You know lots of children right, and this is one of the reasons why the population is growing, and this graph show you the dominican people in terms of those who are immigrants and those who are now born in the United states.
New York of Course, is the is the place where the majority of the dominican people reside in the second and largest place will be New. Jersey then followed by Florida, and then you have the other Arizona.
When you think of New York, the majority of the people will be concentrated in New York City, and by that I mean 90, of the dominican people who lived in New York.
You know that we do this, for, for everybody who need numbers from the dominican people, so Staten Island is the is.
As you know, very well, is divided by neighborhoods the a place where the dominican people have been living for a long time in large number, it's Washington Heights, and here you have some of the numbers.
Yes, and when you have a category that lumps so many people, together, I mean you know, 44,000 people It would be great to take that 44,000 and break it down, and those people are how do they self- identify and Where did they go when they left Washington Heights We have time I, can, I can ask my people in the Dominican Studies Institute to disaggregate the other hispanic for you.
What I wanted to do, is to show you what we think it's, the area that we would like to have designated as a dominican historical district.
You, know that longevity, and also we wanted to create an area that you're you were going to find dominican, symbols.
Maurice Pa Paniwowski, who came in 1911 from the Dominican Republic and then the person who in 565 west 162Nd. Then you know his daughter, married somebody, and we have little stories like that of people who lived in the area Dominigano and then have other members of their family.
So, with that I'd like to move to the next item on our agenda now that it's 8:55, but we're not going to rush it per se for land use and the capital and expense budget.
I would add that we want them to work with us to update the 2007, neighborhood planning and land use study that we undertook with city college by the way.
