Our five guidelines are stay consistent with people first language, so using nouns before we use adjectives using active and positive language, so avoiding victimization and always putting a positive instead of a negative connotation using universal language, so avoiding idioms and ensuring that we're speaking play language using gender neutral language and not assuming individuals, pronouns.
Another thing that I think is important for us to know is instead of saying poor person unfortunate or less fortunate people, we should say a person that is experiencing economic disadvantage or a financial hardship, a person experiencing poverty or a person living before the poverty line.
Now I'm going to move on to the second of the guidelines, which is use, active and positive, language, We should avoid using phrases like suffers from a victim of because it assumes that individuals are suffering or identifies as a victim and when we're having these conversations, we do not necessarily know that everyone, that is, a survivor of domestic violence or a person that is living with HIV or a person living with some disease, necessarily identifies as suffering or that they're a victim of it.
If we're trying to help this population, we need to center their humanity and make sure we're being as inclusive as possible, so avoiding language that connotates pity and trying to use the active voice when speaking about things that happen to or are done, to, individuals.
If we're practicing the people first, we want to say a person living with HIV and not necessarily suffering with a person that is living with diabetes, a person that is living with, but dealing with obesity right and these things that do not add negative connotations to the circumstances that individuals find themselves in third guideline is using universal language.
That's like regularly brought up, and I think it's something that I really wanted to bring up because of how much how charged language is and how important it is for us to be mindful of the things that we are saying and the connotations that they're associated with.
I, think that, because it's so Dis dissociated from its original meaning that no one really knows where it comes from, but the term actually is rooted in the fact that in the early 20th century, black people were forced to sit in a balcony that was often referred to as the peanut gallery or the n- word gallery.
This is because I often find members not necessarily from our committee, but I, know definitely from the larger on board, referring to the chair as a chairman, and I think that if we should move away from that language, because not all people prescribe to the gender binary right- It's, not everyone identifies as female or male, and we need to respect that.
You should just ask I'm in the habit of introducing myself and ensuring that I state, my pronouns, which are hers, but I, think that it's really important for us to discuss pronouns, because for many people this is a relatively new phenomenon and they're not comfortable with the concept of pronouns We should become familiar with, but I think we should definitely at the very least, know that pronouns relate to a person's gender identity, particularly how they want to be addressed when they're not being spoken to when they're being spoken to or about without their name being used.
If that's what they decide to do without making them feel like they have to right, and so I wanted to focus on inclusive language, because I feel like in the time of search of Covid-19 and having virtual conversations.
I think that this is also a great presentation to be done at the general meeting for the purpose of put furthering a possible resolution, but also so that we are informing not only our full board but our community.
Amazon does not do good in a lot of areas, but seemingly in the tech, environment, they're very, very much progressive in making sure that everyone feels accepted and that there are safe spaces for all types of people, and I, for that was the first person that I saw it done so like it was so immersed in the practices and also in the discussions and meetings that we had that.
The last thing that I want to speak to is exercising this type of spirit, not only in the words that we use, but also in our practices that in this board, specifically that there be safe spaces for people to express themselves about all things, and I.
I also feel that this type of work that Naisha has done here is things that people should be credited for like this body of work and the idea that this can be a part of this board's practice for all time now is important, and I feel like often over the years people's work when they put hard effort like this into things, This person sponsored this resolution or a practice or whatever.
I focused on the things that I did focus Is just to be specific to the committee that we're on and like the language that we use regularly, but I do think that.
If, given the opportunity to make this, like a resolution and present to the board, I, do want to include things that are relevant, more relevant or more specific to race and gender expression, because I feel, like those are the most common types of tensions that exist throughout the world.
I know this may turn into I Am not an expert at all, but I definitely think that if you all have any questions or want to have a conversation or talk about a time, where, like I used to share with you that you misgendered or you were misgendered And how that made, you feel I think these are important conversations to have so that we're normalizing these things, right.
But I also think that just like whatever they decide right because I am not, I do not identify as a trans person, but there may be someone that does and does not feel included.
The second part, as far I just wanted to know other committee members thoughts as far as implementing what exists, for instance, in City Council in the assembly, Et cetera, but as far as crediting people who bring ideas to the board as sponsors is done in any other.
We should give people credit right if people spend because people spend time writing these resolutions, and if people are spending time and bringing ideas and putting their time in even if it's like 15 co- sponsors and it's a whole committee, right, we're all working and we're all putting it together, and I absolutely think that we should be credited for it.
The resolution, of course, is still out of the word of But I think that it also says a lot if we're putting it in the bylaws for every single member that might join in the coming.
Or Naisha is going to take it to the task force for discussion and then bring the resolution from the task force Maybe you want to check in with Gail Brewer's office, to see what's being done with other community boards.
We're, going to share the presentation with in our community thread on now, so you all can feel free to share with whoever and if you're, not a committee, member and So I'm sort of wondering if there are any other public people or board members on the thread here who want to make a statement?
You, know: you, I think, also, if so, if people do not so again, just like reiterating parts of my presentation, if people do not feel comfortable speaking, we should also allow them to stand in their silence and feel I'm.
It has been referred to specifically the budget and revenue committing so just check the individual actions by clicking on this little tab here, And below you'll, see now a summary establishes a billionaire mark to market tax, taxing residents with one billion dollars or more in net assets and directs revenue from such tax into a worker bailout fund establishes a worker bailout program providing workers traditionally excluded from wage protection programs, access to unemployment, benefits If you language, have free, contain a clock, you'll, see some further explanation as to why the individual sponsor of the bill wanted to present this good.
Even during this, the summer months, whether that happens, I want to use their clear language that says, may do this, but it's not It's already been introduced into a committee.
You know that we're already here in our own committee talking about individual issues, right, there's this an assembly counterpart and do you want to do a reso about them?
Actually I'm, assuming that some of the what we discussed in April was it in the resolution regarding coronavirus, and you know making sure that people that are affected get benefits and things of that nature.
Do not think that I've seen language that has been able to, or even a report or a survey- Whatever resources are available to make a recommendation based on the data that they could find, because, right now, you do not have to be a resident of the state or even a legal resident to pay taxes.
If I ask for money, they're going to question me speaking to Like he's in need now other people because of his status, and there is the feed that anyone.
We may just want to put an asterisk next to things that are more background, information, which the board can be told what that is so that if that comes up as a concern, we will know like what can be.
I know not a committee member, yet I'm wondering whether saying how poor non- Citizens are is necessarily useful to this resolution.
So I think that in mentioning how the difference is between a non- citizen and that of someone who has permanent, you know permanent residency Is that now it do in this during this pandemic, then that brings it home in the way that okay, They contribute to our economy, but in this pandemic, this is how they're affected , then that helps to kind of like sell this reso and the bill as a you, know, viable option to remedy that.
Are we just concerned more about like if you're making the case you're saying hey these people contribute a lot.
I err on the side of keeping it specifically, because I know that there are people that will argue against how appropriate it this is, and maybe not from our community but others, And, so I feel like the fact that they can get this money.
And I'll vote as well, so that will be members and support, and the committee I vote, yes, hi!, Thank, you, okay, So I will now save these at the bottom of the resolution, and I will send it on out at the end of the meeting, the presentation.
Agenda, Minutes office, staff, responsibility, chair process, and that was brought to a full halt, because the intention was more on let's pitch and hold aisha, because we do not like some of the things that she says, despite whether they're true that- That's, very important work that needs to be done.
This resolution in front of us right now on the screen was already The housing and Human Services Committee voted on it.
, if I see like I'm imposing, but I just wanted to provide space for people to speak about it if they needed to and for people to know that you do not have to say it.
You do not have to tell me now, but if you need to talk to someone or just to like express yourself, I know, personally, I've been dealing with a lot of people.
I think that even right now, even amongst the executive committee members, you know I'll just also state here that there's kind of I think just a very strong, problematic understanding of how to address this kind of concern, and I and I do not necessarily agree with some members that have already started making certain comments, but I do want this entire board to have a conversation going further than it has to address race to address racism, to address.
Yet me not knowing the document exists, bringing up some of those things and other people doing the same and being treated like.
That kind of the reason I'm asking is this is because, when I think of a housing committee right.
There's, certainly a racial justice component that needs to be front and center right, because when we're talking about keeping people in their homes or not just affordable, housing, but quality housing and what kind of populations we want to serve If there's anything like that for this committee or other committees So, we kind of came in at a very odd time, but the first meeting that we were supposed to have in March when I you know suffering.
And I'll say this from being September, then to will be May of next year to really try and focus on what we want to either study in more detail or potentially focus on bringing into this committee, and I say that it broadly, but I also want to just point out that if we have various organizations in the community or acrosss the city that have been doing already, the very important work right, now.
Do think that we will need to discuss a bit more, but also potentially even work with some of the other committees.
