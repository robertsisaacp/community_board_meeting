I, don't know why it might be because I joined the public number link because I'm, not a panelist Give me a second I, see it all right, so I need to quit the screen first, so I'll be right back Let me just give me a second while I think about this now I wanted to give a brief definition of what inclusive language is, and ultimately it's just language that avoids alienating or excluding people or groups of people different ways that you can be excluded or people have expressed being excluded is based on ability, disability or disability, age, nationality, language, accessibility or language barriers, race, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation- Well, not that I think this can go on for as in any way, people can be included for various different reasons, and so here are just five guidelines that I've set up for us, at least as a committee that I think that we should at least adopt as community agreements, because I think they're important in the field that we're particularly focusing on and just in general and everyday discourse Our five guidelines are stay consistent with people first language, so using nouns before we use adjectives using active and positive language, so avoiding victimization and always putting a positive instead of a negative connotation using universal language, so avoiding idioms and ensuring that we're speaking play language using gender neutral language and not assuming individuals, pronouns so using people first language, just the rule of thumb, is noun before adjective on people.
Because again, if we're trying to help this population, we need to center their humanity and make sure we're being as inclusive as possible, so avoiding language that connotates pity and trying to use the active voice when speaking about things that happen to or are done to, individuals The rule of thumb that I like to use for this is things, do not happen to people they are done to people Something else that I wanted.
That I didn't include here, but I did want to bring up, is the idea of a person like hiv positive person again, if we're practicing the people first, we want to say a person living with hiv and not necessarily suffering with a person that is living with diabetes, a person that is living with, but dealing with obesity right and these things that don't add negative connotations to the circumstances that individuals find themselves in third guideline is using universal language.
and I think it's something that I really wanted to bring up because of how much how charged language is and how important it is for us to be mindful of the things that we are saying and the connotations that they're associated with Don't make friends and the reason I say that is because, if we speak in idioms or jargon or acronyms, we exclude people that may not necessarily be experts or like well informed about the conversations that or like the fields that we're having conversations about So. If we use uncoded and plain language, we make it a more inclusive space for everyone to participate in conversations just even in the same language.
and I also wanted to note something: I did Gypsy is a racial slur used to refer to the romani people When you say you were chipped off, it reinforces these negative stereotypes that the romani people are untrustworthy or that they reliance on best to survive and something else that I hear very often is this reference of comments from the peanut gallery, and this one is my least favorite of all I think that, because it's so dis dissociated from its original meaning that no one really knows where it comes from, but the term actually is rooted in the fact that in the early 20th century, black people were forced to sit in a balcony that was often referred to as the peanut gallery, or the n-word gallery.
So I try to like move away from that and use the words partner or spouse, or significant other to ensure that anyone in the space that I'm in feels included You should just ask I'm in the habit of introducing myself and ensuring that I state, my pronouns, which are hers but I, think that it's really important for us to discuss pronouns, because for many people this is a relatively new phenomenon and they're not comfortable with the concept of pronouns I've.
This I have had my own personal experiences, unfortunately, and unintentionally misgendering someone, because I assumed that, based on how someone presents that you can edge on the side of you know having an understanding- Amazon doesn't do good in a lot of areas, but seemingly in the tech environment, they're very, very much progressive in making sure that everyone feels accepted and that there are safe spaces for all types of people and I , for that was the first person that I saw it done so like it was so immersed in the practices and also in the discussions and meetings that we had.
I also feel that this type of work that naisha has done here is things that people should be credited for like this body of work and the idea that this can be a part of this board's practice for all time now is important and I feel like often over the years people's work when they put hard effort like this into things , This person sponsored this resolution or a practice or whatever It is I'd like to see that I'd like to hear thoughts from the committee on how they feel about that and I'm going to be explicit about this racial issues that are going on in the board and gender issues that occur and confrontations that happen or spaces that aren't necessarily comfortable for certain people, certain races or certain genders.
Focus is just to be specific to the committee that we're on and like the language that we use regularly, but I do think that if given the opportunity to make this, like a resolution and present to the board, I do want to include things that are relevant, more relevant or more specific to race and gender expression, because I feel, like those are the most common types of tensions that exist throughout the world guide to terminology by glaad words at work by diversity, council, australia.
What's your pronoun, how equal workplace advocates and disability inclusion guidelines by the united nations relief and work agency, so you all can feel free to learn more I've read through most of these things, I carefully chose them and I've read through most of the things that I've read through all the things that I've referenced in the in the presentation- we're all learning every day, but I'm happy to engage in a conversation or answer any questions you may have I know this may turn into I am not an expert at all, but I definitely think that if you all have any questions or want to have a conversation or talk about a time where, like I used to share with you that you misgendered or you were misgendered and how that made, you feel I think these are important conversations to have so that we're normalizing these things right.
That makes sense, but the second, the second part, as far I just wanted to know other committee members thoughts as far as implementing what exists, for instance, in city council, in the assembly, et cetera, but as far as crediting people who bring ideas to the board as sponsors is done in any other.
The resolution, of course, is still out of the word of just I'm, just really not clear as to are we voting on a resolution right now or naisha is going to take it to the task force for discussion and then bring the resolution from the task force, and maybe you want to check in with gail brewer's office to see what's being done with other community boards.
It would be to move to say the very least:: it's not going to take a total fall, this bill and potentially yes, but there's also the potential to bring back another session, even during this the summer months, whether that happens , I want to use their clear language that says may do this, but it's not It's already been introduced into a committee.
Many working-class individuals and even scott stringer's supporter I, think really hurt too much, but I think that there there's ample amounts of data that could add to much of the discussion already being had He also takes similar language training safety net for independent contractors, as well as non-citizens and undocumented new yorkers Please don't spam me and ask what's on the links, so little emails about all the money that was left to you by a strange family member that you never know about, because I, don't [Laughter] I did find information about the amount of taxes that are paid by undocumented or people who are undocumented to begin her practice, which states that in 2015, according to the irs 4.35 million tax returns, were filed using itin accounting for more than 13.6 billion in taxes.
Let's say the governor's office that gets sent with it right, I know not a committee member, yet I'm wondering whether saying how poor non-citizens are is necessarily useful to this resolution.
Is that now it do in this during this pandemic, then that brings it home in the way that okay They contribute to our economy, but in this pandemic, this is how they're affected, because, if we're concerned about helping undocumented immigrants because of the impact of Covid-19 right and my concern really about what their status was before like how liquid poor, like okay, to use the words here that how poor they were prior to Covid-19, are we just concerned more about like if you're making the case you're saying hey, these people contribute a lot That's?
I will now save these at the bottom of the resolution and I will send it on out at the end of the meeting, the presentation Please because I tried to respond onto the email thread, but because people are cc's, bcc I can't have access to responding to them, but I did share it with you At some point You know you can always ask the board office too Can we possibly create like a google for like housing and human service members, so that we could like it could be like a lister where we can just send things or is that not allowed based on bylaws I'm, not sure like where we can send things to like the functions as in this serve so like?
I had asked the office I understand like the major concern, of course, about that It's still problematic today, but it was essentially a very political move by the current administration to drop undocumented individuals off into what was being labeled at the time as sanctuary cities and I on the side had a discussion with liz ritter, who is our secretary to ask her to dig into the records and find the vote total for this resolution.
When I sat with microsoft, which I discussed with the committee Not only was I looking to create a solution in regards to all of the buildings in our district, so that we can be able to have all the data, for instance, the fact that there might be a brown site at a certain location and we don't Is our resolution agenda minutes office staff, responsibility, chair process and that was brought to a full halt because the intention was more on let's pitch and hold aisha, because we don't like some of the things that she says, despite whether they're true that- that's very important work that needs to be done.
But this resolution was already voted on , I'm still it got here because I brought it up in the context of our last conversation with carmen de la rosa about the fact that but mind you, I had already been communicating with richard with the office by phone in person in email and have had conversation also with our current first chair right , It's many people dropping the ball and ignoring what their charge was before this point, so I mean what you're saying is that this resolution was not shared with the entire board So again I'm, not saying that I'm saying of 2019.
I know that the tangent of that is recently happened in the community and I think it's important to recognize the same way in the same vein of what naisha presented earlier in this meeting, that everyone's experience is different and we cannot assume, because we have a specific experience, can be proved that people push back again, but when it has to do with certain types of experiences, even when you can prove it seems to not get as much light and people are not held accountable for that and that needs to change.
And people who have been here and were a part of that process But yet me not knowing the document exists, bringing up some of those things and other people doing the same and being treated like So. The fact that the inclusion resolution was held back after we did vote on it.
