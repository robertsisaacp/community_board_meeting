Another thing that I think is important for us to know is instead of saying poor person unfortunate or less fortunate people, we should say a person that is experiencing economic disadvantage or a financial hardship, a person experiencing poverty or a person living before the poverty line.
Now I'm going to move on to the second of the guidelines, which is use, active and positive, language, We should avoid using phrases like suffers from a victim of because it assumes that individuals are suffering or identifies as a victim and when we're having these conversations, we don't necessarily know that everyone, that is, a survivor of domestic violence or a person that is living with hiv or a person living with some disease, necessarily identifies as suffering or that they're a victim of it.
If we're trying to help this population, we need to center their humanity and make sure we're being as inclusive as possible, so avoiding language that connotates pity and trying to use the active voice when speaking about things that happen to or are done, to, individuals.
If we're practicing the people first, we want to say a person living with hiv and not necessarily suffering with a person that is living with diabetes, a person that is living with, but dealing with obesity right and these things that don't add negative connotations to the circumstances that individuals find themselves in third guideline is using universal language.
That's like regularly brought up, and I think it's something that I really wanted to bring up because of how much how charged language is and how important it is for us to be mindful of the things that we are saying and the connotations that they're associated with.
I, think that, because it's so dis dissociated from its original meaning that no one really knows where it comes from, but the term actually is rooted in the fact that in the early 20th century, black people were forced to sit in a balcony that was often referred to as the peanut gallery, or the n-word gallery.
This is because I often find members not necessarily from our committee, but I, know definitely from the larger on board, referring to the chair as a chairman, and I think that if we should move away from that language, because not all people prescribe to the gender binary, right, So, gender-neutral language helps eliminate what we assume about people just because certain people have certain gender expressions doesn't mean that their gender expansion and their gender identity, match.
If that's what they decide to do without making them feel like they have to right, and so I wanted to focus on inclusive language, because I feel like in the time of search of Covid-19 19 and having virtual conversations.
I think that this is also a great presentation to be done at the general meeting for the purpose of put furthering a possible resolution, but also so that we are informing not only our full board but our community.
This I have had my own personal, experiences, unfortunately, and unintentionally, misgendering someone, because I assumed that, based on how someone presents that you can edge on the side of you, know having an understanding- Amazon, doesn't do good in a lot of areas, but seemingly in the tech, environment, they're very, very much progressive in making sure that everyone feels accepted and that there are safe spaces for all types of people, and I, for that was the first person that I saw it done so like it was so immersed in the practices and also in the discussions and meetings that we had that.
The last thing that I want to speak to is exercising this type of spirit, not only in the words that we use, but also in our practices that in this board, specifically that there be safe spaces for people to express themselves about all things, and I.
I also feel that this type of work that naisha has done here is things that people should be credited for like this body of work and the idea that this can be a part of this board's practice for all time now is important, and I feel like often over the years people's work when they put hard effort like this into things, This person sponsored this resolution or a practice or whatever.
I focused on the things that I did focus Is just to be specific to the committee that we're on and like the language that we use regularly, but I do think that.
If given the opportunity to make this, like a resolution and present to the board, I, do want to include things that are relevant, more relevant or more specific.
I know this may turn into I Am not an expert at all, but I definitely think that if you all have any questions or want to have a conversation or talk about a time, where, like I used to share with you that you misgendered or you were misgendered And how that made, you feel I think these are important conversations to have so that we're normalizing these things.
The second part, as far I just wanted to know other committee members thoughts as far as implementing what exists, for instance, in city, council, In, the assembly, et cetera, but as far as crediting people who bring ideas to the board as sponsors is done in any other.
We should give people credit right if people spend because people spend time writing these resolutions, and if people are spending time and bringing ideas and putting their time in even if it's like 15 co-sponsors, And, it's a whole committee, Right, we're all working If you put an emotion, I second, that I don't moving forward.
We're, going to share the presentation with in our community thread on now, so you all can feel free to share with whoever and if you're, not a committee, member and So I'm sort of wondering if there are any other public people or board members on the thread here who want to make a statement?
You, know: you, I, think, also, if so, if people don't so again, just like reiterating parts of my presentation, if people don't feel comfortable speaking, we should also allow them to stand in their silence and feel I'm.
Last year, I have gone through several of these type of trainings about you, know, prop proper use of pronouns about the type of language we're using and how we could be more inclusive, and it's made a huge difference in my relationship with people in my understanding of communities that are different than I am so based on.
It has been referred to specifically the budget and revenue committing so just check the individual actions by clicking on this little tab here, And below you'll, see now a summary establishes a billionaire mark to market tax, taxing residents with one billion dollars or more in net assets and directs revenue from such tax into a worker bailout fund establishes a worker bailout program providing workers traditionally excluded from wage protection programs, access to unemployment, benefits You know you're looking at the summer kind of explanation of the individual bill as well.
You know that we're already here in our own committee talking about individual issues, right, there's this an assembly counterpart and do you want to do a reso about them?
Actually I'm, assuming that some of the what we discussed in April was it in the resolution regarding coronavirus, and you know making sure that people that are affected get benefits and things of that nature.
You want it, please don't spam me and ask what's on the links, so little emails about all the money that was left to you by a strange family member that you never know about, because I, don't [Laughter] I did find information about the amount of taxes that are paid by undocumented or people who are undocumented to begin her practice, which states that in 2015, according to the irs 4.35 million tax returns, were filed using itin accounting for more than 13.6 billion in taxes.
If I ask for money, they're going to question me speaking to Like he's in need now other people because of his status, and there is the feed that anyone.
We may just want to put an asterisk next to things that are more background, information, which the board can be told what that is so that if that comes up as a concern, we will know like what can be.
I know not a committee member, yet I'm wondering whether saying how poor non-citizens are is necessarily useful to this resolution.
I think that I want to highlight both the contributions that is already being made, as well as the current difficulties that are also already impacting individual communities across the entire united states.
I err on the side of keeping it specifically, because I know that there are people that will argue against how appropriate it this is, and maybe not from our community but others, And, so I feel like the fact that they can get this money.
Agenda, minutes office, staff, responsibility, chair process, and that was brought to a full halt, because the intention was more on let's pitch and hold aisha, because we don't like some of the things that she says, despite whether they're true that- That's, very important work that needs to be done.
This resolution in front of us right now on the screen was already The. Housing and human services committee voted on it, already.
, if I see like I'm imposing, but I just wanted to provide space for people to speak about it if they needed to and for people to know that you don't have to say it.
You, don't have to tell me now, but if you need to talk to someone or just to like express yourself, I know, personally, I've been dealing with a lot of people.
I think that even right now, even amongst the executive committee members, you know I'll just also state here that there's kind of I think just a very strong, problematic understanding of how to address this kind of concern, and I and I.
Yet me not knowing the document exists, bringing up some of those things and other people doing the same and being treated like.
Certainly, a racial justice component that needs to be front and center right, because when we're talking about keeping people in their homes or not just affordable, housing, but quality housing and what kind of populations we want to serve If there's anything like that for this committee or other committees So, we kind of came in at a very odd time, but the first meeting that we were supposed to have in March when I you know suffering.
And I'll say this from being September, then to will be may of next year to really try and focus on what we want to either study in more detail or potentially focus on bringing into this committee, and I say that it broadly, but I also want to just point out that if we have various organizations in the community or across the city that have been doing already, the very important work right now.
I do think that we will need to discuss a bit more, but also potentially even work with some of the other committees.
