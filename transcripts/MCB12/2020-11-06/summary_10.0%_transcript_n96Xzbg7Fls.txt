But when it comes to actual restaurant food safety, inspections, yes, that continues to be department of health inspectors.
It just started Steve and they're used to not starting necessarily in time, there's other entertainment going on tonight like what oh you mean constantly looking at numbers.
Thanks for having me back, as you know, cases across the city are, we are seeing increases in certain neighborhoods.
I mean, I, think the whole issue is ebbs and flows right, but the point is: we are encouraging everyone to go, get tested to maintain.
If you need anything from our ends, posters palm cards, things like that to share with the community, please let me know if there are any organizations on the ground level that work, with.
I forwarded all of those over to the mayor's office of special enforcement and the Community affairs unit, so that they can send out inspectors to inspect any type of social distancing, violations.
And I'm, happy to speak with folks on that, but I want to turn it over to Laureen from h, test and trace, because she has a lot of really exciting things that they're doing on the ground.
I know our action center has been passing, out, face coverings and working with local cbo's and things like that.
And so, if you see a location of particular concern, I, would recommend you know checking in with the DOT to see if they have the proper permits in place, but I think.
If there is one particular a couple of particular locations of concern, definitely you know reach out to DOT to see if they have the proper permitting in place for their restaurant.
Since the open streets, open restaurants, is a DOT program and debbie and agreed that I guess it's up to Eleazar for the bylaws to figure out what to sign it, but maybe we should have sort of a town hall addressing you know, or at least the committee should have a conversation, probably health and environment traffic and transportation, business development, and maybe licensing if this is a.
Think it's a big issue and as long as we know, the proper reporting, I did have a question for you pauline a separate, question.
I guess it depends on one day of the week, because they were increasing by like a full percentage point in sort of testing, results.
If we're not seeing a steady, dramatic increase in a neighborhood, I think that's good, but I think whenever we see some small incremental increases, we do want to put resources into the community and make sure that stops before it becomes a big problem.
So Washington Heights is not like a hot spot location right now, but we are seeing some incremental increases, which is why I think you know.
So I, think maybe we can get the state Department of Health next time for questions related to that.
If that's something that you think the that business might need, I would recommend letting the state know, as well.
Is sort of a case for concern, but I think you know just to be comparative to the other locations where we're seeing huge hot spots.
I know you want many more resources available to your constituents into your district, but I think we're seeing some real problems in other neighborhoods throughout the city, and so a lot of the focus is on that, but you're right like we do not want to get to that place in Manhattan.
I am the borough outreach director for New, York, City, Health and hospitals, specifically for the test and trace unit.
My job specifically right now is focused on prevention, so that we can keep the numbers down work with all the community- based organizations within your community board in order in an effort to partner and provide access to PPE, give you micro sites where folks can get tested for free or low cost at no cost in your area and to hopefully work alongside with you.
We definitely want to establish a an ongoing working relationship with you and want to support your efforts and want to make sure that people in Washington Heights who wish to get tested can find an easy way to do so and hopefully get their results back pretty quickly as rapidly as possible.
Actually are working on something that we hope to get some information to you early next week, where we're planning a joint virtual health seminar prior to thanksgiving.
Some new information that we've come across is that the uptick in numbers, or an increase in positivity rates, are due to small family gatherings, not the large family gatherings, especially in enclosed spaces, which is why we're trying to get ahead of things and possibly have a speaker and an expert on there.
Once we've confirmed that prior to Thanksgiving, we'll roll that out to you and an invitation to everyone on this community board, along with some other folks in upper Manhattan, so that we can work together in order to prevent a second wave.
It was two months ago and they apparently supplement the work of the test and trace core by providing assistance to a people in isolation.
Okay, yes, I am aware of this article as well, and it's caused a little disarray for the gothamist versus the information that we're actually receiving at the Department of Health and the city from the testing sites from the locations from the hospitals.
You know the palm cars and stuff like that, because I see a lot of in the park.
Actually, you know, send cases of masks and Pom cards and folks who do not have access to that can actually pick up organize days of actions for nearby testing, sites.
If there is not one in a neighborhood, for instance, if seniors have a hard time accessing it because of the terrain, the turf that you guys are at so Hnh staff would bring self- test kits for people to test themselves and folks will receive instructions for how to get their results.
It has been going back a couple of times Richard, you might know you get on mute last Friday afternoon, the department for the aging sent a directive to all senior centers in the city that grab and go and all on- premises.
I know that the New York Times had gotten hold of some of that data back in July and they showed very disparate death rates depending on location.
The pandemic preparedness, act, which was passed in 2019, and it turns out to require that the department of the health and human services at the federal level share extensive data, collect and share extensive data about a pandemic with the public and consult with local leaders in policy making and amongst the kinds of data that they need to help.
He continued to emphasize vigilance on mass social, distancing and avoiding crowded spaces, and he also briefly touched based on the Nih- funded research that was provided in order to look at long- term consequences of Covid-19 on the lungs and on the heart.
Think it'd be important for us to talk about this or get someone to come in to talk about community clinics and ambulatory care services being shut.
I. Just think that if we're going to move it and talk about addressing Covid-19, we need to address it from a community standpoint as well from as well as a health standpoint, and these other clinics that are dealing with the community and people in the communities and they're, not functioning.
These are satellite clinics programs that function in the community that are funded by or in part, by New, York, Presbyterian, and just I want to make sure that these programs and these clinics are open and open to the public and being advertised.
All of our community programs remotely since the start of Covid-19 and one of the things we had to take a look at, was whether we were going to renew the lease at the resource center, which is on 169Th, Street and Broadway, and at this time we've decided not to renew it, because we do not know when this virus will subside and people will be able to return to a location.
Well, I do want to mention that I've been checking the the state Health Department reports about nursing, home Covid-19, related deaths, and you know.
I do not actually know the information, but I'm sure they collected data on all of the cases that they were seeing.
Right like I know what New York train is a hospital, but there's also other programming.
I am among many things, a health educator at the at the Office of Community, Outreach and engagement and which is part of the Columbia University cancer.
So to speak on the other programs, like I, said before, our health services programming, which is really partnered and really strengthened by our partnership and through New York, Presbyterian and Montefiore hospital.
On public injection diversion which goes into our overdose, prevention, harm reduction, programming and support services, which is really a huge part of of our programming drop- in services and hygiene services, which includes our respite care and day shelter, which has really been something that has taken an impact since we have lost our space so just to go into it.
We have a public safety team who dust sweeps of the area and Highbridge park picking up syringes safely and to give you know a direct number in the year.
We found that when people do not have a safe space to touch down and spend a confidential time with their case manager, they are not able to access these services as frequently or sustain them.
This includes a resumption of suspended services such as HIV testing, long- term treatment, coordination, housing and shelter, assistance, food, services, benefits, navigation, advocacy and job seeking support, we'll be able to scale up our health care and critical case management services using telehealth and following physical discipline, guidelines.
We have a full line of Covid-19 prevention, protocols, including physical, distancing and daily sanitation, we'll be able to increase our service referral and health care access, which will then result in sort of a decreased fallout that we'll see in the community.
Every month, as you saw prior on the plan we have been situated so as we will not be obstructing any public sidewalks, we will not be obstructing bike lanes or any park access points and we've been authorized by the State Department of Health, following oversight and guidance from the city.
It was an excellent presentation and we all know the urgency and the importance of y' all having space, and particularly in my capacity when I was working with you, guys.
Do want to highlight is, I think, the importance and not necessarily diminish the importance of the board but, for example, like what is this same presentation going to happen at the daycare at NYCHA across the street at the clinic and the co- op across the street, because you know on the board.
We understand the importance and a lot of that gets lost in translation, because these presentations do not make it to the people on the block and given that, for example, that the timeline is all the way through June you know and given covey.
We do not necessarily know what's going to happen next year, even though it's not blocking the park.
You know really bring in those like deep presentations and conversations, and I say that especially around parking is a hot topic on the board and around there.
It's parent advocates on the the schools on 182Nd and 183Rd. It's people residents who live on Laurel, Hill, terrace down the block from our from our service sites, so we're actively engaging folks through our public safety team who goes out into the community every single day for sweeps.
We did the presentation just about about two weeks ago at our at our last event, and we do have it at the end of every month and it is welcome to everyone in the community because we do want to keep people informed as the process goes as mentioned.
This is a perfect application process to to the city for the the street activity permit or the office of community.
We had a separate one for increasing substance abuse services in the community, including specifically opioid overdose, prevention, education and funding for syringe, cleanups and collections, and that ended up as the number six priority overall for the board.
I want to respect turns, but I do think that this is significant enough, as we've had in the past, with like other organizations that they present at the beginning of the meeting.
So I'm sure we can just send Ellie an email, a five- minute presentation so that board members can ask the question outside of the committee report, because I do think it's significant.
You know, I work for the Parks Department and.
We did try to get one before, but you know with especially with Covid-19 many of these bathroom rentals and shower services are being used right.
If you wanted to do a joint resolution with traffic and transportation would be appropriate for her to do a presentation and get that information out of these two more people on the community board, the question.
Can you just let us and also corner project know in terms of if next steps is that they're going to present either at the general meeting and are we drafting a resolution or is that going to get drafted in time for the executive, meeting.
We know our people though, but I think it would be better if we could get a resolution through the executive committee.
Catherine brought up and a number of other people chimed in about regarding parking space, and we know how important that is.
Public health issue in our community.
You know I dashed this thing: off, unfortunately, just in a short time, and if you can, if you see by the heading of what I gave the resolution, my original intention was to focus on increased enforcement.
So I, do not know if you're kind of like thinking along that direction in terms of like preventative work over necessarily like a summons and arrest and increase policing.
I do want to say that they need to do those kinds of surveillance activities and they do have to stop it at the source and track people who are bringing it into the city.
People need to understand that this is a dangerous activity like you're, saying Steve in this resolution.
If you possess or explode a firework, you will be charged with a violation which we know is like less than a traffic ticket, right.
Okay, so I think the the tenor of the comments I heard earlier from committee members was that we did not necessarily want to crack down on the people who were setting off the explosives in the streets.
It can go both ways from task force to others in the community and vice versa, so that we are able to to hear those perspectives, but we're going to be bringing in different conditions with constituencies before the task force to address to you know for the for us to figure out what the solutions are, what solutions could look like and at the end the end game is to provide a list of recommendations, slash solutions with accountability with who would be accountable for ensuring that those things happen and so, and so that's where we are.
The number one priority for the board as a whole was to expand mental health services in the community.
The number 13 priority was to increase funding for a targeted educational outreach campaign for Covid-19 Prevention and support services and underserved communities such as Washington Heights.
I, think it's in June or July will be the 40th anniversary of the first report in the New York Times that many people are familiar with 1981 right.
You know if we could start integrating something like that in the process, so you're suggesting that, in with respect to World's a day, that's right.
