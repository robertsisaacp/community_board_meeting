Noticing hello, hi sally, I see we have you on here twice. What's up, I just sent you a text. Okay, thanks sally, you can only vote once. I know it's very funny, so it's not like northern elections early and often no. I just I just want to be clear that everybody is aware that there are the three of us on right now at plus ebenezer and like 22 people from the public. So let me try and open up the q a and for some reason it's not showing me the participant screen. Ah there we go, there's a couple hands up already, excellent, all right. Sorry, I'm a little bit delayed. I had some technical difficulties dialing in I'm just looking through the attendees to see if any of our members are on here, tanya natalie, hoppa, family, yeah, natalie's, not I'm I'd, be looking to promote the committee members and also jennifer. Can s ebenezer? Can you make there's? Can you make jennifer hoppa? Oh there we go excellent hapa family is luke, not jen. I see you're, muted, jen, you're muted, like no. I mean it's fine. If you want to talk, I just can't hear you, my son and some other members of the inwood 728 troop are working on their communications, merit badges, so they're joining tonight. We have public meetings happen. Oh that's outstanding! All right! Well! Thank you for that warning. I will do my best not to use any pg yeah any of my characteristically colorful language. Thank you for that heads up. Did they ever do their astronomy thing? I saw that they were looking for an astronomer. Yes, can we also ebenezer? Can you also promote natalie to a panelist and sorry for my inability to multitask, I'm hot and cranky all right, I'm gonna dismiss that we're gonna. Give this another moment sally, I'm not sure I can find out. Let me know if that noise is too much in the background. What I don't think was astronomy. Now that I come to think of it as birds. I don't know why I'm confused oh yeah and, I would say leslie, j and ken chaya. Okay, great. I encourage you to continue that conversation offline. I'm going to bring this to order. It is 6 36..

Are you ready for ouch for taking minutes, okay, you're ready to start, we are recording okay, alexis you're on mute. Are you good with taking minutes you ready to roll yep a little roll okey dokey, welcome everybody to the september community board parks and community board 12 Manhattan parks and cultural affairs committee meeting? I am your chair, liz ritter, elizabeth loris ritter. We have our assistant chair, daryl, cochrane, our public member alexis marnell, who is taking minutes? Thank you. We've got our committee member sally fisher. Our borough, president liaison natalie espino we've got jennifer hoppa from the parks department and we've got looks like about 30 attendees in the audience, including a couple of people with their hands raised already, I'm assuming that's for the public for the for the roundtable session which we'll get to in a moment. I'd also like to. Can you promote danielle jetu? Who is a committee member? She should be a panelist, and I also want to note that our board member, not a committee member tanya bonner, is in the audience. Thank you, tanya, for coming in. It's always really important when members of the board attend other committees. I appreciate that so I've got some updates. One thing that I do want to say is I've gotten a lot of feedback from different people. That meetings that go for much over two hours are just kind of exhausting, so I'm trying very hard to end this by 8 30, so help me out by being concise and by listening to other people's questions and comments, so that if your question is similar to something someone has already asked to just take in the answer to the previously asked question and to know that you can always follow up with people after the meeting on the side, we don't have to resolve every everything in the context of one meeting so because we do meet monthly. So the big update on parks usage is that the temporary road closures ended as of today they ended with the summer. So now that labor day has come and gone. The margaret corbin drive in fort tryon park is now open to traffic. I've gotten a fair amount of feedback of people who are unhappy about that and a fair amount of feedback for people who are actually happy about that because they like being able to use the road as a road. I understand it's important to the cloisters, which has now reopened, as have many museums for limited timed entry, and there are, but I understand that the city council's traffic and transportation committee is going to be having a public hearing on not just margaret corbin drive but on road usage in general, both streets that were closed for play, streets and recreation and to increase social distancing as people use, parks and open spaces, and also the use of roadways as it relates to restaurants and bars so that they can have increased outdoor seating. This is an incredibly important civic issue, but it's actually outside of this committee. It's a traffic and transportation thing. So I give this information to you for your benefit, but it is not a discussion item. I do believe the matter of margaret corbin drives specifically will be on the agenda for the trafficking transportation committee next week. I believe that is monday. The 14th additionally also not strictly a parks matter, but something that we did talk about a lot last month at our last meeting in the meeting before rebel scooters. As you know, they ceased operation in the city until they could put into place some better procedures. They have put in some different operating procedures into place and rebel scooters are back again. This is for your information. This is not an agenda item. I have heard fewer complaints and I personally have observed a few. I haven't seen much activity in the parks, so I don't know. Maybe people got the message, but I encourage you to continue to phone any complaints that you might have about inappropriate usage, sidewalks parts. What have you to go? Revel.Com and that's all I got on rebel. There have been over the summer. There were a couple of deaths on in the waterways due to jet skis, and this is sad. This is tragic. This is avoidable, but again not a discussion item for this committee. It's essential! It's an it's an enforcement matter, and there isn't. You know we thought of possibly bringing someone from the coast guard or from the pd's water. It's like water enforcement, but you know there isn't. We know what the problem is. They know what the problem is dragging them to a meeting to have that back and forth. Didn't seem like a terribly useful, a good use of people's time, but I do think that I'm just wondering jennifer is there anything that parks concessions are doing they don't. These aren't the jet skis, aren't a park's concession and they're, not they're buzzing past the marina this one and the one in Queens, but they're not coming into the marina. So I'm not really sure, that's something that your agency gets particularly involved in yes, you're on mute, our marine operations division does actually get involved in it. The jet skis are prohibited at the parks marina. So when we see if people are trying to disembark or tie up their jet ski, that is an issue for our marinas absolutely and then our marine operations division works with NYPD harbor unit and others. You know signage no wake zones and then, when, if there's a meet-up planned, we all coordinate, there have been several meet-ups large-scale events that were planned earlier in the summer that I know they were coordinating on and trying to prevent from impacting the waterfront infrastructure, as well as people who were along the waterfront. Okay. Thank you. I'm seeing somebody in the I'm going to address the items in the chat after this section. I just want to go on with the with my report here. I did want to note that the inward rezoning task force was. It was unanimously approved by the board at at our committee of the whole meeting on july 28th that we should have an inward that we should constitute formally the inward rezoning task force the members of that have not been named, so I don't have any update on that. Beyond that it has been constituted. I am hoping to get some information from on that from the chair at our next meeting, and hopefully there will be, as we had originally conceived of it a couple of years ago, when it was first suggested representation on the task force from each of the committees. Since the inward rezoning effects there isn't an area of committee work that isn't affected by the rezoning two other things. Sorry, three other things just no I'll circle. Back on that later sorry, I heard from ross frommer at columbia university that the university's peer at the muscoda marsh is due to be replaced, so that is going to be closed while it is being replaced- and it should be finished by in time for next season, so we'll be closing jennifer. Yes, it's actually the parks, department, stock and columbia maintains it for us not an important thing, but we are trying to expedite it one more important distinction. Thank you for correcting me. It's the community stock. We are trying to expedite work, but it's going to be contingent upon the department of environmental conservation's moratorium being lifted. Okay, thank you and when we have, I did encourage ross to make sure that the university is copious with their signage, explaining you know when it's going to be closed when they anticipate it being open just so that people know what's going on, but if anybody sees that there's work happening sees that it's closed, this isn't something that's being taken away from the community. This is something that is being fixed and replaced and being restored to the community. So it's a it's a bummer that it'll be offline, but like anything else, that needs to be fixed, it'll be nice when it's new and fixed and better, and they have committed to having that done in time for next season yeah. I just had a question about that. Do you know where exactly it'll be blocked off? Will people be able to sit in that one area yeah go ahead? Yes, they will jen. Just the floating dock is going to be repaired, so the fixed stock, that's overlooked. You can still use and the whole rest of the park. You can still yeah all of that's going to be completely unaffected and, last but not least, oh welcome, barbara and danielle two of our danielle is a member. Barbara had been a member rotated off to another committee, rotated back on so nice to have you back and then I also heard sorry. So I also heard from the parks concessions the folks at park's concession, I'm gonna shut this there's a restaurant across the street from me and a lot of double parking, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is an ambulance. Welcome to my world yeah, it's not moving. It's going to go on for a while, so the folks at parks, department revenue had two updates. One is that events for all concessions have been approved. Small events, 50 people or less with a variety of you- know the obvious social distancing requirements. People have to be six feet apart. They have to be wearing masks, so this is for all concessions, city-wide in parks that they will be able to have small gatherings with you know: weddings bar mitzvahs anniversary parties, whatever it is that people do when they have small events of 50 people or fewer. I mentioned this because this applies to la murpa to the hudson, in the same way that it applies to every other concession. This is not a rule that is particular to the hudson. This is a rule that is particular to that applies to every single park's concession and the rules for the hudson will be exactly the same as the rules for every other concession. To be clear. I repeat: this applies to every concession in the city. The hudson isn't being singled out, it isn't getting anything less, it isn't getting anything more. It isn't getting anything different. So there's that, and while I was getting that update, I also asked well speaking of concessions. What's going on with the new leaf cafe, there was a concession: it was RFP. There was a as you know there it was awarded. Things fell through with the awardee. They went to the second awardee. Things fell through with that prospective concessionaire, and at that point the revenue division decided to issue a new RFP and then Covid-19, so everything just kind of ground to a halt. Not surprisingly, there are many other priorities city-wide than pushing this out the door, so they will be reissuing an RFP. They don't have a date for it. Yet, as my mother used to say, no news is no news, but there's nothing happening not because of a large conspiracy, not because there's any kind of a secret deal, there's just nothing happening. So as soon as I have an update, and hopefully I will have one soon. I will provide that to you, I'm going to take danielle's question and then I'm going to go quickly to the beginning of the round table of updates from nonprofits, because I know there are a couple of people who need to leave by seven. So what you got danielle, no just I think I might have missed it. I apologize you're referring to the concession for tryon right yeah, the new leaf cafe in fort ryan, and if you could turn your mic up, because it's really hard to hear you. Okay, if we had questions for jennifer, should that wait until later. Yes, questions for jennifer should wait to the portion of jennifer's presentation. This was my update. So if you have questions for me about the things that I just gave you an update on ordinarily, I would take them now but, as I said, it's 6 52 and there are a couple of people who I know need to go. So I'd like to move to agenda item two, the brief programming updates from non-profits arts and culture organizations etc, and let me just get my timer going and I'm gonna unmute, martin collins, I don't seem to be able to unmute martin collins ebenezer. Can you give me the ability to? Can you elevate me to like co-host, so I can unmute people. Thank you, okay, marty. You're on good evening, everyone.

Thank you, and next up we have alex campos temples from the hispanic society. Hello, everyone good evening hold up. Can you hear me yep great, so you know we're approaching reopening hurry, but as they're all museums are now and, as you heard in the news, so we're getting closer to that point and we're actually starting with something outside in conjunction with hispanic heritage month we are doing an outdoor installation that will be opening september 24th and we will be doing it'll be an exhibition in which we are making sure that we take all protocol necessary, Covid-19 protocol necessary. It will be opened up during the day. The gates are open and closed at night and the the exhibition is going to feature highlights of our collection, they're not going to be actual works, they're going to be actually high quality, life-size reproductions of certain works from our collection and we're actually going to have qr codes. So people walk around scan the qr codes and get more personal stories, as well as more information about each object and that's going to be again september. 24Th we're also planning a series of events in conjunction with hispanic heritage month, including a tretulia on that particular exhibition that were opening to the public as well as some public programs, probably a concert and so forth more to come will be on our website later on this year, we plan to open the story gallery, as we had before, and hopefully in the new year we will open up a temporary exhibition space as well, so we are moving forward. Thank you, fantastic. Thank you. So much next up, we've got shiloh holly from the morris jemele mansion hi. I have three updates from the marsh chamel mansion. The first is over the next two thursdays. We are continuing to host our program in conjunction with some other historic house. Trust properties called the handwriting the constitution. It's a creative and reflective workshop where you get to spend time with some documents and it's led by artist morgan o'hara this saturday, we have our upcoming family day. It is a drumming circle within that aguilar and registration is required. It'll be social, distancing, friendly and an on-site event in the park, and the third is that our museum reopens this week. Our hours are thursday through sunday and we have two timed entries per day and then, when we open, we will also open with expanded interpretation, new tour offerings and all interpretive materials available in spanish. For more information about that, please visit our website marsdemal.org for our to book your tour or more information about our programming. Excellent. Thank you so much. I am informed that we've got representatives of the metropolitan museum of art met cloisters tom schuler and griffith mann, I'm going to I'm not seeing where tom is on the call, I'm looking for griff man. Okay, you are on welcome. Thank you good evening. Everyone I just want to announce, along with those other institutions that the met cloisters is opening this saturday, the 12th, and we are planning to open on thursday, the 10th for members. So obviously, we are interested in new york getting back and the cultural organizations being part of that landscape returning and obviously have a real interest in margaret corbin drive. That I know, is on the agenda for later. No it's! Actually it's not it's not on the agenda. For later, I just made an announcement that the road has been open and that's, although it's a, although it's a road through the park, it's really more of a d.o.t thing. So I am happy to I was I can circle back and take some feedback from people to pass on to the traffic and transportation committee. I understand that the that the met is obviously strongly in favor of continuing to keep of having the road be open, because that's how people access the museum yeah. One of the issues I would mention that's connected to that is the fact that the elevator at 190th street is down for repairs. So people who are coming to the cloisters from outside of the neighborhood are actually going to be getting off at the 181st street. Stop and we've been working with the mta to ensure that the bus service runs in to the park so that people can arrive at the cloisters and that's also critical for anyone arriving with accessibility issues so yeah we and the you know the the roadway obviously is just opened, so we've been managing to do our work without it, but we do have staff in the museum, even when it's closed and deliveries and contractors coming and going. So we are very keen to see the roadway open up. Okay, thank you and hello. You're out there, oh tom, lovely, to hear your voice. Yes, no. That was probably just me question. So good guy sound like tom, though hi tom, if you're around, but no I was wondering if maybe two they're working since folks will be walking from probably the 184th entrance working with the restaurants too. On the way there would be great, or at least to tell people you know where they could go eat on their way back from. Yes, do you have a space in your front area for little palm cards from local restaurants? That kind of thing are you talking about the placers yeah. We can look into that, but we do especially with the with the new leaf. We, you know we'd love, to be able to spread the words about restaurants in the neighborhood that people should go to a lot of people when they're leaving the cloisters will actually be going down towards dietman as well as back towards you know the 181st street stop right, particularly. I mean now that beautiful staircase is done. The newly force is closed, but the you know there are there's no paucity of restaurants in the dikeman area or on 187th street corridor, so, to the extent that you can work with them to promote that would be would be great yeah. I can speak to our visitor experience staff about that and I myself rent an apartment in the neighborhood so always like to support local businesses. Excellent, visitor experience, staff, that's a wonderful thing for a function. I like that. Okay, we have anastasia galco from riverside park. Conservancy, hello, everyone thanks for the time. This is anastasia. I'm going to give you three quick updates and if you want to stay in the loop or you have more questions, you can just email me. I don't know liz. If you want to just put that in the notes or something so yeah on tuesday september 15th, we will be announcing the progress that we've made so far on the north park initiative this year. It will be on our social media and on our website again, you can email me if you want to tune in. There are some park improvements on the horizon between 120th 281st super exciting. Looking forward to that on saturday september 19th, there's a coastal cleanup at 145th, which I know is a little south for you guys, but I figured I'd shoot it out there just in case and potentially also west harlem piers, potentially also at 172nd, tbd, again email me and that will be made clear in the next week and then on saturday 9 26. There is a project at 151st street same thing a little far south. We will need rsvp because we are capping group size in order to have social distancing, be possible and yeah. I hope to hear from someone thank you. Can you do me a favor and put your. I don't have the ability to put your information in the chat in that same way. So, if you could throw your contact, information in the chat would be excellent. That's in the q! A right! Yes, oh got you sorry thanks! Also shiloh. Can you just what's the time for that dying circle that you mentioned? I'm sorry. I had to unlock my phone. It is a saturday at one point by which I meant drumming sir. Of course, yes, we're not in yeah and registration can be found on our website. Excellent, I'm sorry! What time was it? I missed it 1pm. Thank you. Thank you great. Okay. I have one more question for anastasia. What was the event on 919? I don't know if I'm unmuted yeah. What was the event you said for 9 19. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you sorry, it's a coastal cleanup, so we'll be doing trash pickup, which is clearly very needed if anyone's been at the parks. Recently, yes, and that's going to be at which section definitely 145th street on the shore, if not also west, harlem, piers and also potentially 172nd. Thank you and just for people who are curious. I understand that 145th street is outside of community board 12, but that area just south of where community board 12 ends is an area that folks within the board, particularly at the southern end of the board, use a lot. So I feel, like community interest, is better served by not being so precise about, like it's 155th street, that's where it ends, and we don't care about anything south of that, so the borders and the parks are a little bit more fluid. I'm gonna move to aaron sims from inwood artworks, hello, everybody how's everyone doing tonight. Well, thanks for having me today happy, I guess almost fall, so inward artworks for those who don't know its mission is to create and curate professional, performing and visual arts in inwood and surrounding community, and that definitely applies to washington heights and also in the northwest Bronx. Just the four programs we have going on this month. There's a lot so just give you the bullet points. Every tuesday. Today, you could log into our youtube channel and see a musical story time for kids sung by some of our uptown artist families. Today we're highlighting favorite things from the sound of music, which is great twice a month on wednesday nights. We are doing lost inward video vault about inward history in Manhattan history. Tomorrow we're doing a documentary on votes for women in uptown, history of women's suffrage, very short documentary created by cole thompson and then on the 23rd, we're doing a sword. Documentary on uptown's, forgotten slave cemetery. So, just bringing it to your attention on thursdays every thursday this month we're having our podcast, which is in available on our youtube channel on video form and also available on apple music spotify and our inwood artworks website, and wherever you get your podcasts from this thursday, we highlight local painter, elisa gore, who many of you know from her works in the parks we are have too much puff and opera, singers, laurie and mary phillips on the 17th and then fight choreographer, local artist, dave venzuelo will be also featured on the 24th and last but not least, every friday. Since march inward artworks has featured a local film, since we had the prosperous film festival, so we've been showcasing a local filmmaker in their film every friday and also pairing that with local businesses that are open this freaking friday. Here we have 911, we have reikwahik by jamie rudy and we're featuring bunny, coffee and kiro kiran. If you have a neighborhood and like us to feature you, it's absolutely free, gratis, we're happy to tell the world you're out there and open, and if we can help you out, we will so it's all available on our social channels. It's all free and we just want to keep spreading the positivity and the creativity in the neighborhood. Thank you. I'm gonna have to cut you off here because you're over your time, but thank you very much you've got inward artworks does a huge amount of stuff. I do hope you're able to stay on the call, because one of the things that I'm hoping jennifer will be able to address during her report, which is coming up soon, is when the parks department will be contemplating permitting. Events in parks seems to me that a properly managed socially distanced. I don't know outdoor film night is probably safer than the unmasked undistanced partying that's happening in the park, so you know there may be some hopefully give us an update, an update on that during your report. If there are other people, I see a couple of hands up hold on sally. I see a couple of hands up in the audience, from cynthia auburn and from tonya bonner, I'm assuming that your comments are relating not to non-profit cultural friends and parks groups, but to parks conditions generally, which is coming up later in the agenda. I've got bob barnett bob. Did you have your hand up to give a report from hudson river community growing by harlem river community rowing? Very briefly, we had hoped to do a very simple singles program this. This fall and we've been conversations with parks. Of course we're going to use the dock, which has since been for very good reasons. We one of our members has actually inspected the dock and also recognized that it was in great shape, but we have pivoted that we're going to be offering this saturday an online a training program or exercise program specifically targeted for rowers, our participants, people that we've worked with in the community in the past years in inwood that will be advertised and depending on the response, we're hoping to go forward to doing a more weekly, typo online or else in parks. If, indeed, we're able to you know permitting permitting at permits, we'll be able to do something like that through the through october, but we're still maintaining our commitment to the community and finding ways a husband, our resource is the best possible so that when the new dock is in place, we're able to return once more offer free programming, fantastic. Thank you very much. I appreciate it obed folk are you had mentioned. You had contacted me earlier to say that you had a quick update from your organization. Yes, hi good evening everybody albert fulker, friends of sherman creek, quick update, we've been this is excited to get the park. Now that the parks are open, the shema crew waterfront park, we are actually conducting a community cleanup event. Saturday, water celebrating waterfront alliance, celebration of all things, water and the story, we're gonna be from 11 to 3 p.m. Gonna be doing some planting some mulching and a general cleanup of the of the shoreline. We are a keeping the mandate of such a distance wearing masks and we're actually getting a toolkit from punishment. Parts yay, where we're going to be handing out two park, users and masks- and you know all paraphernalia- will keep we'll plant and beautify our parks yeah saturday, this coming saturday september, 12th from 11 to 3 p.m. Everybody's welcome to come and join us get down and dirty excellent. Thank you. So much no problem. Okay! Are there any other organizations? Oh veronica lou from word up? What's up hey, I just wanted to say hello and let everyone know that we've had. We have coming up on saturday, a school supply, giveaway voter registration. Do the census event on this saturday, the 12th 1 to 4 p.m, we'll also be doing census stuff every tuesday outside this war. You know up till early august we were doing a ton of online events and through these programs and summer camps we give away. You know a thousand plus books, new books to anyone joining the book, clubs and the camps and everything. But there have been a couple of, like you know, outside socially distanced, masked events that we've done and this september we're focusing them all on making sure that people do the census and coupling it with letting people get getting letting people know about the community fridge that is now out the corner of 165th and amsterdam avenue. You know people have been coming and filling it up, and then people have been taking the food away and it's been this wonderful flow of things just like just like the books that are now pay what you can outside of the shop and hope to see people soon. I have a question: how are people I'm sorry? How do people donate to the community fridge like? What are the parameters? Yeah I can I can share. Maybe this is a maybe a good spot to or someone I can share, there's like an faq document of the kinds of food that can go in and the kinds of food that is not accepted, and then other people have been just sending money through paypal or venmo to the person running the fund and then other people. You know, then do the picking up of the food there's been. You know, partnerships built with some of the people at the farmers markets and some of the other csas. So you know the regular pickups throughout the week that happen for that, but yeah, either through monetary donations or through and in the kinds of you know you could just walk by and like leave food in there, but as long as they sort of fit the guidelines, there are people checking on it on a regular schedule and for the most part, they're, not people who they're people who we've like met throughout the pandemic, but are not people who were already previously word of volunteers. So it's a whole other volunteer crew that we're also a part of you know the word out volunteers, but it's sort of twice the overseeing. You know this is an expanded group veronica. If you could send that, I will share it with the committee, but I am assuming in a nutshell, we're talking about packaged, peeled foods, not things that are yeah. Everything should be labeled packaged, and you know with you know, ideally if it could be labeled bilingually. That would be even better, but in a lot of produce and things that you know are easily identifiable nothing. That's already, you know partially eaten. Nothing expired, nothing homemade! At this time some restaurants have been starting to do. You know, pass things along, but those things have come. Labeled too, like prepared food, it's cold, yeah all right! Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Gold liz. I have a question about that. Okay, yes, briefly, I'm sorry, I think daniella daniel was first. You know. Oh, I was just gonna. Ask I mean you: can you can go ahead? Daryl if you want it was sort of related to that comment about the refrigerator and the giving and taking it. Okay, I just wanna. The community of fridge is a wonderful idea. I support it. I love it. I'm happy it's a thing. I encourage people who have questions about it to reach out to veronica directly. It's not a parks and cultural affairs initiative. So if you've got a lot of questions about the community of fridge, oh no, I didn't turn if you could throw your contact information up into the chat. That would be great. My question was just simply: if people that are utilizing the fridge are maybe getting information on other resources in the community, for whatever other needs they may have and, as you know, I'm unable to put in the chat. So that was my question. We have maybe not directly at the fridge. We have. You know, there's stuff posted all over the outside of the storefront, because we have the nice advantage of big windows where there's big bulletin boards, for you know what to do. You know you're experiencing domestic violence, there's information about the senses. There's information about stuff, that's in the windows, we'll happily put up more okay, thank you, and if you can put up your contact information vern in the chat, that's what I meant. I know that the panelists can't put their questions in the chat, but if you could put your contact, information in the chat would be great. Then send me that flyer and I will forward it to the committee. I've got a question in the chat based on the time asking about where the cleanup is on saturday, I'm assuming that is directed to obed at sherman creek, so obed, I'm gonna unmute, you briefly, so that you can give us some information on when on where people should be meeting up for that cleanup on saturday. Yes, meeting point will be a the water, sherman creek waterfront parks at 203rd, 10th avenue on the holland river, that we're going to be meeting and there will be tents tables for physical distance. I don't like the social distance term because we are socially connected yet physically and yeah. That's the meeting point added for at 11 and feel free to come one hour. What as much as you can stay for the day for the all duration, 11 to 3 p.m, 203rd street and 10th avenue super. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Liz appreciate it. Okay, going once going twice any oh sally liz! I didn't get to finish my question before oh, okay yeah. I think you thought it was going to be about the fridge it was. I was just trying to say that it was really hard to hear you. I don't know. Why? Can you hear me now? Can you hear me? Yes, okay, I was saying that it's along the same vein as like the give and take with the refrigerator but pertaining to books in the parks. I was wondering if we've ever discussed the idea of having like what they have set up on, like broadway sort of like a book library in the parks in inwood. I think the issue is maintaining the bookshelves and whether or not they're protected from the weather, because that's been an issue with all of the public bookshelves. I mean that's one issue that I could think of immediately yeah. I've seen them before in other cities where they have them in like an enclosed sort of situation, but I guess you know just wondering if that's something that like is possible if we've ever discussed. Yes, jennifer wait, we, I know there was one at indian road right at the entrance to inwood hill park. We're still in I'm, not sure who maintains it, and then there also was one at bennett avenue at the a train entrance. That's also gone, I think, to sally's point a lot of the times they just they deteriorated. It's something else to maintain. If a group comes to parks, we pilot it and what tends to have worked well is if it's smaller scale, not people coming and dumping their bookshelves. You know bennett park, we have one the little free lending library and it probably holds about 20 books. Otherwise, at the other locations we get we've gotten dumping at the morris, chamel mansion in roger morris park, there's also a little library that is there in conjunction with the program through word up cool all right. Thank you, sally. Okay, a couple of events. I'm gonna speak for two organizations, maybe three. If there's time the first is friends of inwood hill park. I just a shout out to the parks, maintenance workers who are doing a great job, despite losing all their seasonal staff, and also to groups that have joined us in half a dozen cleanups, especially the parks maintenance workers. The there's a group of hispanic youth from all over the city called communify they've done a couple cleanups with us senator jackson's office and most recently, I think, last weekend a group that a volunteer group that grew out of the greenbelt nature center. So I want to thank everybody for that. The next event that we have and I'd encourage people to keep in touch with our facebook page is on the 26th this month. It's a plogging event, if blogging for those of you who don't know it, it's sort of a combination of jogging and the swedish term, and I won't pronounce it right, which is pica up, which means pickup and basically getting exercise while you're cleaning up whatever route, you're running or jogging, or, in my case I'll, probably be plocking, which is picking up and walking. So that's on the 26th and the next huge event that we have is on the 17th of october, that is, the annual river sweep typically held the first weekend of may, which was postponed for obvious reasons. This will be, I think, our third or fourth year doing it as friends of inwood hill park. In conjunction with other groups, the we've done two sites. One is the dikeman pier I always like cleaning up at the river, because then it doesn't end up in the belly of some fish and also at the northern at the top of in wood hill park, and that's with leslie barbie barbian crew. Those announcements will go online on the 17th of this month and you'll be able to sign up. There will be sites for those of you who don't live in inwood. There are sites all over the city next and then the other thing I just want to mention is 30 seconds, because that dinger was your time. So we have equipment that we can loan to groups that want to do their own cleanups, we've loaned them to uptown dreamers for their harlem and washington heights cleanup. Finally, the washington heights food council has been doing a plant-based nutrition series and that will continue this sunday. It's called food for life. It's a it's a curriculum developed by the physicians committee for responsible medicine. The next session is this: coming sunday, as I said, and the focus will be foods for a healthy weight, you can find out more on the washington heights inwood website or facebook page and that's it since I'm wrapping up cool wrapped up. Thank you. Thank you. Jennifer. Just before the parks report, one cultural thing people perhaps have seen it. The parks department had planted a grove for juneteenth at cadman, plaza back in June and as part of that 19th flowering trees were planted and 19 benches were painted in the pan-african flag. Colors. The park is forever now in concert with partners. We've been sort of spreading that temporary public art project throughout the city right near where friends of inwood hill park help us at inwood hill. We have a new bench by the farmers market at aisham park. We have a new bench, there'll be one going in at fort ryan at broadway and arden street. The dyches farm house has one and we're working with shiloh to have one at roger morris park and those will be up through december 31st. It's part of sort of a larger initiative on the parks department's led by the parks, commissioner, declaring solidarity with the black community november, 2nd there's going to be another piece roll out of it with some park renamings. But if you're wondering what those benches are around and there's a great press release on the parks department's website about it and one other cultural event coming up, it's for trying, park's 85th anniversary and the fortrey and park trust is having an opportunity to travel back in time. 85 years of the olmsted legacy at the heather garden, octo september, 15th at 6 30 pm with the public art designer rhonda m brands. Talking about the olmsted's, then what we know now about invasives and how we carry on their legacy but keep the park and its ecology thriving you natalie. You want to give us a quick plug for the census. Always I live to give plugs for the census. I know you do so. Yes, this is something that may not on the surface. Look like really something that is related to this committee, but we all know that the importance of being counted of having every member of our community counted, of having resources allocated and representation in government determined by an accurate count of everybody, of every sort of every age of every national origin. In this beautiful community of washington heights inwood is it's crucial and it affects every sector and there are city-wide. There is right now, a group of cultural organizations under the hashtag culture counts that you know are arts organizations that have mobilized to make sure that people who follow and support the arts realize the importance of being counted to for the ongoing support of arts and culture of arts and culture, and, as we know, as well as the parks, so the government has shortened the response time. We all know this something cheeky happened. I don't want to speculate, but we only have about 23 days left to respond to the census, so make sure that every conversation you have, even if it is about teacups or wingnuts, includes a plug for the census. Thank you all so much outstanding census. I see Manhattan is up to 56 so which is better than it was, but not as good as it could be. Okay, I have, I don't really know. I can't really screen share in any kind of easy way. That's not going to cause everybody's squares to disappear, so I just want to give you a brief road map of the rest of the meeting. I believe that is it for announcements from parks and cultural groups, we're going to have jennifer's parks report, which will include some of the questions that people have been throwing up in the chat, I'm not ignoring you, I'm just trying to keep things orderly and then we're going to have a discussion of our capital and expense budget priorities. I think some of the lingering questions from some of the things that I've spoken about in my update kind of fit into jennifer's parks report, so I would like to turn the zoom over to jennifer. For that oh wait, a minute just before I before I cue you. I just want to make note of anonymous. Attendee made some comments about motorbikes in and around parks an inward, a couple in inwood hill park, one in central park, so yeah. If you can possibly address what the enforcement issues are there. Thank you anonymous attendee for that and we've got. We've got some questions in the chat about the about the road which, again, I will be passing all of that information on to the traffic and transportation committee. But I think that's, although it is a road in the park, it's large. The decision on that is largely outside of park's purview. That's done through the mayor's office, and can people see these questions in the chat? Are these publicly visible? So I don't have to like read out that information excellent I'll shut up now, jennifer hi everyone just before I forget this doesn't affect everyone, but it does affect many of you. A lot of people. More people are using the 10 miles of trails in inward hill park. We have had oh, it doesn't work. Obviously, we've had the department of health has notified us that we've had another two incidents of rabies in the raccoon and skunk population. One was in the street network, not in the parks but east of fort ryan, and one was along payson avenue. The urban park rangers have done some public education as a result up at moscow to marsh park where people are unfortunately feeding feral cats and thereby attracting raccoons, and someone was bitten. We've got signs up at key park entrances, but I just want to remind everyone to keep your dogs on leash and to be mindful, if you see a raccoon that or a skunk that seem lethargic or overly aggressive, please call it into 311 so that the department of health and the parks department's wildlife division can respond and address it. Isolate the animal and test, if warranted so please be mindful and please keep your dogs on leash, probably both in and outside of the parks, because these are actually park exterior and outside of them. I also wanted to let people know that the parks department has launched a new campaign. We need everybody's help to show your parks, some love, as you can all imagine, with Covid-19. Our parks are seeing probably some of their highest visitorship they've seen in ages. Everyone is using the parks for physical activity for getting together with family, safe social distancing for protests. For you know, graduation photos with the family, you name it outside office, it's all happening in the parks as a result, we're seeing a lot more garbage in the parks with the city's 9 billion dollar budget deficit. There's been budget cuts of 84 million dollars to the parks department's budget. That means that we're dealing with a staffing reduction of 1700 people. So at a time when we've got higher volumes of park use, we don't have the seasonal staff that we normally would have to address. That said, thank you sally. Our staff have been working diligently to try to keep up with it all coming in at six over the weekend handing out bags. It's definitely a lot to deal with, on top of all the illegal dumping and other things that happen at our parks. So we need everybody's help. Our electoral officials have been doing neighborhood cleanups in the streets and at park perimeters the natural areas, conservancy friends of inwood hill park, the fort trying park, trust up. We'd love everybody's help to toss your trash where you can use reusable materials if you're going to picnic with your family and take them out of the park, bring a bag and take the trash to the can if the can is overflowing. Put your bag next to the can and encourage your neighbors to help keep our neighborhood clean because it definitely takes a village when we're all spending so much more time outside trying to escape being cooped up in apartments, and I wanted to give this community board a shout out. As many of you know, we don't necessarily have you know a second shift afternoon staff, the community board members have gone out into the parks at night when people are gathering and hand out bags and talking to their neighbors and that's great. It really helps extend the parks department's efforts. So thank you for that and be on the lookout for new flyers stickers. We've had more trash cans out in the park more coming, we've gotten more equipment for dealing with trash, but not additional staff. So that's definitely a challenge so love your park toss your trash. Our parks are also being used for the outdoor learning initiative that the mayor announced. We've got schools that I think with about 185 schools so far that are going to be taking advantage of uptown's abundant parkland for outdoor learning, outdoor physical education and whatnot. You said how many schools, not just 185 in district 6., it's 185 city wide, so the parks are being used for outdoor learning. We are going to have some additional roadway closures for outdoor learning. The mayor's street activity permit office is working on those and then, of course, we have the play streets, so the city's working hard to try to accommodate as many people as we can outside special event permits right now. It is up to 50 people. You do have to submit a a safety plan to go along with that to show how you're dealing with crowd management and protecting public health no amplified sound is being permitted, though. So, if you hear amplified sound, absolutely call it in it's, not it's not approved in any instance. As you know, schools and league sports for kids and youth is back on the table. Permits are being issued for those the fall season starts next tuesday for youth baseball, softball, non-contact lacrosse, flag football. We know people need to get out and play some facility updates. Shiloh mentioned earlier with the mansion. Reopening roger moore's park is also open and available to the public thursdays through sundays. 10 to 5., miss goda marsh. Has that one temporary closure? We have some areas that are still closed off from the first storm and then we've had subsequent storm damage from the second storm. Some areas may still not be accessible, we're working with the forestry division on that. So, if you see caution, tape, wrapped around a tree or a gate still closed, please be patient. They had thousands and thousands of tree service requests capital projects update as many people can imagine with Covid-19. Several of our projects were halted during the construction moratorium. Things have have restarted as the Covid-19 conditions have improved. Certain safety protocols have been put in place high bridge the five million dollar water tower. Reconstruction has resumed still getting a sense of how that's affected the construction schedule, which I can report to the committee on. A later date, the 30 million dollar anchor parks project has resumed phase. Two of that, as this committee knows, includes a new four and a half million dollar artificial turf soccer field. During our planning meetings, we had lots of demand for more soccer. That's going to be coming online, probably by the month's end, which we're really excited about 175th in amsterdam and then the adventure playground is probably is resumed and that's probably going to become available. I'd, say around halloween weather and other conditions allowing and then the laurel hill terrorist staircase, which this committee also advocated for, has resumed and, let's see, probably it's going to be completed by the end of the year at audubon playground. The community parks initiative site that this committee also advocated for constructions resumed. We have a series of safety inspections, we're hoping we want to get that site or portions of it available to the two adjacent schools in time for school reopening september 21st. So that's our aim, but that'll be good news. The comfort station was bid separately, so that will be happening at a later date, but construction has resumed there as well. We are still, I know since I know sally's gonna ask we're still waiting for omb to green light. Some of the projects where we awarded to contractors like anne loftus playground and the inward nature center since those contracts hadn't been registered with the controller, yet they're sort of in holding patterns still with the city's office of management and budget, and that's actually the case with several of our projects. But I won't go into all of them because I know you want to do your budget priorities. I did want to say: we've got some additional stewardship days coming up three at inwood hill park. If you want to work in the forest which continues to be amazing, park, stewardship has a day coming up september, 17th from 9 to 12 and also on september 26th. If you don't want to go to sally's blogging event or if you want to, if you want to work up in the woods 9 to 12 on the 26th and then with partnerships for parks, there's going to be, if you don't want to work in the forest, but you want to help clean up and be an ambassador in the regular areas of the park. That's on probably on september 20th and that's going to be in the afternoon and evening before trying park. We've got three upcoming stewardship days this saturday, from 10 to one on broadway and arden street, also on september, 26th, broadway and arden again 10 a.m, and on september 20th at 10 a.m. At margaret corbin circle, so questions so the on just on the revel somebody in the motorbike issue. So something to keep in mind is yes go revel.com. If you see somebody abusing a rebel either driving on the sidewalk or driving on a park pad take a photo the license plate and send it to revel they'll revoke that person's subscription for violations. Many people have asked if park enforcement is doing anything about the motorbikes and the revel scooters. As a matter of principle, the parks department park, peace and peace officers and the NYPD will not give chase to a motorized vehicle on a pedestrian path does not end well, and I guess, as a matter of practice it it ends up. It could potentially end up hurting unsuspecting pedestrians on those paths. So what tends to happen is if pep is patrolling a site and they see a rebel scooter inside a playground or if they're patrolling a site, and they see the rebel scooter parked at the tennis court, then they can issue a summons, because obviously you had to drive it on the park path to get there, but the pedestrian safety really has to be a priority on the pedestrian paths. There was another question: there were a couple of specific, very specific questions, so I'm seeing one calculating for rabies prophylactic enough inoculation for rabies, so mark's. The omh brought back its prophylactic rabies inoculation program. The relative cost of this program versus rabies treatment. Right. I don't know what the relative cost is. As you may know, if you've attended meetings in the past, we've done two rounds of with the doh and NYC wildlife, the of inoculating the skunks and raccoons when they, when they can obtain them. They also have done two rounds of the prophylactic. They look like the ketchup packets. They don't hurt dogs, you know if they eat too they'll vomit it up, but they'll remain safe, but they do keep the they do end up inoculating the animals from rabies, so that has two rounds of that has already been done. I can go back to wildlife and see if sort of a certain threshold has been met where they deemed that would will be, is necessary. There's also there's a question. The question about par cleaning schedules, posting the cleaning schedules and the bathrooms specifically the bathroom and the hudson river greenway park off of 157th street is not being cleaned. I mean, I know that there are staffing issues, but I think just having the chat 158's point that having the schedule be posted is useful. Okay, so I can ask that site is administered by the riverside park, administrator and fort washington park. Administrator, so I can ask them if they can post it okay, but if the if it can be posted for others as well, I'm just going to go through some of these other questions. Before I hit you danielle. That would be useful. There's also a question about parks enforcement personnel. I'm going to paraphrase this because it gets to a larger a larger point. Would it help if parks enforcement personnel were working at night when littering occurs and handing out tickets so speak a little bit about what the staffing is for pap, what their scheduling is and how best to you know, leverage that limited resource sure, so the park enforcement division schedules do change. There's there are things we do special operations. If we're doing a joint outreach for an encampment. You know people may change their schedules, be with department of homeless services or do hmas. When we're doing that outreach, we do have two tours one during the day at time. Hours where you know public education can happen, we can prevent certain things from being set up to begin with and then there's the later shift and staff are until 10. periodically. We do. If we're doing a joint operation with the NYPD again, schedules will be changing. Sometimes those are overnight, depending on what type of condition it is that they're responding to. But it's right now the there are two shifts in northern Manhattan parks and north Manhattan parks. The park enforcement pod that is based out of hybrid, serves all of the parks, not just northern Manhattan park, 660 acres, everything down to 110th street. I think there are two sergeants seven officers and two officers in training, so they're covering quite a bit of land. So there are two things that are helpful for that generally patterns. If people are calling your conditions to 3-1-1, even if they're not able to respond right, then same with central communications, even if they're not able to respond right, then because of staff limitations or they're dealing with another special assignment, it helps sort of track what the patterns are and then they can change their deployment of staff accordingly. So I would that would definitely help them, and you know you can always for people all the time forward, complaints and issues to me and I send that to the Manhattan captain, so they can deploy accordingly or if something pops up, which often happens. Then you know and depending on the magnitude of it, then obviously we have to adjust our plans to address the condition that has popped up, but so we have our regular sort of parameters and then we have to deal with conditions as they come up as staffing allows. Sometimes we find out about those things in advance, maybe a day or two. Sometimes we don't so there has to be lots of flexibility, but the more information that division has. The better planning and deployment can happen. But as many people know here, we have also been dealing with lots of pop-ups, so that is has definitely been a challenge on parks property out in the streets on amtrak's property. Can you also speak to because there's been? There are a couple of questions in the chat about just sort of general partying large groups of people there's trash they're not wearing masks. There's I mean none of these complaints or observations are new. What's the ongoing way of dealing with this, because, right so park enforcement and social distance ambassadors that usually, you know, would be assigned to recreation divisions our recreation center right now, people don't know is a Covid-19 testing site, one of our rec centers at highbridge. So some of the recreation staff have been serving as ambassadors. The urban park rangers had some temporary social distance ambassadors, lots of education and mask handing out is being done. That doesn't always mean that people comply, but the education of making the masks available helps encourage that compliance other times. If there's a large scale event, there's amplified sound and it's clearly a safety issue, then parks or police have to come and sort of disperse that gathering, depending on you know what it consists of. Okay, all right. I know that there are some questions from the from the committee, but we've got a couple of people who have been in the in the public who have been patiently waiting with their hands up. Fortunately, it's a virtual hand, so nobody's circulation is dying, but I would like to recognize in the order in which I saw their hands raised cynthia auburn one minute question what you got okay, so I've lived across the street from inward hill park since 1999, and every year conditions in the park grow increasingly worse and this year the litter has been prolific, there's barbecuing all over the park. But what I want to focus on is the noise and the ear splitting decibel level that we have been subject to swapped out. Sound systems in car systems are replete on the streets adjacent to the park. There's a ton of amplified music without permits in the park competing boom boxes. I haven't gotten a good night's sleep all summer long and I would like to ask jennifer if she could please come up with a plan with goals and milestones for addressing this situation and we're all resource constrained, but we are still all held to the same performance standards we were all held to pre-covered and it's becoming unlivable in the neighborhood, and I just would really like the parks department to please once and for all, come up with a plan to put an end to this. Thank you before you address that I just wanna there's somebody else who threw up is essentially the same issue. That's happening at dungan and broadway, and you know we know what the hot spots are and it's continuing to be an issue. Okay, thanks sure- and I would also you know, the NYPD responds to the 311 calls about noise complaints. They haven't been, though jennifer. That's the thing they have not been. Did you say, call the clinton again and two minutes later it's closed down, so they're not responding, they may say they are, but they're not and that's been raised at a community precinct council uh-huh yeah, it's a huge problem. I know we have been. You know when we're following the social media with the pop-up parties and now with the pop-up tournaments. You know there are divisions that follow social media to track things and helpful people in the community also give us heads up. That's that something's happening, so we were able to prevent a certain large-scale gathering on saturday in a portion of inland hill park, but I understand in another area of the park. You know there was a another large-scale event, so I think part of the you know challenges absolutely is being having you know, limited resources and it's unfortunately, not just inwood hill park, it's at many of our other sites, but I'm happy to go back to the the 34th and see now I mean my only comment is that this doesn't seem to be happening in central park and riverside park and I'm actually going to stop you right. There I'm going to stop you right there ma'am it's absolutely happening in pretty much every park in the city that doesn't that doesn't mean it's okay. I don't. I say that not to say that it's happening everywhere. So you know that information, because I was unaware of it but yeah. It's not. It's not like every park has no problems and it's only happening here. It's literally happening in every other park, including I was unaware of that liz. So thank you for informing me. There was an article today about washington square park and a big party that nyu threw cynthia and then a few weeks ago you know prospect park, oh prospect park, Brooklyn Queens, I'm not excusing it, and this is my community too, but I guess what I'm saying is you know it's, whereas maybe it's been isolated before it's much more broad spread, so okay, but if you everything at once has definitely been a challenge if you jennifer and steve, if he's still on the call could reach out agency to agency to the NYPD, I feel like that would go a long way in the NYPD, realizing that it's not just you know six people from the community that don't have anything better to do with their time than complain that this is a real problem and that you as an agency need their help as well as an agency for them to do their law enforcement job. But just to be clear, I don't know if you heard me earlier, we do work closely with them. We did just do a special operation this past weekend in response to some intel we were given. So I don't, I don't think they're necessarily. You know the suggestion that they're, shirking I don't think is accurate. I just think I didn't imply that I mean I all I'm saying is that when we call 3-1-1 yeah, that will absolutely happen later. It's closed down and I gotta move on to other people. Yes, absolutely. I will follow up with that, because that definitely seems yeah thanks a lot yes. So I think that also addresses jennifer bristol's question about had a similar question. Although she did have, she did throw out props to parks and she also had a question about the bingo players at arden and broadway. So the I we don't endorse the bingo players at broadway and arden. They had been you know inside the playground before and then because of the tree damage they sort of relocated, we'll continue to work on that as the larger scale event problem. You know winds down. We hope with. If someone could just ask them to clean up after themselves and to wear some masks, it wouldn't be tough. It would go a long way, absolutely tanya, bonner yeah. Can you hear me? Yes, ma'am, okay, yeah very quickly. I I'm here to address noise issues and illegal activity happening in our parks. It has been as cynthia alluded to affecting people's health inability to sleep and also people's mental health. There are people in our community who are elderly. We have veterans, people have reached out. We have people who have to go to work. We have children school is about to start how are kids supposed to get proper sleep and do their homework. I asked people I reached out to some community members, though this was not scientific. Just to give some people information about problem areas in the park in will hill park took to took the cake for problems. Most of the problems seem to be in inwood, though there was about 29 percent of the problem parks were in washington heights. I can speak to mckenna square being particularly problematic. Some of the illegal activity that is prohibited in parks concluded loud music with dj type equipment, law, parties, drinking illegal drug use, fireworks large gatherings, not to mention so many other things I- and this was all most of this- was happening between 5 p.m and 6 a.m. According to the people that we spoke to, so people are filing 311 complaints about half did half didn't, but the reason the other half said they did not it's, because nothing ever happens. Just like cynthia mentioned things are closed out within a few minutes people. I know I personally contact the precinct specifically directly because I don't have time to waste on 3-1-1 and most people are not even aware half of the people wonder where there's even a parks enforcement unit. That's that should help with this issue. So I want to say that this, like, as I said this has been going on for quite a long time. I have an issue with it's happening, other places, I have to say I went to graduate school at columbia university and that's near 116th street riverside park, and I can tell you well, you can hear a pin drop at 116. all the way that whole strip over riverside drive. You can hear a pin drop. I was not seeing parties. I was not seeing people doing liquor, shooting up smoking weed. I was not seeing people having barbecues. I was not seeing any of that and one day except a couple times. I was sitting in the park and police pulled up and asked me what I was doing there, because I'm just sitting there relaxing and I was asked why I was there at night wow. I don't even know how to respond to that. That's outrageous! This is going to sound. Like I'm passing the book, I'm not there's. We know there's a huge enforcement issue in terms of whether and how the NYPD enforces stuff and how, when and where they deploy their resources, to get a handle on some of these things and although a lot of it, what you're articulating is happening in parks, it's the NYPD, that's doing the enforcement or should be doing the enforcement or isn't doing enforcement. It's not, and I know that this is a conversation that happened last week at public safety. I don't really have anything to add to that liz. Yes, I just wanted to. I was actually just going to mention that that we talked about this at the public safety committee meeting the other day, and I asked the officers if they always respond to every 3-1-1 complaint, and they said yes, so I just wanted to mention that, but also they mentioned. They just reiterated that when they have competing calls, they have to sort of triage and something like a robbery or burglary would be higher priority than like a noise complaint, for example. But they say they say that they do respond to every call. They don't all right. Just wanted to. Just wanted to report what they said during that meeting fiction. Don't I don't doubt that they said that it is. It is true that they said that, because I was actually on briefly on that call, and I heard them say that, and I made a point to ask: if they always respond to every one call and they, yes, you did. Yes, you did so again. Tanya is saying she got cut off. Can she live? Is there on that issue? I was wondering do when they do respond to 311 complaints when they close it out. Do they check out how it's done, how that follow-up is done? I can answer to that and myself and a few other people are actually going to be filing an foia about that. Yes, the officer it is first registered you do it on 3-1-1. It is then sent to the precinct officer at the desk. The desk officer then sends it out to a sector car or an nco decides who to send it to that is recorded in a computer, so it is known who the officer at the desk is and who it is sent to. Then the person or officer that it is sent to then evaluates it, takes an action and that the officers currently have these like tablets and special iphones and in those iphones. They then record what action that they took like unfounded, or you know, complaint resolved or whatever that they did, and so that also, then, is by a code of the officer's identity, which we will be pursuing in a few cases, especially these ones that are closed out in a minute. Thank you much. Thank you. That's super helpful. Look liz, yes, ma'am, okay, lin yeah, so I had just some questions I wanted to know. I understand that the you know police are supposed to be. I just I'm just not clear on who's supposed to be doing what and these are park, rules that are being broken, so parks can't be separate from what police are doing so police and parks need to work in tandem to deal with this issue, and I, when I go to police precinct the 33rd, they told me there's a park cross street. A party was happening and I said, are you kidding me like? This? Was three o'clock in the morning and they said well, the parks department's supposed that's their job to handle that that's what they told me and that they feel like it's, the parks department's responsibility to address those issues that are happening in the parks and so I'm confused. It's a lot of passing of the bug. Well, it's them! And it's not us it's us and it's not it's! You know it's just. I don't really care who it is. I just want this problem addressed because, as I said, I want some data that shows that central park and riverside park are having the same issues that we're having. I want some evidence and I'm going to ask for that data because I'd like to speak to them. I'd like to speak to that. First of all, we compare this to central park, prospect park or battery park. That's actually an unfair comparison because they have conservancies where they have privately hired police. So, under the city budget we receive the same amount of officers per capita or park space that, for example, central park does, but they augment that with a tremendous number of private officers that are hired through the conservancy, we are a poor neighborhood. We do not have that other phalanx of officers that central park or battery park has so that point me the next point I'd like to make. Yes, the NYPD is supposed to be in the park. Beware of information you get from the person who answers the phone in the precinct. That often can be a rookie officer who needs more training. Yes, the NYPD is supposed to be in the parks and at least to be in the park. Half officers especially get off earlier in the day and the NYPD is supposed to be more of the evening presence. They need to have bicycles that they have gotten in the last year to ride in the parks scooters. So that is not the case jennifer. I think you should take over, maybe from there sure just to make clear that crime is the sort of under the purview of the NYPD. The peace officers that form the park enforcement patrol are public education. You know, if you don't have a permit, they can issue you a summons. They can issue a parking ticket, but if they're, if it seems like there's a criminal element to what's happening, then that is for the you know: trained NYPD or agency. It's not our peace officers, so also pep offices do not arrest only NYPD officers arrest. This is correct. They also are not weaponized so, depending on the size and type of condition that they're being asked to respond to. It may be more appropriate for police officers or a team of police officers to respond to. Given you know the safe, the safety of the individual, okay, I'm not sure I keep tanya keeps cutting out, I'm not sure what keeps happening to her, but I just had a quick question. Yes, it's not related to this at all, but it's just about inspiration point. I know there was a large piece of debris on the left side of it. I don't know if that's been addressed, is it? Is it tree debris? No, it looks. It looks like a large piece of furniture. It's probably about a roadway versus six feet across somebody pulled over on the side of the highway and dumped. Is that what you're I mean it's pretty far from the highway. I mean it's under it's in the point: yeah, it's okay yeah. It was there yesterday for sure. We definitely unfortunately had more illegal dumping at all of our park. Perimeters, it was round, so maybe they did just roll it. Who knows? Okay, construction, probably construction, debris, that's the way where more fly-by-night construction companies routinely dump in the parks in order to avoid garbage cartage fees. It's a real ongoing problem for the parks parliament park, especially against it's oh and highbridge park along the harlem river drive dikeman rest by the one train park, terrace west. We get lots of contractor dumping and restaurant dumping and it impedes our ability. You know our garbage trucks get filled with that. Instead of you know regular park trash we're having to take all that to the dump on top of everything else, so it definitely makes things more challenging than they need to be. So if you see someone looking like they're, jumping call sanitation call the NYPD enforcement yeah liz, I would like to make the comment to sort of sum up. This discussion time you raised yeah we can. We cannot expect the NYPD to, for example, going with four officers and confront a group of 50 to 75, because that has a certain right potential for it, but it seems to me especially over the next four weekends, which has been very effective enforcement in the past that we know in the park that in the mornings, what seemed to be semi-professionally, organized gatherings, probably by djs promoters, who have a good twitter list or email list or text list, are organizing large groups of parties. They are bringing in beer on hand, trucks, they're, bringing in refreshments they're, bringing in professionally sized speakers and setting up outdoor parties. I mean professional outdoor parties in the past. We've also seen that on fort george hill we've seen that at the edges of highbridge park by the harlem river. What I would like to request is that the pep and the NYPD be there at indian road and 207th street along their saturday morning, sunday morning, starting at nine o'clock and confiscate the stuff you're not allowed to have alcohol in the park when they start to bring it in on the hand, truck it'd be confiscated, you're not allowed to have loud speakers in the park you confiscate that has been traditionally done in the past has been successful, they're isolated. At that point, the party is off. The party is called off. That will be a tremendous service to our neighbors in inwood, so that they can actually use the park in these last weeks of summer, because what's really happened is that the residents of inwood have been both by and large, vanished from the park and these revelers, and these this you know, anti-social sub-group- have taken over our parks to the detriment of our own community. So I really request that the peps and the police be there in the mornings through the afternoon of saturday and sunday and start confiscating. So I will say that the police set up across dikeman street has been incredibly effective in stopping that party before it starts. So this is a strategy that the precinct knows works and yeah. So I don't. Your point is extremely well taken. I will work with curtis to communicate that to the to the precinct and to the ncos jennifer. If you could back me up on, that would be really helpful liz. Yes, I'm sorry this may not be for us necessarily, but this was in the chat. Some people are asking about the precinct community council meetings and most they haven't happened really, since the start, so the precinct community council hasn't really been meeting since kobig. Barbara is a member of the precinct community council, as is olivia, grant who's the person who put that up in the chat the neighborhood coordination officers have been meeting. But again I want to make very clear. This is an important issue. This is an issue that I care about and that all of the people who have been commenting in the chat and that we all care about this is the parks and cultural affairs committee and while a lot of those issues are happening in parks, that's a public safety, that's a different committee, so you can tell me that I'm passing the buck. I am not I'm trying to keep focused on what is the purview of this committee, so I think we've made really clear all of the ways in which this is a huge problem. We still have a very large agenda item to get through, so I would respectfully request that, unless the question you are about to ask or comment you are about to make is something that has not been asked or said already to. Please yield your time. Well liz. You asked about the community council, it was in march. It was cancelled by one pp, I'm the secretary of the 34th precinct community council. We wish to continue it on one kp canceled, all the community councils around the city out of concern about Covid-19. There was also a tendency to allow zoo meetings due to the fact of privacy issues, etc. I hope that we will have our september community council meeting at least via zoom. We will see- and I will be in touch with the precinct this week, which also then will be raising the issues that I just raised. Thank you. I appreciate that and thank you. Thank you. It's very helpful. Yes sally. Okay, I have some questions for jennifer, which are not related to the noise thing. First, just to re-emphasize that we do friends in wood hill park has equipment that we can loan grabbers and gloves if people want to do cleanups. Second, regarding the masks, because that's a huge issue also, especially because we have the highest proportion or the fourth highest in the city of essential workers, I participated with the mta when they send out the mass force all over the subway system and bus lines and stuff, like that to hand out free mass. I wonder if we could consider something like that- maybe done it doesn't have to be done by the parks department, but it could be done in parks with the assistance of department of health and mental hygiene. So that's 0.2 sort of like a maybe two days and weekends would be best, obviously, because that's where the crowds are there. My third thing is just to thank you for getting the signage up almost immediately colombia in the parks after the first raccoon incident, which was with a friend of mine and finally, just a question and a request to jennifer, I'm glad that the parks are open to the outdoor learning initiative. I wonder if we could also, I know it's been brought up. I have seen at least one article but consider using community gardens like the rain garden, that they become part of the outdoor learning initiative as well. We have lots to teach, but as of now, we can't hold public events, we would love to work with school children. So that's it I'd like to say something briefly. If it's okay, yep, I don't want to start a debate and I don't want to be a contrarian and I think I've considered yielding my time because I know we have to move on. But at the same time I feel that I must say I must remind us that we are in the midst of a pandemic, and people are not able to gather indoors so they're gathering in the parks. And so I guess I want to push back against what was said a few moments ago about you know like heavily enforcing certain things and targeting people who are gathering in the parks, especially if it's daytime I can understand, because the concerns around noise at the in the evenings when people are trying to sleep like tanya raised before. But I think it's just important to remember. That parks are from people together to have fun to listen to music and while it might not be our preference or the preferences of some to have these gatherings that I just I feel like. I really need to push back against that, especially because our community is predominantly a community of color, and this is where people are gathering love her. So I just think it's really important to remember that, especially also just another thing that's happening in the world right now is the killing of a lot of black people of color, and I think that's another reason why maybe the police are perhaps not necessarily enforcing these things because potentially trying to minimize those sorts of interactions that could escalate. So I just wanted to say my little piece thank you and I would like to second the sentiment of everything that danielle just said. Thank you. Thank you. Aisha welcome another committee, member yeah, it's it's a balance, it's a balance and it's a balance. There are a lot of people who use the parks in ways that are not how other people might not might use the parks and it's a balance, and we have to figure out how to use parks together. I think barbara's point is well taken that there's an advantage to some level of being proactive in a way that is not being punitive because yes, people should absolutely be able to use public parks, their public parks. With that, I would very much like to move the agenda to the preliminar to preliminary discussion of capital and expense budget items. I'm just trying to see. If I can screen share this, can you all see? Can you all see cb12m parks and cultural affairs fy 21 capital budget rankings? Is that visible? Yes, excellent, whoa, old dog, new tricks? Okay, so these are the the capital items from last year, I'm gonna mute. Somebody's got some background noise, so I'm just gonna mute everybody jennifer, I'm going to need you to tell me a little bit about some of these items. These are in the order that we had that we discussed them la that we had them last year, not in the that we had ranked them last year. So can you just quickly walk me through, which are the items that may have already been done and need to be moved to continuing support? Okay, so the nature center is fully funded. That is a project that right now is in a holding pattern because of the office of management and budget freeze on new expenditures, but it is fully funded. Designed has all the approvals raul wallenberg is still in need. The basketball court renovation, the eastern portion of an loftus playground, is not funded. I know that which are the ones that should be removed. They're done nature center, though, doesn't include displays or anything like that right. That's just the building there is funding for interior displays, there's not the funding for the sort of like rain, gardens and learning gardens that would sort of retrofit the asphalt apron into more like learning space, so that is correct yeah. We need to include that just for the what's not included. Okay, these are all still needs okay, so the only thing that comes out is the nature center and, if there's additional work that needs to be done in the nature center, that would be a new item. The landscape, the learning landscape would be a new item yeah and I would propose we add that okay and then on the expense and now in an email that I had sent out. I had added because typically what we do when we are looking at the capital and expense priorities, is we take the previous year's list? We remove items that have been funded or, for whatever reason are no longer relevant. They've been completed, they've been rolled into some other project. What have you and then we add new items that have come up over the course of the previous year's discussion and anything else that we might want to add. We will not be doing our ranking this evening, we'll be doing our ranking next month, but it's a lot to take in so I like to spend some time at the september meeting talking about some of the items so that we can, you know, think about it, have some preliminary conversation and then circle back to it next month. So we would add community, I think, in your email you said we could add the community garden. So among okay. I finally found my email, so what I enrolled in based on a review of the meeting minutes from the previous year is urban gardening, including funding for possibly the space behind gw high school or some other space, but funding for a space for urban gardening, and we do have- I mean, there's two hundred thousand dollars that is somewhere that was already allocated. It might be recapturing those dollars. Yes, there was the discussion of some kind of equipment for better trash management in uptown parks. The several months ago, we had suggestion about dumpsters and dumpsters aren't as simple as just dumpsters. If you're going to add dumpsters, you also need the trucks that can pick up and empty a dumpster. So if that's a capital need that we want to add to our priority list, that's something that came up in conversation and then there had been the basketball courts on 186th street and some repairs to that. There are some drainage issues. There are some paving issues and the courts themselves are really kind of a nightmare and they could use a substantial overhaul so based on a review of the last year. Those would be the three projects that had been discussed and then there's the issue of the learning landscape. Yes, jennifer just want to clarify that there's about 460 000 right now in the 186th street courts. Okay- and I think the projected estimate was something like 750 000, 800, 000, okay, so the estimate so there's you said: 460 000. I think it's about that and it's like 750 or 800 000 project. So it basically needs an additional three 350.. The last time it was estimated out. Yes, okay now can we ask about the state of certain structures now so liz? I'm not sure. Are you paying attention to the hand raise in the zoom or are we just okay? I I'm not gonna lie because I was sharing screen. I can't see that so I'm going to unshare my screen so that I can go back to that. Okay, I've got hands raised all right, so thank you. So we've got aisha and then I'm gonna pull a recognizer. I have a question okay before I get to you, though daryl I'm going to recognize steve because I'm pretty sure he's got something relevant to say about capital ayesha, so from housing and youth in ed. I was in the habit of seeing the register being used to be able to see what the city responded. I'm assuming that, because jennifer's here, maybe we don't need to use the register in order to make those comparisons right. Okay, that being said, can you walk me through the reason why some of our parks- or, I guess maybe all of our parks- I don't really know what it is, do or don't have cameras in them. The reason why I bring this up is because I had looked into it, and I saw an article that stated something about bringing cameras to parks and the question came up because of the thing that took place recently in for trying. So I was just wondering what is the actual answer as to whether there is or isn't cameras in some or all of our parks, and if there isn't, what is the justification for that? I just wanted to know background because, depending on what the answer is, then maybe that's something that I'd want to suggest an answer. Yeah please so most of the parks do not have cameras, and part of that is because of the service contracts it requires. You need somebody to be monitoring it. When senator jackson was a council member, I believe he gave funding for the NYPD to put cameras in problem areas to have tracking I'm not sure what came of that. But that way, if anything is happening, you know they could they'd have somebody monitoring those cameras. They could respond. So it's it was more of a question of where did it make sense operationally and what was the most sustainable okay, so I just want to say based on that there's ai technology. Now that has the ability to do surveillance without the use of a human and even to be able to make assessments on types of behaviors that it and quantify those behaviors and alert whoever based on that. So that's something that can be put for consideration but yeah. Thank you for the answer. Okay, yeah, I mean we can totally put anything anybody wants for consideration. Reasonable people can and do disagree on whether cameras in parks are a good idea for the obvious public safety benefits or a bad idea for the equally obvious creepiness factor. So you know different people are just going to come down on that differently, but there's no reason not to include it as an item steve, I'm gonna take you off of mute, but before you ask your question, I do see a question in the chat from trish anderton about shoreline preservation and bulkhead repairs. Wasn't that funded or is this a different section of park of shoreline? So if you could just offer some clarification, either jennifer or steve on that item, so I know whether I should be removing it or including it yeah. I think you should remove it because I can double check before your next meeting, but I believe this is a project which has been funded by fema and which in fact, is already underway. So I'm I don't think it needs to take up space on your list. But what I would suggest possibly is that you might want to consider as a long-term item for as a budget request the what we refer to as the lighthouse link the extension of the greenway north of the bridge, bringing it down into into the lower level of fort washington park. So we could have a continuous greenway along the river if I think that might be a a beneficial thing to have in a legitimate item for the community board, and that is something that has been discussed previously, not so recently. But yes, okay- and the last thing I want to say is when I have a couple of other things actually on the. I would not a hold to that estimate for the 186th street basketball court. That estimate that jennifer gave you is about a year old and all of our estimates are going to go up by probably six percent or more, as we calculate for the fiscal year 22 budget. The other thing I want to mention. I want to correct something that barbara said earlier. There are no private police in central park riverside park or battery park. There are private police, I believe, in battery park city, but that's not a city park in battery park. There are no private police. What central park has we have maybe four pep officers assigned to that entire park. What they do have is their own police precinct. Riverside park also has a unlimited detail of pep officers. The other thing I want to say is on cameras. I would not recommend making that a capital project request for your committee. We've had mixed experience, putting in cameras in fort trying, I believe in iceland, in other parks around Manhattan, and the reality is that it's much more effective, much more efficient. If the cameras, if the cameras are installed directly by NYPD and are made part of the NYPD system, it doesn't make sense to have a camera here, camera there, which is not part of NYPD. They then have to come over to us. We have to try to download the camera. It's a it's a much more efficient system if all the cameras are operated by NYPD. So then, if I'm hearing you correctly and dovetailing with aisha's suggestion, I can in the same way that I will be communicating to the traffic and transportation committee the feedback earlier about the margaret bourbon drive. I should be communicating with curtis about you know this ongoing obvious issue related to enforcement, which is an expense item, not a capital item, but that there was interest within the committee to have some cameras in certain parks areas and let that be part of the nypd's appointments, and I would add to that decibel readers. It's the same sort of issue in shock spotters. I had an item and I'm not sure it did come up in meetings, I'm not sure where to put it, which is more sort of sustainability. Things it'd come up when we talked about the baseball fields, but having no touch, you know like more modern, like bottle fillers having no touch water, fountains and also having recycling dollars devoted to education and equipment so that we can recycle. I know that the pilot was a failure, but we can always do better when we do our cleanups. We actually do separate recyclables, but we have to take them out of the park and I would like to see this committee advocate for both expense dollars and capital dollars to go into some sustainability initiatives. Okay, just to respond to that. I it's been our practice as a committee when we have capital items, capital projects that we ask for bottle, fillers and those kinds of updated, upgraded fixtures, but retrofitting existing it's way more efficient to just upgrade them every time, there's a playground or whatever whole project. So I wouldn't actually it's not going to be particularly efficient or particularly likely to happen. If we just say we want new bottle fillers all throughout the system. The problem is when it's been brought up, it hasn't been included. I would requested a minimum that they'd be in our largest park, which is inwood hill park, but I think it's. I think it's unfortunate that they're not there and I'm embarrassed as a member of this committee that we haven't pushed more aggressively for recycling right. I get I didn't get to recycling, yet I was specifically about bottle pills in terms of recycling, I'm totally with you and I- and I think and steve can correct me, but I think that should be a larger expense item through the health and environment committee to address recycling throughout the district, including in our parks. But I think, if we have like a recycling item about recycling generally and a secondary recycling item about recycling in parks, we're less likely to get what we want, we're more likely to get what we want. If we have a single recycling item coming through steve's committee, yes, because it is it's up to the department of sanitation, okay, so if they're I'm happy with that dealing with the public safety or health committee, rather it should go there. Okay am I am I still on. Can I say something? Yes, you are still on. I think sally. The we did include a bottle filler in the in the plan for inward hill park. Ball field number one. Yes, we did and it was the last one though it was, and you moved it out of the dugout at one point it was in the dugout. I can't tell you right now where it is, but I believe it's part of the plan and I believe we now as a standard practice. We included, I think, in all of our playgrounds. I know I. Yes, I presented a plan to community board six last weekend. It was in the playground I presented to them, but could I, but as long as we're mentioning inwood hill park ball fields, could I point out to you liz that you might want to include that as one of your capital project items as well, because at this point we have the funding to do three of the five fields we're going to need money at some point soon to do the other two fields right. So that's ball fields, two and four. No, it's I think, damn it. I think it's three and five three and five one, two right: okay, where no it's four and five, it's four and five that aren't done four and five. I don't know what two and four are part of the plan with number one. You know I don't know my next, we'll figure it by next month, we'll figure it out the other for the moment, the other two and there was certainly clear enough feedback. That's actually my bad for not having included that as an item that had come up previously, because there was broad support for the for the one ball field and then for expanding it to the three ball fields, and many people asked what about the other two. So, yes, they should be added okay and then yes, sarah, okay yeah. I just had some questions about possible and I know maybe what's best for jennifer or steve to maybe prioritize us or tell us where it is now in terms of repair or replacement of certain fixtures in the park. One is the 181st street pedestrian bridge. That was one then there's the other pedestrian bridge. That's that is a d.o.t bridge by the way. No it's our bridge, but it's going to be rebuilt by d.o.t by ddc, yeah. Well, yeah! Well, I think it's a d.o.t project. In any case, it's it is a fully funded project. It is somewhere in the pipeline. I've been I've been trying to find out actually whether or not it's being held up by omb and by the time of your next meeting, we'll get you an update on where it stands. Okay, for now we don't need any. No, I don't think so. Okay, and what about the other pedestrian bridge in the east eastern side of the western side of inwood hill park, has not been funded by DOT. Yet, do you think it's needed it's? It gets inspected as part of their bridge inspection program. We can check, but we haven't been approached recently about it needing upgrades or overall, and I was also wondering about mcnally plaza. That seems to be in some sort of disrepair at the moment. Do you mean mckenna that was mcnap by the bridge by the one bridge at 186 in laurel hill terrace? That's correct? Yes, oh first, I've heard of that yeah. It's been recently repaved, all right. Some of the fixtures look like they're broken. What do you mean by fixtures benches? There's a fence there around a sign. Okay, we can take a look at that. You don't have to list that as a capital project- yeah- probably not a capital, probably just expense. Okay, and what about inspiration point? I know it looks like some of it is chipped off the rebar yeah. The stairs will would need to be reconstructed. Is this a capital project or no? Yes, probably it's pretty deteriorated. The rebar is coming out and that would so that would be inspiration, point fort washington, park, yeah and then the last thing I had was for it's specific, so inspiration point what the structure itself the structure itself. You know if we're gonna be, if we're gonna be taking a capital, look at it. We should just make sure that it's structurally sound, because it's actually you're standing on. What's the second story of it, when you're looking out at the overlook so underneath and then there's lots of spalling of the the staircase that it's like three stairs that provide access to the brick patio and they're pretty far gone. What would you call that? It's not a gazebo, it's a it's a portico! Thank you, portugal, nice jennifer, something that hasn't been. I'm sorry sally. Sarah! I just had one more I'm sorry it was. It was just the I don't know what you call it: it's around 175th street below that path that goes down just west of j hood wright park, haven, avenue, yeah, that's in really bad shape, the fencing and the path and all that there, the lighting is working now, but it the whole area, is constantly under construction. I don't know if you can tell there's a temporary ramp right now and there's the walkway work. Is that ours, portions of it, portions of it or port authority? Portions of it are state DOT, some of it's city, d.o.t and some of its parks. I would love to do a tour of that when we're able okay. Thank you. Thank you for bringing up inspiration, point yeah. It's the past year. It's really gotten much worse, yeah, okay, sally! You got something quick, okay, the other capital item I know again. This is something that was supposed to be funded in year, two of participatory budgeting, but tree pit guards along broadway and other areas, because I think parks invest a lot of money in trees that continue to die, most of which, I think are reported within the contracted time frame, but some of which are not- and I just wonder if we made a push for tree pick guards so are tree pit guards capitally eligible. If you have yes only for trees that have been planted within a two year time frame anything beyond two years, you'd have to use expense funding for it. I think yeah, because I know other districts have done it through participatory budgeting. I know like corey, johnson's district, okay, all right, so these items will be added. I want to just take a quick look at the expense items I'm gonna screen share again briefly, during which I will not be able to see raised hands. So we did also have a question about non-parks items, and I just want to remind people that we do have a capital item regarding supporting the hispanic society and their accessibility. All right are you seeing parks and cultural affairs. Fy 21 expense, budget rankings? Yes, okay, so we have six items: additional pep forestry crew, increasing DCLA funding, increasing funding for various. It's a catch-all item, just increasing parks's funding for various different kinds of staff from playground associates to recreational associates urban park rangers for a variety of the programming that they offer: funding additional staff for sanitation, maintenance and operations and horticulture, and maintaining funding to continue to provide six days of services for libraries, which I don't know if that's going to come out of our committee or come out of education. Libraries seem to bounce between education, youth and parks and cultural affairs from this conversation that we've had this evening and from conversations that we've had over the past year. I don't know that there's a whole lot of new capital items, but new expense items that aren't already covered under these six categories. I think these sort of are ongoing, needs and are likely to be even ongoing, given the budget cutbacks, and I think that you know we're already seeing the incredible detriment to people's quality of life when these programs aren't supported. So I was just curious: did: did parks department get a artist in resident from DCLA this year? I'm sorry say that again did they get an artist in residence that I'm aware of. Does I have a question about number six yeah? Do we want to think about including language about hours? In addition to the number of days, because I feel like children, I mean I'm just thinking about like after school and having a space the exact wording of the encapsulate encapsulized version of what the item is less important than how we explain. You know because there's the item and then there's a little bit of an explanation of what the item is. You know sure we could. We could say six days of service at nypl and after school programming that certainly makes sense expanded hours or something like that or maybe ex expand. I mean use modern terminology. I think we should have an item that talks about the outdoor learning initiative, because now it's not only after school, but it's during school. So I would like to see some sort of item that talks about dedicating dollars to the parks department for expanding their outdoor learning initiative in parks and community gardens. Well, actually, we don't spend any money on this initiative. This is money that would be spent by d.o.e yeah. That's a funding item. That's going to be coming from DOE, so it's not like I'm not agreeing with you, but that's gonna. That's gonna have to be advocacy through the youth and education committee. So if someone wants to write one of those emails to faye sure thanks what I would ask, if is that your item number five, be a jump to the top of your list in light of our budget cuts and if you could remain loose on this point, because we may have to come back to you next month, if the layoffs go through and give you some other news on where things stand with our staffing yeah, I mean clearly, the specifics on this is gonna is gonna change a little bit when we have some more information yeah. So I'm at this point sort of frankly getting back our m o staff and and the rest of our basic staff is more important, for instance, than having a dedicated forestry crew I like and then and then having the having some of the programming staff I mean once again, I we're not we're not ranking these items, so I actually want to get into a conversation about ranking these items. I just want to make sure that what the items are is complete so that when I send them out to people for their considerations, for when we are ranking them next month that we have a complete list, so I will be communicating to faye about outdoor learning and what was that somebody had some wording there expanded hours. No, that's really. I would play the outdoor learning initiative in parks, community gardens and other green spaces steve with the invasive removal, because that's you know, that's an issue. Would that fall under that budget line? I mean that request line, or is that why it would fall under forestry crew? We would love. We would that's why I think we need it with our avoidance of spraying and then the tree loss and the holes in the canopy. We have had a proliferation of invasives and we would absolutely love more foresters to be helping us in inwards, forest and high bridges forest for trying park. But you know it the general public priority, as steve notes, you know, is the trash and the park maintenance right, stop sharing, so that I can see if there we've got raised. Hands have one more thing: liz yeah. So I saw that on one of the items it's specified like specific groups like teens and children, and I would like to I'm not sure if we want to have this be a separate point or just like kind of include formally incarcerated people as another group to target for programming. Because I'd really like to see us, the rate of incarceration is pretty high in our area and we have a lot of people returning from jill, and I I know that the fortune society is around like 145th, but we don't really have to my knowledge, very many opportunities for programming up right. So more of that, I would agree with that, and that is intended to be an extremely general item so as not to micromanage how exactly parks does the best they can with whatever funds that they have. But I agree that that's an important, targeted group to add so, rather than having a new item, I would add that language to that item, I'm cool with that. Thank you and thank you. Okay, so I think that's all of the added items I see I've got jennifer bristol somebody's got a lot of background noise. I'm muting everybody jennifer, hey there. I just thought I wouldn't be doing my job. If I didn't mention the dogs in our community and the dog runs or the dog running for tryon- and I know you know for the last few months- I've been thinking about, of course, we're never going to get funding because of you know the budget cuts and the pandemic. But you know what I realized that during the pandemic and our close down how many people were begging for the dog runs to open for various reasons. Besides the dogs, it's a sense of community people. Socialize there they're safe there, their dogs are safe. There are a lot of problems with dogs being off leash, so I know it's a lot of friggin money, but I also think it's my responsibility. Since I've been on the call to at least bring that out to everyone's attention, because we haven't done that for a few years, so that was it. Thank you for everyone's hard work. Thank you and thank you for your for your comment appreciate that hold on a second yeah. You can you can speak alexis? Oh okay, thank you. So I want jennifer. I just want to let you know that there's been great admissions, helping swimming in different parks, dog, run parks, and if you want to talk to me about that, I'm happy to talk to you offline and the just concerned about because of the recent storm where there was a huge tree match that fell right into the porch of marshmallow. That now needs. Can we put another am in there, because now that porch is really rotted endanger and starting to look changed yeah the tree limb was removed. The to my knowledge, the tree limb did not really do damage to the porch everybody's hearing that yeah that's correct, jennifer, the tree branch. Actually, just it didn't fall on the porch over a series of days, the weight of the tree and they had it resting on the porch and there was really no damage. Besides some scraping of the paint we are, though, alexis sending forestry back to do an assessment. They remove the immediate hazard. We want to make sure you know, particularly given how historic the house is, that didn't destabilize the tree in any way and that there isn't. You know a potential threat of more coming down and damaging the house right and regarding the pending capital project, the porch in woodwork will be attended. As a part of that, I'm sorry alexis. I gotta, I gotta mute you because I can't you sound like you're talking from underwater. So if you want to shoot me a text or throw something into the chat, but I can't understand the word all right dragon. I took pictures of the dam, it seemed to have increased the rocks and all I'm asking is just. I just would like to see if there could be funding to help ex funding to help fix that. That's all I'm saying it's part of, I don't know if you heard shiloh or if you were disconnected, but the porch will be part of the sort of exterior restoration of, and I have been there because I've been taking pictures. Okay, thank you all right, so I have one more thing. Sorry sure I was just thinking about that boy that drowned in the in the world. I hear you, can you speak up? Sorry, I'm just I was thinking about. I was just thinking about any other ideas that I had and I thought about that boy that drowned in the water in inwood hill park. There were two boys, the two boys, I'm so sorry, the two boys that john I'm just wondering as long as we're thinking about projects and expenses and potential projects, is there anything that could be installed to try to prevent something like that from happening again in the future. So it's you know a worthy cause, but we have more than four miles of shoreline here. So it's not something that like capitally can happen, but what the parks department and the department of education and others have been doing. There's a program called swim for life and they go into certain communities, particularly communities of need like and in second grade you have mandatory swimming. So, like my son, you know goes to school east to broadway. He got the benefit of that program in second grade. The parks department also does in their rec centers, learn to swim programs, but more opportunities and access for learning how to swim is really key, because the physical obstructions would be of such a magnitude that it would really hurt sort of the visual openness of our community. Concurrent with all that, the marine operations division does at more sort of accessible entry. Points must go to marsh the dikeman beach, where there's almost immediate access into the waterways. There are call boxes, they're like rescue rings and the park part of the parks enforcement patrol's tasks is to go and check to make sure all of that is still intact. The warning signs about no swimming so that there's some level you know of deterrent there in public education there both. So there remain, you know still some fairly large on it. I think I think we're solid on the on the capital, an expense I'll, send out a revised list and remove the rankings, obviously so that we have them for our consideration and discussion next month. There continues to be sort of the lingering question and concern about the enforcement issue in parks, balancing legitimate use and the very compelling argument that danielle made that aisha echoed and that's been something. We've talked about a lot in this committee before as well. As you know, people's legitimate need to have some peace and quiet, and what is the parks department's role in that? And what is the pd's role in that? So you know again jennifer and steve if you can bring back to pep. I know that you have that they have limited resources. There aren't very many of them and there's a lot of ground to cover. But you know we're really struggling up here and it's frustrating to keep on having the same conversation and then you know it sort of goes away when the weather gets cooler and then it's a problem again the following spring. So it's a little bit, exhausting literally for those of us who aren't sleeping, and I don't really know how to solve it. We agree that it's important, we'll take it back, might be helpful to have inspector harris from pep come back next to your meeting next month. Report on you know what they are doing, what they have been dealing with, is it possible for her to get I mean I don't want to make work just to make work, but is it possible for her to provide you know monthly, some kind of just snapshot of what the staffing looks like and what the deployment looks like, so that we can just say: look here are the resources that we have and here's how they've been used in this area. We can request that, yes, that would be helpful and that way, and if she provides it, if she's able to provide it, then you know she maybe doesn't have to sit in a two and a half hour meeting yeah. That would be good but realize in terms of deployment that they're moving around all day, long and traveling from one part to another they're, not for the most part. You know fixed post in any particular location, correct, except for special operations like fields this weekend or an overnight or yeah, but in the same way that it was useful, for I don't remember who I think it might have been cynthia, but whoever it was to whom it came as news that the problems that we're seeing in the parks up here are problems that people throughout the city throughout the five boroughs are seeing in their parks. She did not realize that you know like many people. What she knows is what she knows. So, if all you see is the hot mess that is your local park in inwood or washington heights, and you don't know that this is a condition happening elsewhere, yeah. So I think it's it would be helpful to have monthly data from from pep saying these are what our resources were. These are where they're being deployed. These are how many summonses we issued. You know whatever their data points are, I'm sure people will also have questions and it would be helpful if she could maybe be here for part of the meetings, but it would there's probably some information that she can give us pretty economically. That would be enlightening to us and not a terrible, add to her workflow and not a huge commitment of her time noted fantastic. Okay. My goal was to be done by 8 30, because my goal really was to be done by nine and we only missed that mark by 10 minutes. So I can't read lips, but it sure looked like sally said motion to adjourn. Is there a second? I second fantastic. Thank you very much. I appreciate you all, I'm going to leave the meeting open for a couple of minutes so that I can continue pulling comments out of the chat to forward to my colleagues and other committees, but consider this meeting adjourned and I am turning off the recording. Can I delete the chat? Is there a way to save it? I don't know how okay yeah, I guess it's the queue you can cut and paste it. Someone that's what I'm working on it totally sounds like you're calling us from a waffle under the ocean. Do you want to wrap it up? The meeting yeah just hold on just somebody else, stop recording underwater. I stopped recording because the meeting is finished, but I still have the I haven't ended the meeting I've adjourned the meeting, but I haven't, ended the zoom because I was just cutting and pasting the chat. So I need another couple of minutes to do that because I don't know how else to save it and did we say welcome to the new member. Sorry, oh my god, you know I did. I did spam yay to barbara. I didn't welcome etta because she wasn't on the call at that point, but welcome etta, so glad that you were assigned to this committee. Thank you. I'm really excited to be part of this committee. I look forward to working together and happy birthday to your husband. Thank you all righty and I think I've got okay. I've got all of the comments from the chat, so I'm going to leave the meeting. Okay thanks guys. Thank you.
