But moving from that, I would like to I guess: first bring in tim anderson from the borough president's office to share your to share the you know: The offices You know perspective on this issue of inclusion and fairness in planning and zoning, and you know what have been some of the obstacles To see you know, based on the work that you're doing with other community boards and based on your background, We meaning not just the community board, but the community board and agencies of city government.
You know intelligent comments and although one of the representatives of the city council's land use committee said it was, you know, one of the you know most impressive It's, not clear the extent to which the level of detail and nuance was really followed through, because what was passed, you know ultimately did not really address many of the issues or the recommendations that were raised, and if it did, you know it would have really had less of the adverse impact that has been scaring everyone from the very beginning, Thank you wayne and thank you community board, 12 and the land use committee for getting us together around this topic, I mean it's extraordinarily, timely and important that I think what we're doing right now communicating across what is often the silos of the community agencies, particularly from where I sit, academia and research centers, as well as the citizens who are most affected by our endeavors in our work, Perhaps.
Remember saying to them, but look at river terrace That's us too, and they at first kind of didn't, believe it, and you know it's odd-- to have external forces like a business based on conversation in neighborhoods, making the decision to some degree based on housing types There are consequences for people's assumptions about neighborhoods as well, that a basically a neighborhood social networking business would, you know, want to so narrowly define neighborhood If you go back to the issue of the boundaries for audubon park.
We have an unusually quiet land use committee, but if there are no committee, members who have points to add I would say, I see this and I think the committee sees this As. You know the flavor of the day conversation, but something that is very real and something that if we were to take the neighborhood planning and land, you study that the community board did with city college and completed in 2007, and we used that as a tool for updating it.
I think that would be an excellent opportunity for city planning and the bond center and the borough president's office they're planning to work with community board 12 to update that vision for land use and planning in you know washington ice inwood, because you know once again that's something that we spent a couple of years doing included many community meetings and When EDC first came to us and proposed the inward rezoning.
We've watched the degradation of communities happen while we inch along so I would really welcome both the Manhattan borough president's office, dcp cb12, as well as others to continue this conversation My colleagues are interested, some very invested and thoughtful and skillful people All I think we can make some progress so again, I'm going to support wayne and calling for us all to continue this conversation, particularly around the issues of land use for cb12 You could upgrade peter green.
What we call the upper and lower drive were areas that we recommended be either included in the audubon park, historic district, because if you look at the development of the area, I mean this whole area was an area of you, know, sort of a rural, suburban area of single-family homes and mansions, but over time, urbanized- There were a lot of arguments for why you know not specifically just this building, but the whole streetscape was something that should be included, as I said, that didn't happen, which leads us to a potential development that would involve as I understand demolishing that building, which is you know, a two-story, whatever wood frame, single family home, probably dating back to the time of the audubons, and you know, building a 13 story structure on a somewhat narrow lot, and there were some early conversations in august and a fair amount of community and I have been sharing emails as well as steve, and more recently, I was put in touch with peter green, who is going to walk us through I could just interject something because I'm looking at an aerial view of this area.
Just to the north of this site are several buildings filled with photocells on their roof, photovoltaics on their roof So. If this building is built, of course, the zoning we're asking that should have been in place two years ago already, of course magic doesn't occur anymore, but had this protective zoning be been in place, these solar cells, these photovoltaic ins installations, would not be in jeopardy, and now they are This building will in fact block sun right beyond You know we're looking at a broader issue of you know: a distinct impact on community character, his or the group's conversation, comments and conversation, and so peter you have the screen unmute yourself, okay, good evening, My name is peter green actually have been working on some of the issues with the park.
Don't know how in our registered architect, actually managed to graduate from architecture school and create that, but really the literal and figurative shadow that this 135 story tower would cast on our neighborhood would really be 135 foot high middle finger to us and our community Even the numbers in the pre-application don't add up the demolition permit I about 15 errors in it, including the owner of the plot, the enormous number of environmental and structural concerns in part, because it's built along a 1900s retaining wall that runs the length of upper riverside drive at the far end of which is at castle village, and He's got stacks of violations, stop work, orders even a ripping down a stop work order and going back to work on his site.
We're also very concerned that, given the current economic climate and the way that many new york developers work that the lot could simply be bulldozed and left vacant, the demolition permit doesn't even provide for how they plan to remove the debris In the area and would certainly improve the tax space for that one lot, but probably significantly reduce the value of many of the apartments and co-op apartments around it, which would lower people's home values and lower the tax base again for the neighborhood and then finally, you know we really need it's going back to wayne's point in the whole discussion.
I mean all of you know that gail is always in the community, and several of you who live in the neighborhood This is an issue that is important to a lot of people It's concerning a lot of people that we need to gather as much information as we can New data points of things that look You know you know additional concerns about proper notification, so every one of those gets run up the chain in my office when you guys communicate You know education.
The project Steve is also a member of the land use committee and a neighbor and a neighbor I live further down on riverside drive at 155th street peter I had received an email from leslie doyle a few days ago, in which I believe she says that you had consulted with zoning professionals, who pointed out to you that there were errors made in the calculations as to how tall this building could be, and you know the zoning advocate who we are talking to We've got to raise a little money to be able to pay him.
You know community residents to raise money to pay zoning and I immediately looped in our you, know: city planning and borough president You know planning and urban design You know whatever documentation is available with respect to the errors in the zoning calculation is so that once again, the community board lands committee could forward that information to city planning and to the borough president's office to have them run their own analysis to see what makes sense- and I think the point that was raised in the email that you said on you know, given the width of the site, doesn't the sliver law kick in and if the sliver log kicks in?
It was all in the letter and tim has it as well But this is monstrosity, because if you compare to the highs of the building suggesting to that which is like I live on like next door right in 839, which is only a six-story, you know building and it had the basements Those questions on maria are I, think perfect questions for city planning and the borough president's office to include you know in their analysis and there's so many things that are talked about in the community.
It's really it's hard to say when the next, when their next step, when their next step would be, which is why natalie and tim do you have any ability to lean on the buildings department and explain that this is a demolition for a project that you know isn't clear that it can be built and therefore they need to hold off and sit down with the community board, for instance, and others, and explain what they're going to do before they put a bulldozer or sledgehammer in there What's your timetable just for sending a letter on letterhead or by email on letterhead to DOB and asking them to just be sure to pause this permit and I'll bring it up in traffic and transportation.
So I would like to see the community board itself take an affirmative action and send a letter Is there, points that the borough president's office has already reduced to writing that we could, you know, sort of echo and support in our in our letter to the borough, to the building, department?
But I just want to update with regard to the school property Is the school going to be in And then there is the five-story former catholic school building that runs along 215th street That's had about 200 or so 9 through 12 high school students over the last 40 years and in the fall of 2021 It will be home to 923 k through 8 students right we actually years ago past the resolution authorizing or requesting that the board chair and district manager reach out to the owners of the hearst house, Basically the seventh-day adventists, to engage them in a conversation on I believe there was a Brooklyn congregation of the senate that actually owned that property, and you know you would expect a church to be a little more interested in community, but I, don't think they ever responded.
