It's, not kind of you know off the top, and we worked very closely with our colleagues at the border president's office and in city planning, and So when we issue something as a request and there is no response or it's just rejected- outright.
You know perspective on this issue of inclusion and fairness in planning and zoning, and you know what have been some of the obstacles Then I'd like to loop in sean rickenbacker, to see you know, based on the work that you're doing with other community boards and based on your background, We, meaning not just the community board, but the community board and agencies of city government.
You know up and down Manhattan, so I feel, like you, know, affordable housing, is just tied into so many other issues that affect these communities and I feel, like you know, the more that we can, the more that we can fight for an advocate for affordable housing, really all around will definitely yield some great results, and You know, I mean she's been a champion in a lot of ways for more diversity, more equity, and I.
Diversity, inclusion and as well as empowerment in the development of urban communities and sustaining them, and what we most endeavored to do was to establish really transparent, but yet firm relationships with city, agencies, community boards, the private sector, industry and ourselves, and that, with that kind of collaboration, that we could truly innovate and so to wayne's point of some of the incredible work that cb12 land use committee and as well as some of the local community groups who contributed to the research there.
So you know, I, know that there are city planners and design professionals here, And I, don't know who's watching online, but I certainly believe that you know we are not as effective if we are not talking to the economist if we are not talking to the community, if we are not talking to the social scientists to help inform us and make a more comprehensive and holistic or take a more comprehensive and holistic approach to analyzing what it is that we have done collectively to kind of right, the ship a bit or at least and perhaps in a more radical fashion, rebuild or reconstruct how it is that we will operate to ensure that we do provide diversity.
That's us too, and they at first kind of didn't, believe it, and you know it's odd-- to have external forces like a business based on conversation in neighborhoods, making the decision to some degree based on housing.
And I think the borough president's office in city planning might also you know.
You know the flavor of the day conversation, but something that is very real and something that if we were to take the neighborhood planning and land, you study that the community board did with city college and completed in 2007, and we used that as a tool for updating, it.
I, think that would be an excellent opportunity for city planning and the bond center and the borough president's office they're planning to work with community board 12 to update that vision for land use and planning in you know washington ice inwood, because you know once again that's something that we spent a couple of years doing included many community meetings and When EDC first came to us and proposed the inward rezoning.
Know, work with us to update that vision for what are what are our land use and planning needs now and as jim berlin.
Think your leadership and the leadership of the members of the land use committee has been extraordinary and That often goes overlooked in favor of the direct impact on citizens and communities.
It was pointed out that you know, because that r8 zoning allows you to have an far I think 6.02, unless you're doing quality housing, in which case you're up to 7 or 7.02.
What we call the upper and lower drive were areas that we recommended be either included in the audubon park, historic district, because if you look at the development of the area, I mean this whole area was an area of you, know, sort of a rural, suburban area of single-family homes and mansions, but over time, urbanized- There were a lot of arguments for why you know not specifically just this building, but the whole streetscape was something that should be included, as I said that didn't happen, which leads us to a potential development that would involve, as I understand, demolishing that building, which is you know, a two-story, whatever wood, frame, single family, home, probably dating back to the time of the audubons, and you know, building a 13 story structure on a somewhat narrow lot.
Why is it that the one or two spots that have the ability to engineer something with you know vaulted floors and shoot you up above everybody else to get million dollar views of the river should be the one or two places that get any investment and ruin it for everyone, else, and This area may be just as important as anything else to preserve the character and preserve the ability of people who live here to feel that they live in a neighborhood that and in a city that respects them as much as people on fifth avenue are respected by the zoning laws that apply there, that nobody can steal their view of central park, for instance.
Even the numbers in the pre-application don't add up the demolition permit, I about 15 errors in it, including the owner of the plot, the enormous number of environmental and structural concerns in part, because it's built along a 1900s retaining wall that runs the length of upper riverside drive at the far end of which is at castle village, and you all probably know about how that collapsed.
They, failed to present this project to the community board or let anyone know they were working on this.
We've got to raise a little money to be able to pay him first to get a real opinion out of him, but he did say that if you do what wayne And I did, which is take the numbers and the pre-application and add them together- It seems to be borne out by my experience, which is that until the department of buildings issues a zoning diagram for a project, you can't really know what they're claiming they can get for the space.
You know whatever documentation is available with respect to the errors in the zoning calculation is so that once again, the community board lands committee could forward that information to city planning and to the borough president's office to have them run their own analysis to see what makes sense- And I think the point that was raised in the email that you said on you know, given the width of the site, doesn't the sliver law kick in and if the sliver log kicks in?
I would say that you know once again those questions on maria are, I, think, perfect questions for city planning and the borough president's office to include you know in their analysis.
Building of this size triggers the need, for you, know an eis, but I would say that the issue that was raised early on relative to the soil, conditions- And, there's so many things that are talked about in the community.
You know, came across the borough engineer we haven't, You know what is the borough president's approach to investigating Just based off of the information that was pulled by you, vivian peter, definitely are going to come from DOB with the application filings and just a couple of questions that I have in regards to the sliver.
Also, you have to remember that D.O.T is working on riverside dry west Well we'd, like city planning, to look at it because it's a city funding issue, But we'd, like the borough president's office, to look at it.
Okay, so, but getting back to the question to the borough president's office into city planning We can reach out to the appropriate people in our agency.
I asked the borough president's office and city planning about the time frame for getting back to the community board.
The borough president's office of folks who you know, are paid to look at these zoning and planning issues and that's an old version of the handbook by the way to come back to us, because you know the.
If, you know the area, there's a tremendous difference in elevation between the upper and lower drives right now , We're going to bring it to our zoning division, as we already have to a point, but just as you get more information, please share that with us.
It's hard to say when the next, when their next step, when their next step would be, which is why natalie and tim do you have any ability to lean on the buildings department and explain that this is a demolition for a project that you know isn't clear that it can be built and therefore they need to hold off and sit down with the community board, for instance, and others, and explain what they're going to do before they put a bulldozer or sledgehammer in there.
You know projects that come before the community board.
And I will say there have been a couple of projects that are as of right that were presented to the community board, because the people involved wanted to do so.
We've raised a number of questions about the zoning, and we've raised a number of issues which may not impact the building code per se, but it impacts issues over which the billing department has jurisdiction and would need to look at So I mean I, look forward to city planning and to the borough president's office.
Raised, peter you leslie, others, any additional information that needs the review and analysis of you, know, city planning and the planners of the borough press, office.
I mean we could we could support what the borough president's office is doing, but also, and at the same time indicate that these are questions that that are also of concern to people who live in the community.
I. Think that's something that that this committee or the community board itself, would also like to support.
