Not kind of you know off the top, and we worked very closely with our colleagues at the border president's office and in city planning, and so when we issue something as a request and there is no response or it's just rejected- outright.
I guess, first bring in Tim Anderson from the borough president's office to share your to share the you know: You know perspective on this issue of inclusion and fairness in planning and zoning, and you know what have been some of the obstacles Then I'd like to loop in Sean rickenbacker, to see you know, based on the work that you're doing with other community boards and based on your background,.
I know that I'm I share with Ryan that I'm relatively new to Gail's team, so I started right during the pandemic, so still getting used to zoom calls and getting used to meeting everyone, but I can definitely say what I've been able to absorb in the few months that I've been at the offices.
Diversity, inclusion and as well as empowerment in the development of urban communities and sustaining them, and what we most endeavored to do was to establish really transparent, but yet firm relationships with city, agencies, community boards, the private sector, industry and ourselves, and that, with that kind of collaboration that we could truly innovate and so to Wayne's point of some of the incredible work that CB12 land use committee and as well as some of the local community groups who contributed to the research there that work and my brief opportunity to review.
That's us too, and they at first kind of did not believe it, and you know it's odd- to have external forces like a business based on conversation in neighborhoods, making the decision to some degree based on housing.
And I think the borough president's office in city planning might also you know.
You know the flavor of the day conversation, but something that is very real and something that if we were to take the neighborhood planning and land, you study that the Community Board did with city college and completed in 2007, and we used that as a tool for updating, it.
You know more than a decade later to responding to the you know: coin city planning, made: I think that would be an excellent opportunity for city planning and the bond center and the borough president's office they're planning to work with Community Board 12 to update that vision for land use and planning in you, know, Washington, Ice Inwood, because you know once again that's something that we spent a couple of years doing included many community meetings and When EDC first came to us and proposed the inward rezoning.
Know, work with us to update that vision for what are what are our land use and planning needs now and as Jim Berlin.
I think we can make some progress so again, I'm, going to support wayne and calling for us all to continue this conversation, particularly around the issues of land use for CB12.
It was pointed out that you know, because that R8 zoning allows you to have an far I think 6.02, unless you're doing quality housing, in which case you're up to 7 or 7.02, that can lead to.
What we call the upper and lower drive were areas that we recommended be either included in the Audubon Park historic district, because if you look at the development of the area, I mean this whole area was an area of you, know, sort of a rural, suburban area of single, family homes and mansions, but over time, urbanized- That did not happen, which leads us to a potential development that would involve, as I understand demolishing that building, which is, you know, a two- story, whatever wood, frame, single family, home, probably dating back to the time of the audubons, and you know, building a 13 story structure on a somewhat narrow lot, and there were some early conversations in August and a fair amount of community.
Why is it that the one or two spots that have the ability to engineer something with you know vaulted floors and shoot you up above everybody else to get million dollar views of the river should be the one or two places that get any investment and ruin it for everyone, else, and This area may be just as important as anything else to preserve the character and preserve the ability of people who live here to feel that they live in a neighborhood that and in a city that respects them as much as people on Fifth Avenue are respected by the zoning laws that apply there, that nobody can steal their view of central park, for instance.
My name is Peter green we've come here to express our neighborhood's concern with the proposed demolition of, what's sometimes known as the historic Audubon Guest house, in the erection of a 13-story tower of micro condominiums, that would average about 600 square feet on the site at 857, Riverside.
Even the numbers in the pre- application do not add up the demolition permit , I about 15 errors in it, including the owner of the plot, the enormous number of environmental and structural concerns in part, because it's built along a 1900s retaining wall that runs the length of upper Riverside drive at the far end of which is at Castle village, and you all probably know about how that collapsed.
They, failed to present this project to the community board or let anyone know they were working on.
What's permissible under you know the r8 quality housing zoning, the issue of the soil, site, Condition Geotechnical Foundation- will are all you know, one and as we've shared, and you know, Steve and Those points need to be brought to the agency having jurisdiction, which is you know, the building, department, and President may in fact be doing that you know, but you know beyond liking or disliking.
It seems to be borne out by my experience, which is that until the department of buildings issues a zoning diagram for a project, you can't really know what they're claiming they can get for the space.
Take a look at it and the reason why I ask you Peter and Leslie to send me: You know whatever documentation is available with respect to the errors in the zoning calculation is so that once again, the Community Board Lands Committee could forward that information to city planning and to the borough president's office to have them run their own analysis.
I. Think the point that was raised in the email that you said on you know, given the width of the site, does not the sliver law kick in and if the sliver log kicks in, does not the width of the street govern Things Are, in my mind, have been put not in my mind, you know, following my email committee has been put in the laps of you know.
I would say that you know once again those questions on Maria, are, I, think, perfect questions for city planning and the borough president's office to include you know in their analysis.
Building of this size triggers the need, for you, know an eis, but I would say that the issue that was raised early on relative to the soil, conditions- And, there's so many things that are talked about in the community.
Also, you have to remember that D.O.T is working on Riverside dry, West Well we'd, like city planning, to look at it because it's a city funding issue, But we'd, like the borough president's office, to look at it.
And I'd like to get some feedback from both the borough president's office and from city planning.
Okay, so, but getting back to the question to the borough president's office into city planning We can reach out to the appropriate people in our agency.
I asked the borough president's office and city planning about the time frame for getting back to the community board.
I want city planning, The borough president's office of folks who you know, are paid to look at these zoning and planning issues and that's an old version of the Handbook by the way to come back to us, because you know the.
If, you know the area, there's a tremendous difference in elevation between the upper and lower drives right now , We're going to bring it to our zoning division, as we already have to a point, but just as you get more information, please share that with us.
It's hard to say when the next, when their next step, when their next step would be, which is why Natalie and Tim do you have any ability to lean on the buildings Department and explain that this is a demolition for a project that you know is not clear that it can be built and therefore they need to hold off and sit down with the community board, for instance, and others, and explain what they're going to do before they put a bulldozer or sledgehammer in there.
So there are a number of any discretionary action would require it to come before the you know, the community Board or in some cases.
We've raised a number of questions about the zoning, and we've raised a number of issues which may not impact the building code per se, but it impacts issues over which the billing department has jurisdiction and would need to look at So I mean I, look forward to city planning and to the borough president's office.
Any, additional information that needs the review and analysis of you, know, city planning and the planners of the borough press office.
Sure the community board itself could also write a letter to the building's department and raise some of these questions and request.
I mean we could we could support what the borough president's office is doing, but Also- and at the same time indicate that these are questions that that are also of concern to people who live in the community.
I. Think that's something that that this committee or the community board itself, would also like to support.
I mean there's a very simple approach for taking you know the Hud AMI formula and making it work for any community board.
