I, just I just want to be clear that everybody is aware that there are the three of us on right now at plus ebenezer and like 22 people from the public.
We've got jennifer hoppa from the parks department and we've got looks like about 30 attendees in the audience, including a couple of people with their hands raised.
I understand it's important to the cloisters, which has now reopened, as have many museums for limited timed entry, and there are, but I understand that the city council's traffic and transportation committee is going to be having a public hearing on not just margaret corbin drive but on road usage in general, both streets that were closed for play, streets and recreation, and to increase social distancing as people, use, parks and open spaces, and also the use of roadways as it relates to restaurants and bars so that they can have increased outdoor seating.
Didn't seem like a terribly useful, a good use of people's time, but I do think that I'm just wondering jennifer.
Yes, it's actually the parks, department, stock and columbia maintains it for us not an important thing, but we are trying to expedite it.
We, are trying to expedite work, but it's going to be contingent upon the department of Okay , thank you and when we have, I did encourage ross to make sure that the university is copious with their signage, explaining you know when it's going to be closed when they anticipate it being open just so that people know what's going on, but if anybody sees that there's work happening sees that it's closed.
They have to be wearing masks, so this is for all concessions, city-wide in parks that they will be able to have small gatherings with you, know: weddings bar mitzvahs anniversary, parties, whatever it is that people do when they have small events of 50 people or fewer.
And then I'm going to go quickly to the beginning of the round table of updates from nonprofits, because I know there are a couple of people who need to leave by seven.
So I'd like to move to agenda item two, the brief programming updates from non-profits arts and culture organizations etc, and let me just get my timer going Can. You elevate me to like co-host, so I can unmute people.
I understand that the that the met is obviously strongly in favor of continuing to keep of having the road be open, because that's how people access the museum One of the issues I would mention that's connected to.
So people who are coming to the cloisters from outside of the neighborhood are actually going to be getting off at the 181st street.
Stop and we've been working with the mta to ensure that the bus service runs in to the park so that people can arrive at the cloisters and that's also critical for anyone arriving with accessibility issues.
There's, no paucity of restaurants in the dikeman area or on 187th street corridor, so, to the extent that you can work with them to promote that would be, would be great And, I myself, rent an apartment in the neighborhood So, always like to support local businesses.
, I, guess almost fall, so Inward artworks for those who don't know its mission is to create and curate professional, performing and visual arts in inwood and surrounding community, and that definitely applies to washington heights and also in the northwest Bronx.
Every thursday this month we're having our podcast, which is in available on our youtube channel on video form and also available on apple music spotify and our inwood artworks website, and wherever you get your podcasts from this thursday, we highlight local painter, elisa gore, who many of you know from her works in the parks.
Outdoor film night is probably safer than the unmasked undistanced partying that's happening in the park, so You know there may be some hopefully give us an update, an update on that during your report.
One of our members has actually inspected the dock and also recognized that it was in great shape, but we have pivoted that we're going to be offering this saturday an online a training program or exercise program specifically targeted for rowers, our participants, people that we've worked with in the community in the past years in inwood that will be advertised and, depending on the response, we're hoping to go forward to doing a more weekly, typo online or else in parks.
There have been a couple of, like you, know, outside socially distanced, masked events that we've done and this september we're focusing them all on making sure that people do the census and coupling it with letting people get getting letting people know about the community fridge that is now out the corner of 165th and amsterdam, avenue.
My question was just simply: If people that are utilizing the fridge are maybe getting information on other resources in the community, for whatever other needs, they may have and, as you know, I'm, unable to put in the chat.
I mean that's one issue that I could think of In other cities, where they have them in like an enclosed sort of situation, but I guess you know just wondering if that's something that like is possible, if we've ever discussed.
Just before the parks report, one cultural thing, people perhaps have seen it.
We've, been sort of spreading that temporary public art project throughout the city right near where friends of inwood hill park help us at inwood.
We're going to have jennifer's parks report, which will include some of the questions that people have been throwing up in the chat Then we're going to have a discussion of our capital and expense budget.
I think some of the lingering questions from some of the things that I've spoken about in my update kind of fit into jennifer's parks report.
Let people know that the parks department has launched a new campaign.
Next to the can and encourage your neighbors to help keep our neighborhood clean because it definitely takes a village when we're all spending so much more time outside trying to escape being cooped up in apartments, and I wanted to give this community board a shout, out.
We have the play streets, so the city's working hard to try to accommodate as many people as we can outside special event permits right.
That's going to be coming online, probably by the month's end, which we're really excited about 175th in amsterdam, I'd, say around halloween weather and other conditions allowing and then the laurel hill terrorist staircase, which this committee also advocated for, has resumed Let's see The community parks initiative site that this committee also advocated for constructions.
I did want to say: We've got some additional stewardship days coming up three at inwood hill park.
It help if parks enforcement personnel were working at night when littering occurs and handing out tickets so speak a little bit about what the staffing is for pap, what their scheduling is and how best to you know, leverage that limited resource sure.
Forward, complaints and issues to me, And I, send that to the Manhattan captain, But. As many people know here.
Large groups of people There's trash What's, the ongoing way of dealing with this, because, right so park enforcement and social distance ambassadors that usually, you know, would be assigned to recreation divisions.
And, it's clearly a safety issue, then parks or police have to come and sort of disperse I know that there are some questions from the from the committee, but we've got a couple of people who have been in the in the public who have been patiently waiting with their hands.
You know there are divisions that follow social media to track things and helpful people in the community also give us heads up.
It's literally happening in every other park, including There, was an article today about washington square park and a big party that nyu threw cynthia and then a few weeks ago you know prospect park, oh prospect, park, Brooklyn, Queens, I'm, not excusing it, and this is my community too, but I guess what I'm saying is Spread, I feel like that would go a long way in the NYPD, realizing that it's not just you know six people from the community that don't have anything better to do with their time than complain that this is a real problem and that you as an agency need their help as well as an agency for them to do their law enforcement.
We, know there's a huge enforcement issue in terms of whether and how the NYPD enforces stuff On some of these things and although a lot of it, what you're articulating is happening in parks, it's the NYPD, that's doing the enforcement or should be doing the enforcement or isn't doing enforcement.
They can issue a parking ticket, but if they're, if it seems like there's a criminal element to what's happening, then that is for the you know It may be more appropriate for police officers or a team of police officers to respond to.
Is that the pep and the NYPD be there at indian road and 207th street along their saturday morning, sunday morning, starting at nine o'clock and confiscate the stuff you're not allowed to have alcohol in the park when they start to bring it in on the hand, truck it'd, be confiscated, you're not allowed to have loud speakers in the park you confiscate that has been traditionally done in the past That will be a tremendous service to our neighbors in inwood, so that they can actually use the park in these last weeks of summer, because, what's really happened is that the residents of inwood have been both by and large, vanished from the park and these revelers, and these this you know, anti-social sub-group, have taken over our parks to the detriment of our own community.
This is the parks and cultural affairs committee, and while a lot of those issues are happening in parks, that's a public safety.
Friends in wood hill park has equipment that we can loan grabbers and gloves if people want to do cleanups.
And, so I guess I want to push back against what was said a few moments ago about you know like heavily enforcing certain things and targeting people who are gathering in the parks, especially if it's daytime I can understand, because the concerns around noise at the in the evenings when people are trying to sleep like tanya, raised before.
You know different people are just going to come down on that differently, but there's no reason not to include it as an item.
What I would suggest, possibly is that you might want to consider as a long-term item for as a budget request the what we refer to as the lighthouse link, the extension of the greenway north of the bridge, bringing it down into into the lower level of fort washington park.
I should be communicating with curtis about you know this ongoing obvious issue related to enforcement, which is an expense item, not a capital item, but That.
I, think that should be a larger expense item through the health and environment committee to address recycling throughout the district, including in our parks.
It was in the playground, I presented to them, but could I, but as long as we're mentioning inwood hill park, ball, fields, could I point out to you liz that you might want to include that as one of your capital project items as well, because at this point we have the funding to do three of the five fields.
We're going to need money at some point soon to do the other two fields: That's, actually my bad for not having included that as an item that had come up previously, because there was broad support for the for the one ball field and then for expanding it to the three ball fields, and many people asked what about the other two.
Is this a capital project or The rebar is coming out, and that would so that would be inspiration, point fort washington, park, You know if we're gonna be, if we're gonna be taking a capital.
This is something that was supposed to be funded in year, two of participatory budgeting, but tree pit guards along broadway and other areas, because I think parks invest a lot of money in trees that continue to die, most of which, I think are reported within the contracted time frame, but some of which are not, And I.
So I would like to see some sort of item that talks about dedicating dollars to the parks department for expanding their outdoor learning initiative in parks and community gardens.
I would play the outdoor learning initiative in parks, community gardens and other green spaces steve with the invasive removal, because that's you know, that's an issue.
I'm, not sure if we want to have this be a separate point or just like kind of include formally incarcerated people as another group to target for programming.
If I didn't mention the dogs in our community and the dog runs, or the dog running for tryon- I've been thinking about, of course, we're never going to get funding because of You know the budget cuts and the pandemic.
It's not something that like capitally can happen, but what the parks department and the department of education and others have been doing.
There continues to be sort of the lingering question and concern about the enforcement issue in parks, balancing legitimate use and the very compelling argument that danielle made that aisha, echoed We've talked about a lot in this committee before as well.
As, you know, people's legitimate need to have some peace and quiet, and what is the parks department's role in that?
She did not realize that you know like many people.
So, if all you see is the hot mess that is your local park in inwood or washington heights, and you don't know that this is a condition happening.
