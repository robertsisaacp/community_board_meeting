Just I just want to be clear that everybody is aware that there are the three of us on right now at plus ebenezer and like 22 people from the public So. Let me try and open up the q a and for some reason it's not showing me the participant screen Tanya natalie, hoppa, family, yeah, natalie's, not I'm, I'd, be looking to promote the committee members and also jennifer excellent hapa family is luke, not jen Just can't hear you, my son and some other members of the inwood 728 troop are working on their communications.
We've got jennifer hoppa from the parks department and we've got looks like about 30 attendees in the audience, including a couple of people with their hands raised already I'm, assuming that's for the public for the for the roundtable session which we'll get to in a moment.
When members of the board attend other committees, One thing that I do want to say is I've gotten a lot of feedback from different people, I'm trying very hard to end this by 8 30, so help me out by being concise and by listening to other people's questions and comments, so that if your question is similar to something, someone has already asked to just take in the answer to the previously asked question and to know that you can always follow up with people.
The big update on parks usage is that the temporary road closures ended as of today they ended with the summer The margaret corbin drive in fort tryon park is now open to traffic I've, gotten a fair amount of feedback of people who are unhappy about that and a fair amount of feedback for people who are actually happy about that because they like being able to use the road as a road I understand it's important to the cloisters, which has now reopened, as have many museums for limited timed entry, and there are but I understand that the city council's traffic and transportation committee is going to be having a public hearing on not just margaret corbin drive but on road usage in general.
There isn't an area of committee work that isn't affected by the rezoning two other things Yes, it's actually the parks, department, stock and columbia maintains it for us not an important thing, but we are trying to expedite it.
So people who are coming to the cloisters from outside of the neighborhood are actually going to be getting off at the 181st street Stop and we've been working with the mta to ensure that the bus service runs in to the park so that people can arrive at the cloisters and that's also critical for anyone arriving with accessibility issues We are very keen to see the roadway open up On. The way there would be great, or at least to tell people you know where they could go eat on their way back from Yes. Do you have a space in your front area for little palm cards from local restaurants?
You're able to stay on the call, because one of the things that I'm hoping jennifer will be able to address during her report, which is coming up soon, is when the parks department will be contemplating permitting Outdoor film night is probably safer than the unmasked undistanced partying that's happening in the park, so you know there may be some hopefully give us an update, an update on that during your report.
If there are other people I see a couple of hands up hold on sally I, see a couple of hands up in the audience, from cynthia auburn and from tonya bonner I'm, assuming that your comments are relating not to non-profit cultural friends and parks groups, but to parks conditions generally, which is coming up later in the agenda Did. You have your hand up to give a report from hudson river community growing by harlem river community rowing?
This fall and we've been conversations with parks We. One of our members has actually inspected the dock and also recognized that it was in great shape, but we have pivoted that we're going to be offering this saturday an online a training program or exercise program specifically targeted for rowers our participants, people that we've worked with in the community in the past years in inwood that will be advertised and depending on the response, we're hoping to go forward to doing a more weekly, typo online or else in parks.
We have coming up on saturday a school supply, giveaway voter registration, You know up till early august we were doing a ton of online events and through these programs and summer camps we give away You, know a thousand plus books, new books to anyone joining the book, clubs and the camps and everything But there have been a couple of, like you know, outside socially distanced, masked events that we've done and this september we're focusing them all on making sure that people do the census and coupling it with letting people get getting letting people know about the community fridge that is now out the corner of 165th and amsterdam avenue.
You know you could just walk by and like leave food in there, but as long as they sort of fit the guidelines, there are people checking on it on a regular schedule and for the most part, they're, not people who they're people who we've like met throughout the pandemic, but are not people who were already previously word of volunteers So, it's a whole other volunteer crew that we're also a part of If. You could send that I will share it with the committee, but I am assuming in a nutshell, Yes, briefly, I'm sorry, I think daniella daniel was first I support it, I encourage people who have questions about it to reach out to veronica directly It's, not a parks and cultural affairs initiative If you've got a lot of questions about the community of fridge.
If we've ever discussed right at the entrance to inwood hill park, We're still in I'm, not sure who maintains it, and then there also was one at bennett avenue at the a train entrance If a group comes to parks, we pilot it and what tends to have worked well is if it's smaller scale, not people coming and dumping their bookshelves You know bennett park.
We get we've gotten dumping at the morris, chamel mansion in roger morris park, there's also a little library that is there in conjunction with the program through word up cool, The first is friends of inwood hill park, I, just a shout out to the parks, maintenance workers who are doing a great job, despite losing all their seasonal staff, and also to groups that have joined us in half a dozen cleanups, especially the parks, maintenance workers, The. There's a group of hispanic youth from all over the city called communify they've done a couple cleanups with us senator jackson's office and most recently I think last weekend, a group that a volunteer group that grew out of the greenbelt nature center and I'd encourage people to keep in touch with the next huge event that we have is on the 17th of october.
One is the dikeman pier I always like cleaning up at the river, because then it doesn't end up in the belly of some fish and also at the northern at the top of in wood hill park, and that's with leslie barbie barbian crew There will be sites for those of you who don't live in inwood We have equipment that we can loan to groups that want to do their own cleanups, we've loaned them to uptown dreamers for their harlem and washington heights.
We're going to have jennifer's parks report, which will include some of the questions that people have been throwing up in the chat and then we're going to have a discussion of our capital and expense budget priorities.
The community board members have gone out into the parks at night when people are gathering and hand out bags and talking to their neighbors and that's great We've had more trash cans out in the park more coming, we've gotten more equipment for dealing with trash, but not additional staff.
That doesn't always mean that people comply, but the education of making the masks available helps encourage that compliance other times and it's clearly a safety issue, then parks or police have to come and sort of disperse I know that there are some questions from the from the committee, but we've got a couple of people who have been in the in the public who have been patiently waiting with their hands up, so I've lived across the street from inward hill park since 1999, and every year conditions in the park grow increasingly worse and this year the litter has been prolific, there's barbecuing all over the park What I want to focus on is the noise and the ear splitting decibel level that we have been subject to swapped out.
Please come up with a plan with goals and milestones for addressing this situation and Did. You say call the clinton again They may say they are, but they're not and that's been raised at a community precinct council uh-huh You know there are divisions that follow social media to track things and helpful people in the community also give us heads up So we were able to prevent a certain large-scale gathering on saturday in a portion of inland hill park, but I understand in another area of the park and it's unfortunately, not just inwood hill park.
It's literally happening in every other park, including There, was an article today about washington square park and a big party that nyu threw cynthia and then a few weeks ago you know prospect park, oh prospect park, Brooklyn Queens I'm, not excusing it, and this is my community too, but I guess what I'm saying is Whereas maybe it's been isolated before it's much more broad spread I feel like that would go a long way in the NYPD, realizing that it's not just you know six people from the community that don't have anything better to do with their time than complain that this is a real problem and that you as an agency need their help as well as an agency for them to do their law enforcement, job and I gotta move on to other people and then because of the tree, damage they sort of relocated.
I was actually just going to mention that that we talked about this at the public safety committee meeting the other day and I asked the officers if they always respond to every 3-1-1 complaint, and they said yes, so I just wanted to mention that They just reiterated that when they have competing calls, they have to sort of triage and something like a robbery or burglary would be higher priority than like a noise complaint.
Instead of you know regular park trash we're having to take all that to the dump on top of everything else, so it definitely makes things more challenging than they need to be So. If you see someone looking like they're, jumping call sanitation call, the NYPD enforcement We cannot expect the NYPD to, for example, going with four officers and confront a group of 50 to 75, because that has a certain right potential for it.
This is an issue that I care about and that all of the people who have been commenting in the chat and that we all care about this is the parks and cultural affairs committee, and while a lot of those issues are happening in parks, that's a public safety.
If, it's okay, yep I, don't want to start a debate I must remind us that we are in the midst of a pandemic, and people are not able to gather indoors so they're gathering in the parks, And, so I guess I want to push back against what was said a few moments ago about you know like heavily enforcing certain things and targeting people who are gathering in the parks, especially if it's daytime I can understand, because the concerns around noise at the in the evenings when people are trying to sleep like tanya, raised before But I, think it's just important to remember.
Think that's another reason why maybe the police are perhaps not necessarily enforcing these things, because potentially trying to minimize those sorts of interactions that could escalate Another committee member There are a lot of people who use the parks in ways that are not how other people might not might use the parks.
Think in your email you said we could add the community garden So what I enrolled in based on a review of the meeting minutes from the previous year is urban gardening, including funding for possibly the space behind gw high school or some other space, but funding for a space for urban gardening and we do have- There was the discussion of some kind of equipment for better trash management in uptown parks So. If that's a capital need that we want to add to our priority list , that's something that came up in conversation and then there had been the basketball courts on 186th street and some repairs to that.
, don't think it needs to take up space on your list What I would suggest possibly is that you might want to consider as a long-term item for as a budget request the what we refer to as the lighthouse link, the extension of the greenway north of the bridge, bringing it down into into the lower level of fort washington park We could have a continuous greenway along the river if I think that might be a a beneficial thing to have in a legitimate item for the community board, and that is something that has been discussed previously.
We're going to need money at some point soon to do the other two fields right , That's, actually, my bad for not having included that as an item that had come up previously, because there was broad support for the for the one ball field and then for expanding it to the three ball fields, and many people asked what about the other two and I know, maybe what's best for jennifer or steve to maybe prioritize us or tell us where it is now in terms of repair or replacement of certain fixtures in the park.
Okay, so we have six items: additional pep forestry crew, increasing DCLA funding, increasing funding for various parks's funding for various different kinds of staff from playground associates to recreational associates urban park rangers for a variety of the programming that they offer: funding, additional staff for sanitation, maintenance and operations and horticulture, and maintaining funding to continue to provide six days of services for libraries, which I don't know if that's going to come out of our committee or come out of education.
That's gonna have to be advocacy through the youth and education committee If someone wants to write one of those emails to faye sure thanks what I would ask, if is that, your item number five, be a jump to the top of your list in light of our budget cuts and if you could remain loose on this point, because we may have to come back to you next month if the layoffs go through and give you some other news on where things stand with our staffing , So I'm at this point sort of frankly, getting back our m o staff and and the rest of our basic staff is more important, for instance, than having a dedicated forestry crew, I like We're not ranking these items, so I actually want to get into a conversation about ranking these items.
The dogs, it's a sense of community people, I know it's a lot of friggin money, but I also think it's my responsibility, Thank you and thank you for your for your comment appreciate that hold on a second I just want to let you know that there's been great admissions, helping swimming in different parks, dog, run parks, and if you want to talk to me about that, I'm happy to talk to you offline and the just concerned about because of the recent storm where there was a huge tree match that fell right into the porch of marshmallow.
There continues to be sort of the lingering question and concern about the enforcement issue in parks, balancing legitimate use and the very compelling argument that danielle made that aisha, echoed We've talked about a lot in this committee before as well As. You know people's legitimate need to have some peace and quiet, and what is the parks department's role in that?
I mean I, don't want to make work just to make work, but is it possible for her to provide you know monthly, some kind of just snapshot of what the staffing looks like and what the deployment looks like, so that we can just say: look here are the resources that we have and here's how they've been used in this area for I , don't remember who I think it might have been cynthia, but whoever it was to whom it came as news that the problems that we're seeing in the parks up here are problems that people throughout the city throughout the five boroughs are seeing in their parks.
